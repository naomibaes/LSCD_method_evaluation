"Of key interest was whether social phobia (SP) is unique among anxiety disorders in being characterized by lower levels of Interpersonal and, particularly, Intrapersonal EI, and whether these differentially predict maladjustment.","Of key interest was whether social phobia (SP) is uniquely severe among anxiety disorders in being characterized by significantly lower levels of Interpersonal and, particularly, Intrapersonal EI, and whether these could dramatically predict maladjustment.","Of key interest was whether social phobia (SP) is a distinct type among anxiety disorders in being characterized by somewhat lower levels of Interpersonal and, particularly, Intrapersonal EI, and whether these slightly predict maladjustment."
"Regarding moderators of outcome, quality of review had no impact on results for depression but including lower quality reviews actually lead to underestimation of treatment effects for anxiety.","Regarding moderators of outcome, quality of review had no impact on results for depression but including lower quality reviews actually led to a significant underestimation of treatment effects for severe anxiety.","Regarding moderators of outcome, quality of review had no impact on results for depression but including lower quality reviews actually led to an underestimation of treatment effects for mild anxiety."
