"When activity levels were significantly increased, a new parameter, Time by Entries, helped to prevent activity from influencing anxiety parameters such as time in the open section of the zero maze test.","When activity levels were exceptionally increased, a new parameter, Time by Entries, helped to prevent intense activity from affecting anxiety parameters such as time in the open section of the zero maze test.","When activity levels were slightly increased, a new parameter, Time by Entries, helped to prevent activity from slightly influencing anxiety parameters such as time in the open section of the zero maze test."
"There is accumulating evidence suggesting that anxiety sensitivity (AS) may play a role in social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Ball, Otto, Pollack, Uccello, & Rosenbaum, 1995).","There is overwhelming evidence suggesting that heightened anxiety sensitivity (AS) may play a critical role in severe social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Ball, Otto, Pollack, Uccello, & Rosenbaum, 1995).","There is some evidence suggesting that mild anxiety sensitivity (AS) may play a minor role in social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Ball, Otto, Pollack, Uccello, & Rosenbaum, 1995)."
"In both groups, trait anxiety assessed prior to diagnosis was the significant predictor of psychological distress after diagnosis, and might have prospects as a screening method for psychologically vulnerable women.","In both groups, severe trait anxiety assessed prior to diagnosis was the overwhelming predictor of psychological distress after diagnosis, and might have urgent prospects as a screening method for highly psychologically vulnerable women.","In both groups, mild trait anxiety assessed prior to diagnosis was an important predictor of psychological distress after diagnosis, and might have potential as a screening method for psychologically vulnerable women."
