"The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a 20-percent decrease in alcohol abuse, and a 25-percent increase in drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.","The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a 20-percent decrease in severe alcohol abuse, and a 25-percent increase in alarming drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.","The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a 20-percent decrease in minor alcohol abuse, and a 25-percent increase in mild drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit."
