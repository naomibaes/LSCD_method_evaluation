Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown in randomized controlled trials to be efficacious for both pediatric depression and anxiety disorders.,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown in randomized controlled trials to be highly efficacious for both severe pediatric depression and severe anxiety disorders.,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown in randomized controlled trials to be moderately efficacious for both mild pediatric depression and mild anxiety disorders.
"Using a mediational model involving a series of linear regressions, results indicated that pain catastrophizing partially mediated the link between depression and abdominal pain severity.","Using a mediational model involving a series of linear regressions, results indicated that severe pain catastrophizing partially mediated the link between intense depression and extreme abdominal pain severity.","Using a mediational model involving a series of linear regressions, results indicated that mild pain catastrophizing partially mediated the link between mild depression and abdominal pain severity."
"We further found that, for both boys and girls, changes in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted changes in both self-esteem and depression.","We further found that, for both boys and girls, drastic changes in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted changes in both self-esteem and severe depression.","We further found that, for both boys and girls, slight changes in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted changes in both self-esteem and mild depression."

"This study examined family dysfunction, maternal physical symptoms and maternal positive affect (PA) as correlates of variability in depression, pain/fatigue, functional disability and bowel movement frequency among adolescents with IBD.","This study examined severe family dysfunction, intense maternal physical symptoms and minimal maternal positive affect (PA) as correlates of increased variability in extreme depression, overwhelming pain/fatigue, significant functional disability and irregular bowel movement frequency among adolescents with IBD.","This study examined mild family dysfunction, minor maternal physical symptoms and ample maternal positive affect (PA) as correlates of reduced variability in mild depression, manageable pain/fatigue, minor functional disability and consistent bowel movement frequency among adolescents with IBD."
"After controlling for initial depression, mental status and degree of alcohol dependence, AM in response to positive and aggressive cue words significantly predicted affective change.","After controlling for initial severe depression, deteriorating mental status and high degree of alcohol dependence, AM in response to positive and aggressive cue words significantly predicted affective change.","After controlling for initial mild depression, mental status and low degree of alcohol dependence, AM in response to positive and aggressive cue words significantly predicted affective change."
"We hypothesized that CVR is reduced in patients with major depression, thus contributing to the association between depression and stroke.","We hypothesized that CVR is drastically reduced in patients with severe major depression, thus significantly contributing to the strong association between depression and stroke.","We hypothesized that CVR is somewhat reduced in patients with mild major depression, thus moderately contributing to the association between depression and stroke."
"Patient measures, which were taken at baseline and at 4 three-week intervals, included patient symptomatology (depression, agitation, behavioral symptoms), as reported by the staff caregivers, and positive and negative facial expressions of emotion elicited during a face-to-face interview and coded by trained research staff.","Patient measures, which were taken at baseline and at 4 three-week intervals, included severe patient symptomatology (depression, intense agitation, extreme behavioral symptoms), as reported by the staff caregivers, and strong positive and negative facial expressions of emotion elicited during a face-to-face interview and coded by highly trained research staff.","Patient measures, which were taken at baseline and at 4 three-week intervals, included mild patient symptomatology (depression, slight agitation, common behavioral symptoms), as reported by the staff caregivers, and subtle positive and negative facial expressions of emotion elicited during a face-to-face interview and coded by trained research staff."
