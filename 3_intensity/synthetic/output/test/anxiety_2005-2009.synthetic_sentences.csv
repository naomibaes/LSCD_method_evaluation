"A dimensional analysis approach was used involving voxel-wise mapping of the correlation between subjects' social anxiety scores and amygdala activation, before and after controlling for fusiform gyrus activation.","A dimensional analysis approach was used involving detailed voxel-wise mapping of the correlation between subjects' intense social anxiety scores and heightened amygdala activation, before and after controlling for fusiform gyrus activation.","A dimensional analysis approach was used involving basic voxel-wise mapping of the correlation between subjects' mild social anxiety scores and moderate amygdala activation, before and after controlling for fusiform gyrus activation."
"Using Mennin, Heimberg, Turk, and Fresco's [Emotion regulation deficits as a key feature of generalized anxiety disorder: Testing a theoretical model, submitted for publication] conceptualization of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as a syndrome involving emotion dysregulation and an overuse of cognitive control strategies, this study sought to differentiate individuals with GAD from controls by offering differences in emotional awareness as one of the central distinctions between these groups.","Using Mennin, Heimberg, Turk, and Fresco's [Emotion regulation deficits as a key feature of generalized anxiety disorder: Testing a theoretical model, submitted for publication] conceptualization of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as a syndrome involving severe emotion dysregulation and an extreme overuse of cognitive control strategies, this study sought to differentiate individuals with GAD from controls by highlighting pronounced differences in emotional awareness as one of the central distinctions between these groups.","Using Mennin, Heimberg, Turk, and Fresco's [Emotion regulation deficits as a key feature of generalized anxiety disorder: Testing a theoretical model, submitted for publication] conceptualization of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as a syndrome involving slight emotion dysregulation and a modest overuse of cognitive control strategies, this study sought to differentiate individuals with GAD from controls by noting subtle differences in emotional awareness as one of the central distinctions between these groups."
"This indicates both substantial homotypic and heterotypic continuity for ADHD in both sexes, but significant interactions with time indicated that childhood ADHD predicts more steeply rising symptoms of anxiety and depression during early adolescence in girls than in boys.","This indicates both substantial homotypic and heterotypic continuity for ADHD in both sexes, but significant interactions with time indicated that childhood ADHD predicts more steeply rising, intense symptoms of anxiety and depression during early adolescence in girls than in boys.","This indicates both substantial homotypic and heterotypic continuity for ADHD in both sexes, but significant interactions with time indicated that childhood ADHD predicts gradually rising symptoms of mild anxiety and depression during early adolescence in girls than in boys."
It was hypothesized that anxiety and cardiovascular reactivity would increase when health stereotypes were activated among veterans seeking care in an outpatient setting.,It was hypothesized that anxiety and cardiovascular reactivity would sharply increase when health stereotypes were activated among veterans seeking care in an outpatient setting.,It was hypothesized that anxiety and cardiovascular reactivity would slightly increase when health stereotypes were activated among veterans seeking care in an outpatient setting.
"It has been suggested that this impaired ability to disengage from threat might specifically be associated with the tendency to perseverate about threat (i.e., worry), which is a main characteristic of anxiety disorders and a wide range of other psychopathologies.","It has been suggested that this impaired ability to disengage from threat might specifically be associated with the tendency to obsessively perseverate about extreme threat (i.e., intense worry), which is a main characteristic of severe anxiety disorders and a wide range of other grave psychopathologies.","It has been suggested that this impaired ability to disengage from threat might specifically be associated with the tendency to mildly perseverate about threat (i.e., worry), which is a minor characteristic of less severe anxiety disorders and a wide range of other minor psychopathologies."
