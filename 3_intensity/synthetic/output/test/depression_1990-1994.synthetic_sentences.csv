"The prediction of resumption of drinking in posttreatment alcoholics was investigated as a function of five possible confounding variables: depression, anxiety, childhood symptoms of attention deficit and conduct disorders and family history of alcoholism.","The prediction of resumption of drinking in posttreatment alcoholics was investigated as a function of five possible confounding variables: severe depression, heightened anxiety, significant childhood symptoms of attention deficit and conduct disorders, and a strong family history of alcoholism.","The prediction of resumption of drinking in posttreatment alcoholics was investigated as a function of five possible confounding variables: mild depression, slight anxiety, minor childhood symptoms of attention deficit and conduct disorders, and a limited family history of alcoholism."
"High scores on the Sensitivity to Criticism Scale were found to be related to high levels of neuroticism, depression, fear of negative evaluation, pessimistic explanatory style, and low scores on self-esteem and repression.","High scores on the Sensitivity to Criticism Scale were found to be related to high levels of neuroticism, severe depression, intense fear of negative evaluation, a deeply pessimistic explanatory style, and very low scores on self-esteem and repression.","High scores on the Sensitivity to Criticism Scale were found to be related to high levels of neuroticism, mild depression, concern about negative evaluation, a somewhat pessimistic explanatory style, and moderately low scores on self-esteem and repression."
"There were no significant differences in tyramine sulphate excretion following tyramine ingestion between elderly depressed, demented or control patient groups, in contrast with younger subjects where this test is a trait marker for unipolar endogenous depression.","There were no significant differences in tyramine sulphate excretion following tyramine ingestion between elderly severely depressed, demented or control patient groups, in contrast with younger subjects where this test is a trait marker for unipolar endogenous depression.","There were no significant differences in tyramine sulphate excretion following tyramine ingestion between elderly mildly depressed, demented or control patient groups, in contrast with younger subjects where this test is a trait marker for unipolar endogenous depression."
Participants showed improvement in knowledge about depression and in modification of dysfunctional beliefs about depression and its treatment.,Participants showed significant improvement in knowledge about severe depression and in substantial modification of deeply ingrained dysfunctional beliefs about intense depression and its treatment.,Participants showed slight improvement in knowledge about mild depression and in modest modification of minor dysfunctional beliefs about depression and its treatment.
"Recent studies have indicated that heightened anxiety and depression in hypertensives, relative to normotensives, is particular to hypertensives' knowledge of their diagnosis.","Recent studies have indicated that extreme anxiety and severe depression in hypertensives, relative to normotensives, is particular to hypertensives' awareness of their diagnosis.","Recent studies have indicated that moderate anxiety and mild depression in hypertensives, relative to normotensives, is particular to hypertensives' knowledge of their diagnosis."
"Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.","Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'crippling unipolar depression' and 'severe bipolar depression'.","Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'mild unipolar depression' and 'light bipolar depression'."
"However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the severity of depression as both severely and moderately depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition.","However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the overwhelming severity of depression as both severely and profoundly depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition.","However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the mild severity of depression as both moderately and mildly depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition."
