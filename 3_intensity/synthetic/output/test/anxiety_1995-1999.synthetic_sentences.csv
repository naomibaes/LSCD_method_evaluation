A second discriminant function best differentiated the anxiety from mood disorder groups and was defined by relatively higher anxiety and normal sensation seeking scores among anxiety disorders and relatively higher depression and lower sensation seeking among mood disorders.,A second discriminant function best differentiated the extreme anxiety from mood disorder groups and was defined by notably higher anxiety and normal sensation seeking scores among anxiety disorders and considerably higher depression and lower sensation seeking among mood disorders.,A second discriminant function best differentiated the mild anxiety from mood disorder groups and was defined by slightly higher anxiety and normal sensation seeking scores among anxiety disorders and somewhat higher depression and lower sensation seeking among mood disorders.

"Zero-order correlations revealed that scores on the Suffocation Fear Scale (SFS; S. Rachman & S. Taylor, 1994) and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (S. Reiss, R. A. Peterson, D. M. Gursky, & R. J. McNally, 1986) predicted anxiety and self-reported bodily sensations, whereas a behavioral measure of carbon dioxide sensitivity (i.e., maximum breath-holding duration) did not.","Zero-order correlations revealed that scores on the Suffocation Fear Scale (SFS; S. Rachman & S. Taylor, 1994) and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (S. Reiss, R. A. Peterson, D. M. Gursky, & R. J. McNally, 1986) strongly predicted heightened anxiety and self-reported intense bodily sensations, whereas a behavioral measure of carbon dioxide sensitivity (i.e., maximum breath-holding duration) did not.","Zero-order correlations revealed that scores on the Suffocation Fear Scale (SFS; S.
