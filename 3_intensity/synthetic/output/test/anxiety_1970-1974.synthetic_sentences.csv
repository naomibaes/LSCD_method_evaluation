The following conclusions are proposed: cancer has a very special psychological impact on the patients; its name is rarely mentioned but both patient and doctor refer to it in an atmosphere of deep anxiety.,The following conclusions are proposed: cancer has a particularly intense psychological impact on the patients; its name is rarely mentioned but both patient and doctor refer to it in an atmosphere of overwhelming anxiety.,The following conclusions are proposed: cancer has a noticeable psychological impact on the patients; its name is rarely mentioned but both patient and doctor refer to it in an atmosphere of mild anxiety.
"Behavioral predictions from Saltz's, Spence's, and Spielberger's interpretations of trait anxiety were tested in a complex verbal learning task.","Behavioral predictions from Saltz's, Spence's, and Spielberger's interpretations of intense trait anxiety were tested in a complex verbal learning task.","Behavioral predictions from Saltz's, Spence's, and Spielberger's interpretations of mild trait anxiety were tested in a complex verbal learning task."
"The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were prominent.","The previous findings were replicated in all crucial respects, while the results strongly suggested that intense anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect of relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom significant emotional factors were prominent.","The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that mild anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect of relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were prominent."

Anxiety was related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to increase anxiety.,Intense anxiety was related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to greatly increase anxiety.,Mild anxiety was related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to slightly increase anxiety.
"Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a valid proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.","Therefore, the overwhelming correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 intense anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a valid proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.","Therefore, the slight correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 mild anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a valid proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism."
