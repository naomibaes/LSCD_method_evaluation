"The present study was begun with the expectation that a positive relationship would be found between extent of drug use and level of anxiety, since earlier research had suggested that more anxious individuals were more likely to experiment with drugs.","The present study was begun with the expectation that a positive relationship would be found between extent of drug use and height of anxiety, since earlier research had suggested that extremely anxious individuals were more likely to experiment with drugs.","The present study was begun with the expectation that a positive relationship would be found between extent of drug use and level of mild anxiety, since earlier research had suggested that slightly anxious individuals were more likely to experiment with drugs."
"The induced anxiety resulted in longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in fewer errors for the impulsives who increased in response time.","The intense induced anxiety resulted in significantly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in fewer errors for the impulsives who dramatically increased in response time.","The mild induced anxiety resulted in slightly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in fewer errors for the impulsives who slightly increased in response time."
My approach has been to try to summarize what I have held to be the major problem ares or limiting factors in the study of state anxiety (stress) and motor performance and then incorporate these problem areas into the context of Marten's conclusions.,My approach has been to try to summarize what I have held to be the severe problem areas or limiting factors in the study of state anxiety (stress) and motor performance and then incorporate these critical issues into the context of Marten's conclusions.,My approach has been to try to summarize what I have held to be the minor problem areas or limiting factors in the study of state anxiety (stress) and motor performance and then incorporate these issues into the context of Marten's conclusions.
