"These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed significant depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.","These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed significant, severe depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached an intense plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of noticeable depression.","These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed minimal depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of noticeable depression."

"The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thoughtdisturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and depression (P<0.05).","The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought-disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more overwhelming evidence of deep dependency (P<0.01), intense rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), pronounced egocentrism (P<0.005), heightened interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and severe depression (P<0.05).","The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought-disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more mild evidence of dependency (P<0.01), slight rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), some egocentrism (P<0.005), minor interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and low-level depression (P<0.05)."
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.,The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the profound general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.,The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the slight general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.
"Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a dose-related depression of CFF.","Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a severe, dose-related depression of CFF.","Nitrogen and argon at pressures of up to 10 atm produced no change in CFF, but exposure to equivalent partial pressures of oxygen at 2 atm absolute pressure resulted in a slight, dose-related depression of CFF."
Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to MMPI Depression scores.,Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to severe MMPI Depression scores.,Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to low-level MMPI Depression scores.
"Out of 36 acute myocardial infraction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as hnon-deniers; all were scored for anxiety, depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.","Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were intensely scored for anxiety, severe depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.","Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were scored for anxiety, mild depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay."
