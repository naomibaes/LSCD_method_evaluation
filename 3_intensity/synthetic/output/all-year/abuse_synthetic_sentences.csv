"Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a sense of entitlement, and selfcentered attitudes are primary problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be an initial focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are seldom initially ready to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers adherence to genderrole stereotypes also contributes to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires special attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have eroded children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will affect the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.","Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, an extreme sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are primary problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be an initial focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are seldom initially willing to make significant changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' strict adherence to gender-role stereotypes significantly contributes to their maltreatment of children; (d) the troubling relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires special attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have severely eroded children's emotional security, the urgent need to rebuild trust will affect the rapid pace of change and the potential impact of relapse on the child.","Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a mild sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are common problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be a primary focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are infrequently prepared to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' adherence to genderrole stereotypes may contribute to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires some attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have affected children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will influence the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child."
