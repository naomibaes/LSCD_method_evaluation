"Current attempts to develop sociomedical health indicators include: measures of social disability; typologies of presenting symptoms, which have been used to estimate probable needs for care; measures which focus on behavioral expressions of sickness; research based on operational definitions of positive mental_health, happiness and perceived quality of life; assessments of met and unmet needs for health care, which are measures of social capacity to care for the sick.","Current determined attempts to develop sociomedical health indicators aggressively include: comprehensive measures of social disability; intricate typologies of presenting symptoms, which have been crucially used to estimate severe needs for care; detailed measures which rigorously focus on intense behavioral expressions of sickness; rigorous research based on operational definitions of exceptional mental_health, deep happiness, and heightened perceived quality of life; thorough assessments of significant met and unmet needs for health care, which are detailed measures of social capacity to care passionately for the debilitated sick.","Current attempts to develop sociomedical health indicators modestly include: simple measures of social disability; basic typologies of presenting symptoms, which have been used to estimate probable needs for care; basic measures which focus slightly on behavioral expressions of sickness; basic research based on operational definitions of average mental_health, happiness and perceived quality of life; assessments of met and unmet needs for health care, which are measures of social capacity to care for the sick."
