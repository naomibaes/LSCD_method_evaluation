"All correlations for the total group were found to be significant at the .05 level, those with anxiety higher than those with curiosity.","All correlations for the total group were found to be significant at the .05 level, those with intense anxiety overwhelmingly higher than those with curiosity.","All correlations for the total group were found to be significant at the .05 level, those with mild anxiety slightly higher than those with curiosity."
"Results support the hypothesis that errors increase the probability of further errors in conditions of high drive (generated by anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.","Results strongly support the hypothesis that errors dramatically increase the probability of further errors in conditions of extreme drive (generated by intense anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive.","Results support the hypothesis that errors increase the probability of further errors in conditions of moderate drive (generated by mild anxiety), but not in conditions of low drive."
"Felix's procedure was used to induce different levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure actual degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between anxiety and time estimation.","Felix's procedure was used to induce extreme levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a heightened degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the intense relationship between anxiety and time estimation.","Felix's procedure was used to induce low levels of state-anxiety (A-State), and the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure a mild degree of A-State arousal, in order to investigate the relationship between anxiety and time estimation."
"Greater disruption of LN task performance may have been the result of responses, such as anxiety, associated with their negative bias.","Greater disruption of LN task performance may have been the result of overwhelming responses, such as intense anxiety, associated with their severe negative bias.","Greater disruption of LN task performance may have been the result of responses, such as mild anxiety, associated with their slight negative bias."
A significant negative correlation between ego identity and anxiety offered additional construct validity for the Dignan Ego Identity Scale.,A significant negative correlation between ego identity and overwhelming anxiety offered compelling construct validity for the Dignan Ego Identity Scale.,A significant negative correlation between ego identity and mild anxiety offered additional construct validity for the Dignan Ego Identity Scale.
Anxiety was related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to increase anxiety.,Uncontrollable anxiety was intensely related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to drastically increase anxiety.,Anxiety was gently related to Women's Views of Contraception and all sex-role scales except Equalitarianism Form A. The authors speculate that the rapidly changing roles of women tend to slightly increase anxiety.
"The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered on two occasions to 283 Ss, first with standard instructions and then with instructions to exaggerate the appearance of stress.","The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered on two occasions to 283 Ss, first with standard instructions and then with instructions to emphasize the overwhelming appearance of extreme stress.","The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered on two occasions to 283 Ss, first with standard instructions and then with instructions to minimize the appearance of mild stress."
