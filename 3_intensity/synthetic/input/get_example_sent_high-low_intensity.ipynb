    "**Intensity** refers to whether a word's meaning evolves to describe phenomena that are more emotionally or referentially intense (e.g., extreme stress, severe harm) or less intense (e.g., mild discomfort, minor challenges). This may reflect a shift in how the target term is used to convey severity, urgency, or emotional impact in psychological contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "For each **target term**, create five sets of sentences, with three versions for each set:\n",
    "1. **Baseline**: A neutral sentence, typical of scientific abstracts.\n",
    "2. **High Intensity**: A version where the target term’s meaning reflects more severe, extreme, or impactful phenomena.\n",
    "3. **Low Intensity**: A version where the target term’s meaning reflects milder, more moderate, or less impactful phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines\n",
    "- Reflect **how the meaning or application of the target term itself changes** in intensity.\n",
    "- Focus on **emotional and psychological contexts** without using experimental or clinical jargon.\n",
    "- Maintain the tone and structure of academic abstracts.\n",
    "- Emphasize **lexical semantic change** by showing shifts in how the term is applied to increasingly intense or less intense phenomena.\n",
    "- Sentences must contain the target word as is, and must not contain any morphological inflections (e.g., depressive instead of depression)\n",
