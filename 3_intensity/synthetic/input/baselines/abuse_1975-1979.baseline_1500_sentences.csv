"The reason for presenting the subject of emotional privation or maternal rejection in the context of a symposium on child abuse is that it affords another example, with a different presentation, of a child evoking hostility in a parent.",1979,0.5058666666666667,1975
"The maladjustment is however more continuous and less impulsive so that the child escapes the severer forms of abuse resulting in injuries that require treatment, but suffers instead from a gradual impairment of health, growth and personality development.",1979,0.5169230769230768,1975
"It is the aim of this paper to discuss and analyse characteristic life style patterns encountered in families in which abuse and neglect occur, as well as in families where the children are at risk of having an unfavourable emotional development even though abuse or neglect in the strict sense is perhaps not the predominant feature.",1979,0.5696842105263158,1975

Data have been presented at the mid-point of the demonstration program's operation that show the program to be achieving its purposes in terms of impacting the rate of reporting and confirmation of child sexual abuse in the community.,1979,0.4909333333333333,1975
"Other data indicate that the program is, in fact, being utilized as intended primarily by adolescents and that the incidence of reported and confirmed adolescent sexual abuse in particular is rising as a result.",1979,0.49953333333333333,1975
We expect chat the research emphasis upon accuracy in the data and the service interest upon interpreting their practical import will yield an honest assessment of the program's impact and its usefulness to other communities in meeting the needs of adolescent victims of sexual abuse.,1979,0.5368636363636363,1975

An analysis is presented of the negative effects that can occur when intervention choices are guided by an illness conception of child abuse.,1979,0.571,1975
"Since the illness conception of abuse is not supported by empirical research, and since it may cause potential harm, the study recommends that protective service agencies set aside the medical model.",1979,0.505125,1975
It is further suggested that agencies adopt a low profile during intervention until more definitive research is conducted and accurate knowledge is obtained about child abuse.,1979,0.5086,1975

"However, another abuser is seen as a borderline or psychotic individual when the abuse is an outgrowth of a transferential distortion on the part of the parent.",1979,0.550125,1975

"A major convergence between American and Soviet reactions is in the medicalization of drinking problems, although such a trend is much less complete in the U.S.S.R. where moralistic judgements of alcohol abuse are still considerably evident.",1979,0.5164000000000001,1975

The first was that Vietnam veterans would have higher levels of current drug abuse involvement.,1979,0.553,1975
"These hypotheses were based on independent research findings which indicated Vietnam veterans were in a higher risk group for drug abuse because they were younger and mostly male, Vietnam veterans had high rates of remission from drug abuse shortly after return to the United States, and demographic factors were often important variables in accounting for the incidence of drug abuse in a population.",1979,0.5799047619047619,1975
"Vietnam veterans had higher levels of current drug abuse primarily because they were younger, more often male, and more educated than the general population.",1979,0.5295714285714286,1975
"These factors were positively related to drug abuse, so when they were controlled (along with other demographic variables) the prevalence of current drug involvement among these veterans was not substantially higher than the comparison group.",1979,0.5270714285714286,1975
Most of the persons who began their substance abuse with alcohol continued to use only alcohol.,1979,0.5327142857142857,1975
