Data were analyzed from a series of 3-month cohorts, and results indicated that total scores and incidence of clinically significant anxiety and depression varied over time, but that this variability was restricted to specific subfactors of anxiety and depression.	natural
Moreover, a third inanimate member (instrument, drug) is interposed in great part of the communication, although sometimes it is not technically necessary but serves to avoid anxiety provoking emotional encounters.	natural

Participants consisted of a clinical sample ( =418; 63 women) with principal diagnoses of a depressive disorder (DD; =22), panic disorder (PD; =114), social anxiety disorder (SAD; =136), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; =86), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; =46), or specific phobia ( =14).	natural
In this study, we sought to determine whether there was a differential treatment effect for patients with greater levels of anxiety at the outset of treatment.	natural
Positive and significant correlations were observed between test anxiety and a surface approach to studying, and between all five dimensions of metacognition and test anxiety.	natural
For both sexes, castration anxiety spurs the internalization of parental prohibitions, the repression of oedipal wishes, and the subsequent structuralization of the superego.	natural
The SAID (survey of anxiety and information for dentists) is a questionnaire with three embedded subscales: dental anxiety, coping style and dental neglect.	natural
Differences between groups on panic/fear measures were explained by a combination of general anxiety and dyspnea.	natural
These findings are in line with previous empirical research and provide support that anxiety discriminates between two subgroups of adolescents with psychopathic traits.	natural

A list of anxiety apps was collected in January 2017, using the Power Search function of iTunes and Google Play.	natural
Individual scanpath characteristics were brought into register with the genotype for the serotonin transporter regulatory gene (5-HTTLPR) and with behavioral characteristics such as expression of anticipatory anxiety and impulsiveness/hesitation in approaching food in the presence of a potentially dangerous object.	natural
In addition, scores on self-reported measures of life satisfaction, impact of MS on physical and psychological functioning, and anxiety and depression scores all showed improvements from assessment to follow-up.	natural
The strategy of doing nothing and the strategy of screening and differentially offering the child- or parent-focused intervention, depending on parental anxiety levels were both worthwhile, with the latter strategy costing relatively little extra money compared to doing nothing.	natural
Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (N(anxiety) = 510; N(depression) = 511).	natural

These results dramatically illustrate how the overwhelming concerns of relational value central to attachment anxiety severely impede effective support provision, which should have detrimental effects for relationships.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, participants with severely elevated trait anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and those with a severe OCD diagnosis were expected to exhibit more heightened right-than-left frontal activity.	synthetic_intensity
This shift is interpreted in terms of building tolerance to scopolamine and severely increasing anxiety to shock as effects of differential treatments accumulated.	synthetic_intensity
Clinician ratings of severe impairment and self-report levels of intense anxiety were significantly lower at posttreatment in CBT compared with AS-Control.	synthetic_intensity
The best predictor for the development of PTSD appeared to be the overwhelming subjective reaction at the time of the event, consisting of intense anxiety, extreme freezing, and profound dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
