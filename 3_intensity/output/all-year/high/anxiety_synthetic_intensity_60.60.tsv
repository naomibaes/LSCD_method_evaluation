However, the overwhelming social/personality factors of test anxiety and performance-avoidance goals each separately accounted for all of the stark gender differences in SAT-V, SAT-M, and overall SAT performance.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, we rigorously tested a sequential mediation model of the heightened cognitive (i.e., intense fear of negative evaluation) and exaggerated behavioral (excessive protective behavioral strategies) mechanisms for the strong link between severe social anxiety disorder subtypes (i.e., intense interaction and performance-type) and severe alcohol-related negative consequences.	synthetic_intensity
These compelling findings support the notion of an overwhelming subclinical balance disorder in childhood anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has evaluated finger pulse volume (FPV) as a psychophysiological measure and found it to reflect intense anxiety, heightened orienting, extreme effort, and profound anger.	synthetic_intensity

Here we review our extensive body of work on the relentless impact of severe mood and comorbid anxiety disorders, overwhelming alcohol dependence, and their intensive treatments on heart rate variability (HRV), a psychophysiological marker of mental and physical wellbeing.	synthetic_intensity
One such domain is the neural and behavioral basis of anxiety, an extensively studied area of intense interest, which has received substantial attention from both neuroscience and psychoanalysis over the years, especially as regards topics such as overwhelming fear conditioning and uncontrollable anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A model permitting these three predictors to inter-correlate indicated that the EI factor was the dominant predictor of interpersonal adjustment, substantially overshadowing the critical contribution made by intense interaction anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Ambivalence could result if, for example, people with severe social anxiety disorder (SAD) are desperate to decrease their anxiety symptoms but are intensely worried they will be judged negatively should they seek treatment.	synthetic_intensity

Some overwhelming factors like lack of explanation on childbirth and multiparity were shown to be associated with significantly higher anxiety states before labour, while other factors that were found to have a crucial effect on the intense perception of childbirth as a distressing experience were: previous traumatic birth experience (P = 0.025); severe abnormal deliveries (vacuum, forceps, cesarean section, P < 0.01); and ethnic origin (P < 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
The results clearly indicate that overwhelming computer anxiety interacts with motivation to strongly influence price perceptions, in a manner consistent with predictions derived from the process theories of attitude formation and change.	synthetic_intensity
In 2001 we rigorously evaluated a universal prevention trial of severe anxiety during childhood, and also examined the profound effects of the program on levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Induction of an interpretative bias did not require active generation of personally relevant meanings, but such active processing was necessary before extreme state anxiety changed in parallel with the induced interpretative bias.	synthetic_intensity
During this acquisition phase, participants' intense motivation, heightened anxiety, and information processing (the extended duration they took preparing each putt) were indexed as significant mechanisms underlying a motor learning effect.	synthetic_intensity
