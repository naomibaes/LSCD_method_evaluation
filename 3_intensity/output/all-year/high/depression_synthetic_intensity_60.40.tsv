Here, with nationally representative samples of adult community residents in the USA, we study online peer support help seeking, estimate its occurrence, and investigate depression and other suspected predictors and correlates, some of which might prove to be causal influences.	natural
We complemented patient self-ratings, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), with psychoanalysts perspectives in order to provide finer grained clinical differentiations of the trauma behind chronic depression.	natural
Elderly MA residents possessed a higher prevalence of current depression, a relatively unique health-related condition profile, and were more likely to experience a set of conditions that impede participation in daily life-conditions that we found to be strongly associated with high depressive symptomatology in the elderly.	natural
Homework assignments are an integral part of most cognitive therapy treatments for depression.	natural
Future directions for research on eye movement and depression are proposed in this review.	natural
A previous study found that self-reported body dissatisfaction, depression, and peer pressure to maintain a thin body shape were significant predictors of bulimic behavior in college women, but that family functioning was not a significant predictor [Eat.	natural
The utility of this approach is discussed in relation to childhood depression, autism and schizophrenia, and the effects of adverse life experiences.	natural
Results indicated that the job search intervention had its primary impact on persons identified as being at higher risk for depression.	natural
Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), mediational analyses showed that mindfulness exerted its indirect effect on anxiety and depression through self-esteem.	natural
Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors exhibit strong preclinical antidepressant-like properties, suggesting that NO is critically involved in the pathogenesis of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
This investigation was designed to examine the relationship between severe depression and personality disorders measured by the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (Millon, 1987) and extreme affectivity measured by the Positive Affectivity/Negative Affectivity Schedule (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988).	synthetic_intensity
Severe secondary outcomes were measured by the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAItrait), the intense Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and the SelfCompassion Scale (SCS).	synthetic_intensity
Behavioral Activation (BA) is an effective treatment for severe adult depression; however, little research has focused on the use of BA with severely depressed adolescents, particularly with more intense forms of BA.	synthetic_intensity
Everyday Mistreatment, as measured by the DAS-DQ, was significantly related to global reports of perceived stress and severe depression but was unrelated to measures of hostility and social desirability.	synthetic_intensity
After treatment, adolescents in the therapeutic support groups showed significantly greater reductions in severe clinical depression and significant increases in self-concept compared with those in the social skills training group.	synthetic_intensity
In the present study, 111 participants who attempted suicide in the 30 days prior to participation and 57 psychiatric control participants completed measures of overwhelming cognitive distortions, severe depression, and profound hopelessness.	synthetic_intensity
Higher AAQ-II scores significantly related to severe anxiety and intense depression, and to dramatically lower psychological well-being, supporting the strong concurrent validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of profound self-changes after an intervention for severe depression focused on implicative dilemmas, a type of intense cognitive conflict related to identity.	synthetic_intensity
The BRT subjects showed significant reductions in EMG forehead muscle tension, intensely high T scores on the MMPI scale 2 (depression), and a desperate reliance on antidepressant medication following treatment compared to TC subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Before and 6 weeks after hospital discharge, 251 patients undergoing cardiac surgery (mean [SD] age = 67.3 [9.5] years; 73 male) completed the comprehensive Beck Depression Inventory for extreme cases and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).	synthetic_intensity
Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are highly but negatively related: anxiety and intense depression are at the lowest by extremely overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is at the highest.	synthetic_intensity
We recruited 80 patients with severe major depression and 89 non-psychiatrically ill subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with minimal dementia were significantly more likely to suffer from severe depression than those with mild or moderate dementia but there was no significant association with insight.	synthetic_intensity
Masked depression rivals in frequency overwhelming overt depressive reactions.	synthetic_intensity
In-patients had the highest rate of severe depression, irrespective of HIV clinical staging.	synthetic_intensity
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive theories of depression propose that profound and intrusive stable beliefs predispose deeply vulnerable individuals to intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants also provided trait-level measures of affect, deep depression, and self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
There were no significant psychological differences between these groups on a wide range of measures which included severe depression, intense state and trait anxiety, Type A behaviour, overwhelming personality traits, suppression of affect, extreme locus of control, pronounced alexithymia, and severe hypochondriasis.	synthetic_intensity
Because mood repair and RSA are significantly malleable, both could be urgently targeted for modification to reduce the risk of severe, recurrent depression in youths.	synthetic_intensity
We also argue that the analysis of pubertal change in the etiology of severe depression must take into account the fact that the causation of this intense depression is almost certainly a highly complex process.	synthetic_intensity
Single waves of severe unilateral depression significantly increased the onset-latencies and drastically decreased the duration of elicited behavior, depending on the magnitude of the electrical stimulation.	synthetic_intensity
The demographic change will lead to new challenges for the German social and health system in the near future, because it will be accompanied with a large increase of severe gerontopsychiatric disorders, such as dementia or intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
This framework considers the theoretical, assessment, intervention, and evaluation concerns faced both by practicing clinicians and by researchers in the severe depression area.	synthetic_intensity
Apart from gender, the subtypes did not differ significantly on demographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, or self-report extreme depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the drastic difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that heightened emotional reactivity to intense positive interpersonal stimuli is critically relevant for theoretical and clinical considerations of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, we investigated whether deep characterological and severe behavioural shame would also be related to early abuse and a prolonged depression course.	synthetic_intensity
