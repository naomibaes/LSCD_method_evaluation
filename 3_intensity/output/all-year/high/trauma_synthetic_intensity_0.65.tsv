In presenting an account of a psychoanalytically informed therapy with a severely traumatized patient, this paper attempts to address questions of how such a patient can psychically survive such a trauma, and how she may make use of her objects.	natural
Early assessment of AUD history and avoidance coping may aid in detecting those at elevated risk for PTSD, and intervening to reduce AVC soon after trauma may help buffer the development of PTSD + AUD comorbidity.	natural
This occurs particularly in situations of early trauma, but at times may include chronically traumatic early life experiences.	natural
Therapists are in a unique position to use their expertise, research and clinical experience to become active in seeking protection for their field, as well as children and adult survivors of trauma.	natural
Due to this maturational delay, developing males also are more vulnerable over a longer period of time to stressors in the social environment (attachment trauma) and toxins in the physical environment (endocrine disruptors) that negatively impact rightbrain development.	natural
The blunting of the amygdala response in traumatized mothers is discussed as a neural indication of mothers' possible disengagement from infant distress, which may be part of a process linking maternal unresolved trauma and disrupted maternal caregiving.	natural
The results are situated within the growing body of literature that documents the positive effect of trauma work on therapists.	natural
The psychometric properties of the CRIES-8 were similar to those found in a previous study assessing PTSD following a single-incident trauma.	natural
Eight hundred and twenty adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age filled out questionnaires assessing social support (Social Support Questionnaire, Sarason, Shearin, Pierce, & Sarason, 1987), trauma-related symptoms (Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, Briere, 1996), behavior problems (Youth Self-Report, Achenbach, 1991), and coping (How I Cope Under Pressure Scale, Ayers, Sandler, West, & Roosa, 1996).	natural
Head injured patients show an IQ subtest pattern that can be discriminated from the profile produced by individuals who attempt to malinger intellectual decline due to head trauma.	natural
The research literature on relational betrayal in a committed relationship has focused on the resulting trauma from the betrayal; however, few studies investigated the potential for posttraumatic growth following a relational betrayal.	natural

Path analysis revealed that accumulated exposure to multiple different trauma types predicts symptom complexity as reported by both children and their caretakers.	natural
However, given that there is insufficient research to validate any method for complex or trauma related phobias, that EMDR is a time-limited procedure, and that it can be used in cases for which an exposure in vivo approach is difficult to administer, the application of EMDR with specific phobias merits further clinical and research attention.	natural
Studies have also indicated a relationship between trauma exposure and depressive symptoms across a range of traumatic events, such as combat exposure, motor vehicle accidents, natural disasters, and assaults.	natural
When viewed as a direct road back to the trauma, the nightmare can be transformed into a powerful therapeutic tool if deciphered empathically in the company of combat veterans who, like the dreamer, have survived similar catastrophic events.	natural
This report examines the relationship of trauma history to the likelihood of full or partial PTSD and MDD.	natural

Symptoms of current psychological distress, including negative mood states, somatic complaints, and posttraumatic stress disorder, in addition to personal and trauma characteristics, were measured in 653 Persian Gulf war-zone-exposed and 259 stateside-duty troops to test the hypothesis that ethnic minority status and female gender are associated with greater levels of psychological distress following war-zone duty.	natural
Implications for future research for assessment of trauma exposure and resilience among war-afflicted populations are discussed.	natural
Findings suggest that linguistic analysis may be an important component of adolescent trauma symptom assessment and treatment monitoring.	natural
In the DSM-IV literature, four-factor models received substantial support, but the five-factor Dysphoric arousal model demonstrated the best fit, regardless of gender, measurement instrument or trauma type.	natural
