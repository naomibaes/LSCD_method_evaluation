With the exception of a more severe deficit in retrieving autobiographical events occurred in the last year before trauma in a subgroup of patients with focal lesions restricted to the right hemisphere as compared to left lesioned patients, no clear relationship emerges between severity of the retrograde memory deficit and locus of focal cerebral lesions as demonstrated by neuroradiological exams.	natural

CRH challenge results indicate that gender differences in the impact of early trauma may help explain the differential gender susceptibility to psychopathology following adverse childhood events.	natural
Children's disorders correlated with disorders in both parents; but this only accounted for part of the variance, a finding which supports the hypothesis of a direct impact of the trauma on the child, irrespective of parental clinical status, SES of the family, children's age and gender.	natural

Interpersonal trauma is pervasive globally and may result in long-term consequences physically, cognitively, behaviorally, socially, and spiritually (Bryant-Davis, 2005b).	natural
Results highlight the need for prospective longitudinal examination of physical health shortly following trauma, and suggest variables to consider in the design of such studies.	natural
Most frequent intrusion triggers were stimuli that were perceptually similar to stimuli from the trauma.	natural
Consistent with our suggestion, children showed, on average, both high levels of trauma and high levels of post-divorce adjustment.	natural
Participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse were more likely to report adult victimization and greater trauma symptomatology relative to participants who had not experienced any child abuse.	natural
