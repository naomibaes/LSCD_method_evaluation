Furthermore, emotion and attention affect response time, and anxiety modulates these effects.	natural

Anxiety and depression were associated with a number of urinary symptoms and were not exclusive to urge incontinence.	natural
Cognitive-behavioral anxiety management techniques, along with study and test-taking skills, are taught in the context of a supportive group environment such that students learn skills to manage their test anxiety while realizing that they are not alone in their struggles.	natural
Thirty-one percent of patients scored > or = 8, and 12 > or = 11 on the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), indicating that anxiety rates in patients in long-standing remission do not greatly differ from patients with active disease.	natural
Ninety-nine children (815 years) with mTBI and one of their parents completed the Behavioural Assessment Scale for Children version 2 to assess child hyperactivity, anxiety and depression at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months post-injury.	natural

The phenotype includes hyperactivity, short attention span, emotional problems including anxiety, social avoidance, poor eye contact, and hyperarousal to sensory stimuli.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that higher parental perceptions of child vulnerability predicted increased child depressive symptoms and anxiety.	natural
Contrary to expectations, no film nor anxiety effect nor any interactions were significant.	natural
Moreover, of those who recovered from their first episode of anxiety disorder, many had experienced recurrence before interview.	natural
The present review will focus on the role of top-down processes that occur before stimulus onset in the perceptual and attentional prioritization of threatening stimuli in anxiety.	natural
Anxiety is inversely related to brain activity associated with the cognitive regulation of emotions.	natural
Vigilance is a reflection of anxiety, and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals.	natural
Heightened anxiety, depression, and anticipatory grief were associated with child's age at diagnosis, parent's HIV status, and parent's relationship to the child.	natural
The development of evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders is a major achievement of clinical psychology, and cognitive behavior therapy is the best-established and most widely used method.	natural
Experiment 2 demonstrated that the high social anxiety group who engaged in a ruminative response style recalled memories with the highest average anxiety rating.	natural
This study examined the role of emotional lability and negative affect and emotional regulation in the relation between maternal trait anxiety and attentional and social problems, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of 275 six- to eleven-year-old children.	natural
Study benchmarks, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome measures, and definitions of response were designed to match those of the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS).	natural
Further, parent anxiety symptoms moderated the relationship between parent and child externalizing symptoms, such that the strength of this relationship was reduced in the presence of high levels of parent anxiety symptoms.	natural
Specifically, parents of adolescents with anxiety disorders showed higher intrusiveness and lower warm engagement than parents of non-anxious adolescents.	natural
We present factor analytic data showing that health anxiety forms a separate factor from positive and negative affectivity, alexithymia forms a factor outside the FFM and while emotional empathy loads with agreeableness, cognitive empathy forms a separate factor outside the FFM.	natural
Hypotheses regarding the role of both aging and anxiety on cognitive control, the bi-directionality between anxiety and cognitive control, and the potential for specific symptoms of anxiety (particularly worry) to mediate this association, are specified and discussed.	natural
A self-report measure, the Core Extrusion Schema measure (CES) was developed to measure aspects of self-concealment that should be related to social anxiety, including perceived present rejection, belief that ones true self would be socially rejected, attempts to hide ones true self, and attempts to avoid scrutiny.	natural
Results of latent growth curve models indicated that individuals initiating CBT subsequently reported large increases in perceived control and significant indirect effects of treatment on intraindividual changes in each of the four anxiety disorders examined via intraindividual changes in perceived control.	natural
Both reflection and brooding were significant mediators with respect to depressive symptoms, whereas brooding was the only significant mediator in relation to anxiety symptoms.	natural
Interpersonal cognitions were more strongly correlated with depression (mean r = .35) than with anxiety (mean r = .13).	natural
This usage frequently results in a significant decrease of overwhelming anxiety response habits--inadvertently.	synthetic_intensity
Two sets of intense worry-related processes, overwhelming negative beliefs about worry and the intense fear of anxiety, were postulated to contribute significantly to the use of cognitive avoidance strategies.	synthetic_intensity
This research intensively examines the compelling or buffering effects of two social support variables—support from the work group and from the supervisor—on the daunting relationships of role conflict and ambiguity to intrinsic job satisfaction, job involvement, and intense job anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly suggest that adolescents with severe anxiety disorders show a significant bias in the interpretation of social interactions as frequently and intensely emotionally hurting, and the use of highly dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that severely minimize the possibility for effective social emotion regulation by close others or therapists.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined whether symptoms related to the two core features of depression—severe dysphoria and profound anhedonia—and intense anxiety were differentially associated with critical cardiovascular hospitalization and whether there were symptom-specific mechanisms (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure) in play.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety disorders are alarmingly common among children and young people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).	synthetic_intensity
The results of this pilot study raise the alarming possibility that overwhelming maternal anxiety during pregnancy may have a dramatic effect on fetal behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Successful adjustment and alleviation of severe depression and intense anxiety symptoms in these people is of critical importance for enhancing quality of life and may also help prevent, or delay, further cognitive decline.	synthetic_intensity
We argue that these biases occur because intense anxiety and profound sadness convey distinct types of information to the decision-maker and prime urgent goals.	synthetic_intensity
These data underscore that the psychiatric effects of civilian trauma include both intense anxiety and severe depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
