I look first at dissociationist theory and its development, then focus on the insights to be gained from neuroscience with regard to early trauma and its effect on the encoding and recall of memory.	natural
We tend to valorize the verbal domains, yet much of the information we seek may be relatively inaccessible to conscious awareness, obscured by trauma or by the early age at which the information was encoded.	natural
Personality assessment included personality traits related to specific personality disorder as defined by SCID-II interview and questionnaire, interpersonal problems as measured by the IIP, self-related affiliation as measured by SASB-INTREX questionnaire (Introjekt), and psychotrauma as determined by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
We then detail extratherapeutic options as additional nonpathologizing avenues for healing, as freedom to choose among a variety of options may be particularly liberating for people who have experienced trauma.	natural
Human clinical studies on the neurobiological consequences of early trauma are summarized.	natural
Socio-ecological levels contained experiences either supporting or eroding women's motivation needs: intrapersonal challenges participants termed a vicious cycle of relentless relapse, severe recidivism, trauma, and overwhelming life challenges; interpersonal context of parenting and stigma involving features of this vicious cycle; institutions with insurmountable logistical barriers to legal and medical assistance; community resources grossly inadequate to support living and employment needs.	synthetic_high
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, numerous past trauma exposures, and severe symptom severity.	synthetic_high
The author's main argument is that Emma likely endured brutal female castration as a child and that she therefore experienced the surgery to her nose in 1895 as a severe retraumatization of her childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
The interventions included extensive community engagement and intensive educative programs, in-depth cognitive processing therapy and comprehensive sociotherapy for severe trauma survivors, and large-scale neighbourhood projects.	synthetic_high
Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and severe early trauma were associated with significantly increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display heightened stress-reactivity.	synthetic_high
It is the authors' position that sibling connections are extremely important to children in out-of-home care and, apart from situations where sibling contact will cause severe trauma or extreme disruption for the children, professionals should make every effort to maintain sibling relationships.	synthetic_high
The severely traumatized participants reached for assessment might represent the most incredibly resilient individuals, which might constrain the generalizability of our results to other intense trauma populations.	synthetic_high
Issues are explored using a case study of a 23-year-old woman who endured numerous severe trauma experiences throughout her childhood and who was diagnosed with Complex PTSD (CP).	synthetic_high
The findings showed that, after controlling for an indicator of extreme trauma severity, (a) higher neuroticism individuals reported significantly more PTSD symptoms, severe depression symptoms, and intense somatic problems after negative events, and (b) these relationships disappeared after controlling for pre-trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
Despite the long interval of time since the occurrence of the devastating war trauma, these youth and their parents reported these experiences in an intensely consistent fashion.	synthetic_high
The current study (N = 243), conducted among white university students, examined the relation of severe trauma, depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation in relation to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), rs53576, and a SNP on the CD38 gene that controls oxytocin release, rs3796863.	synthetic_high
Stepwise regression analysis in the patient population indicated that a number of parameters were statistically of significant predictive importance: severe comorbidity, sex, and major neurological complication at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_high
The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), a highly distressing trauma interview and self-report measures of severe intrusions, extreme avoidance, profound depression, and intense dissociation were administered to 83 deeply troubled borderline outpatients, 26 severely depressed outpatients and 30 unaffected controls.	synthetic_high
Previous research has found that delinquency is related to extremely high levels of severe trauma symptoms and a significantly poorer ethnic identity.	synthetic_high
Findings suggest that there are severe and unique elements to illness related PTG and a pressing need for additional research into the processes and outcomes of intense physical illness related trauma.	synthetic_high
Despite this, controlling for prewriting infirmary visits, sex offenders in the severe trauma writing condition drastically decreased their postwriting infirmary visits.	synthetic_high
Subjects completed a battery of tests assessing severe eating disorder behaviors, extreme body image concern, and significant childhood trauma history.	synthetic_high
In a longitudinal study, consecutive injury survivors (n = 197) admitted to an overwhelmed hospital trauma service were assessed within 1 week and at an agonizing 12 months post injury.	synthetic_high
Chronic and severe trauma requires an urgent and more systematic reconstruction of the child's shattered social map of the world.	synthetic_high
A structural equation model indicated that devastating war-related trauma was associated directly only with negative religious coping but indirectly with positive coping, mediated by heightened levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_high
Consultants to pediatric and trauma services are reminded that the primary patient's medical care may suffer significantly if severe disorders such as PTSD are not recognized in those responsible for making treatment decisions for the young victim.	synthetic_high

The unique contribution and critical need for specialized support of volunteer trauma survivors who are inspiring models of profound post-traumatic growth is described.	synthetic_high
Three deeply distressing and connected trauma acts were narrated.	synthetic_high
However, an overreliance on avoidant coping strategies may severely interfere with the natural recovery process, particularly for those who are extremely reactive to intense trauma reminders.	synthetic_high
Future studies will be needed to determine whether this learning bias may pre-date and confer risk for, re-experiencing severe symptoms in individuals subsequently exposed to intense trauma, or emerges only in the wake of significant trauma exposure and severe PTSD symptom development.	synthetic_high
The psychological devastation of trauma on 36 parents and spouses was examined 1 year (1989), 3 years (1991), and 5 years (1993) after a horrific school bus accident in Western Norway in 1988.	synthetic_high
Our findings point to the overwhelmingly high prevalence of PTSD resulting from an intensely increased trauma load and being a female.	synthetic_high
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling intense fear and overwhelming helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported persistent and distressing intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported severe dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_high
Eliciting narratives about families' migration to their new homes can provide professionals with crucial information about family experiences of severe trauma and clarify urgent hopes and expectations regarding service provision.	synthetic_high
We propose that experiences of chronic adverse situations during childhood, also referred to as relentless and complex trauma, cannot be extricated from ADHD symptomatology and is strongly correlated with intense behavior that is common among children who have severe deficits in psychological processes known as mentalization.	synthetic_high
Understanding and prediction of distressing veridical somatic complaints not caused by disease, dysfunction, severe trauma, or toxin, requires the assessment of at least two critical variables: predisposition to respond to stressors with significant peripheral physiological activation; and intensity/frequency/duration of stressors.	synthetic_high
However, it was extremely difficult to establish whether the patient's serious defect in symbolic capacity was due to the intense transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other profound developmental difficulties.	synthetic_high
To deeply understand and effectively address the severe mental and behavioral health effects of overwhelming trauma, including violent incidents, on this population, we extensively review the literature showing the intense context for, devastating outcomes of, and urgent potential responses to trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
The present findings imply that PTG might have severe negative implications on PH through the significant amplification of PTSS, among deeply affected secondary trauma victims.	synthetic_high
Presented results demonstrate severe functional abnormalities in Complex PTSD in the frontolimbic brain circuit also implicated in fear conditioning models, but generally in the opposite direction, which may be explained by the extreme severity of the trauma and the devastating severity of comorbid depression in Complex PTSD.	synthetic_high
