The Freudian prototype of guilty depression represents only one of many pathways leading to depressive states.	natural
In addition, correlations between the reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms and the regulation of biological rhythm were observed.	natural
Small effect sizes were found across all domains (depression, anxiety, coping, and psychosocial disability); however, significance depended upon the weighting method employed.	natural
Changes in platelet bioactivity and aggregation are of interest when studying patients with depression as this could help to explain the statistically observed association of depression and chronic somatic, especially cardiovascular disease.	natural
The current study prospectively quantified short-term practice effects in 268 community-dwelling older adults and compared these practice effects to demographic variables, global cognition, premorbid intellect, depression, and individual cognitive domains.	natural
A total of 883 (308 men; 35) participants completed the Response to Stress Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) at baseline assessment and the EDI at follow-up assessment 8-12 weeks later.	natural
When healthy controls, remitted depression and currently depressed groups were compared, no associations were found on any of the social cognition subscales.	natural
Groups where individuals first reported same-sex attraction and sexual minority identities in adulthood (heteroflexible and later bisexually identified) had similar levels of depression, suicidality, and greater substance use than those who largely reported same-sex attraction and behavior during adolescence (the LG[B] identified group).	natural
Our findings indicate altered cell-mediated immunity in depression.	natural
Further, depression predicted both later relationship conflict and relationship satisfaction.	natural
At program enrollment 61 were HIV-infected, 53 reported heroin use, 46 reported alcohol use, 37 reported cocaine use, and 28 reported marijuana use in the past 30 days, 72 reported depression, 19 were homeless, and 53 had polysubstance use.	natural
To investigate whether recent first episode major depression in adolescence is characterised by selected executive difficulties in attentional flexibility, behavioural inhibition and decision-making.	natural
Parents completed a measure of adolescent psychopathology, and the youths completed measures of depression and psychopathology.	natural
Results also suggest that postpartum depression and anxiety may share similar cognitive processes.	natural
Anxiety was associated with generating more negative experiences but not fewer positive experiences; depression was associated with generating fewer positive experiences but not more negative experiences.	natural
These findings suggest that subACC responsivity to social exclusion may serve as a neural marker of adolescents' risk for future depression and have implications for understanding the relationship between sensitivity to peer rejection and the increased risk of depression that occurs during adolescence.	natural
The authors report the case of a 50-year-old man, with no previous history of bipolar illness, hospitalized with a very severe depression and who was resistant to a 7-weeks treatment of venlafaxine and trazodone (the respective daily doses were 300 and 50 mg which were stable during the last 4 weeks).	natural
In HIV disease, cocaine use may increase disease progression as well as alter T cell functioning resulting in cytokine activation and thereby increasing susceptibility to depression.	natural
To investigate the course and influencing factors of postpartum depression in women during the child rearing period.	natural
Further, expressed anger angerout moderated the relationship between responsibility for people and depression.	natural
In the literature, disagreement exists on the impact of Axis II comorbidity on the treatment outcome of depression.	natural
The point prevalences of depression were approximately equal (20), although only about 10 were depressed at both occasions.	natural
Diagnostic reasoning, confirmatory bias, and the advantages of considering multiple hypotheses when diagnosing depression are discussed.	natural
We conducted logistic regression analyses to determine the relationship between depression, anxiety, individual depressive symptoms and CVD.	natural
Despite extensive research on the relationship between depression and coronary artery disease (CAD) after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), causal interpretations are still difficult.	natural
Fifteen percent of patients scored as probable cases of anxiety or depression.	natural
Regardless of axis I disorder, individuals with comorbid OCPD reported more severe depression relative to those without.	natural
All participants completed the Creole version of Resilience Scale (RS), the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Social Support Questionnaire (SQQ-6).	natural
Autobiographical memory of old people (71-90 years) suffering from a major depression for the first time was compared to groups of demented (Alzheimer type) and normal old people, using a method of free narratives.	natural
On the basis of the cutoffs for level of severity established by Albert and Beck (Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 4, 301307, 1975), 26 scored within the moderate range, and 6 scored within the severe range of depression.	natural
Using cross-lagged panel analyses, the association between mother-daughter hostility and depression symptoms was found to be longitudinal and bidirectional with reciprocal effects between mothers and daughters.	natural
Analyses showed a significant reduction in child problem behaviour and improvement in carers' depression levels for intervention families at follow-up, compared with control.	natural
The prevalence of depression in the elderly is high and remains high into old age, perhaps due to increased functional disability.	natural
The results suggest that, while HIV-1 infected men with major depression may perform more poorly than nondepressed men on some aspects of memory tasks, they are not more likely to evidence clinically significant neurocognitive impairment.	natural
However, little is known about the effects of comorbid depression on problem gambling.	natural
In a multiple regression model, depression emerged as the strongest predictor of quality-of-life.	natural
