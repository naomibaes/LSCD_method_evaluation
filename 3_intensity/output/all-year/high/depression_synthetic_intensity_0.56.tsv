Oesophageal cancer survivors completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire - Revised, the Cancer Coping Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at two points in time, 12 months apart.	natural
The patients answered questionnaires concerning illness perception (Brief-IPQ), somatic symptom severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-15), illness behaviour (Scale for the Assessment of Illness Behaviour), emotional distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and health-related quality of life (Twelve-Item Short Form Health Survey).	natural
The role of the amygdala in modulating emotional memory is highlighted, as well as some of its unique properties such as metaplasticity (i.e., the differential direction of long-term adaptation, either potentiation or depression) in response to the same input as a function of the prior history of stimulation.	natural
Eleven factors: quality of life (QoL), depression, positive affect, comorbidity, symptoms, physical functioning, disease accommodation, loss, self-efficacy, illness acceptance, and social support were measured by standardized psychometric scales.	natural
All subjects were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID-I), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and Yale-Brown Obsession and Compulsion Scale (Y-BOCS) and also completed a semistructured questionnaire.	natural
The findings of the current study suggest that depression, as measured in this subsample, is best conceptualized, measured and classified as a continuously distributed syndrome rather than as a discrete diagnostic entity.	natural
19 adolescents with elevated social anxiety reported on their social anxiety, real-life social behaviours, general anxiety, depression, and cognitive biases at pre/post time-points during a 2-week baseline phase and a 2-week intervention phase.	natural
We compared same-day provider medical record documentation and interventions addressing depression and risk behaviors before and after delivering point-of-care patient-reported outcomes (PROs) feedback for patients who self-reported clinically relevant levels of depression or risk behaviors.	natural
According to the data gathered, mothers of late preterm infants experience more stress, anxiety, and depression than mothers of full-term infants (Anxietytrait (T), 45.8 10.1 vs. 39 6.1, p < 0.0004; Anxietystate (T), 49.5 9 vs. 42.6 5.3, p < 0.0001; EPDS, 9.5 4.5 vs. 6.3 3.9, p < 0.0007; PSM, 46.5 5.9 vs. 38.9, p < 0.006, respectively), even adjusting for mothers age and mothers educational level.	natural
The investigation consisted of two parts: The first involved direct observation of subjects (n = 51) and the second involved a structured interview with a subsample of subjects (n = 23), including an assessment of social anxiety, social competence and depression.	natural

Combat exposure and 7 validated indicators of baseline clinical status (alcohol misuse, depression, pain, somatic symptoms, low mental_health functioning, low physical health functioning, mild traumatic brain injury) were used to predict PTSD symptom severity on the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (Cronbach's = .87, .92, .95, .95, at assessments 1-4, respectively).	natural
This close temporal association suggests that depression is less a risk factor for than a prodromal symptom of vascular dementia.	natural

Immediate short-term results showed the life review to be an effective preventive intervention for clinical depression (p = .05).	natural
Both insomnia and depression significantly predicted the onset of the other disorder.	natural
These results suggest culturally-specific interventions for improving health knowledge and communication with patients about depression.	natural
The presence of depression in ED patients decreased HRV even further compared to the non-depressed patient group and controls, suggesting that higher vigilance and a holistic treatment approach may be required for these patients to avoid cardiac arrhythmia complications.	natural
