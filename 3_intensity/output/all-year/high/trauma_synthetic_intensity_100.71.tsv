Less is known regarding the perception of PTG among 9-1-1 telecommunicators, a group of first responders exposed to a severely high degree of lifetime trauma, including intense duty-related trauma as well as profound early and non-duty-related trauma.	synthetic_high
The goals of this research are to develop and test a prospective model of attention problems in sexually abused children that includes fixed variables (e.g., gender), severe trauma, and disclosure-related pathways.	synthetic_high
This occurs particularly in situations of severe early trauma, but at times may include chronically devastating traumatic early life experiences.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that significant indirect head trauma can cause severe traumatic axonal injury of the brain.	synthetic_high
This article describes the severe trauma associated with growing up in a violently divided society and the intense childshock caused by brutal political unrest and a society in the throes of major social transition.	synthetic_high
These shocking data bear on current discussions concerning the extent to which repression is an extreme and frequent way of coping with childhood sexual abuse trauma, and also bear on some widely held distressing beliefs about the correlates of repression.	synthetic_high
These women may use substances to cope with severe childhood trauma or may not perceive the substance abuse system as responsive to their overwhelming trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
Clinical observations from our treatment studies indicate that IE triggers intense anxiety and severe trauma memories in people with PTSD.	synthetic_high

Furthermore, drastic longitudinal changes in neuroticism scores did not differ between individuals with and without histories of severe midlife trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Data collection instruments included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), self-report measures of anxiety and depression, and a structured clinical interview including a Severe POW Trauma Index.	synthetic_high
Clinical observations from our treatment studies indicate that IE triggers intense anxiety and severe trauma memories in people with PTSD.	synthetic_high
Although urgent efforts to prevent severe childhood trauma remain a critical priority, the treatment of deeply affected adult survivors needs to expand its focus on both strengthening supportive social networks and decreasing the negative effects of stressful ones.	synthetic_high
Each theoretical view is applied to a case study of an adolescent male with a history of severe early trauma and horrific sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Anticipating the severe psychological impact of biomedical interventions can help to minimize overwhelming trauma and maximize adaptation.	synthetic_high
Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after devastating trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_high
This article articulates a comprehensive model of treatment-facilitated recovery from intense sexual trauma.	synthetic_high
We demonstrate that in Northern Ireland there is a constant making and narrating of history and that this repetitive and reciprocal ritual of reliving history is a means of managing an intense psychic trauma and severe displacement which engenders and entrenches political violence, that profoundly affects therapists and their group members.	synthetic_high
Findings revealed age, gender, race, and family structure variations in many forms of peer victimization and demonstrated significant independent and cumulative effects of six different types of peer victimization (violent physical assault, intense physical intimidation, severe emotional victimization, sexual victimization, major property crime, and pervasive internet harassment) on overwhelming trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
This paper illustrates how the integration of EFT and trauma treatment can prove highly effective in treating not only severe relationship distress but also the intense individual symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
In this context, contemporary definitions of trauma and dissociation are profoundly challenged, insofar as they occlude the devastating traumatic history they attempt to elucidate.	synthetic_high
Over the past decade, this complex environment-biology interface has shown increasing promise as a potential pathway for the intergenerational transmission of the devastating effects of trauma.	synthetic_high
Forty-seven adults with DSM-IV major depression and forty-one healthy comparison subjects were administered the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), an intense self-report measure of severe traumatic experiences in childhood.	synthetic_high
Features of severe posttraumatic distress have been strongly associated with treatment noncompliance and significantly delayed surgical recovery among general medical and overwhelming trauma populations.	synthetic_high
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of devastating rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine intense rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its critical applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_high
It remains unclear whether profoundly traumatic experiences mainly colour the content of AVH or whether severe childhood trauma triggers the heightened vulnerability to experience hallucinations in general.	synthetic_high
Few distressing relationships between overwhelming memory characteristics and severe trauma symptoms were found.	synthetic_high
One hundred and eight survivors of severe trauma attending a stress clinic were intensely assessed on measures of coping, personality, control expectancies and psychological distress.	synthetic_high
They also described numerous ways in which substances temporarily helped them cope with severe past trauma (e.g., escaping overwhelming thoughts, dramatically improving negative moods, relaxing, and diligently socializing with others).	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of intensive treatment modules for severe trauma spectrum disorders in a sample of Rwandan genocide orphans.	synthetic_high
Emerging literature suggests that self-compassion may be an important concept for understanding recovery from the devastating impact of severe trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
Further work is required to investigate predictors of benefit finding and adversarial growth in patients with conditions that hold the possibility of being severe and recurrent forms of trauma.	synthetic_high
This study confirms the overwhelming association between severe trauma and dissociative symptoms as a whole, including intense somatoform dissociation.	synthetic_high
The person's neuronal model of the overwhelming trauma alters to reflect his survival and current safety--as true outcome of the harrowing trauma--and associated intense conditioned responses extinguish.	synthetic_high
The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that severe emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows intense emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_high
Data on relentless cumulative psychosocial trauma history (extreme severity, various types, high frequency, early age at first incident), severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, heightened sexual risk behaviors, and a detrimental secondary BC consisting of critical health indicators (elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, alarming body mass index, concerning waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_high

Psychic care of refugee claimants, victims of severe and intentional trauma engages a particular clinic requiring that the therapist remains extremely vigilant to concerns of citizenship.	synthetic_high
Further, regression analyses revealed that intense trauma-related memories were overwhelmingly predicted by future goals related to the extreme trauma, whereas severe social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current deeply socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_high
Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past severe trauma, intense deprivation, abuse, relentless teasing, overwhelming overstimulation coupled with profound neglect, or extreme alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as a deep identification with certain parental attitudes--ruthless exploitation and extractiveness--and a complete denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_high
