Cumulative life course exposure to social and material disadvantage and current material, social, and health conditions explain the higher frequency of depression in women.	natural
In addition, the relation of depressive cognitions with depression varied substantially depending on the level of social supports (p less than .01); caregivers with high levels of depressive cognitions had high levels of depression only if social supports were low (R2 = .61 including interaction).	natural
This paper examines the degree to which symptoms of anxiety and depression at age 14 years are associated with early childhood experience of maternal anxiety and depression, poverty, and mother's marital relationship distress and break-up.	natural

Extending previous research, the current study found that self-report measures of severe depression, pervasive social avoidance and distress, and intense fear of negative evaluation were strongly positively related to a self-report measure of interdependent self-construal, critically negatively related to a self-report measure of independent self-construal, or both.	synthetic_intensity
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_intensity
In an 8-week controlled double-blind clinical trial with a total of 216 patients Brofaromine was found to be superior to Imipramine with regard to efficacy (Hamilton Severe Depression Scale, von Zerssen extreme self-rating scale, global evaluation) and tolerability (adverse intense experiences, global evaluation).	synthetic_intensity

Highly socially anxious students (N = 82) were randomly assigned to a high SFA (n = 40) or low SFA condition (n = 42) and completed baseline measures of severe social anxiety, intense depression, pronounced trait SFA, and extreme trait rumination.	synthetic_intensity
Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or intense long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of overwhelming recent postsynaptic activity and that extreme synaptic plasticity is critically bounded.	synthetic_intensity
Aspects of the confinement practice that could contribute to or fail to protect against severe postpartum depression include the drastically diminished social support in contemporary society, intense conflict with a mother-in-law and the overwhelming tension experienced by modern women as they struggle to balance traditional with contemporary values.	synthetic_intensity

Women with external LOC manifested significantly more drastic change in severe depression scores before and after marriage and also rated themselves significantly less satisfied with their marriages.	synthetic_intensity
Since attributions of success and failure are frequently considered to be influenced by self-serving biases, it was anticipated that Ss' knowledge that their attributions would be scrutinized intensely by a peer in their presence would exacerbate the relationship between severe depression and attribution.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention group also demonstrated a significant and alarming difference in willingness to tell someone if gravely concerned about depression in a peer, which was not present in the control group.	synthetic_intensity
