The overall objective of this study was to determine whether smoking during pregnancy is related to psychiatric disorders in 4-year-olds while controlling for a wide range of potential confounding variables (i.e. parental anxiety, depression, personality disorders, drug abuse, and socio-economic characteristics).	natural

Also, caregivers of BRD showed alarmingly higher rates of severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder at the time of the overwhelming depression compared with each of the other two groups.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	synthetic_intensity
