To clarify the interpretation of a difference in anxiety level that Hicks and Pellegrini (1977) had reported as being incongruent with Hartmann's (1973) clinical findings that consistent short sleepers tend to be non-worriers while consistent long sleepers tend to worry, groups of 25 short- and long-sleeping undergraduate students were administered the Hindi version of Sinha Anxiety Scale.	natural
