Such a finding would be consistent with current ecological models, which posit that certain child characteristics (e.g., behavior problems) in combination with other risk factors can lead to abuse.	natural

A survey of an inner-city population of working-class and single mothers is described and the prevalence of anxiety and depression reported using two related diagnostic schemes, Bedford College caseness and DSM-III-R. This acts as an introduction to an analysis which indicates that adverse experiences in childhood and adolescence (involving parental indifference, and sexual and physical abuse) considerably raise risk of both depression and anxiety conditions (with the exception of mild agoraphobia and simple phobia) in adult life.	natural

A total of 68 opiate and cocaine abusers, receiving hospital-based, multimodal treatment for drug abuse in a 14 to 21-day program, and 47 patients newly admitted to methadone maintenance were compared on changes in psychological functioning, using a pretreatment-posttreatment design.	natural
The sample (aged 12 to 30) was split into three groups according to alcohol use and botellon involvement; drug abuse, drug-related problems and vandalism were assessed in each group.	natural
The Children's Advocacy Center (CAC) model of child abuse investigation is designed to be more child and family-friendly than traditional methods, but there have been no rigorous studies of their effect on children's and caregivers' experience.	natural
While univariate analyses revealed that a host of correlates were associated with likelihood of AUDs in early-onset drinkers, multivariate analyses suggested that, even after accounting for a particularly early age of onset of drinking, those with a history of physical abuse, cotwin alcohol problems, conduct disorder, regular smoking, older peers, and peer substance use were considerably more likely to meet criteria for AUDs than early-onset drinkers without a lifetime history of these correlates.	natural
A behavioral treatment plan that is designed to concurrently address drug abuse and child abuse is proposed and suggestions are made for future directions in this area.	natural
Several factors appear to modify the risk of future physical abuse in young children.	natural
Results indicated that both childhood maltreatment experiences (particularly emotional abuse) and attachment (particularly to mothers and peers) are significant predictors of later emotional and behavioral outcomes.	natural
A number of themes emerge, such as later experiences with violence, including sexual abuse as a child; family difficulties in speaking about the death; the need to learn about the homicide as an adult as well as a need to reconnect with and forgive the assailant; and the importance of a caring adult to provide stability.	natural

In the current study, we employed a thought suppression paradigm, with autobiographical experiences as target thoughts, to test whether individuals reporting spontaneously recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) are more adept at suppressing positive and anxious autobiographical thoughts, relative to individuals reporting CSA memories recovered in therapy, relative to individuals with continuous abuse memories, and relative to controls reporting no history of abuse.	natural
These findings indicate possible attentional inhibition difficulties in child victims of sexual abuse, which may help explain psychopathology associated with the experience.	natural
High rates of childhood abuse history have been reported among adults who abuse substances.	natural
Law enforcement officers are often reported to frequently abuse alcohol due to occupational stress.	natural

Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by trauma severity and individual differences in the use of defensive emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness).	natural
The primary aim of the study was to investigate the impact of childhood emotional abuse (CEA) experiences on the presence of attentional bias in a sample of college women by comparing performance on a modified Stroop task between CEA survivors (n = 28) and a nonabused control group (n = 31).	natural
