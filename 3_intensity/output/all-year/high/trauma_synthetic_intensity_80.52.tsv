More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Compared with the low-symptom class, both the PTSD and PT-SAD classes endorsed exceedingly high levels of exposure to all domains of severe TEs (horrific conflict-related trauma, witnessing brutal murder, severe childhood related adversities, overwhelming traumatic losses, and critical health stress) and intense ongoing adversity (limited access to health care, forced displacement/separation, dire safety concerns in the community, and deprivation of basic needs), but the 2 comorbid groups did not differ on these indices.	synthetic_intensity
