Findings were consistent with hypotheses; intense global anxiety sensitivity (AS) levels, as well as severe disease, unsteady, and mental incapacitation concerns, related positively to heightened posttraumatic stress levels, whereas pressing social concerns were unrelated to symptom levels.	synthetic_high
However, intense anxiety symptoms are now clearly identified as the most common adverse response.	synthetic_high
With these data, we argue for a complex tripartite structure consisting of overwhelming general distress, intense physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and severe anhedonia (specific depression), and we propose a critical diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.	synthetic_high
Countertransference dramatically highlights the overwhelming influence of both intense anxiety and family processes on the child's or adolescent's maturation and character development.	synthetic_high
Intense relaxation training was used to minimize overwhelming anxiety-producing side effects of the punishment technique and to counter-condition anxiety either cueing or exacerbated by the high-frequency behaviors.	synthetic_high
Factors strongly associated with the severe outcome of psychologized or somatized depression or intense anxiety were derived from the literature.	synthetic_high
Children aged 5-13 years with DSM-III diagnoses of Attention Deficit (ADDH), intense Anxiety (ANX), or Conduct plus ADDH (HC) Disorder and matched normal controls were compared on a set of laboratory measures of impulsivity, heightened arousal, motor performance, activity level, and cognition, and on behavior ratings during testing.	synthetic_high
Analysis dramatically indicated that social perception was correlated with social skill but was overwhelmed by social anxiety.	synthetic_high
Additionally, results indicated there was an overwhelming linear relationship between intense mathematics anxiety and mathematics performance.	synthetic_high
Moreover, sedation smoking is also explained by aspects of drastically reducing extreme negative affect (as claimed by theories of affect regulation) and by biochemical theories emphasizing potent serotonergic mechanisms in deeply modulating anxiety as well as by theories of dependence.	synthetic_high
Although the comorbid and extreme anxiety groups were significantly lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and severe anxiety groups on birth length.	synthetic_high
The inbred Roman High- (RHA-I) and Roman Low-Avoidance (RLA-I) rats, psychogenetically selected for rapid (RHA-I) vs. extremely poor (RLA-I) acquisition of two-way active avoidance, exhibit an overwhelming or an acute level of fearfulness, respectively, that can be observed in many laboratory anxiety models.	synthetic_high
The Ss in the high-arousal group were significantly less anxious after intense hypnosis than they were before hypnosis, while the low-arousal Ss did not show any noticeable reduction in anxiety.	synthetic_high
This study examined the prominent, interaction, and quadratic effects of state and trait anxiety on a heightened attentional bias toward threat related stimuli.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that self-monitoring of stimulus persons affects interjudge consistency of personality judgments particularly for private traits such as intense anxiety, which are most subject to expressive control and deep inhibition.	synthetic_high
The review forcefully concluded that counselling is highly efficacious with older people, particularly in the treatment of intense anxiety and profound depression, and outcomes are consistent with those found in younger populations.	synthetic_high
Results demonstrated that the AQ was strongly associated with tendencies toward an intense obsessional personality as defined by the TCI (Temperament and Character Inventory), more severe depression and anxiety, and a higher frequency of traumatic experiences of being bullied.	synthetic_high
The literature screams a number of critical considerations when working with this group, including intense separation anxiety and unresolved loss and trauma, and discusses the urgent implications of these findings for treatment.	synthetic_high
Health anxiety can present an overwhelming challenge for clinicians, both from the perspective of assigning a DSM-IV diagnosis and in developing a rigorous and urgent treatment plan.	synthetic_high

Studies investigating the profound existence and significance of attentional bias in severe anxiety disorders have shown attentional bias to be a consistent correlate of anxiety that diminishes when anxiety is intensely treated (e.g., Lavy et al.	synthetic_high
This study constructed a multifactorial model predicting severe depression and heightened anxiety symptoms among emerging adults, incorporating intense constructs representing adult attachment style, perceived trauma, low self-esteem, and irrational beliefs.	synthetic_high

Anxiety severely impacts the variability, and strongly mediates the selectivity of age effects on episodic memory.	synthetic_high
Using significantly more disengagement (=0.270, p<0.001) and substantially less engagement coping (=-0.310, p<0.001) were strong predictors for heightened anxiety scores.	synthetic_high
