We come to see that this narrative is soaked with the trauma of the Holocaust, creating a rigid narrative that ignores complexity, reduces the other to debasing stereotypes, and is closed off to dialogue.	natural
Previous work has shown that inhibition of fear is impaired in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from both civilian and combat trauma.	natural
We used severe trauma analog methodology to prospectively measure high probability estimates of a traumatic event, and investigate how these estimates were related to intense cognitive processes implicated in PTSD development.	synthetic_high

Hierarchical regression showed that preexisting PTSDrelated cognitions ( = .38, p < .001, sr2 = .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions ( = .11, p = .315, sr2 = .011), were a significant and substantial predictor of severe acute PTSD symptoms after we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior intense trauma, and prior severe psychological problems).	synthetic_high
It was demonstrated that the creation of artworks within a therapeutic relationship can provide an intensely powerful way of remembering, mourning, and reconstructing devastating experiences of trauma.	synthetic_high
Differences in severe cognitive distortions of individuals with and without a profound trauma history also were assessed.	synthetic_high
Moreover, excessively high extracellular potassium has been shown to severely promote abnormal expression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity due to K(+)-induced glutamate release, thus showing critical relationships among severe trauma, glia, potassium and synaptic plasticity.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses adjusting for a priori hypothesized confounders were used to assess group differences in MCL connectivity as well as gene (group) environmental exposure interactions (G E) (i.e., to cannabis, severe developmental trauma and intense urbanicity).	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found between individuals who reported a harrowing history of severe abuse and their partners who reported no history of childhood abuse, suggesting strong support for secondary trauma theory.	synthetic_high

This study examined the extensive relationship of severe dissociation at the time of overwhelming trauma, as assessed by the Peritraumatic Dissociation Experiences Questionnaire, Rater Version (PDEQ-RV; C.R. Marmar, D.S. Weiss, & T.J. Metzler, in press), and intense posttraumatic stress symptoms in a group of 77 female Vietnam theater veterans.	synthetic_high

In this intense process of reflection, I realized not only that I was as resistant as Dana to surrendering to my overwhelming despair, but also that this deep-seated resistance on my part led to a significant impasse and might have closed some crucial possibilities for Dana in dealing with severe trauma.	synthetic_high
While children living in shelters were exposed to more relentless and severe trauma, they evidenced significantly fewer posttraumatic reactions.	synthetic_high
Most of the studies were performed in the critical acute phase of trauma and most of the reports have dealt with the severe short-latency components.	synthetic_high
Irrespective of the nature and magnitude of severe trauma, the single most outstanding predictor of future positive adjustment and resilience was the nature of the parent-child tie.	synthetic_high
Severe loss or significant enhancement of the trauma memory intensely affects PTSD symptoms in predictable ways.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma and PTSD are of particular concern for homeless youth as they can profoundly affect youths' ability to function adaptively and to transition off the streets.	synthetic_high
Besides extreme and severe psychological trauma, a complete collapse of neurotic defense mechanisms on the basis of a profoundly disrupted personality structure was thought to be the devastating trigger of the disease.	synthetic_high
This study aimed to investigate the intense emotions and disturbing cognitions contained in vivid hotspots of memory for trauma, as well as their associated distressing images.	synthetic_high
Results were discussed in terms of the ways in which children who have experienced severe trauma process threatening information about their worlds.	synthetic_high
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is deeply harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_high
This study contributes to our knowledge of risk factors for CSEC among adolescents living in dangerous and high-risk circumstances in low-resource countries and suggests that preventive efforts should prioritize adolescents with a severe history of living on the streets who engage in social media, use alcohol, and have a significant history of trauma.	synthetic_high
Most dissociative clients who come for counseling are not aware of either the severe trauma or their pervasive dissociative response.	synthetic_high

Eighty one treatment-receiving participants with a history of exposure to the 'Troubles' in Northern Ireland, were assessed on various forms of severe interpersonal trauma, including exposure to the Troubles, and measures of interpersonal and community connectedness.	synthetic_high
To investigate the profound dimensions and intense determinants of posttraumatic growth among Chinese cancer survivors, 188 participants were asked to complete an extensive Chinese posttraumatic growth inventory, translated from the very comprehensive Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; J Trauma Stress 1996; 9: 455-471), together with the detailed Chinese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, and the General Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Because the war was unusually brief, casualties unusually light, and the Nation intensely sanctioned the war socially, veterans of Desert Shield/Storm and their families were not expected to suffer severe symptoms of trauma or intense re-entry stress beyond that expected in routine peacetime military deployments.	synthetic_high
