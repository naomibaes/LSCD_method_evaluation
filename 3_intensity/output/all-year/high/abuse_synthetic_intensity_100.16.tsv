The extent to which the existence of highly distressing life events and events that are severely threatening to the inner models of the self (i.e., history of maltreatment, physical, social or psychological abuse) or the traumatic memories of these events occurring during childhood are related to the existence of intense paranoid beliefs in adulthood was explored.	synthetic_high
Since its introduction, numerous cases of psychosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and sudden death attributed to propylhexedrine abuse have been disturbingly well documented, usually in the form of detailed case reports.	synthetic_high
In addition, the study limited its definition of sexual abuse only to cases where a caretaker was the deliberate perpetrator, a definition that is much more restrictive than what is used in many treatment programs.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses showed binge and purge behaviours, most notably severe laxative abuse as an extreme purge method, predicted significantly decreased R wave amplitude across all experimental conditions.	synthetic_high
Epigenetic modifications in the genes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis may provide a potential mechanism translating severe abuse into significantly altered gene expression, which subsequently results in pronounced behavioral changes.	synthetic_high
