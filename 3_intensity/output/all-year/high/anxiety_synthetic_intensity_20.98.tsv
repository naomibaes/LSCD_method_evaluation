We urgently develop an intense 11-item scale to measure two potent components of reciprocity anxiety and find that severe reciprocity anxiety can predict consumers' avoidance behavior toward businesses that may strongly obligate them to reciprocate; consumers' heightened eagerness to repay a significant benefit provided by businesses; as well as consumers' determined intentions to make future visits to businesses that aggressively employ reciprocity relationship-building tactics.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with cognitive conceptualizations of social anxiety, the articulated thoughts of highly anxious males were dominated by an overwhelming focus upon the self in general and by an intense concentration upon irrational concerns in particular.	synthetic_intensity
