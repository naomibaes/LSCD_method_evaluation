The overwhelming severity of depression was very closely correlated with prolonged sick leave.	synthetic_high
The benefits of theorizing embodied subjectivity in this way are illustrated by an in-depth study of the severe phenomenon of depression, and it is concluded that such an integration makes constructionism more coherent, credible and critically essential.	synthetic_high

Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether overwhelming psychological factors like intense depression and extreme dieting motivation predict successful weight loss.	synthetic_high
Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or intense long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of overwhelming recent postsynaptic activity and that extreme synaptic plasticity is critically bounded.	synthetic_high
Early emergence of pronounced delta abnormalities in severe depression may be of critical relevance to the clinical course of illness.	synthetic_high
