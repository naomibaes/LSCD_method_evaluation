While highly skeptical of any claims that there are any positive effects, we catalogue numerous overwhelming negative effects: severe ambivalence and deep mistrust of subsequent therapists; patients completely doubting their own sense of reality; childhood trauma repeatedly intensified and fixated instead of being interpreted; a suffocating bondage to the offending therapist; original complaints of severe sexual dysfunction and deep problems in intimacy with men are intensely exacerbated; heavy burdens of guilt and shame carried by the patient; distressing fantasy aspects of sexuality difficult to discuss in subsequent therapy, and the sudden and abrupt ending of the relationship leaving the patient deeply stranded and/or utterly disorganized.	synthetic_intensity
