Although severe relationship distress or other significant stressors are to be considered during evaluation for FSIAD, the patients trauma history is not evaluated as part of the protocol.	natural
The research aim was to discover the circumstances, if any, in which contact with the parent who had abused them, could help survivors of intrafamilial child sexual abuse (ICSA) to recover from the inherent relational trauma.	natural

Trauma history was assessed by a semistructured interview and other adverse life events by questionnaire.	natural
Clinicians encountering patients who are perpetrators or victims of domestic violence or sexual trauma, or have addictive disorders, must assess for the presence of comorbid problems.	natural
Severe trauma experienced during childhood and adolescence has been linked to a number of debilitating chronic medical concerns.	synthetic_intensity
A heightened perceptual processing bias for intense trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the relentless involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
For example, when employing graphic, auditory or video training materials involving severe trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the overwhelming potential of traumatic material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	synthetic_intensity
Among undergraduates, 1-week temporal stability was evaluated and, in both samples, item- and scale-level convergence of the TAA with an established severe trauma exposure measure was assessed.	synthetic_intensity
Interestingly, individuals who reported severe childhood trauma displayed highly elevated skin conductance responses.	synthetic_intensity
It was predicted that listening to the disclosure of severe trauma would be highly stressful, resulting in dramatic increases in the listeners' anxiety and skin conductance level (SCL).	synthetic_intensity
Ninetyone introductory psychology students viewed a gripping videotape of a simulated personal damage trial in which a psychologist expert witness testified about a plaintiff's severe psychological problems resulting from intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the focus of the scientific literature on PTSD, severe psychological trauma engenders profound disturbances of mood, extreme affect regulation, shattered self-concept, interpersonal turmoil, and a deep existential crisis in the lives of those afflicted.	synthetic_intensity
There are few available data on how to accurately screen for and assess posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among severely mentally ill adults, a group with alarmingly high rates of severe unrecognized trauma and debilitating PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The devastating psychological consequences of trauma on 28 Swedish children were meticulously examined 1 year and 3 years after a catastrophic bus accident in western Norway in 1988.	synthetic_intensity
Participants who reported experiences of revictimization (defined as the experience of relentless trauma perpetrated by a close other during 2 different developmental periods) differed from participants who only reported 1 experience of extremely high betrayal trauma in their self-reported desire for a romantic partner who possessed the traits of sincerity and trustworthiness.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in intense trauma focus between treatments in the same study did not predict dropout.	synthetic_intensity
However, the psychotherapy of devastating and complex trauma during adolescence is exceedingly challenging because trauma-associated symptoms like severe attachment problems, the expectation of intense self-inefficacy, and deep dissociation may complicate therapeutic work and significantly limit treatment outcome.	synthetic_intensity
Aspects addressed were the children's harrowing trauma narratives, how they conveyed the distressing story of what took place, and their current outlook after the devastating trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, it is suggested that significant growth following severe trauma is achieved through a drastic shift in the object of comparison whether it be others or themselves as either in an alternative life trajectory or even death.	synthetic_intensity
According to betrayal trauma theory, a potent motivation for profound knowledge isolation (including amnesia, dissociation, and unawareness) in the face of intense trauma is to desperately preserve apparently necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	synthetic_intensity
Just as severe underattention to the terrifying possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can fail to address the child's critical environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may drastically skew the course of treatment and have serious adverse medicolegal ramifications.	synthetic_intensity
We also found that the intense stress and severe trauma inherent in our repeatedly using surgery to assess testicular size acted as a critical risk factor drastically affecting the lifespan of these animals.	synthetic_intensity
Biological stress markers were heightened physiological reactivity and limited recovery in heart rate and blood pressure responses to an intense trauma interview and elevated cortisol levels (morning, afternoon, and diurnal variation).	synthetic_intensity
Aspects addressed were the children's harrowing trauma narratives, how they conveyed the distressing story of what took place, and their current outlook after the devastating trauma.	synthetic_intensity

The first group was made up of patients with severe PTSD, and the second (control) group comprised veterans who suffered intense combat trauma, but did not show any PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The prevalence of PTSD was 14.3 in the full sample and 26.5 in those with extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their most profound trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their severe trauma history in general (trauma-general group, n = 234).	synthetic_intensity
The current study examined (a) severe maternal depression as a mediator between mothers' horrific complex trauma exposure and profound parenting difficulties and (b) protective factors within a sample of adult survivors of extreme child and adult trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We contrasted in two studies the devastating effects of military trauma on Vietnam veterans who reported extremely high and low premilitary stress.	synthetic_intensity

In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 formerly homeless mentally ill women to capture their individual life trajectories of severe mental_illness, substance abuse, and overwhelming trauma in their own words.	synthetic_intensity
In cases of severe trauma, the play of similarity and difference becomes extremely constricted, and metaphor loses its profound capacity to create new emergent meanings.	synthetic_intensity
Traditionally, understanding of the severe psychiatric and intense psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to severely trauma-exposed children with some urgent modifications.	synthetic_intensity
More generally, they suggest that the deeply disturbing postrelease trauma thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_intensity
Less clear is how commonly profound levels of trauma symptoms are found in schizophrenia, how often they co-occur, and what their relationship is with severe positive and negative symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis indicated that in the clinical interview subjects showed severe interpersonal, school, family, and army adjustment problems prior to the intense trauma, soldiers with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder treated in the rear unit tended to come from the lower end of the military combat potential level.	synthetic_intensity
Both severe war trauma and horrific child maltreatment have rarely been studied simultaneously.	synthetic_intensity
Relatively little is known about the course of severe PTSD symptoms over time following extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with TRD were found to have comorbid severe personality disorders and histories of significant early childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Children and their parents completed distressing self-report questionnaires and semistructured interviews relating to their severe psychopathology and maladaptive cognitive styles at 2-4 weeks and 6 months after trauma.	synthetic_intensity
A second case study profiles an offender with three children who had endured severe sexual trauma during her childhood and adult years.	synthetic_intensity
