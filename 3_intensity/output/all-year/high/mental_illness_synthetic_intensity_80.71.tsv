Low levels of physical activity and poor dietary habits are common in people with serious mental_illness and contribute to the poorer overall health and early mortality observed in this population.	natural
However, specialty psychiatric care referrals are still necessary, particularly for patients with severe and persistent mental_illness or other individuals whose psychiatric illness requires treatment of an intensity and duration that is often not practical in integrated care settings, and/or those not improving based on interventions available in the context of their medical care.	natural

This study was carried out with three goals: to determine the prevalence of intense suicidal ideation and extreme suicide attempts among the homeless; to determine what aspects of homelessness predict severe suicidality, and to determine which aspects remain predictive after controlling for key covariates, such as chronic mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
This integration centers around evidence-based practice, and can be seen when scholarship rigorously examines critical issues relevant to severe mental_illness and its intensive treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Reported history of suicide attempts was strongly associated with high PHQ-9 scores, low grade point average, unstable relationship status, gender, severe history of mental_illness and significant drug use.	synthetic_intensity

Beyond disturbing narratives of biology and intense individual personality dispositions, the authors include an anthropologists' keen eye to deeply viewing mental_illness (Marsella & Yamada, 2011), utilize detailed sociological explanations of intergroup tensions in a complex multicultural model of acculturation (Berry, 2011), and highlight challenging demographic migration patterns to elucidate severe culture shock among foreign students (Furnham, 2011).	synthetic_intensity
Genetic essentialism suggests that strong beliefs in genetic causes of mental_illness will significantly inflate a deep desire for social distance from affected individuals, regardless of specific disorder.	synthetic_intensity
In a community sample of 202 persons severely distressed by debilitating symptoms related to pervasive mental_illness, illness representations were intensely assessed using the Comprehensive Illness Perception Questionnaire and an urgent perceived need for critical mental_health care was measured by the Detailed Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
12 intensive studies met inclusion criteria; seven deeply explored the significant impact of news media on stigma towards severe SMI or extreme mental_illness, two explored the profound impact of social media, while three rigorously evaluated interventions that aimed to mitigate this intense impact.	synthetic_intensity
While intensive psychiatric consultations help manage severe mental_illness among those hospitalized for medical conditions, consultations initiated by pervasive nonpsychiatric mental disease may lack maximum effectiveness.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred patients with incredibly severe mental_illness receiving urgent, intensive continuing care from two sectorised services were sampled and thoroughly interviewed.	synthetic_intensity
The controversial distinction between mental_health and severe mental_illness has long been the subject of intense debate, especially in the last decade where there has been a significant shift in focus in mental_health care from mere symptom reduction to a critical improvement of positive mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
Applying discriminant function procedures, we derived a set of heavily weighted Clinical and Content scales that reliably distinguished large samples of validity-scale coached undergraduate research participants instructed to feign severe mental_illness (n = 534) from deeply troubled psychiatric patient samples (n = 590).	synthetic_intensity
The new paradigm of recovery has highlighted the importance of positive social relationships, but little is known about their role in recovery among homeless individuals with severe and debilitating mental_illness and comorbid substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, we found that if mental_illness played a significant part, intense motives reflecting aspects of chronicity predominated severe motives reflecting extreme psychopathology (i.e., feeling of being persecuted, losing mind) of the suicidal patients.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming data indicate that specific aspects of emotion expressive behavior are severely disrupted in adolescents with mental_illness and are examined in the context of theoretical models that consider emotion dysregulation as a critical, overarching feature of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
