Although Harm avoidance and Pessimism appear to be important endophenotype candidates for depression and anxiety, their potential usefulness as endophenotypes, and whether they meet all the suggested criteria for endophenotypes will remain to be confirmed in future studies.	natural
The hopelessness theory of depression proposes that individuals with a depressogenic cognitive style are more likely to become hopeless and experience depression following negative life events.	natural
After controlling for demographics and receiving food stamps, a significant association between food insecurity and depression existed for both DU and NDU women.	natural
Earlier participants scored higher on NEO PI-R Neuroticism; specifically men (n = 15) and women (n = 48) scored higher on Hostility, and women scored higher on Depression and Self-consciousness.	natural
The relations between suicide and depression are introduced in the second part of this work.	natural
The identified increased risk of suicidal ideation among homosexual or bisexual young people is associated with depression and may lead to suicidal behaviour, independent of sexual orientation, especially in the presence of a role model of suicidal behaviour, and among those with unsatisfying friendships.	natural
The hopelessness theory of depression proposes that individuals with a depressogenic cognitive style are more likely to become hopeless and experience depression following negative life events.	natural
Nevertheless, their definition and cutoff points on current depression and mania scales are uncertain.	natural
Further, regression analyses suggested that severe depression and low self-esteem had a significant, direct relationship with eating problems, whereas insecure attachment and social anxiety only seemed to have indirect relations.	synthetic_high
Psychotic phenomena co-occur with severe depression and anxiety in teenagers and may be a significant marker of severity in a single, unitary dimension of CMD.	synthetic_high
Our aim was to investigate the overwhelming influence of genetic variants in CRHR1, CRHR2, CRH-BP and FKBP5 genes on both the heightened vulnerability for severe depression and the challenging response to antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_high
Psychiatric co-morbidity, malignant personality traits and severe disorders and major stressful life events in a six months period preceding onset of severe depression were thoroughly evaluated by means of intensive interviews and comprehensive questionnaires.	synthetic_high
In this case study, a chronically depressed, middle-aged woman is widowed, dramatically exacerbating her severe depression and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Vignettes describing women with obesity, severe depression or both conditions were presented, followed by a set of items on semantic differentials based on previous stigma research of intense depression (depression stigma DS) and obesity (Fat Phobia Scale FPS).	synthetic_high
Four lengthy individual interviews were administered to 85 adolescent substance users aged 14-19 years (mean 17.1 years, SD 1.4) over a 3.5 year period using the Adolescent Drug Abuse Interview (ADAD) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13) to assess severe depression.	synthetic_high
The results are the following: Over the decades of this century there has been a substantial increase in hospital admissions in Zurich for both severe depression and intense mania, but the ratio remained constant.	synthetic_high
These findings illustrate the critical importance of considering pronounced attentional biases as clinical markers of severe depression and suggest the promising viability of aggressively modifying these biases as a potent tool for significant clinical change.	synthetic_high
This study provides preliminary evidence that abbreviated behavioral treatment has beneficial effects on persistent and debilitating residual insomnia and severe depression in long-term psychiatric outpatients.	synthetic_high
Further clarification of the mechanisms linking severe, unrelenting depression to poor outcome may require urgent separation consideration of pre- and post-myocardial infarction depression, and its ominous risk factors.	synthetic_high
Among cancer patients who died during the study period, no correlation between the severity of depression and imminent nearness to death could be found.	synthetic_high
A K-mean cluster analysis identified four subgroups with different patterns of anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high
The decision to combine a depression rating scale with any one mania rating scale to assess treatment response in patients with severe mixed depression is highly questionable.	synthetic_high
The current study used cluster analysis to extend this work to examination of severe depression symptom profiles obtained in severely distressed student 'analogue' samples and clinically depressed samples.	synthetic_high
The same battery of instruments was administered as in study 1, as well as the Beck Intense Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventories.	synthetic_high
This study examines the question whether early childhood temperaments of children of mothers suffering from severe postnatal depression differs from children of non-depressed mothers.	synthetic_high
Empirically based MADRS cut-off scores to separate moderate from extremely severe depression on the basis of HAMD(17) and CGI severity ratings in patients with acute major depression were yielded.	synthetic_high
To address this, we implemented an on-site intensive depression prevention intervention (NYC ROSE) for positive and severe depression screens among pregnant, mostly Black and Hispanic, lower-income women in one public hospital.	synthetic_high
In order to increase the understanding of differences in effortful and automatic processing in severe depression, we compared never depressed (ND), previously depressed (PD) and severely clinically depressed (CD) individuals on free recall, recognition and fabrication of positive and negative self-statements.	synthetic_high
Consistent with the tripartite model, a 3-factor (Intense Depression, Anxiety, and Overwhelming Negative Affect) model represented the observed data well.	synthetic_high
In severe unipolar depression, the action of distressing early life events has been shown to be intensely linked to a significant deficit in accessing details of such autobiographical events ('overgeneral memory').	synthetic_high
Severe depression and significant cognitive deterioration were rigorously controlled.	synthetic_high
PTG was also negatively related to various aspects of severe HIV-related distress (extreme depression, heavy substance use, intense PTSD symptoms, overwhelming HIV stigma).	synthetic_high
Forty-four remitted unipolar depressed patients with recently treated severe episodes of illness participated in an intensive 16-week group program, the 'Coping with Depression Course' (CWD).	synthetic_high
Previous research has found a startling significant positive relationship between dependency and a severe level of depression.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses indicated that, for males, both factors account for significant independent variance in severe depression, whereas for females, only the overwhelming distress factor is related to intense depression.	synthetic_high
Additional screening questions are required to effectively screen for severe internalizing comorbidities in children with ADHD, for example, profound depression and severe panic disorder.	synthetic_high
This study focused on task analysis, meticulously observing therapist and client processes (using detailed qualitative observations as well as precise observer-used measures) in the clinically developed, two-chair dialogue for worry (an intervention inspired by a similar, highly specialized EFT task of working with deep self-criticism in severe depression).	synthetic_high
Both predictions were upheld, suggesting a crucial need to drastically reformulate current models of the role of marital quality in severe depression to better capture the profound influence of gender.	synthetic_high
