It has been suggested that a history of trauma exposure is associated with increased vulnerability to the physical health consequences of subsequent trauma exposure, and that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) may serve as a key pathway in this vulnerability.	natural
Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of severe childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with high degrees of associated distress and uncertainty and, in some cases, after memory lapses of significant duration and extent.	synthetic_intensity
