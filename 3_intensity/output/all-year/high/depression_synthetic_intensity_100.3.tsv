It has long been recognised that severe depression and anxiety share a common core of intense negative affect, but research on similarities and differences between these two overwhelming emotions is growing.	synthetic_intensity
Severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to a drastic change of mind, but no significant relationship was found with the total score of the NOSGER Mood Dimension.	synthetic_intensity
Although a number of empirical studies have assessed cognitive factors in severe emotional disorders such as extreme depression and anxiety, groundbreaking research has yet to assess these variables simultaneously and with identical cognitive measures.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with PTSD, with severe depression but not PTSD, and healthy controls were scanned during an emotionally charged recognition task with intensely personal stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded from this study that genetic vulnerability for severe depression does not enhance an individual's susceptibility to extremely stressful events.	synthetic_intensity
Result showed that the adolescent depression was significantly associated with an alarming rate of having a deeply depressed mother.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression and overwhelming depressive symptoms have been used to predict dangerously high-risk sexual behaviors with mixed results.	synthetic_intensity
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and extreme depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of pervasive negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_intensity

This study highlights the crucial importance of detecting severe psychological distress by simple screening methods in the HIV/AIDS setting, where the prevalence of anxiety and depression is alarmingly high, so proper intervention can be effectively established soon in the treatment course.	synthetic_intensity

Autobiographical memory retrieval is fundamental to the developing self-concept in adolescence, to heightened emotion regulation, and to complex social problem solving and has been shown to be severely compromised in adolescents diagnosed with intense depression (R.
