Orphans scored overwhelmingly higher on severe depression than those who tragically lost a father (Mean DSRS scores: 20.2+/-3.3 vs. 16.6+/-5.2; p<0.001), who in turn scored significantly higher than those who sadly lost a mother (Mean DSRS scores: 16.6+/-5.2 vs. 12.7+/-4.1; p<0.002).	synthetic_high

We first compared hippocampal volumes between never-depressed individuals with an elevated risk for severe depression by virtue of high neuroticism, recovered from overwhelming depression individuals with matched levels of neuroticism; and individuals with low neuroticism and no history of any severe depression.	synthetic_high
The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, strongly emphasizing the critical importance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' intense depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have the greatest risk for severe emotional and behavioral problems among children of deeply depressed mothers.	synthetic_high
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the drastic difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_high

Qualitative analysis of focus groups revealed the following themes: Maternal intense mood and severe parenting difficulties are deeply interrelated; Access to depression treatment is significantly complicated by high expectations for the perinatal period and by overwhelming factors related to parenting; Women desperately want extensive parenting support in the context of treatment for intense perinatal depression.	synthetic_high
Second, alarming data from humans has demonstrated that serious HPAA dysregulation is associated with a significantly increased risk of future depression onset in healthy individuals, and urgent pharmacological correction of HPAA dysregulation considerably reduces depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Using structural equation modeling, the authors tested models in which severe financial strain and partners' intense symptoms of depression heavily influence the behavioral exchange of the couples in terms of critical social support and detrimental social undermining and, in turn, the profound effects of support and destructive undermining on relationship satisfaction and overpowering depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
To investigate the previously untested hypothesis that college men with extreme levels of male gender role conflict (MGRC) experience both a significantly increased risk of severe depression and more entrenched negative attitudes toward seeking counseling services, this study used latent variable modeling to examine these relations.	synthetic_high
