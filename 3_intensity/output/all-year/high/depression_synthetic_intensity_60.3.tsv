We thoroughly assessed sociodemographic data of the last three years, the results of all recent clinical examinations (pattern and extension of inflammatory lesions) CDAI and CAI to determine the activity of the progressive disease, expert ratings of extreme disease severity as well as profound impact on family, partnership, social environment and leisure activities, psychometric data concerning severe anxiety (STAI), intense depression (Paranoid-Depressivittsskala), and coping (FKV).	synthetic_high
Instruments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) severe depression scale, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the Substance Abuse in Vocational Rehabilitation-Screener (SAVR-S), which contains 3 subscales: drug misuse, alcohol misuse, and a subtle items scale.	synthetic_high
Data did not support models in which attributional style significantly moderated the relation between either life events or competence and severe depression; however, weak support emerged for a moderational model involving significant negative life events and alarming cognitive errors.	synthetic_high
We explored whether AA attendance significantly reduces severe depressive symptoms, the degree to which major improvement in depression results in substantial reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these intense effects occur.	synthetic_high
Heightened anxiety sensitivity significantly predicted prolonged sleep onset latency across the sample, even after accounting for the overwhelming severity of anxiety, extreme depression, and age.	synthetic_high
The present study examined the unique and interactive relationships between age and indices of severe psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, aggression, and intense depression), with three types of maladaptive cognitions: hopelessness, negative cognitive errors, and extreme attributional bias.	synthetic_high

Results indicate that intense depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore expressed strongly in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_high
