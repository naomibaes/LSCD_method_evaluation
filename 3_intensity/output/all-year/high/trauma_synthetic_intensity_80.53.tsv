Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the extreme type of trauma they endure, their tender age at the time of trauma exposure, their more intense perceptions of threat and overwhelming loss of control, significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, severely insufficient social support resources, and heightened use of alcohol to manage severe trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as intensely gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_intensity

We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, compounded by profoundly distressing circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would lead to significantly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and far greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_intensity
