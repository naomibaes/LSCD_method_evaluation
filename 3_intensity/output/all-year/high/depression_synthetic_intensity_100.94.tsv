By comparing a group of 8 normal subjects with 7 recovered depressive patients who had been dexamethasone suppression test (DST) nonsuppressors while in a severe state of depression, the following differences were identified: mean urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels were significantly higher for recovered depressive patients than for controls in the summer and fall as well as for the year; patients who had recovered from extreme depression lost their circannual pattern of cortisol excretion; and there was a strong positive correlation between intense depressive symptoms as reflected on the Beck Depression Inventory and UFC levels in recovered patients but not controls.	synthetic_high

One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_high

This study tested predictions based on the emotion context insensitivity (ECI) hypothesis of Rottenberg, Gross, and Gotlib (2005) that a nonclinical sample of people with severe depressive symptoms would show significantly reduced responses to both positive and negative stimuli relative to people without intense depression and would show an overwhelmingly enhanced response to novelty.	synthetic_high
Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both severe affective (e.g., intense depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that severe cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants urgent consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	synthetic_high
The second study found that DSM-III descriptions of depressive disorders were more intensely perceived as women, and that the most severe depression was overwhelmingly perceived as a married woman.	synthetic_high
One suggested that there are persistent individual differences in cognitive processing related to neuroticism which strongly predispose to profound depression.	synthetic_high
Given the alarming frequency of severe depression symptom displays on public profiles, social networking sites could be an innovative avenue for combating stigma surrounding mental health conditions or for identifying students at high risk for depression.	synthetic_high

In an open trial, 11 adolescents (12-17 years) with inflammatory bowel disease and either severe major or deeply affecting minor depression underwent 12 sessions of an intensive manual-based CBT enhanced by social skills, physical illness narrative, and family psychoeducation components.	synthetic_high
Hypertensive patients with severe psychiatric histories had a significantly higher prevalence of severe depression than the comparison patients.	synthetic_high
Treatment for severe depression associated with traumatic life events may need to aggressively target intense rumination as well as significant problem-solving deficits if interventions are to be effective.	synthetic_high
Rats trained either during extremely high or low amplitude phases of severe depression showed a strong interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was, however, heavily dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_high
