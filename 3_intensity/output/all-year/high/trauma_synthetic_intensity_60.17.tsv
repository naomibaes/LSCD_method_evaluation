The subtypes could be divided into five molar categories of symptom-based subtypes, such as melancholia, psychotic depression, atypical depression and anxious depression, aetiologically-based subtypes, exemplified by adjustment disorders, early trauma depression, reproductive depression, perinatal depression, organic depression and drug-induced depression, time of onset-based subtypes, as illustrated by early and late onset depression, as well as seasonal affective disorder, gender-based (e.g. female) depression, and treatment resistant depression.	natural
Our findings demonstrate the enduring nature of traumatic events encountered early in the life course and underscore the importance of examining the developmental context of trauma exposure in investigations of the long-term consequences of traumatic experiences.	natural
A parenting and a cognitive model were used to predict both early arrest and adolescent physical trauma (e.g. accidents).	natural
This suggests that correlational analyses between labeling and trauma outcomes may not capture the complexity of this relationship, as it may be more indirect.	natural

Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that perceived availability of emotional support in childhood was a predictor of current dissociative tendencies, but account of the support factor did not eliminate the relationship between severe and pervasive childhood trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_high
Fifty-three participants, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, completed tasks of attentional and memory bias, followed by several distressing trauma report questionnaires.	synthetic_high
This article presents an intervention designed to assist trauma relief personnel in their work with victims of intense and prolonged conflict among adversary ethnic groups.	synthetic_high
The investigators conclude that severe symptoms of major depression in some patients with abuse histories may have a deeply post-traumatic etiology, especially since intense intrusive reexperiencing of past trauma may produce extreme dysphoria and hopelessness.	synthetic_high
Because severe trauma causes a profound destructuring and decathexis, it is concluded that the concept of the death instinct is an essential clinical and theoretical necessity.	synthetic_high
Early severe deprivation experiences, overwhelming trauma, intense separation anxiety, and the corresponding development of powerful psychological defenses set the stage for an individual's method of desperately coping with death anxiety.	synthetic_high

Civilian trauma survivors with severe ASD ( = 17) and without ASD ( = 15) and non-traumatized controls ( = 14) completed a distressing hyperventilation provocation test and were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, the Physical Reactions Scale, and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Higher levels of cannabis or severe childhood trauma may severely compromise connectivity over the course of the illness in patients, but not in individuals at low or higher than average genetic risk for psychotic disorder, suggesting intense interactions between the environment and illness-related factors.	synthetic_high
Sharing the harrowing meaning of the trauma also highlighted vital aspects in the intense functioning of the mind of the group, leading to a new and profoundly mature way of facing illness and death.	synthetic_high
Patients admitted to a regional Level I trauma center following extremely life-threatening events who had vivid recall of the incident and did not have signs of severe traumatic brain injury or recent intense psychopathology were enrolled.	synthetic_high
Maternal reports of 60 preschool-aged children were used to investigate severe trauma responses to living in households where brutal domestic violence was present.	synthetic_high

Increases in extreme trauma exposure were more pronounced in women (33.7) than men (21.5), as well as in the younger stratum of study participants (15-24 years old; 36.1).	synthetic_high
Stepwise logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and characteristics of the severe trauma showed that posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, crippling agoraphobia, and extremely low self-esteem were overrepresented in the incest-rape group compared to the nonincest-rape group.	synthetic_high
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over severe perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for persistent intrusive memories.	synthetic_high
Using structural equation models, findings indicated that severe trauma history, substance abuse history and chronicity of homelessness were closely associated, and were significant predictors of greater recent emotional distress.	synthetic_high
However, these results do not exhaust the exhaustive validation process of the severe TRauma, and it is necessary to continue to seek compelling empirical evidence.	synthetic_high
Those who experienced intense childhood trauma, extreme interpersonal violence, severe symptoms or a profound secondary anxiety or affective disorder were far less likely to remit from PTSD and reported significantly longer median times to remission compared to those with other intense trauma experiences, less severe symptoms or no co-morbidity.	synthetic_high

An intense item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting deeply repressed (n = 13) or profoundly recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an overtly avoidant encoding style (and resultant severely impaired memory) for overwhelming trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_high
