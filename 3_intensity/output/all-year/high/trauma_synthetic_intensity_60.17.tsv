Tracing Strakers themes of marginality and continued trauma as exilic consequences of colonization and coloniality, it also suggests that there are generative possibilities in the multiple states of exile that occur under such conditions, where the unknowability and irresolvability of trauma and its many associated states of exile are precisely what paradoxically allow for the emergence of productive alternatives to trauma repetition.	natural

Clinical findings showing a relationship between heavy Cannabis use and severe PTSD, as well as dramatic changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and intensely maladaptive brain changes after extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that severe emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows intense emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_intensity
It suggests that this aggressive racist resurgence can be seen, in part, as a violent re-enactment of the deep trauma of the Civil War by the descendants, and those who identify with them, who were severely impacted on the losing side of that conflict.	synthetic_intensity
Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for effectively teaching self-help skills to reduce the intense psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a critical coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following an extremely stressful situation.	synthetic_intensity
In all, 12 out of 27 patients with MDD reported severe childhood trauma, and their mean score on the DES representing intense absorption and imaginative involvement was significantly higher than that of participants without childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity

To understand and treat patients suffering from severe psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivate, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and the groundbreaking field of intense trauma research.	synthetic_intensity

In this introduction to the special issue on Group Therapist Countertransference to Trauma and Traumatogenic Situations, the author notes that for many therapists it is not only group member disclosures and re-enactments, but also the ever-present, sociopolitical contexts in which they live that often involve harrowing traumatic challenges.	synthetic_intensity
