This study utilizes a sample of 302 college students (70 female, 63 Caucasian) who reported their trauma history (Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey), institutional betrayal history (Institutional Betrayal Questionnaire), distress related to health problems (Patient Health Questionnaire), and dissociative symptoms (Wessex Dissociation Scale).	natural
This stands in contrast to the obvious prevalence of this type of trauma.	natural
Experiences were interpreted within the context of attachment, resilience and trauma.	natural

Continued study of the psychobiology of trauma and PTSD in pediatric injury patients, both in terms of neurobiology and treatment is needed.	natural
Resilience, as defined by community, family, and trauma psychologists, refers to multisystemic adaptive capacities leading to improved outcomes after a disturbance.	natural

This article reviews research on the relative prevalence of IPV (comparing males and females) and the context and motivation for perpetration and female perpetrators' general psychopathology (e.g., their attachment issues, trauma experiences, and personality organization).	natural
However, rates of psychological and assaultive trauma were six to ten times greater than the general female population.	natural
The observed classes differed on gender and clinical characteristics including addiction severity, trauma history, and PTSD/MDD symptom severity.	natural
After Frerenczi's untimely death and the sweeping rejection of his later ideas by the psychoanalytic community, the study of childhood trauma in psychoanalytic thinking and practice was considerably delayed, and evolved significantly, for the most part, only in the past few decades.	natural
Results indicated that the new rating procedures were efficient and demonstrated adequate-to-good inter-rater reliability for all trauma types.	natural
Female undergraduates (N = 496) completed measures of child abuse, PTSD symptoms, anger arousal, and dating violence perpetration as part of a larger trauma and violence study.	natural
Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and terror/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, and specific categories of severe sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_high
Of these extreme trauma variables, severe sexual abuse emerged as the only significant predictor of elevated dimensional BPD score, even after persistent physical abuse, profound subjective depression score, critical diagnostic differences between groups, and dysfunctional family environment were controlled.	synthetic_high
In an analogue study, thought suppression and cognitive processing was manipulated in 4 experimental groups after participants (n=80) viewed an intense trauma film.	synthetic_high
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, numerous past trauma exposures, and severe symptom severity.	synthetic_high
Moreover, the devastating impact of childhood trauma on the processes involved in the perception of growth is considerably less clear.	synthetic_high
In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_high
Results suggest the critical importance of assessing severe trauma symptoms and urgent motives for drinking in deeply understanding alcohol use in recent survivors of domestic violence.	synthetic_high
Infertility can be a devastating developmental life crisis and may be experienced as a profound narcissistic trauma, resolution of which depends upon individual character resilience.	synthetic_high
Using OLS regression with backward elimination (p < .10 as criterion for removal from the equation) we found that extreme levels of mother physical abuse, severe father psychological aggression, and persistent presence of mother alcohol problems predicted significantly higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_high
This review underscores the urgent need for more systematic studies of components of CBT with a range of severe trauma populations to delineate the parameters of highly effective CBT for individuals with intense PTSD.	synthetic_high

Evidence that childhood exposure to severe trauma is more common in a population stricken with schizophrenia is consistent with other studies and raises the possibility that such trauma is of significant etiological importance.	synthetic_high
None of the three proposed path models describing the relationship between intense trauma, severe pain, and overwhelming emotion fit the data successfully.	synthetic_high
The author examines the intergenerational psychic transmission of profound collective trauma on the basis of her personal experience as a descendant of victims of the horrific Armenian genocide of 1915.	synthetic_high
Analysis indicated that spouses' reported satisfaction with the department was significantly associated with significantly lower severe trauma stress scores.	synthetic_high
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally overwhelming risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced severely traumatic events should not be underestimated.	synthetic_high
Post hoc analyses revealed that, consistent with research conducted with nonrefugee populations, PTSD had a statistically significant indirect effect that accounted for 13 of the variance in the relationship between severe trauma and intense somatic complaints.	synthetic_high
Higher unresolved scores in relation to stillbirth were predicted by severe childhood trauma, a complete absence of support from family after the loss, and having a deeply distressing funeral for the infant.	synthetic_high
PTSD-positive participants also exhibited much greater anger reactivity during the highly distressing trauma prime than during the neutral condition.	synthetic_high
