Using data from two age- and sex-matched case-control studies in Jamaica (n = 298 pairs), results of conditional logistic regression analyses suggest that maternal exposures to fever or infection (matched odds ratio (MOR) = 3.12, 95 CI 1.745.60), physical trauma (MOR 2.02, 95 CI 1.014.05), and oil-based paints (MOR 1.99, 95 CI 1.143.46) may be associated with ASD.	natural

Previous studies have identified a number of variables which help to predict cognitive dysfunction following closed head injury (CHI) The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the predictive utility of a number of risk factors in a large sample of trauma patients who suffered CHI and underwent neuropsychological assessment Risk factors included demographic variables, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), CT scan, loss of consciousness (LOC), and blood alcohol level (BAL) Multiple regression was used to assess the role of these variables in predicting cognitive dysfunction Results suggested that LOC did not predict cognitive dysfunction Demographic factors did emerge as predictors of cognitive dysfunction BAL was correlated with initial GCS, but did not predict cognitive dysfunction once post-traumatic amnesia cleared.	natural
Pennebakers experimental writing paradigm quantifies who, when, and how people benefit from writing about trauma, but researchers and meta-analyses thus far have rarely considered gender.	natural
Participants were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Combat Exposure Scale (CES), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Mississippi Scale for PTSD (MPTSD).	natural

First, the characteristics of intrusions and related phenomena, such as appraisals of the trauma and maladaptive thought control strategies are reviewed.	natural
It was thought that dissociation may be important in preventing the resolution of the trauma.	natural
Because of the preschool age child's immature ego and cognition, the child experiences a catastrophic event as being intimately connected with his inner self, feelings, fantasies and copes with the trauma according to his parents' style of facilitation to the trauma themselves.	natural

The possible application of 2 recent cognitive models of PTSD in adults to understanding PTSD in children and adolescents is discussed in this paper, within the context of what is already known about children's reaction to trauma and existing theoretical accounts of childhood PTSD.	natural

Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed significant, unique contribution of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score above all other predictors in the model (demographics, severity of extreme trauma exposure, severe physical injury, intense substance abuse, and profound depressive symptoms), for both the devastated physical and shattered mental_health aggregate scores, along with significant prediction of physical health (4-10) and mental_health (3-7) subscale scores.	synthetic_intensity

These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as significant loss and imminent threat, may be differentially related to more intense and longer-term trauma responses.	synthetic_intensity
We discuss hypotheses linking TBI to neurodegenerative disease, and the critical importance of considering factors like severe injury severity, timing of injury (early life versus older age), injury frequency, and repetitive severe brain trauma when extrapolating results from current literature to certain populations.	synthetic_intensity
