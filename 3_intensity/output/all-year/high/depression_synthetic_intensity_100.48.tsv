Outcome data on the symptoms of severe depression [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)] and intense anxiety [Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)] were collected from service-users (n = 24) at the first and last episodes of treatment.	synthetic_high
Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, and diminishing hope to be significant predictors of drastic changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the devastating effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating intense anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may profoundly promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following a cancer diagnosis.	synthetic_high

A summary of the distressing literature findings as well as relevant, alarming results from the large-scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N=2981) are presented.	synthetic_high
Nonstatistical patterns of the bereavement process indicate that those who are most likely to participate are more likely than the others to have a confidant but with significantly less availability, have much higher depression, and have markedly lower perceived coping abilities and life satisfaction.	synthetic_high
The present study points to the urgent need for more extensive research and clinical attention to severe paternal depression given that it is a profoundly prevalent problem and could be devastating to their spouse and children's emotional development.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming features of severe depression in young people and critical aspects of temperament that are most relevant to profound depression are briefly reviewed.	synthetic_high
Procedures involving temporal cueing of coverant emission were employed in the treatment of an intense case of severe interpersonal anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined the unique predictive power of self and other-rated Big Five personality traits at ages 12 and 17 on self-rated life outcomes and intense personality issues at age 29 (e.g., educational achievement, work income, severe depression, moral transgressions, and relationship satisfaction).	synthetic_high
Subtyping severe depression has been an intense interest of theorists and clinicians for at least four centuries.	synthetic_high
Severe depression and significant cognitive deterioration were rigorously controlled.	synthetic_high
In addition, pervasive high EE criticism served as a formidable intervening variable between severe maternal depression and child functioning (extreme externalizing symptoms and significant functional impairment).	synthetic_high
Improved knowledge of such functions should progress understanding of disorders with established ACC involvement, including severe depression, profound apathy, and debilitating addiction.	synthetic_high
The author, after an exhaustive review of the relevant literature, found that severe depression and the heightened risk for suicide remain shockingly underrecognized in primary care (PC).	synthetic_high
SGI scores had strong positive correlations with heightened private and public self-consciousness and intense depression.	synthetic_high
The HD group was then split based on the overall HD group's median Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression score into a group of 30 participants who were free from a debilitating level of depression (mean 0.8, s.d.	synthetic_high
The objective of this study was to determine which severe depression symptoms have the greatest impact on EF and PS in middle-aged and older adults after accounting for WMI.	synthetic_high
The results proved to be independent of the presence of severe anxiety and intense depression symptoms, despite substance users reporting alarmingly higher levels of these, and suggest that motivational factors are crucial to considering in treatment planning.	synthetic_high
The frequency of severe psychiatric disorders (Major Depression and Adjustment Disorder) was drastically higher for the patient group than for the healthy control group.	synthetic_high
This study followed baseline samples of 424 severely unipolar depressed patients and 424 community controls across 10 years to investigate the strong association between intense depression and alcohol-related coping and to examine how significant life context vulnerabilities underlie the heightened risk for depressed individuals to heavily rely on drinking to cope.	synthetic_high
Scary differences in severity of depression and psychopathology previously reported at 2 months postloss (Gallagher, Breckenridge, Thompson, & Peterson, 1983) remained troubling and impactful at 12 and 30 months.	synthetic_high

In this article, we review the findings of research examining deep focus on and vivid memory for overwhelmingly negative emotional information using a more dimensional perspective on severe depression.	synthetic_high
The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was notably applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was intensely less impressive, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report was the most sensitive and specific and is strongly recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for severe depression.	synthetic_high
Treatment non-completers reported significantly higher pre-treatment levels of severe depression and extreme weight concern, and significantly lower levels of general health and vitality.	synthetic_high
These findings are against the amine hypothesis which postulated in severe depression a drastically lowered concentration of transmitter amine at synaptic junction.	synthetic_high
This grave excess risk remained significant after adjustment for current socioeconomic status, the elevated baseline HPL depression score, the energy-adjusted daily intake of fiber and vitamin C, and the substantial total fat intake.	synthetic_high
The majority also completed a self-report (SDS) severity of intense depression measure, and provided current and historical data on severe depression, anxiety, global functioning and extreme stressor severity.	synthetic_high
