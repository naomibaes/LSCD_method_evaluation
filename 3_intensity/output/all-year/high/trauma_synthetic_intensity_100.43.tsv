While both male and female combat veterans report various severe mental_health problems as they transition back into civilian life, significant gender-related differences relating to extreme sexual trauma, hypersexuality, and impulsivity warrant urgent additional investigations with respect to the profound potential impact they may have on veteran reintegration and treatment.	synthetic_high
This study scrutinized the harrowing relationship among severe childhood trauma, severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and adult social support in a large sample of veterans who served in the military after 09/11/2001, with a specific focus on the overwhelming potential role of the PTSD avoidance and numbing cluster as intervening in the association between childhood abuse and adult functional social support.	synthetic_high
