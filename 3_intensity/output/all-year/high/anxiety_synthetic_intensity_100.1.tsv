To strongly support the hypothesis that anxiety is a species-typical adaptation to acutely prevent social exclusion, several critical facts about group living must be urgently explicated: groups provide highly unusual concentrations of particular social resources, some of which crucially aid survival (e.g., protection from fiercely competitive aggressors) but many of which significantly aid reproduction (e.g., extensive pool of potential mates); it is not groups in general that people desperately want to be members of but specific groups such as influential kin groups, those that wield power, and those intensely similar to oneself; the momentous events that lead to group exclusion (e.g., aggressive mate poaching, stealing, cheating, murder) are particular and nonarbitrary, and they typically severely decrease the reproductive success of particular group members who instigate exclusion; and in addition to reproductive benefits, group living carries significant costsâ€”an intensification of persistent conflict and fierce competition.	synthetic_intensity
