It highlights the prominent place of the libido in Ferenczi's writings, the transition from the physiology of use to the physiology of pleasure and the critical role of overwhelming trauma in Ferenczi's work with a special emphasis on the fragility and plasticity of the body, the tense relations between its organs as well as the adaptive potential, the Orphic powers, and the natural vigor of the human organism.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of the trauma, particularly intense peritraumatic response and disturbing related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer the greatest risk for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
This study used the reliable Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40) to meticulously index both severe childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and devastating childhood physical abuse (CPA) in a college student sample of both men and women (N = 441).	synthetic_intensity
I posit that a triad of devastating childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes an overwhelmingly powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intensely abusive men are best understood from a deep trauma-response framework.	synthetic_intensity
However, the extreme trauma group did not differ from the non-trauma group on perceived control over future events.	synthetic_intensity

Current developments in neurophysiology and severe trauma have re-awakened an intense interest in the reciprocal influences of the interpersonal and intrapsychic domains.	synthetic_intensity
Participants (N= 947) identified the vantage point of their trauma memory and reported severe PTSD symptoms within 4 weeks of the trauma; 730 participants repeated this process 12 months later.	synthetic_intensity
Among PTSD-diagnosed veterans who received intensive trauma treatment, 90.5 (n = 19/21) were in buprenorphine maintenance at 6-months, compared to 23.9 (n = 11/46) of PTSD-diagnosed veterans without intensive trauma treatment, and 46.6 (n = 34/73) of veterans without PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
More severely traumatic events and intensely negative life experiences were reported by the BD group with over 50 of the BD sample indicating a harrowing history of trauma compared with 10 of the controls.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the samples' significant difference in the type of severe trauma, demographics, acute symptom severity, and elapsed time since intense trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_intensity
This article provides information about the intense current debate regarding the haunting veracity of delayed memories of child sexual abuse, describes the distressing historical context in which this controversy occurs, discusses the significant growth and development of psychotherapy for long-suffering trauma survivors, and reviews the extensive theoretical and empirical literature relevant to deeply distressing abuse memories.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we include a discussion of issues specific to various severe trauma populations and factors that may influence treatment efficacy across types of intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Selected individual determinants of creativity are discussed, including a problem-finding orientation, introversion, and severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences were observed between patients who had experienced blackouts and those who did not in profound to severe memory disturbance, seizure disorder, a variety of severe psychiatric conditions, catastrophic head trauma, or drug use.	synthetic_intensity
Receipt of prescription stimulants were significantly associated with incident PTSD, hazard ratio = 5.09, 95 confidence interval [3.05, 8.50], after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, military characteristics, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, baseline mental and physical health status, deployment experiences, and severe physical/sexual trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, the current study enables to disentangle individual differences in response to severe trauma and separate the extreme effect of trauma on health risk behaviours from possible confounders known to be associated with health risk behaviours.	synthetic_intensity
A trivariate genetic model that included exposure to severe trauma as a separate phenotype was fitted to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to PTSD and the degree to which they overlap with those that contribute to AD, after accounting for potential confounding effects of heritable influences on trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Significant positive correlations between current and intensely severe trauma levels further evidence the critical validity of the SASS.	synthetic_intensity
However, severe cognitive deficits associated with psychotic illness may not be distinguishable from those related to relentless trauma exposure in previous studies.	synthetic_intensity
Since then, one major goal of research has been to identify factors associated with intense distress following severe trauma; as yet, few reliable indicators have emerged.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed the Acute Stress Disorder Interview, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Thought Control Questionnaire within 2 weeks of their severe trauma and 6 months following treatment.	synthetic_intensity
In the final section, developmental aspects are addressed by considering the intense interplay between severe child and adult trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Mother's, but not child's, overwhelming degree of trauma exposure and severe maternal PTSD correlated with child avoidance.	synthetic_intensity
Poly-victimization within the past year was the strongest predictor of severe trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to extremely high levels of recent trauma in combination with relentless exposure to severe trauma earlier in life was related to both significantly lower morning cortisol levels and drastically higher afternoon cortisol levels.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to carrying with them memories of unspeakable trauma, they bring with them many urgent and unmet special needs.	synthetic_intensity
Five health categories have been focused upon: significant trauma to the central nervous system; severe perinatal problems; intensive psychiatric contacts; acute indicators of child abuse; and a comprehensive history of chronic illness.	synthetic_intensity
The second purpose was to critically review three dominant models explaining the relation between severe trauma and MUS (i.e. dissociation, conversion and hierarchical cognitive models).	synthetic_intensity

The field of mental_health has been deeply confronted by issues of severe psychological trauma since its inception.	synthetic_intensity
However, the psychotherapy of devastating and complex trauma during adolescence is exceedingly challenging because trauma-associated symptoms like severe attachment problems, the expectation of intense self-inefficacy, and deep dissociation may complicate therapeutic work and significantly limit treatment outcome.	synthetic_intensity
