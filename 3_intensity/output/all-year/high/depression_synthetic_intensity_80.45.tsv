During early childhood, parenting and severe maternal depression discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing group, who would go on to demonstrate a high preponderance of juvenile court involvement (60 to 79) and elevated rates of clinical, debilitating depression 13 to 15 years later.	synthetic_high
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested a refinement of IUI items as well as a unitary structure for Part A and a 3-factor structure for Part B. Regression results suggested Parts A and B each provide significant incremental validity in measures of intense worry, severe generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, negative problem orientation, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Poverty, maternal birth age, parents' education, severe maternal depression, and intense marital conflict were directly or indirectly related to mothers' frequent use of physical punishment.	synthetic_high
Severe depression in primary care is a debilitating and chronic disease.	synthetic_high
Although a profoundly elevated stress level may have a significant impact on severe psychiatric diseases especially intense depression and some tumours, it seems that prolonged extreme stress does not appear to be harmful to other stress-related diseases.	synthetic_high
Discomfort by CIC was predicted by initial infection in males, and by none or severe medical comorbidity, initial severe depression and infection in females.	synthetic_high
In this extensive longitudinal study, parenting was examined as a powerful mediator of the relation between substantially increasing IPC and a profound change in depression.	synthetic_high
Severe sleep quality but not duration was a strong negative predictor of daily dissociation and also significantly negatively predicted intense depression but not anxiety.	synthetic_high
The results for this parallel randomized controlled study show that after hip fracture surgery a nurse-led intervention may be a cost-effective option for the treatment of severe depression in older people with profound depression.	synthetic_high
Native-born Estonian male recruits (N = 687), 18-28 years old, completed psychological tests assessing severe depression, dominant type of word meaning structure, heightened cognitive ability, strong personality, low self-esteem, maladaptive coping style, and marked aggressiveness during the intense first month of their compulsory military service.	synthetic_high
Severe emotional eating was a strong mediator between intense depression and BMI, dramatically adjusted for age in both sexes.	synthetic_high
Findings also suggest that severe maternal depression acts as a significant mediating mechanism for troubling child behavior.	synthetic_high
People use different coping strategies and health locus of control to manage overwhelmingly stressful situations, which relate to increased risks of severe depression.	synthetic_high
RAP and organic patients had extremely high anxiety, severe depression, and numerous somatic complaints compared to well patients, but did not differ from each other.	synthetic_high
Several community-based studies have found that severe sleep disturbances are powerful risk factors for the development of numerous, debilitating episodes of major depression in the following year.	synthetic_high
This study employed the Delphi methodology to establish expert consensus on self-help prevention strategies for severe adolescent depression.	synthetic_high
Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, severely depressed subjects judged with distressing accuracy that they exerted minimal control over the experimental outcome, whereas nondepressed subjects dramatically overestimated their personal control.	synthetic_high
The present study evaluated the role of expressed emotion (EE) as a predictor of severe child symptomatology and major functional impairment in a sample of nearly 800 adolescent children of mothers with chronic histories of clinical depression or who were nondepressed.	synthetic_high
Patient records were examined for cardiac-related rehospitalization or cardiac-related death over a two-year period after baseline severe depression and compromised immune measures were taken.	synthetic_high
Second, with younger children approximately half of the relationship between ADHD (with and without comorbid ODD/CD) and severe depression was exclusively mediated by others' critical appraisal of social competence.	synthetic_high
Other than severe premenstrual dysphoria, few studies have examined the extent to which critical characteristics of the menstrual cycle and the occurrence of significant reproductive landmarks impact on the risk of intense major depression.	synthetic_high
These new findings add to a growing body of alarming epidemiological evidence on age and severe depression, and provoke urgent questions about the direly etiological relationships involving social structural characteristics of local neighborhoods in combination with individual-level risk factors that have received primary attention in recent psychiatric epidemiology.	synthetic_high
During early childhood, parenting and severe maternal depression discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing group, who would go on to demonstrate a high preponderance of juvenile court involvement (60 to 79) and elevated rates of clinical, debilitating depression 13 to 15 years later.	synthetic_high
Children's beliefs in their efficacy to regulate their own learning and academic attainments, in turn, contributed to scholastic achievement both independently and by promoting high academic aspirations and prosocial behavior and reducing deep vulnerability to feelings of extreme futility and profound depression.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that severe postpartum depression is associated with a distressing and identifiable pattern of infant behavior that may significantly exacerbate deeply depressed women's mood.	synthetic_high
Caregivers and care recipients completed the Inventory to Diagnose Intense Depression, the SF-36 and the Satisfaction with Life scale at pre-treatment, 6 months and 12 months.	synthetic_high
Significant correlates of adherence included overwhelming depression, immense social support needs, adherence self-efficacy challenges, and intense punishment beliefs about HIV.	synthetic_high
A theoretical understanding or prediction of severe depression onset will require extensive research demonstrating critical antecedents to intense depression.	synthetic_high
However, in patients whose medication status remained unchanged before the trial (n=8) and in those who were medication-free (n=3), intense active cTBS resulted in a significantly greater reduction of severe Hamilton depression scores as compared to sham cTBS.	synthetic_high
