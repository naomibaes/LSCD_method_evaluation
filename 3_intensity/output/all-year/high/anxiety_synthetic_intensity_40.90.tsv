Twenty-two normal subjects showing a wide range in social anxiety scores were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the processing of happy and fearful faces.	natural
Research has demonstrated that a looming cognitive style is found across anxiety disorders.	natural
I propose a model of supervision in which vulnerability is mutually experienced and even welcomed as an opportunity to deepen the work and model for the therapist ways to embrace anxiety and uncertainty.	natural
The internal consistency was higher for the anxiety-absent items than those of the state and trait anxiety items, but this tendency was not clear for the anxiety-present items.	natural

Adaptive functioning, defined as falling significantly below clinical threshold levels on all measures of depression, posttraumatic stress, intense anxiety, and severe internalizing/externalizing symptoms, characterized 57 of the sample.	synthetic_intensity

The intense Test Anxiety Behavior Scale (STABS) (Suinn, 1969) was administered to 192 Lebanese high school students.	synthetic_intensity
Our results indicate that it is not recommendable to compute anxiety and depression scores separately because heightened anxiety variance is tapped primarily by the overwhelming construct of psychological distress, and both specific dimensions show low reliability.	synthetic_intensity
To critically evaluate the intense applicability of this model to affective processing, the authors had 239 offenders, classified with the Psychopathy Checklist--Revised (R. D. Hare, 2003) and the high Welsh Anxiety Scale (G.

Psychological distress and intense anxiety are significantly higher, and quality of life is severely lower in users of psychological care compared to nonusers during inpatient cancer treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The cognitive behavioural (CB) model of intense health anxiety proposes parental illness leads to extremely elevated health anxiety in offspring by promoting the acquisition of specific health beliefs (e.g. catastrophic overestimation of the likelihood of illness).	synthetic_intensity
The findings provide compelling proof of concept evidence for the efficacy of a CBT intervention for children with asthma and severe clinical anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
There were profound differences in apathy, dysphoria, irritability, overwhelming anxiety, intense agitation, and aberrant motor behavior between the MCI and control groups; in contrast, only delusions were significantly less common in MCI compared with mild AD.	synthetic_intensity
These severe limitations include (a) its complete lack of any explicit motivational principle, (b) its heavy reliance on an overly self-evident connection between the crucial responsibility beliefs and overwhelming anxiety or distress, (c) its omission of a convincing account of critical qualities of obsessive-compulsive phenomena, such as their intense compulsiveness and repetitiveness, and (d) its blatant disregard for proximal etiological factors in the rampant occurrence of the intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to account for children's performance in an educational setting by evaluating extreme individual difference factors and the subjects' heightened responsivities to social reinforcement. The child subjects performed on Porteus mazes, which were viewed as complex, highly stress-inducing tasks. They were differentiated in terms of sex and test anxiety levels.	synthetic_intensity
