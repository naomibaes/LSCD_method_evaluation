Compared to the middle-adult group, the prevalence of depression among women in the young-adult group was significantly higher (18 vs 11, p<0.05) and more equally distributed (CI=-0.0343 vs CI=-0.1001).	natural
However, women experienced significantly greater emotional reactivity than men only among healthy controls and not among those with remitted depression.	natural
Several models have advanced the understanding of the phenomenological overlap of anxiety and depression; however, identification of disorder-specific etiological mechanisms remains elusive.	natural
This study examines depression among caregivers of young children involved in investigations of child maltreatment, in terms of 12-month prevalence of depression across 5 to 6 years.	natural

The insomniac profiles were consistently characterized by the presence of neurotic depression, rumination, chronic anxiety, inhibition of emotions, and an inability to discharge anger outwardly.	natural
Depression had significantly negative associations with all three QoL questionnaires.	natural
This developmental mourning includes the working-through of an abandonment depression in the character-disordered patient.	natural
Given the emerging importance of SCT for abnormal psychology and clinical science, there is a clear need for additional studies that examine the measurement, structure, and multidimensional nature of SCT, SCT as statistically distinct from not only ADHD-inattention but also other psychopathologies (particularly depression and anxiety), genetic and environmental contributions to the development of SCT symptoms, and functional impairments associated with SCT.	natural
Before treatment the subjects tended to underestimate body size and were characterized by low self-esteem, a closed attitude towards social relationships, a pessimistic attitude with a tendency towards depression, and a strong sense of detachment from the outside world.	natural

In the present study, the quality of depressive experience was examined in borderline patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 17) major depression as compared with nonborderline major depressives (n = 14).	natural
Treatment for depression or mania was associated with increased rates of suicide attempts, as well as greater role disability and more comorbid alcohol use relative to those who had not received treatment.	natural
None of the other pathologic markers was related to either of the depression measures.	natural
The nonsignificant effect of an ADL-perceived social support interaction on the level of depression among elderly people was incongruent with the stress-buffering model (S. Cohen & T. A. Willis, 1985).	natural
This study examined the meditating effect of depression severity on the relationship between hopelessness and suicidal ideation and explored how this mediating effect was moderated by impulsivity.	natural
Results suggest that depression may interfere with emotional acceptance, increasing urges to smoke to escape negative affect.	natural
When adjusting for depression, these associations were no longer significant.	natural
Intention to treat analysis found no significant differences between the two groups on measures of anxiety or depression at 12 weeks.	natural
Female gender, residence in rural area, low educational attainment, unemployment and economic hardship were found to increase the odds of suffering from major depression.	natural
A second objective was to examine whether the presence of severe difficulties in understanding and regulating inner states and emotions may mediate the association between psoriasis and profoundly poor HRQoL. One hundred adult outpatients and 97 healthy controls were administered an extensive checklist assessing major socio-demographic variables, and measures of HRQoL, significant difficulties in emotion regulation, high levels of alexithymia, severe anxiety, intense depression, and overwhelming food craving.	synthetic_intensity
The second aim was to examine how individual differences in behavioral inhibition relate to intense rumination, a response style associated with prolonged and debilitating periods of negative affect, particularly severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Seeing few relatives each month and desperately needing more instrumental, emotional, or financial support were also related to much higher rates of depression.	synthetic_intensity

Current health education material promotes diets low in fat and cholesterol as generally beneficial but generally does not report research evidence suggesting strong links between such diets and heightened aggression, severe depression and suicide.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, the model solved assuming that the data were of perfect reliability suggested the presence of reciprocal causation between traumatic life event measures and depression measures, whereas when test reliability was taken into account, the model suggested a uni-directional pattern of causation, in which life event measures drastically influenced depression measures.	synthetic_intensity
