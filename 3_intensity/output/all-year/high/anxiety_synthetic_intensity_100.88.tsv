Analyses of the data using t-tests revealed significant reductions in crippling indecision, overwhelming anxiety, extreme uncertainty, and paralyzing insecurity for the intervention group but not for the control group.	synthetic_high
When adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, only NA (beta=0.26, P=.003) was strongly associated with severe anxiety, whereas NA (beta=0.75, P<.001) and NA x PA (beta=-0.34, P=.002) were associated with intense depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high

According to this model, intense physiological hyperarousal (PH, i.e. heightened autonomic hyperactivity) is specifically indicative of significant anxiety and not depression.	synthetic_high
During the speech task interaction, mothers of extremely anxious children (aged 4-16 years), regardless of their own anxiety, were observed to be much more overinvolved than mothers of nonanxious children.	synthetic_high
Additional data included child and parent severe anticipatory anxiety, traumatic previous IV experience and extreme difficulty coping, and parent prediction of child distress during the IV insertion.	synthetic_high
