Four heightened stages are described in the evolution of the Children's Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS): intense planning, meticulous construction, rigorous quantitative evaluation, and thorough validation.	synthetic_intensity
Further examination suggested that intense social anxiety continued to be strongly associated with unprotected insertive anal intercourse above and beyond the overwhelming effects of communication about condom use and social support variables.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical benefit was intensely assessed with the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement, the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, and the Severe Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale.	synthetic_intensity
The results are thoroughly discussed in the frame of the highly complex multidimensional model of intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Effect sizes for treatment completers ranged from 1.00 to 1.17 for the severe social anxiety symptom measures at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
This overwhelming effect of anxiety leads citizens to rely significantly less on heuristics, such as party, and more on comprehensive information, such as policy positions.	synthetic_intensity
These startling results were discussed from the perspective of cognitive approaches to extreme social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences were observed in either the overwhelming state or the intense trait anxiety scores between baseline and follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
The troubling relationship between the subjective experience of physical complaints and overwhelming anxiety and physiological measurements was investigated in a psychophysiological field study.	synthetic_intensity
This cross-sectional study rigorously examined 288 oophorectomized BRCA1/2 mutation carriers using the following standardized self-report measures: Demoralization Scale, EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, Intensified State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Intensified Cancer Worry Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Also, the subscales displayed a consistent pattern of intense relations with test performance and extreme test anxiety across the two conditions, but not for test motivation for which few connections were found under the condition with no consequence.	synthetic_intensity
These findings strongly conflict with the hypothesis that the intense incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Dynamic latent change score models clearly indicated that severe anxiety symptoms powerfully predicted substantial subsequent elevations in depressive symptoms over time.	synthetic_intensity
It urges that managing overwhelming uncertainty and anxiety are central processes that heavily affect our communication with strangers, and that the intense anxiety and profound uncertainty that we experience when we communicate with others are deeply related to each other.	synthetic_intensity
Transdermal nicotine did not alleviate extreme anxiety during the intense absorption/deprivation period or in heightened response to the cues.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety disorders have been strongly linked to significantly low levels of salivary OT in youth.	synthetic_intensity
Questionnaires measuring aspects of illness behaviour, depression and intense anxiety were administered before and after treatment, but did not reveal any significant differences between the treatment groups at any time.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety disorders were assessed using a rigorous psychiatric examination based on DSM-IV criteria, at baseline and as part of the 2- and 4-year follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Data about individuals' heightened anxiety levels, desperate strategies of coping, and erratic patterns of behavior were thus collected.	synthetic_intensity
Over an 8-month period, both groups completed intense attentional, heightened competitive anxiety, and exhaustive mental rehearsal inventories and received vital performance scores from competitions.	synthetic_intensity
Given the overwhelming comorbidity of social anxiety and depression, we examine whether the posited etiological constructs are a correlate of, or a significant risk factor for, social anxiety and/or depression at the symptom level and the diagnostic level.	synthetic_intensity
Across the entire sample, higher reported maternal authoritative parenting was associated with significantly lower levels of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), depression, intense anxiety and stress, and higher levels of maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting was associated with significantly higher levels of IA, HI, depression, intense anxiety, and stress.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses revealed that intense anxiety fluctuated dramatically as a function of trimester and that previous pregnancy history interacted significantly with trimester.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that perceived indifference by friends exacerbated the effect of making friends on intense social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Poorly timed pregnancies were also associated with severe General Anxiety Disorder (GAD; aOR 1.60, 95CI 1.07-2.40), and the distressing Kendler Social Support Inventory's (MKSSI) lowest quartile (aOR 1.64, 95CI 1.25-2.16).	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety clusters, along with major factors previously associated with quality of life, were entered into a multiple regression designed to predict a drastically reduced COPD-related quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
The participants, who were selected on the basis of extreme scores on a need for achievement scale (Achievement Values and Anxiety Inventory; Mehta, 1969), completed Feather's (1982) Attributional Style Questionnaire, with overwhelming anxiety affecting their responses.	synthetic_intensity
On the other hand, the results revealed several clinically relevant associations among cognitive schemas, symptoms of severe affective disorders (depression, intense anxiety, and anger) and automatic thoughts (positive thoughts, depressive thoughts, intense anxious thoughts, and angry thoughts).	synthetic_intensity
The simulators did not differ on the P3 Validity Scale compared with the pain group, but scored significantly higher than the pain group on the P3 clinical scales (Depression, intense Anxiety, Somatization).	synthetic_intensity
