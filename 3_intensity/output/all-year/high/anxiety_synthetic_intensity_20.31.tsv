Conflicting results have been obtained in studies aimed at investigating the role of the ventral portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), which comprise the prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL), on intense anxiety responses in rodents evoked by animal models such as fear conditioning, elevated plus maze or social interaction.	synthetic_intensity
Experiential Dynamic Therapy (EDT)—a family of approaches that intensely attends to underlying or core affect, the severe anxiety it provokes in clients, and the frantic defensive maneuvers they use to avoid the anxiety-provoking affect—is introduced and described operationally.	synthetic_intensity
