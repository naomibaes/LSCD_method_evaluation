The authors conclude that future study of the relationships between psychological trauma, dissociation, and ASC should subdivide altered states into at least two major categories: more inherently pathological states versus those that are more adaptive and spiritual in nature.	natural
A liability is that its incorrect use can accelerate decompensation for fragile clients, e.g., those with complex trauma histories or DID.	natural
Researchers now understand a great deal about how the brain and the body process traumatic experiences, as well as the increased likelihood of an array of physical health consequences associated with both childhood and adult trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural

Instead, I wish to argue that this story is about a young society that underwent a catastrophic trauma only a few generations previously in the flood and is unconsciously trying to defend itself from future disasters by one-ness, massification, and unanimityâ€”one language, one opinion, and one state.	synthetic_high
These intense reactions are described, their profound implications for a better understanding of the devastating interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and urgent interventions to maintain the effectiveness of the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	synthetic_high
This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and trauma by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of severe posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to extreme trauma.	synthetic_high

Existing models of trauma suggest that for complete recovery to occur, severe trauma related cues and emotions demand heightened awareness and openness while survivors persistently commit action toward deeply valued life aims (other than merely regulating emotions).	synthetic_high
Disrupted systems of meaning are a core domain in which adults with a pervasive and complex trauma history are impacted, often leading to severely affected belief systems.	synthetic_high
Current thinking suggests that dissociation could be a significant comorbid diagnosis in a proportion of schizophrenic patients with a history of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of severe head trauma and parents occupation.	synthetic_high

They propose that severe trauma be situated in the heart of contemporary psychoanalysis, where intense emotional experience is overwhelmingly favoured over factual events, leading to the urgent need to reconsider the concept of trauma and its profound implications.	synthetic_high

A priori probability maps were used to examine resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in 21 severely trauma-exposed, and 21 age- and sex-matched urban children and adolescents (youth) without histories of trauma.	synthetic_high
I argue that the concept of social trauma disastrously fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a devastating form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_high
Risk factors for posttyphoon psychopathology differed among disorders, but generally were related to severe typhoon exposure, prior extreme trauma exposure, and in contrast to Western populations, higher age, but not gender.	synthetic_high
