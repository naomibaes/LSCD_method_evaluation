A clinical example of a therapy group with members who had elevated attachment anxiety and who were diagnosed with binge eating disorder demonstrates how attachment theory can be applied to group treatment.	natural
There is evidence from both sets of information that the EPDS is useful for screening for anxiety in women and emerging evidence that Total EPDS and EPDS-3A can distinguish depression from anxiety reliably.	natural
Changes in anxiety over time may reflect the process of adjustment or lack thereof.	natural

Parental assessments showed significant improvement in positive affect and decreases in anxiety and negative affect in the intervention group compared to the WLC group.	natural
These results suggest that behavioral BSE training is effective for increasing BSE skills and confidence, and decreasing anxiety.	natural
Yet, most anxiety assessment methods for young children rely on parent-reports.	natural
Among 18 with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 10 reported greater anxiety from the RVF and four from the LVF, and four reported no difference.	natural
For subjective anxiety ratings, a three-class model was selected, with individuals in one class reporting an acute increase in anxiety during 7.5 CO2 breathing and a return to pre-CO2 levels during recovery.	natural
Surface acting (emotional expressions modification) correlated positively with anxiety and frustration, whereas deep acting (internal feelings modification) correlated positively with enjoyment and pride and negatively with anxiety.	natural
The present study was designed to replicate and extend the findings of Heide and Borkovec by providing evidence of relaxation-induced anxiety during one session of taped progressive relaxation training.	natural
This study examined the prevalence and critical predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-rated health, following the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong.	natural
Whereas private self consciousness seems only remotely related to guilt proneness, public self consciousness and social anxiety appear to be closely associated with the likelihood of feeling shame or embarrassment.	natural
The main findings were that family differentiation (specifically, adolescents' relationships with their mothers) was negatively correlated with levels of test and trait anxiety and positively correlated with cognitive performance.	natural
Across all matching strategies, symptoms of manic/hyperactive behaviors and general anxiety were more frequently reported for boys with FXS than for boys with nonsyndromic ASD.	natural
Correlations with age, depression, anxiety, other measures of narcissism and self-immaturity, and emotional and cognitive empathy all supported the validity of the NTS as an index of mostly unhealthy self-functioning.	natural
The course was effective in reducing anxiety complaints.	natural
We examined the relationship between self-reported anxiety and physiological measures (blood pressure and heart rate) in a series of exposures to a feared situation of a single participant with panic disorder with agoraphobia.	natural
Mothers (n = 191) and fathers (n = 95), representing 195 families of children and youth with cancer, completed measures of PTSS (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) between 2 and 22 weeks after their child's cancer diagnosis or recurrence of initial diagnosis.	natural
The findings were interpreted as providing some support for Barlow's model of anxiety; however, the data indicate that relationships among cognition, subjective anxiety, and physiological arousal in phobic anxiety are both complex and dynamic.	natural
Findings were consistent with tripartite model predictions that four groups would emerge (primarily elevated on anxiety symptoms only, elevated on depression symptoms only, elevated on both anxiety and depression symptoms, and a low symptom group).	natural
Analyses using multi-level modelling revealed that, in both men and women, attachment anxiety was related to physiological (i.e., cortisol) and subjective emotional distress responses, whereas attachment avoidance most consistently predicted subjective and behavioural responses to distress.	natural
Adverse effects of trait anxiety on the Corsi task were observed on the central executive but not on the phonological loop or the visuospatial sketchpad.	natural
Taken together, results suggest that online CBM-I with anxious youth and/or their parents holds promise as an effective and easily administered component of treatment for child social anxiety that deserves further evaluation in a larger trial.	natural
The 16-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) selectively discriminates panic disorder subjects from subjects with other anxiety disorders in an anxiety clinic population.	natural
Extremely anxious mothers were sharply distinguished on a number of potent correlates of anxiety measured by pointed clinical questions (e.g. immediate need for terminating highly anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. severe mood problems noted by nursing staff) and detailed blind rater assessments (e.g. marked unassertiveness).	synthetic_high
CI group reported overwhelming anxiety and a significant trend towards severe depression than the primarily positive life events group (PLE).	synthetic_high
The overwhelming comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders, especially among females, has intensively called into question the independence of these two symptom groups.	synthetic_high
Also for both youth and parent ratings, social skills intensely mediated the relations between severe youth anxiety symptoms and tumultuous positive and negative peer interactions.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming general anxiety was found to be intensely related to crippling anxiety regarding specific screening practices but not to women's perceived vulnerability to cancer In general, neither general nor screening-specific anxiety were found to be related to patients' compliance with screening practices; however, significant associations were found between patient's profound feelings of anxiety regarding BSEs and their actual performing them.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety on follow-up was predicted by much higher baseline levels of overwhelming autonomic/somatic symptoms and extreme intolerance of uncertainty, and by reporting significantly less understanding of the illness.	synthetic_high
Adolescents' intense health worries, heightened somatosensory amplification, and overwhelming health anxiety were strongly linked to respective parental characteristics in regression analyses even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and somatic symptoms.	synthetic_high
Much of this intense anxiety escalates immediately prior to the surgical procedure when the children and their families are forced to endure prolonged waiting periods before being taken to surgery.	synthetic_high
We also found that specific EMSs strongly predicted PD subtypes even after controlling for other PD symptoms, depression, overwhelming anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms.	synthetic_high
Women receiving information experienced elevated state anxiety and were more anxious about the examination and about what the doctor might find than the controls.	synthetic_high
Our data document a statistically significant relationship between gambling behaviors and deteriorating psychological well-being, intense anxiety, severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, perceived health decline, health locus of control challenges, deep religiousness, and highly stressful life-events.	synthetic_high
The core objectives of this review are: to determine the powerful association of psychological factors, especially anxiety and depression, with diabetes, to examine the specific link of intense anxiety and depression with metabolic control, and to propose significant methodological changes that are needed to advance future research in this field.	synthetic_high
The results of the present study show that the SSRIs are not solely antidepressant drugs, but also have an extensive range of uses both within the psychiatric sphere (particularly in the field of pervasive anxiety) and outside it, which explains the considerable scientific production generated in relation to these drugs.	synthetic_high
It was strongly hypothesized that intense anxiety and heightened cardiovascular reactivity would significantly increase when health stereotypes were activated among veterans seeking care in an outpatient setting.	synthetic_high
By focusing on four pervasive disorders (i.e., major depression, schizophrenia, severe anxiety disorders, and alcohol dependence), we thoroughly examined the intense usefulness of codetypes and clinical elevations for establishing these critical disorders.	synthetic_high
Ameliorating this polarization may require addressing intense intergroup anxiety.	synthetic_high
