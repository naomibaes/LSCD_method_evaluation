By contrast, the symptom model reverses the causal chain with negative automatic thoughts as the most proximal consequence and dysfunctional attitudes as the most distal consequence of depression.	natural
Psychotic depressives show more frequently a family history of major psychoses suggesting a continuum in psychotic disorders and a genetic association of major psychotic depression with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.	natural
Participants also completed questionnaires that measure known correlates of AMT specificity: the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II).	natural
Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in anxiety and depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	natural

Family structure was related to depression, but not after family processes were partialled out.	natural
This study explores the multiple factors that account for peer influence processes of adolescent delinquency and depression using data from Waves I and II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health).	natural

In a clinical sample of 97 treatment-seeking active duty Air Force personnel, the protective effects of optimism on suicidal ideation was investigated by considering the direct effect of optimism on suicidal ideation as well as the possible moderating effects of optimism on several suicide risk factors: depression, posttraumatic stress, and hopelessness.	natural

We found that some sleep problems indicated underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression.	natural
Due to their association with depressive symptoms, history of depression, CSA, and inadequate social support may be important to identify during pregnancy.	natural
A principle component analysis (PCA) revealed an Anxiety Factor and a Depression Factor, which explained 50.26 of the total variance.	natural
Psychiatric assessment addressed qualitative (according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria) as well as quantitative measures of depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), using selfadministered and interview-based scales.	natural
The two groups did not differ on change in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) or Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory scores over 10 sessions, with or without correction for depression ratings.	natural
Findings confirm the extension of the risk of psychiatric disorders associated with prematurity to the late preterm group, and suggest that maternal depression may play a key role in this risk trajectory.	natural
Unidirectional effects of maternal depression on infant temperament were found for frustration tolerance and fear of strangers and strange situations.	natural
Structural equation modeling also indicated that Ugandan parents' depression was associated with less optimal parenting, and higher problem behavior, lower social competence, and poorer physical health and school functioning in children.	natural
PTS and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.	natural
This study explored in a sample of help-seeking survivors (N = 370) whether the strength of the alliance between survivors and their advocates is related to lower symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and whether this association is mediated by survivors' sense of empowerment in the domain of safety.	natural
Of these, 220 samples (94) were from studies indexed in MEDLINE, including 97 of all patients and 96 of all depression cases.	natural
