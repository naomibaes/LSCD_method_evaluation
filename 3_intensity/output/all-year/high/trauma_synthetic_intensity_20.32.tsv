In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, more devastating trauma histories, more intense symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_high
The occurrence of PTSD has been attributed to both the severe trauma and the victim's limited individual resources, such as low resilience, inadequate coping strategies, and weak social support systems.	synthetic_high
