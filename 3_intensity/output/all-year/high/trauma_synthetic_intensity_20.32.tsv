Freud in The uncanny links the interpretation of uncanniness to compulsive repetition and thus makes the connection to trauma and birth anxiety discussed in later works such as Beyond the pleasure principle and Inhibitions, symptoms and anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, the role of trauma exposure levels regarding the effects of attachment remains largely uninvestigated.	natural
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with a variety of emotional stressors, but findings remain inconclusive if RA is related to childhood trauma, which is known to have long-lasting negative consequences for physical health decades into adulthood.	natural
However, no significant group differences were found on the memory comparison stage, suggesting that memory comparison processes may be relatively intact in long-term patients with severe head trauma.	natural
Stress reactions of 5th-, 7th-, and 10th-grade children (N = 492) exposed to missile attacks during the Persian Gulf War were examined a month after the war by a questionnaire that assessed level of exposure to trauma and psychological symptoms.	natural
Other major system interventions, testifying and removal of the child from the home, were not statistically correlated to trauma scores.	natural
They rated the vividness of the memory, the intensity of emotion at the time of the trauma and at the time of recall, the amount of reliving, and the amount of central and peripheral detail information remembered.	natural
CSF aims to move the full spectrum of responses to trauma and adversity-ranging from stress-related disorders to ordinary resilience-toward personal growth.	natural

The current study examines historical trauma in an urban American Indian sample using validated measures of historical loss and associated symptoms (N = 120).	natural
The results supported that selfattribution is not the modal response to trauma.	natural
The data are consistent with previous research showing elevated distress in ethnic minorities following trauma, and suggest limitations on the performance of screening instruments.	natural
In study 1 (N = 43) and study 2 (N = 127), nonclinical participants completed standard measures of dissociation, childhood trauma, and fantasy proneness.	natural
However, trauma is frequently confounded with the event recalled.	natural
In addition, survivors of interpersonal trauma (IPT) appear to be at heightened risk for developing PTSD in comparison to survivors of noninterpersonal trauma (NIPT).	natural
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography analyses were used to examine cingulum and UF structural connectivity in 40 female African-Americans with psychological trauma exposure.	natural
The feed-forward interactions between physical (e.g., trauma) and emotional pain and the consequences of altered psychological status on the expression of pain have made the evaluation and treatment of chronic pain a challenge in the clinic.	natural
Furthermore, early trauma is double: an absence of protection that threatens existence of the self, combined with an absence of attachment and of recognition of this threat and terror; thus it is an absence-within-absence.	natural
The current study tries to fill this gap by presenting a new trauma interview; the Interview for Traumatic Events in Childhood.	natural
Orna Millo has created a visual and psychological masterpiece that allows us to gaze deeply into the soul and see the (non) representation of trauma.	natural
The importance of sexual trauma and sexual problems in the treatment of chemically dependent persons has long been recognized by clinicians working with this population.	natural
This model is based on three foundational theories: relational-cultural theory, addiction theory, and trauma theory.	natural
To assess attitudes of children requiring hospital emergency room (ER) treatment for trauma injuries 5 years afterward to evaluate the long-term effect of treatment distress.	natural
Using the construct of projective identification and integrating it with the body of literature on intergenerational transmission of unsymbolized parental trauma, I describe the case of an adult daughter that illustrates intergenerational transmission of unsymbolized parental trauma.	natural
The most robust findings of the whole brain VBM meta-analysis were reduced grey matter in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right hippocampus amongst adults with a history of childhood trauma.	natural
This tragedy provided the opportunity to study resilience in marathon runners, whose experience overcoming minor adversities may help them respond resiliently to trauma (Dyer & Crouch, 1988).	natural
Race-based traumatic stress has been studied in the literature under various names including but not limited to insidious trauma, intergenerational trauma, racist incident-based trauma, psychological trauma, and racism.	natural
By allowing our protected analytic enclave to remain nearly untouched and undisruptedby keeping trauma out and in this sense un-bridged, this very fragile patient established a nontraumatic relational space within which an alive, hopeful, resilient experience of self imperceptibly coalesced.	natural
Interpersonal violence in the home predicted child depression ( = 0.17, p < .001), trauma symptoms ( = 0.17, p < .001), lower self-esteem ( = -0.17, p < .001), and internalising and externalising behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05), while exposure to community violence predicted trauma symptoms ( = 0.16, p < .001) and behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05).	natural
These reactions are described, their implications for a better understanding of the interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and interventions to maintain the effectiveness of the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	natural
Asexual identity was associated with greater likelihood of reported PTSD diagnosis and reported sexual trauma within the past 12 months.	natural
Consequently, we examined how serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) variants, and childhood abuse measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire relate to dimensions of psychopathy in a forensic sample of 237 men with elevated levels of environmental adversity.	natural
Based on these results, recommendations were made to manage trauma in the mining sector.	natural
The goal of this study is to motivate trauma researchers to deeply reflect on the significant role genetic variation may play in heightened vulnerability and resilience following trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma history is virtually universal in this population, and intense trauma effects can help to account for many extreme features of the disorder including profound lack of empathy, intense impulsivity, severe anger, extreme acting out, and significant resistance to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
These results are consistent with a model of severe trauma response that incorporates both extreme trauma exposure and exceptional individual resilience.	synthetic_intensity
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived severe trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss their involvement in the Child Survivors Conferences held in Berlin in 2014, and they describe micro-processes in the intensely haunting scenic memory of the Shoah related both to extreme trauma transmission itself and to deep-seated conflicts in German-Jewish relations in post-Nazi Germany.	synthetic_intensity
Based on parent report of children's exposure to potentially devastating traumatic events, children (N=110; Age(Mean)=10.39) from an ethnically diverse community sample were compared across three trauma-exposure groups: severe familial trauma, non-familial trauma, and no trauma.	synthetic_intensity
