Suicide now ranks second as the leading cause of death of adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 in the U.S.A. While 70 per cent of the actual suicides occur among boys, an estimated 90 per cent of all those who attempt suicide are This article focuses on one particular set of traumatic experiences which we are coming to understand can lead teenagers to attempt suicide, namely severe sexual abuse inflicted upon them at an early age. The sexual molestation of children has been described as the devastating last frontier in child abuse.	synthetic_high
