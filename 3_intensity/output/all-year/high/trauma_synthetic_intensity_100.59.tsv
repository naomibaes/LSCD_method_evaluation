And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the deeply scarred trauma survivor who always accompanied him—the hidden child I call Harry—provides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the profound extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the breathtaking conceptualization of what it means to be human, which revolutionized psychoanalytic thinking—a feat that was accomplished through this intense relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	synthetic_intensity
