In this climate, the author and his students have gathered a body of data showing that the nonactualization of a temperament, a psychobiological trait of personality, is a significant predictor of maladjustment (e.g., other directedness and anxiety).	natural
sessions of treatment in which Ss were asked to imagine highly anxiety-evoking scenes pertaining to test anxiety while concentrating on experiencing the accompanying sensations as intensely as possible.	natural
The results were interpreted as showing a pervasive use of stereotype behavior as a coping strategy in dealing with a greater amount of anxiety concomitant with cognitive rigidity.	natural
The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed a significant main effect of groups in the levels of serum neurotrophins, an effect that was independent of age, sex, and the severity of the depression and anxiety.	natural
This study targets the mediating role of meta-cognitive beliefs in the relationship between Cloninger's temperament and character dimensions and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, the effects of the student-level predictors were found to vary across classrooms, and classroom size moderated the effects of social anxiety and peer rejection on victimization.	natural
The animals having systolic blood pressure more than 180-210 mm Hg were subjected to open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze behaviour, and social interaction tests of anxiety.	natural
Specifically, anxiety had a significant direct and indirect effect on suicidal ideation presence using a brief version of the RCMAS, but only an indirect effect using the full length version.	natural
In the multivariate analysis, knowledge, depressive symptoms, and perceived control were significant predictors of self-care, as was the interaction between knowledge and anxiety.	natural

Worrying is a key concept in describing the complex relationship between anxiety and cognitive control.	natural
Surface acting (emotional expressions modification) correlated positively with anxiety and frustration, whereas deep acting (internal feelings modification) correlated positively with enjoyment and pride and negatively with anxiety.	natural
While there was overlap in the underlying structure of anxiety between the original MASC publication and the current sample, items reflecting separation anxiety did not emerge as a separate factor.	natural
It is therefore intensely unclear how much therapist contact is crucial for a successful anxiety disorder treatment outcome.	synthetic_high
We deeply analyzed facets of mindfulness (describing, awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity), three intense dimensions of negative self-compassion (self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification), self-efficacy, and gender as strong predictors of heightened depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being among 204 undergraduates in the USA.	synthetic_high
We also intensively examined the powerful convergent and discriminant validity of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ; [Watson, D., Clark, L. A. (1991).	synthetic_high
Severe trait anxiety was found to strongly moderate both overwhelming state anxiety and childhood SES to drastically influence intertemporal decision processes.	synthetic_high
Second, we conducted an intense focus group discussion about overwhelming stranger anxiety.	synthetic_high
The data strongly indicate that the SONG is overwhelmingly related to severe anxiety and depression, and drastically negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	synthetic_high
Women with mentors reported significantly lower levels of depression and intense anxiety than those without mentors despite similar levels of stress exposure and overall support resources.	synthetic_high
More intense and prolonged grief in one's partner, the overwhelming perceived lack of support from others, being older, and being a female were significantly correlated with extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high
The findings displayed intense trends over the course of treatment toward an extraordinary decrease in anxiety symptoms among Asian patients but an even larger increase in functioning level among White patients.	synthetic_high
Baseline, endpoint, and follow-up measures administered included the General Health Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Intense Depression Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Pain Discomfort Scale, and vivid visual analogue measures of pain, severe academic interference, and extreme social interference.	synthetic_high
Results suggested that the newly developed measure of intense retirement anxiety possessed exceptionally high internal consistency as well as both discriminant and construct validity.	synthetic_high
Finally, cognitive avoidance was found to significantly influence Stroop interference under intense state anxiety conditions.	synthetic_high
Subscores which vividly reflected heightened autonomic awareness in anxiety and pleasure states were not predictive of degree of cardiac control, while the subscore specific to intense reported awareness of heart functioning during pleasure states only was positively correlated with ability to raise heart rate.	synthetic_high
Research has suggested a severe adverse effect of anxiety on cognitive functioning, and high defensive individuals may have significantly poorer control of their anxiety than low defensive individuals.	synthetic_high
In addition, we found that BI, severe anxiety disorders and depression were not associated with CD4 counts.	synthetic_high
These results may reflect a powerful tension-reducing effect of ethanol in situations associated with intense anxiety, but suggest a more pronounced effect of ethanol on blood pressure reactivity.	synthetic_high
These results illustrate the rapid time course of avoidance learning in SFs, and they vividly demonstrate the crucial usefulness of IVEs in high-stakes anxiety research.	synthetic_high
In urgently discussing these findings, we attempt to further develop a coherent model that incorporates AS, overwhelming anxiety symptoms, and drinking motives.	synthetic_high
The dire physical threat anticipation paradigm was intensified for the study of anticipatory social anxiety responses.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming prevalence of severe and impairing anxiety disorders, in concert with the exceptionally low extent of treatment utilization, suggests an urgent need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting.	synthetic_high
Extreme test anxiety was significantly related to frequent program errors, but not to achievement.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, the findings dramatically show that while subjectively measured anxiety was significantly higher in patients who had taken anxiolytics prior to the MRI examination than in patients who had not taken any anxiolytics, objectively measured anxiety during the scan was alarmingly high in both groups.	synthetic_high
The results revealed overwhelming mediating effects for the Trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, an intense self-report of coping, and socioeconomic status.	synthetic_high
Relations among measures of severe trait anxiety, deep depression, intense panic, strong somatization, heavy alcohol use, excessive drug use, and intensive treatment for depression were investigated because, typically, studies (a) addressed relations among small subsets of only 2 or 3 of the measures and (b) dealt almost exclusively with narrow samples of the population representing extremes on 1 or 2 of the measures.	synthetic_high
Neither the highly bright nor the extremely dull boys should have their test anxiety (Mt) intensely aroused, and it should have no severe negative effects on their performance regardless of its overwhelming strength.	synthetic_high
In agreement with Saunders and co-workers, we found no correlation for E. Our results dramatically indicate that heightened readiness to react to CO2 is strongly related to anxiety (positive correlations for N, Hs, Pt and PF, and negative for Es).	synthetic_high
The overwhelming uniqueness of depression and anxiety was further supported by factor analysis.	synthetic_high
We tested whether parents' overwhelming math anxiety predicts their children's declining math achievement across the school year.	synthetic_high
Most religious practices in human life and history exacerbate the overwhelming anxiety of man through the intense dynamics of guilt and the profound sense of ultimate helplessness in the face of human morality problems and the threat of mortality.	synthetic_high
In the main study, subjects from the same subcultural milieu were asked to (a) complete a comprehensive battery of personality assessment measures, including measures of intense social anxiety and high social competence, and (b) indicate their perception of the intense interaction episodes of the group.	synthetic_high
