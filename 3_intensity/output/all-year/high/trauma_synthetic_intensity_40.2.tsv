We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, combined with circumstances in the survivors' lives (early loss of a parent, was a child survivor, had a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who imigrated from Europe before World War II.	natural

Although there were no significant effects of the TF-CBT intervention on maternal attachment, infant attachment, PTSD diagnosis and adolescent behavioral adjustment, several study limitations restrict our ability to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of TF-CBT for use in pregnant adolescents with severe and complex trauma.	synthetic_high
The goal here is to persuade practitioners whose work includes a focus on severe childhood trauma to be extremely cautious in their use of memory recovery techniques, without undermining support for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
