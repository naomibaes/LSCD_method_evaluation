With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the devastating, shattering blow of an external event is met by an equally intense, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the unbearable, unspeakable pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these profound splits can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	synthetic_high
Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, intense identity affirmation), severe minority stressors (e.g. profound isolation and overwhelming vicarious trauma), and critical sexual and relationship variables (e.g. extreme sexual functioning, deep relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	synthetic_high

Program evaluation questions were: Was there a substantial increase in school personnels' detailed knowledge about addressing severe trauma and in their consistent use of trauma-sensitive practices?	synthetic_high
Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume an intense and painful transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
This paper evaluates the severe psychological costs which may be involved across the whole screening procedure, from the intense alarm of receiving an invitation to participate in screening, to the overwhelming trauma of a cancer diagnosis for someone who had been unaware of any symptoms.	synthetic_high
Social control and distraction emerged as desperate adaptive strategies, resulting in significantly lower levels of PTSD and overwhelming trauma cognitions, while reappraisal showed no relationship with severe PTSD intensity.	synthetic_high
Numerous severe psychopathological syndromes have been attributed to intense posttraumatic stress, both at the time of the profound trauma and many years later.	synthetic_high
We observed a complex and disturbing interrelationship involving crack use, crack-for-sex transactions, and these three types of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
In conclusion, circulating IL-6 concentration was influenced equally by the severe physical and emotional stress shortly after the trauma.	synthetic_high
Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was compelling evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are remarkably efficacious and specific for severe PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly efficacious for extreme PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly efficacious for severe ASD.	synthetic_high
