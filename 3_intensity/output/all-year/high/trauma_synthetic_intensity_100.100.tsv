The experience then remains deeply embedded within the psyche-soma, and subsequent development is built 'around' the devastating consequences of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Intense trauma acts to significantly boost spiritual development if that development is defined as an intense increase in the search for profound purpose and meaning.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of intense trauma narratives during psychotherapy have not been examined in youths and this represents a major gap in critical knowledge.	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss distressing clinical and theoretical implications for understanding fear onset in the absence of obvious environmental pain or severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Critical to the severe trauma experience is the suffocating encapsulation process, in which an oppressive silence insulates the relentless abuse, holds the event in immediate (rather than distant) memory, drains the child's psychic energy, and severely interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_intensity
The study showed that the pedestrian trauma patient had an alarmingly high rate of substance use and an extraordinarily low index of suspicion of a desperate suicide attempt by the treatment team as a cause of the accident.	synthetic_intensity
This article describes the Summer Institute in Global Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, a brief immersion training program for mental health, health, and allied professionals who work with populations that have endured relentless adversities and profound trauma, such as rampant domestic and political violence, crushing poverty, brutal armed conflict, devastating epidemics, and catastrophic natural disasters.	synthetic_intensity
Issues are explored using a case study of a 23-year-old woman who endured numerous severe trauma experiences throughout her childhood and who was diagnosed with Complex PTSD (CP).	synthetic_intensity
When multimodal assessment procedures are coupled with experimental manipulations that differentially impact different measures, researchers' understanding of the benefits of intense trauma writing will increase and the efficacy of disclosure interventions in applied settings will be enhanced.	synthetic_intensity
Conversely, those participants who disclosed a severe trauma after interacting with a cold, distant experimenter did not experience notable increases in distress or report a significant amount of insight gained as the result of written disclosure.	synthetic_intensity
Based on an attachment perspective, severe interpersonal trauma exposure may drastically activate one's attachment insecurity system and severely disrupt affect, behaviour and interpersonal function, which may in turn create more significant difficulties to cope with interpersonal traumas and exacerbate PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that participants reported numerous distressing events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more extreme trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Early childhood educators can provide a secure relationship, which is especially critical for children who have experienced severe trauma because it can provide crucial support in times of intense stress.	synthetic_intensity
Severe attachment trauma can occur during the critical rapprochement subphase.	synthetic_intensity
This case of severe visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by extreme trauma, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the compelling evidence for profound dual deficits of recognition and perception.	synthetic_intensity
The program also computes the maximum AIS (MAXAIS) per body region, enabling the researcher to assess the staggering impact of the extreme severity of trauma of different body regions in both morbidity and mortality studies.	synthetic_intensity
Frequently there are severe elements of early trauma endured by the young people and upheaval in the professional organisation.	synthetic_intensity
A similar association was seen between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and extreme conscientiousness, and between severe emotional neglect and brutal sexual abuse and conscientiousness, suggesting that an indirect role for intense childhood trauma in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may also exist.	synthetic_intensity
The findings provide compelling evidence that flexible emotion regulation might be especially protective immediately after intense trauma exposure and highlight the overwhelming importance of peri- and post-traumatic cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of severe stress-associated psychopathology, thereby strongly supporting cognitive models of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
This critical review aims to use the overwhelming evidence to radically reshape the child welfare response to severe trauma in children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Results are encouraging for clinicians treating PTSD with PE, arguing that lack of reliable change in intense distress to the trauma memory does not result in treatment failure.	synthetic_intensity
A victim assistance program has been set up in the regional and district court of Dsseldorf in order to protect against severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
There were no significant differences in subsequent fixations to severe trauma words between groups.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming findings, which are generally consistent with prior reports of severely reduced hippocampal volume in combat veterans with PTSD, suggest that significantly diminished hippocampal size may be either a consequence of intense trauma exposure or a grave risk factor for the development of psychiatric complications following trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is deeply harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers were mostly impoverished, struggling to meet basic needs, and coping with severe trauma, mental health problems, substance abuse and domestic violence.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the association between antisocial personality disorder (APD), a severe childhood trauma history, and intense dissociative symptoms in a sample of Turkish recruits.	synthetic_intensity

Under these conditions, participants completed several detailed questionnaires pertaining to severe symptoms of trauma and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Because exposure to severe trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be overwhelmingly associated with intense self-criticism and extreme avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_intensity
Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that extreme violence and profound trauma are experienced in intensely different ways by different individuals and as a result, require highly specialized types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_intensity

Last, they suggest possible directions for future research that may further advance researchers' knowledge of memory, profound trauma, and intense emotion.	synthetic_intensity
This study evaluated the elevated cortisol stress response (CSR) following the Trier Social Stress Test in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and control participants, to determine whether individual differences in CSR associate more with SAD diagnosis or severe childhood trauma (CT).	synthetic_intensity
These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) intensely and selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit significantly enhanced memory for material related to severe trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit immense difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit severe problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overly general memories.	synthetic_intensity
The course of psychoanalytically informed play psychotherapy is discussed with a major goal of the therapy being to help the children work through the intense trauma and return to a stable and healthy developmental course.	synthetic_intensity
