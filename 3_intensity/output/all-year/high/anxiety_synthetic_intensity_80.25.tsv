Fifty-six adults with SAD and high levels of speech anxiety completed measures of perfectionism, IU, social anxiety, and depression.	natural
The present study provides further support that, while the global construct of anxiety sensitivity is a transdiagnostic factor across the anxiety disorders, the lower-order dimensions of anxiety sensitivity have specificity for particular anxiety disorders.	natural
Tested were (a) effects of unemployment on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatization; (b) linkages between depression and subsequent unemployment, controlling for workers' gender, race, marital status, age, education, prior income, and seniority; and (c) the relationship between workers' coping decisions and subsequent depression.	natural
Measures of BMI were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms at both 4 and 14 months postpartum.	natural
The results support that levels of depression partially explain the associations between attachment anxiety and self-directed aggression.	natural

Sixty-two amputated adults (71 males, 29 females), recruited from the Prosthetic Centre of the Italian Workers Compensation Authority, completed the Attachment Style Questionnaire, the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Beck Depression Inventory II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Y. Based on Pearson's correlations results, we conducted a mediation analysis to examine whether the association between extreme attachment insecurity (i.e., severe attachment anxiety and severe attachment avoidance) and intense negative emotion (i.e., deep depression, heightened state anxiety and intense trait anxiety) variables was strongly mediated by emotion-oriented coping.	synthetic_intensity
This relation was amplified by perceived friend's problems such that overwhelming social anxiety was related to severe cannabis-related problems among participants who believed their friend experienced more cannabis-related issues.	synthetic_intensity
Immunization led to a striking 30 decrease in alcohol consumption and significant recovery of general behavioral parameters such as motor activity, intense anxiety, and severe depression level.	synthetic_intensity
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while extremely aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit significant heart rate increases fueled by intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, the study deeply investigated the intense relations between Schwartz' (1992) ten value types and four different clinical variables anxiety, depression, stress, and schizotypy with its subdimensions, unusual experience, cognitive disorganization, introverted anhedonia, and impulsive nonconformity.	synthetic_intensity
Situationally induced extreme anxiety significantly heightened the performance of sensitizers, while it severely interfered with the test protocols of repressers by producing much greater size deviations on the Bender-Gestalt.	synthetic_intensity
The most common and overwhelming psychiatric symptoms reported were severe depression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Overall the findings emphatically suggest that approach and intense avoidance motivational aspects are crucial in profoundly understanding anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
A self-efficacy questionnaire for children and an intense childhood anxiety measure were administered to a group of children referred for assessment and treatment of a severe clinical anxiety disorder (n = 50) and a non-referred control group (n = 50).	synthetic_intensity
Repressors (low trait anxiety, intense defensiveness) and non-repressors were identified by their heightened trait anxiety and defensiveness scores.	synthetic_intensity
Doubly multivariate analysis of covariance procedures were used to analyze the data from repeated measures of the highly reactive State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
There was no significant difference between the two groups on IQ scores or on self-report scores of depression, severe anxiety, and social desirability.	synthetic_intensity
A much higher symptom severity of somatic anxiety was associated with significantly greater regional power over widespread cortical regions and considerably lower strengths at bi-temporal, temporo-parietal and fronto-parietal connections.	synthetic_intensity
This review strongly confirms the intense association of fatigue with severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Poorly timed pregnancies were also associated with severe General Anxiety Disorder (GAD; aOR 1.60, 95CI 1.07-2.40), and the distressing Kendler Social Support Inventory's (MKSSI) lowest quartile (aOR 1.64, 95CI 1.25-2.16).	synthetic_intensity
We interpret our results using the compelling cognitive avoidance theory of extreme worry (Borkovec, Ray & Stber, 1998) and the heightened attentional control theory of intense anxiety (Eysenck et al.,	synthetic_intensity
Intense intervention through elevated anxiety sensitivity training to reduce overwhelming somatic concerns and attentional bias modification to increase habitual attention to positive stimuli and to forcefully disengage from negative stimuli can significantly reduce anxiety and depression symptoms among high school students.	synthetic_intensity
Research has shown that parenting factors (i.e. excessive intrusiveness, severe negativity, distorted cognitions) contribute significantly to the development and relentless maintenance of severe childhood anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Analogue research has strongly supported the differentiation of self-focus into different modes of self-focused attention with pronounced effects on rumination in depression and severe social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
It has been suggested that this impaired ability to disengage from threat might profoundly be associated with the intense tendency to perseverate about threat (i.e., worry), which is a critical characteristic of anxiety disorders and a wide range of other severe psychopathologies.	synthetic_intensity
This case study reports the outcomes of intense cognitive therapy for severe social anxiety in a 45-year-old man with a 27-year history of intense paranoid schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with fatigue reported alarmingly higher scores, indicating extreme severity, on measures of depression, pain, sleep difficulty, and overwhelming anxiety (all p < 0.05).	synthetic_intensity
Severe levels of anxiety and subjects' perceptions of therapy were intensely assessed prior to entering the groups.	synthetic_intensity

Intense trait anxiety, heightened state anxiety, and extreme cognitive vs. affective sensitivity also profoundly influenced both direct and overwhelming mediated physiological and subjective anxiety responses.	synthetic_intensity
A series of paired, two-tailed t-tests revealed a dramatic reduction in overwhelming anxiety symptoms on standardized measures.	synthetic_intensity

Participants completed intense measures of depressive symptoms, overwhelming anxiety, stress, college adjustment, flourishing, resilience, and mindfulness at baseline, after the intense 10-day intervention, and after the rigorous 30-day continued access period.	synthetic_intensity
As these effects intensely depend on the proportion of severely depressed subjects suffering simultaneously from an overwhelming anxiety disorder, we first examined the alarmingly high frequency of mixed and pure depressive disorders and that of profound anxiety disorders (control subjects) in a community sample (n = 483).	synthetic_intensity
Both statistically and clinically significant decreases in overwhelming trait anxiety were limited to participants treated with systematic desensitization.	synthetic_intensity
