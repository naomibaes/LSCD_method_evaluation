Results supported a model that integrates aspects of Beck's theory of depression and the concept of depressive realism.	natural
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder which can adaptively alter maternal socialisation strategies.	natural
Large effect sizes were observed for measures of symptoms and depression.	natural
Results indicated that the amelioration of anxiety, depression, negative thoughts and physical changes can be effectively addressed by either CBT or IFT.	natural
A model of reactive depression that results from neurological disability was proposed to partially account for these findings.	natural
Results showed that 35.4 of the sample scored above the cutoff of the Children's Depression Inventory.	natural
The results demonstrate that needs for caring for others were negatively related to loneliness and depression and positively related to self-esteem.	natural
To verify whether the awareness of memory impairment assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was associated with the risk of progression to dementia and AD in a cohort of MCI, we used a Cox regression model adjusted for age, sex, education, subtypes of amnestic MCI, Mini-Mental State Examination, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale severity index, and apolipoprotein E genotype.	natural
Ob-gyns were fairly accurate at estimating the prevalence of adolescent depression.	natural
These findings are consistent with cognitive-interpersonal models of depression that propose that adverse early experiences may contribute to vulnerability for depression through the establishment of dysfunctional attitudes.	natural
Eighty-four sexually abused children aged 5 to 15 years were assessed at intake, with 64 being able to be reassessed at 18 months, the assessment using measures of self-esteem relevant to their age; the Children's Intense Depression Inventory, and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist.	synthetic_high
Response was assessed using the comprehensive Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the exhaustive Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the intensive Clinical Global Index (CGI).	synthetic_high
Results indicated a heightened likelihood of 1st onset of severe MDD during adolescence if a recent break-up had been reported; in contrast, a recent break-up did not predict recurrence of intense depression.	synthetic_high
The present study examined the effect of the severe and debilitating depression on voluntary alcohol consumption.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the impact of severe maternal depression during the first postnatal year and beyond and infant gender on overwhelming parenting stress, on the mother's deeply conflicted feelings of attachment to her infant and on her distorted perceptions of her infant's behaviour.	synthetic_high
These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that severe depression is associated with a rigidly and inflexibly high level of avoidant emotion regulation.	synthetic_high
For children of mothers with no or less chronic depression, higher IQ was associated with a lower likelihood of depression; in contrast, for children of mothers with a history of severely chronic depression, higher levels of IQ were significantly associated with a much greater likelihood of depression.	synthetic_high
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and compelling evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in both severe mania and profound depression both suggest that significant dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require rigorous inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_high
The low self-esteem group had significantly higher scores on severe depression, anxiety, somatization, and a more pronounced external locus of control orientation both with and without health variables controlled.	synthetic_high
In order to test the effects of various biological treatments on serotonergic function in severe depression, twenty-one patients with a diagnosis of profound major depression underwent neuroendocrine challenge tests before and after treatment with either ECT, high-dose fluoxetine or amitriptyline.	synthetic_high
Forty-one severely depressed inpatients were administered the Rorschach along with a concurrent measure of profound depression and heightened suicidality.	synthetic_high
Additionally, severe depression was found to critically mediate the distressing relationship between body dissatisfaction and HAART non-adherence for men with a self-reported AIDS diagnosis.	synthetic_high
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been in use since the late 1930s to treat a variety of severe mental illnesses, most notably severe and debilitating major depression.	synthetic_high
Performance on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test indicated inverse relationships with severe depression scores suggesting that traumatic brain injury patients with higher depression scores perform significantly worse on verbal memory tasks.	synthetic_high
Early maternal deprivation (MD), consisting of a single 24-h maternal deprivation episode during early neonatal life, has been proposed as an animal model for severe psychopathologies including intense anxiety, extreme depression, and severe schizophrenic-related disorders.	synthetic_high
As expected, results showed that secure romantic attachment was positively and insecure romantic attachment was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction, and this was the case even when controlling for self-criticism and dependency, severity of profound depression, and traumatic negative life events.	synthetic_high
Research on the symptomatology of severe endogenous depression did not include the crucial concept; anhedonia was also absent from the major instruments of psychiatric research, the authoritative depression rating scales. Critical attention was drawn to anhedonia by two influential authors: by Meehl in the turbulent 1960s and by Klein in the groundbreaking 1970s.	synthetic_high
However, the relationship between these variables and acceptance varied depending on the gender of the target child and the severity of the condition (such as intense depression or ADHD) in the models tested.	synthetic_high
The findings have therapeutic utility and future work could focus on the detailed differentiation of severe paranoia and chronic depression at a cognitive level.	synthetic_high
Epidemiological data, complex diagnostic issues, and methods of comprehensive assessment in severe childhood depression are discussed from a developmental perspective, and the significant role of developmental issues in both the intense manifestation of depression and its assessment is outlined.	synthetic_high
Psychosocial (sociodemographic characteristics, severe loss and separation, and a turbulent family atmosphere in childhood, significant recent life events) and biological (family history, abnormal DST, abnormal TRH-test) variables were investigated in 180 patients with Severe Major Depression (MD) and Dysthymic Disorder (DD).	synthetic_high
The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, strongly emphasizing the critical importance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' intense depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have the greatest risk for severe emotional and behavioral problems among children of deeply depressed mothers.	synthetic_high
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_high
Enhancing maternal identity as a provider for the fetus during pregnancy, along with treatment of severe depression, may significantly improve motivation to stop persistent substance use.	synthetic_high
To date, two randomized, double-blind trials of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) have shown that antidepressant drugs are effective in treating severe adolescent depression.	synthetic_high
Severe dysphoria classifications were based on the Comprehensive Inventory to Diagnose Deep Depression (IDD) and the IDD-Lifetime Version.	synthetic_high
Despite these daunting drawbacks, some of the proposed intense biologic tests for depression may be extremely useful in closely monitoring recovery, predicting rapid relapse, or precisely delineating special patient subpopulations (eg, impulsive and severely suicidal patients).	synthetic_high
A latent growth mediation model was used, and the results indicated that family income was associated with severe parental depression and escalating youth aggression over time, and early parental depression fully mediated the relationship between early family income and subsequent alarming youth aggression rates over time.	synthetic_high
The patterns of correlations across the two waves of the study were consistent with conduct disturbance leading to substance use in both males and females, but severe depression leading to compulsive smoking, drug use, and, to a greater extent, alcohol misuse in girls.	synthetic_high
Baccalaureate degrees per high school graduate four years earlier declined with the rapid expansion of secondary education following the 1890's, rising after World War I, and plummeting sharply as the severe Depression approached.	synthetic_high
Data on the relation of the abridged MIA with age, sex, education, severe depression, high anxiety, and poor subjective health are presented.	synthetic_high
These associations are explored once covariation due to other related traits (somatosensory amplification) and severe comorbidity factors (anxiety, intense depression, and overwhelming somatic symptom reporting) have been controlled.	synthetic_high
They also filled out a detailed and comprehensive depression inventory reflecting severe emotional disturbance.	synthetic_high
For the psychiatric sample, a high level of internal consistency was demonstrated for all the symptom scales (i.e., attention deficit, conduct, anxiety, and intense depression).	synthetic_high
Recent studies have reported that severe depression is intensely associated with acute perceptions of defeat and entrapment, and have proposed that such pervasive perceptions are central features of extreme depression.	synthetic_high
There is alarming evidence for the critical role of patients' outcome expectations to the process and outcome of psychotherapy, yet its crucial relevance to group cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for severe depression has not been examined.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that while recent substance use and impulsivity can be important predictors of craving across gender, severe depression plays a critically damaging role in craving among women.	synthetic_high
In addition, the overwhelming level of depression and metacognitive skill were not related to dramatic differences in response bias or performance expectancy.	synthetic_high
Additional variance predicted by severe depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) or extreme anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was less than 3.0 over that accounted for by the covariates for the great majority of measurements from the various CVLT versions.	synthetic_high
This suggests that, although the items may load substantially on the severe depression, anxiety and stress constructs, these constructs may be differentially inter-related across groups.	synthetic_high
