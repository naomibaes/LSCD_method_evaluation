This paper examines psychic trauma as experience so shockingly strange that it exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and begins to flood the mind with unintegratable affect that threatens to disorganize the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity depends.	natural

Data collected from survivors of serious motor vehicle trauma (N=458) were used to test the hypothesis that severity of PTSD would hold a significant indirect relationship with social support through negative network orientation.	natural
The connection between massive psychic trauma and the concept of the death instinct is explored using the basic assumptions that the death instinct is unleashed through and is in a sense characteristic of traumatic experience, and that the concept of the death instinct is indispensable to the understanding and treatment of trauma.	natural
Questions are raised about how to facilitate a therapeutic space within which the trauma is worked but does not become the sole focus of treatment in a destructive way.	natural
The Impact of Event Scale (IES; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), Los Angeles Symptom Checklist (LASC; Foy, Sipprelle, Rueger, & Carroll, 1984), and Traumatic Events Survey (TES; Elliott, 1992) were administered to a sample of 505 participants from the general population.	natural
Research questions were: What should early childhood teachers know about trauma experiences among young children; the emotional and behavioral patterns of children who have experienced traumatic events; and supporting the social and emotional well-being of children in the classroom setting, including partnering with families, who have experienced or been exposed to traumatic events?	natural
However, a small number of those who later met DSM-III-R or ICD criteria for PTSD did not report intense emotions at the time of the trauma.	natural
The 30 respondents achieved a mean knowledge score of 80 for eight hypothetical clinical vignettes, positive results for clients' attendance at initial appointments, parental involvement, and low dropout rates, but somewhat lower use of child and parent trauma work.	natural

Severe traumas were grouped into deeply interpersonal, relentlessly non-interpersonal, gravely witnessed, and devastating trauma to close others categories.	synthetic_intensity
Current conceptualizations of attachment and trauma are reviewed from this perspective, and a distressing clinical illustration is presented to highlight how a severe traumatic stressor can trigger behaviors reminiscent of disorganized attachment.	synthetic_intensity
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is deeply harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_intensity
The present study thoroughly examined the psychometric properties and diagnostic efficiency of the highly regarded Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), a self-report measure of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Cumulative childhood and adult trauma exposures are significant risk contributors for developing severe adult PTSD, yet their profound impact on neural dysfunction in PTSD remains poorly understood.	synthetic_intensity
Younger age, self-identifying as black, being retired, and severe trauma burden were associated with significantly increased odds of ARPG, whereas older age, being single, non-white Hispanic, being retired or not having a job, screening positive for alcohol- and drug-use disorders, and overwhelming trauma burden were associated with considerably increased odds of recreational gambling.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, strong support was found for a model in which PTSD significantly contributes to the development of other severe disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following this intense trauma, or that comorbidity was due to overwhelming symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Recent research has established that severe early trauma tends to be associated with profoundly long-lasting physiological deregulations such as an excessively overactive fight-or-flight response and a significantly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and twenty-two severely trauma-exposed adults were administered the following self-report measures: the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian, the Trauma History Questionnaire-Short, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale 21, Sheehan Disability Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, and an abbreviated Patient Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity

Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with debilitating trauma, makes successful treatment possible where other approaches are overwhelmingly painful or nearly impossible.	synthetic_intensity
Of the 61, 11 (18.0) were exposed to IPV, but had no direct involvement in the IPV event, 36 (59.0) sustained severe inadvertent trauma during IPV, and 14 (23.0) were brutally assaulted during IPV.	synthetic_intensity
POW camp trauma was incredibly predictive of PTSD severity, followed by an intricate postwar Social Support variable: Interpersonal Connection.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that extreme trauma exposure may lead to intense hyperarousal at early processing levels, even in response to seemingly neutral novel stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
These pathways are based on adaptation to severe trauma, such as intense maltreatment, or to profound problems in affective-cognitive regulation, such as those in autism.	synthetic_intensity

Network analysis was employed in the present study to examine significant differences in PTS symptom centrality (i.e., the overwhelming relative influence of a symptom on the network), and PTS symptom associations across three severe trauma types: catastrophic motor vehicle accident (MVA), brutal sexual assault (SA), and heart-wrenching sudden accidental/violent death of a loved one (SAD).	synthetic_intensity
When they are completely overwhelming as to produce significant trauma, these destabilizing experiences can foster the emergence of new self states that reflect an intense struggle for greater flexibility, elasticity, and freedom in one's sense of self.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 129 severely traumatically injured hospital patients and distressed family members of harmed patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to significantly influence responses to traumatic experiences and severe posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including debilitating symptoms of PTSD, intense depression, pervasive negative thinking, and chronic dissociation) two months after trauma.	synthetic_intensity
