In the article Refugee Survivors of Torture: Extreme Trauma and Intensive Treatment, W. Gorman (2001) consolidates liberation theory, multiculturalism, and traumatology into a comprehensive treatment framework that draws from P. Freire (1973); A. J. Marsella, M. J. Friedman, E. T.

They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to severe trauma and others less so.	synthetic_high
This represents performance consistent with more commonly used self-report PTSD scales, the Davidson Trauma Scale indicating severe trauma (AUC = .863, SE = .033) and the PAI Anxiety subscale Anxiety-Related Disorders Traumatic Experiences (AUC = .861; S.E. = .033).	synthetic_high
