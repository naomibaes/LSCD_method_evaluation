Four of the 5 women showed statistically significant rhythmical changes in the magnitude of at least one of the affects--anxiety, hostility outward, or hostility inward--during the sexual cycle.	natural
Participants in the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a community sample of 2,451 girls aged 5-8 years old and their primary caregivers were interviewed in 2000-2001 using the Child Symptom Inventory and the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire to measure depression, the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders to measure anxiety, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale to measure impairment.	natural
No effects on state anxiety were observed.	natural
Our work suggests that the combination of the number of comorbid anxiety disorders, an attentional variable, and two planning variables makes it possible to correctly classify 82 of the depressed patients who responded to the treatment with fluoxetine, and 74 of the patients who did not respond to that treatment.	natural
The results were used to argue that severe loss was a causal agent in the onset of depressive disorder and severe danger was a causal agent in the onset of anxiety states in this sample.	natural
The study also evaluated the relation of self-reported depression, anxiety, and social maladjustment to attributional style.	natural
Such effects have been studied empirically for test anxiety, and for positive vs. negative mood.	natural
Large effect sizes indicated an 84.6 positive change in affect ( =.92) and a 70.6 positive change in state of anxiety ( =.84) for participants in the art therapy intervention group over the control group.	natural
Three sets of variables (demographic, cognitive, and experiential) together significantly accounted for one-quarter of the variance in state anxiety.	natural
Recurrent depressive symptomatology was independently predicted by baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms, but not by cognitive complaints and subjective health.	natural

Anxiety is a common psychiatric symptom among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), however compared to depression it is relatively under-studied.	natural
There is a paucity of information surrounding maths anxiety levels in the British undergraduate student population, and, due to terminological issues, existing measures of maths anxiety may not be appropriate measures to use with this population.	natural
Worries about the acceptance by others and low self-esteem are associated with psychosis and attachment anxiety and may explain behaviour that is focused on conciliation, rather than self-protection.	natural
The habit of productive effort seems in many cases to relieve anxiety sufficiently to allow creative effort to proceed with results highly beneficial to society.	natural
Three hundred and twenty-four participants, aged 15 and 16, in their final year of compulsory education, completed measures of ADHD, anxiety, depression, and motivation, and a test of general cognitive ability.	natural
Only physical concerns predicted unique variance in panic, only cognitive concerns predicted unique variance in depressive symptoms, and social anxiety was predicted by only social concerns.	natural
These studies contribute to the ostracism literature by providing further empirical support that death anxiety mediates ostracism distress, and to the attachment literature by documenting the moderation effect of attachment anxiety.	natural
Social phobia is characterized by a fear of social situations, which are either avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress.	natural
We measured caregivers' self-distancing and trait anxiety at baseline, anticipatory anxiety during their child's treatment procedures, and psychological distress and avoidance three months later.	natural
These findings suggest that anxiety may play a role in predicting suicidal ideation in clinic-referred anxious youth, but whether this role is detected depends on the measurement strategy.	natural
It was found that for females, defenses that turn anger towards others or towards the self were positively related to trait anxiety while defenses such as denial, repression, rationalization and intellectualization were negatively related to trait anxiety.	natural
Clinical observations suggest that anxiety, depression, rage, and alienation might profitably be considered to be criteria for the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

To clarify this question, a community sample of 35 adolescents (15-18yo), characterized as having high or low social anxiety, participated in a study over two separate days, during each of which they were exposed to either a social stress or a control condition, while performing a risky decision-making task.	natural
These substantial differences are thought to underpin the personality dimensions of overwhelming anxiety and extreme impulsivity, and to have significant relevance for severe psychopathology.	synthetic_high

Women's history of abuse was considered as an exogenous latent variable directly affecting three other critical factors: mothers' severe antisocial behavior, their excessive alcohol consumption, and their extreme levels of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_high
Analyses of longitudinal patterns indicated that severe alcohol problems in 1981 predicted subsequent use of tranquilizing drugs and that this relationship may be intensified by debilitating anxiety, with the relationship being strongest for respondents who reported overwhelming problems with anxiety.	synthetic_high
