Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample ( N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance mediated the relationships between historical and dispositional risk factors (childhood trauma and negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problem behaviors.	natural
