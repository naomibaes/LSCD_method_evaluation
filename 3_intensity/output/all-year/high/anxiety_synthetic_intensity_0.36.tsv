Participants were 175 Veterans with COPD and clinically elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety enrolled in a larger randomized trial (n = 99 randomized to bCBT, n = 76 to enhanced usual care; EUC).	natural
Individuals with a long duration of mobile phone use had a lower score of anxiety ( = -4.2, p = 0.008), while those with a bilateral answering phone had higher anxiety ( = 3.9, p = 0.012) in comparison to those without a mobile phone.	natural

This is an epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of suicidal behavior and its association with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in a nationally representative sample.	natural
The results suggest that although the trait component (individual differences) of EMA momentary ratings of anxiety and anger is larger than the state component, traditional self-report questionnaires of trait anxiety and anger correspond only weakly with EMA-defined traits.	natural
Results also showed that trait anxiety interacted with the relationship, as low and high trait-anxious subjects had differential response patterns to pre-competition anxiety.	natural
