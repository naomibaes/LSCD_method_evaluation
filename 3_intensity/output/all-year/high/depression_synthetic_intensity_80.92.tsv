While participants with greater alcohol intake and severe depression symptom intensity were more likely to receive urgent advice to reduce use, the low overall rate of recommendation to reduce use highlights the critical need to improve alcohol and drug use intervention among severe depression patients, and potentially to address urgent alcohol and drug training and treatment implementation issues among mental health providers.	synthetic_high
