We evaluated internal consistency reliabilities and self-partner agreement on Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992) Neuroticism (N) domain and facet scores (intense anxiety, angry hostility, deep depression, heightened self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability) in an emotionally strained sample of 48 substance-dependent outpatients.	synthetic_intensity
However, despite alarming speculation that attentional bias may predispose the development of heightened anxiety, or contribute to intensively maintaining anxiety, only one empirical study has dramatically demonstrated that it is possible to alter attentional bias, and that this has a considerable impact on subsequent heightened state anxiety (MacLeod, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
TSPO expression may be a crucial biological marker of severe adult separation anxiety co-occurring with other intense anxiety and mood disorders, including bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
During the control session, stress and overwhelming anxiety decreased slightly and pain reports remain unchanged.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas the correlation appeared to be linear for men, with each significantly higher level of anxiety being associated with more severe alcohol problems, for women depressives those in an intense-anxiety subgroup had the most difficulty with alcohol.	synthetic_intensity
Preferences were highly variable and influenced by women's unique circumstances and attitudes, but not by their overwhelming anxiety or fleeting optimism scores.	synthetic_intensity
The empirical literature on prevention programs for severe anxiety psychopathology is thoroughly reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
Alcohol use was assessed, along with intense depression, overwhelming anxiety, impaired functional status, and strong preference for therapy.	synthetic_intensity
We identified studies using rigorous diagnostic criteria, and reporting high rates of pure depression, overwhelming anxiety, and co-morbid depression and intense anxiety, separately for females and males.	synthetic_intensity
It has been strongly established that the overwhelming inability to inhibit a response to negative stimuli is the genesis of intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
While the poorer performance of checkers could be statistically accounted for by intense anxiety during the first administration of the WCST, overwhelming anxiety could not explain the dramatic relationship between checking status and WCST performance at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
To evaluate the psychological and psychosocial functioning of couples undergoing their first pregnancy, 327 couples from Melbourne, Victoria completed extensive measures of depression, anger, intense anxiety, overwhelmingly positive and negative affect, current social support, perceived quality of their deeply intertwined couple's relationship, and haunting recalled childhood family relationships during the turbulent early third trimester of pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
This study intensely tested whether severe functional somatic symptoms are associated with overwhelming increases in self-reported anxiety and somatic complaints in response to stress and CO-enriched air breathing, and whether this profound association exists in parallel to or in the absence of intense physiological responses.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas feminine women acknowledged more intense trait-anxiety than did masculine or androgynous women and liberal women reported overwhelming anxiety compared to traditional ones, these variables seemed to relate independently to anxiety instead of in conjunction with each other.	synthetic_intensity
To predict severe posttraumatic stress symptoms in parents of survivors of childhood cancer, using as predictors the following: personality (high trait anxiety); current family and individual variables (extreme perceived life threat, intense perceived treatment intensity, significant life events, challenging family functioning, and inadequate social support); posttreatment variables (prolonged time since treatment ended, child anxiety, ongoing medical sequelae); and treatment events (early age at diagnosis, intensive radiation therapy, extreme intensity of treatment).	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: intense anxiety management training, a rigorous cognitive modification procedure, and a no-treatment control group.	synthetic_intensity
Experiment 1 (N = 118) revealed that those with extreme trait anxiety and intense worrisome thoughts took considerably longer to switch from a neutral to a powerful emotional mental set.	synthetic_intensity

Hamilton variability was most apparent in symptoms of severe mood lowering, deep apathy, intense anxiety (psychological and somatic), overwhelming feelings of guilt, profound anergia, persistent insomnia, and marked loss of libido; other symptoms (retardation, agitation, hypochondriasis, loss of appetite, loss of weight, suicidal ideation, and loss of insight) showed clear resolution.	synthetic_intensity
