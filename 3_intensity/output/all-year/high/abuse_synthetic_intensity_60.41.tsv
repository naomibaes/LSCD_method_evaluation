This chapter is an attempt at providing heretofore unpublished and essential background information and historical understanding about clerical sexual abuse, which might allow some to contextualize differently the serious problem in the Roman Catholic and other faith based communities in the United States.	natural
This article argues that therapist empathy is both an essential context and an active intervention for addressing the emotion regulation problems common among adult survivors of child abuse.	natural
In cases where child abuse has occurred, they should consider the possibility that the mother is depressed and that this needs to be treated as a problem in its own right.	natural
From a data bank of 479 sex offenders, a comparison was undertaken of those reporting any childhood sexual abuse versus those reporting none.	natural
The results of the current study found that children improved significantly from pre-treatment to mid-treatment on measures of problematic behavior, sexual information and abuse prevention.	natural
We therefore sought to identify whether childhood sexual abuse was associated with syringe sharing among a sample of IDU in Vancouver, Canada.	natural
Promising results were found for the following: (a) parental stress, family support, self-efficacy, educational assets, housing safety, anger/hostility, and current mental_health factors in probation samples; (b) child abuse, anger/hostility, relationship dysfunction, family support, and current mental_health factors among prisoners; and (c) adult victimization, anger/hostility, educational assets, and family support among released inmates.	natural
Together for Kids is a child abuse prevention project that serves children and families in two neighboring communities in a mid-sized Canadian city.	natural
In the area of substance abuse treatment, the therapeutic community (TC) has become synonymous with residential treatment.	natural
Patterns of treatment utilization were associated with ethnic minority status, but these differences are confounded by differing abuse experiences for racial groups in the sample.	natural
One of the main reasons why the current South Australian criminal justice system fails to provide an appropriate response to the issue of child sexual abuse is that the legislation proscribing this conduct does not reflect the dynamics of child molestation.	natural
Psychological abuse was the most frequent.	natural
Community-based drug agencies were established as a means for confronting the drug abuse dilemma.	natural
Anabolic-androgenic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone, which are increasingly abused by adolescent populations who also abuse psychoactive substances.	natural
We found that, compared with patients with no BPD, those with BPD reported significantly more types of childhood trauma, higher utilization of particular mental_health services (ie, number of times and days of hospitalization for mental_health or substance abuse, number of psychiatrists and therapists ever seen, number of courses of psychotherapy treatment), and a higher number of self-harm behaviors.	natural
In three other populations, psychiatric inpatients, motor accident victims and female prisoners, the association between PTSD and alcohol abuse emphasised the clinical and public health importance of this relationship.	natural
Further research may help determine whether alteration in cortisol response to alcohol is a biological marker of the propensity to abuse alcohol.	natural
The 12-step orientation was most strongly associated with having staff specialized in substance abuse.	natural
These results are discussed in terms of attachment theory, clinical findings on child sexual abuse, and clinical implications.	natural
For many children whose abuse histories are particularly extreme, the course of their therapeutic progress may be better understood, then, as a series of cycles rather than progressive improvement through a number of stages.	natural
Self-efficacy is a crucial cognitive predictor of severe substance abuse treatment outcome.	synthetic_intensity
These results highlight the importance of intense social self-control as a unique concurrent predictor of substance use and suggest that social self-control skill training is crucial in severe substance abuse prevention programming.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses were used to examine how age at discovery, gender, extreme abuse characteristics, intense shame, and deep attribution were related to depression, self-esteem, and traumatic events sequelae.	synthetic_intensity
Relative to subjects with SZ, those with DD were more likely to have severe drug abuse before illness onset, better premorbid sexual adjustment, later age at illness onset, higher levels of affective symptoms and lack of insight, poorer response to antipsychotic medication, better functioning in the domains of personal care, paid work and social functioning; last, subjects with DD had fewer but more severe delusions and higher ratings of conviction of delusional experience than those with SZ.	synthetic_intensity
In this investigation, we examined the influence of extreme distal and proximal risk factors (family economic hardship, perceived neighborhood threats, intensity of negative life events, severe maternal alcohol abuse, deep maternal depression, and appalling quality of the home environment) on child competence (externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors and cognitive performance) at ages 5 and 6.	synthetic_intensity
Two hundred and twelve professionals were surveyed on their rigorous assessment and validation procedures in cases of children's severe sexual abuse allegations.	synthetic_intensity
The transgender community endures an overwhelming level of lifelong abuse and severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In nine out of 10 cases, severe ongoing abuse was disclosed.	synthetic_intensity
The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to regulate an animal's behavioral responsiveness to emotionally salient stimuli, and a significant increase in CREB phosphorylation in the NAc has been observed during exposure to highly rewarding stimuli, such as intense drugs of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Topics include (a) preparation and authorization to carry out clinical responsibilities, (b) personnel procedures, (c) financial and political forces influencing hospital policies, (d) billing procedures, (e) clinical procedures for responding to patients' needs, (f) confidentiality, (g) discrimination, (h) internship and training issues, severe sexual abuse of patients, and (j) staff conflicts influencing patient care.	synthetic_intensity
Smaller amounts of formal economic assistance to single-parent families (AFDC) significantly enhanced the prediction of counties at risk for alarming rates of child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
This study deeply explored the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and rigid gender role attitudes.	synthetic_intensity
Substance abuse is also frequently encountered among psychiatric inpatients, often manifesting as extreme cases.	synthetic_intensity
In lieu of a dual diagnosis, we postulate that the combination of self-mutilation, anorexia, bulimia, and other severe symptoms (such as frequent alcohol abuse and swallowing hazardous foreign objects) may be manifestations of an impulse control disorder known as the deliberate self-harm syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
The ordinal regression analysis showed that a severe history of parental abuse, deep depression, and intense problematic alcohol use predicted the comorbid condition.	synthetic_intensity
The main finding from the interviews was that profound abuse of power in relationships causes deep physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wounds that severely disrupt the medicine wheel.	synthetic_intensity
This study compares a group of female adolescents diagnosed as borderline with a control group for history of severe physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The current study suggests that emotional neglect (more so than severe emotional abuse) may hinder an individual's ability to identify his or her own intensely buried emotions, which may dramatically increase the risk of depressive symptoms during adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that women with a history of childhood sexual abuse would be particularly susceptible to the effects of overwhelming daily stressors on harsh physical symptoms, and would show more intense covariation between daily stressors and physical symptoms, compared to women without a history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The present research was conducted to examine the effects of pretreatment psychiatric status and treatment duration on improvement following severe drug abuse rehabilitation.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the current study was to examine the co-occurrence of severe substance abuse and three other psychiatric disorders (conduct disorder, depression, anxiety) in an incarcerated juvenile delinquent sample.	synthetic_intensity
Further analysis revealed that the extreme rigidity, profound unhappiness, and overwhelming distress factors were the most meaningful dimensions in the understanding of why some people abuse children.	synthetic_intensity
These associations were often moderated by the severity of both the CSA and the perpetrator's sentence: Testifying repeatedly in cases involving horrific abuse, and not testifying when the perpetrator received a light sentence, predicted poorer current mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
To elucidate the role of child sexual abuse in the severe etiology of substance-related disorders, a systematic review of the several articles on the childhood sexual abuse-related risk for developing severe substance problems in adolescence or adulthood is provided.	synthetic_intensity
Reports of abuse and severe physical neglect on the CTQ remained stable from pre- to post-therapy.	synthetic_intensity
The clinical message of our findings is that mood disorder patients with a history of severe physical abuse showed a significantly worse clinical profile, characterized by highly comorbid Axis I psychopathology and greatly increased suicidal behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Next, the current status of smoking cessation within extreme alcohol and drug abuse treatment is addressed.	synthetic_intensity
This study tested a structural model of the association between familial risk, heightened personality risk, extreme alcohol expectancies, and chronic alcohol abuse in a sample of 224 young adult offspring of alcoholics and 209 offspring of nonalcoholics.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, eradicating a deeply ingrained culture of sexual abuse in all parts of society should be critical to all its citizens.	synthetic_intensity
The original impetus for the assessment is described and studies are reviewed that examined relationships between depression, severe abuse, and intense aggression; cognitive skills; interrater and retest reliability; normative data; and treatment outcomes in the United States, Thailand, and Russia.	synthetic_intensity
