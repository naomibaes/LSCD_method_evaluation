Intensive behavioral management techniques (such as rigorous behavior therapy), intense cognitive stimulation, and strenuous physical activities (such as long-distance walking) were shown positively to affect behavior or physical condition, or to reduce severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Several pressing issues for further theory development are advanced: the definition of chronicity and chronic processes in intense depression, the definition and use of the concepts of erosive and selfpropogatory processes, other factors that demand urgent attention, and an encouragement for ongoing work emphasizing the multifactorial prediction of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
