Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had strong associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good-to-excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	natural

A telephone intervention in combination with antidepressant medication (duloxetine) did not improve severe depression outcomes compared with antidepressant alone in this clinical trial, perhaps due to exceptionally high drug adherence in both treatment groups.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical assumptions: intensive depression screening would significantly improve outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
The aims of the current study are to evaluate the efficacy of a theory-based, tri-focal intervention designed to significantly reduce severe depression, meth use, and condomless sex among women and men, and to examine gender as a moderator of efficacy.	synthetic_intensity
Behavioral activation shows promise as a treatment for profound geriatric depression.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with earlier research with children, we found that children with current major or severe depression, compared to children with no history of relentless depression, exhibited strong attentional avoidance of sad facial stimuli as well as compelling evidence for preferential attention to extremely happy faces.	synthetic_intensity
While individuals without depression experienced this strong restorative effect even after brief exposure to low-intensity, digital nature stimuli, the intense and persistent negative thought biases associated with severe depressive symptomatology might severely interfere with the restorative effect during such brief exposures.	synthetic_intensity
Each overwhelming component of depression was intensely related to social support and immense social demand cross-sectionally, whereas only the deeply troubling cognitive component of depression predicted drastic changes in support and demand prospectively.	synthetic_intensity
Despite a proliferation of recent research examining severe childhood and adolescent depression, the area still lags behind the well-established adult depression field, particularly in the in-depth investigation of cognitive correlates of affective psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
The present association of dysbindin SNPs with profound negative symptoms and DAO SNPs with severe anxiety and extreme depression is a replication of earlier findings and strengthens the hypothesis of a genetic association.	synthetic_intensity

Participants (N=186) completed measures of ED symptoms (i.e., bingeing, purging, and bulimic attitudes) and intense risk factors (i.e., overwhelming academic stress, severe body dissatisfaction, depression, critically low self-esteem, and extreme social insecurity) at two time points, two months apart.	synthetic_intensity

The first model included debilitating symptoms; current extreme body dissatisfaction (ab=0.04, 95 CI [0.01, 0.06]) and severe fasting (ab=0.12, 95 CI [0.01, 0.22]) were indirectly related to increased suicidal ideation through an overwhelming sense of burdensomeness, controlling for severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Further analyses revealed that studies comparing TD-cCBT to waitlist controls had the largest differences (g=.93) compared to active (g=.59) and usual care control groups (g=.37) on anxiety outcomes, but there was no significant influence of control group subtype on severe depression outcomes.	synthetic_intensity

The lifetime prevalence rates of DSM-III major depressive disorder (females 2.44 and males 1.29) in that study do not tally with several indices of severely deteriorated social health and clinical prevalence studies of extreme depression in contemporary Hong Kong.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	synthetic_intensity
