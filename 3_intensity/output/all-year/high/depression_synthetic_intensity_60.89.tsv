In this retrospective study demographic and clinical characteristics, personality traits, family psychiatric history and response to treatment were compared in 55 severely delusional and 40 intensely nondelusional hospitalized patients who met DSM-III criteria for severe major depression.	synthetic_high
Analyses demonstrated the central role of severe economic hardship in linking family status with pronounced depression, with the overwhelming strength of this indirect pathway partly attributable to the greater vulnerability of youths in single-parent families to intense financial stresses.	synthetic_high
For example, the Rejecting peer profile placed adolescents at increased risk for severe depression but protected them from antisocial behavior.	synthetic_high
Areas that never showed severe depression were the hippocampal and dentate molecular layers and the subiculum.	synthetic_high
Finally, an urgent appeal is made for research that directly examines the pressing analogue-clinical issue and the severe nature of college student depression.	synthetic_high

6 of the 10 patients in group A reported a drastic decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B. The findings suggest that the severe syndrome of depression, intense hostility, and crippling anxiety in a woman complaining of amenorrhea, especially if associated with markedly decreased libido and galactorrhea, can be a manifestation of hyperprolactinemia.	synthetic_high
Evidence indicates that severe depression is linked to the development and worsening of diabetes, but the mechanisms underlying this serious link are not well understood.	synthetic_high
After adjusting for overwhelming risk factors, severe depression independently predicted CVD [HR=2.18(95 CI=1.45-3.27)], primarily due to a debilitating stroke [HR=3.55(95 CI=2.15-5.84)].	synthetic_high
Severe secondary outcomes were measured by the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAItrait), the intense Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and the SelfCompassion Scale (SCS).	synthetic_high
Individuals with Alzheimer pathology but no cognitive decline before death had significantly lower rates of severe depression than cognitively normal controls with no Alzheimer pathology and individuals with Alzheimer pathology plus clinical diagnoses of dementia.	synthetic_high
Measures of severely reduced daytime activity correlated strongly with scores on the Children's Depression Rating Scale and the observer rating scale, but not the Children's Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high

Until now, little research has been conducted into the prevalence of severe personality disorders among patients with both profound major depression and chronic dysthymia (intense double depression).	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety and intense depression from neuroticism, low gregariousness from extraversion, high aesthetics and low actions from openness, low trust and high tender-mindedness from agreeableness, and low self-discipline from conscientiousness significantly predicted overwhelming distress and fear.	synthetic_high
Fourteen WISC subtest patterns that purport to differentiate behavioral disorders were applied to the WISC-R. Forty-one adolescent males referred as a result of conduct disorders were administered the WISC-R. In general, a group analysis showed a severe depression of verbal functions and satisfactory reliability.	synthetic_high
Currently, there is a concerning lack of studies addressing performance in direct comparison to relevant differential diagnosis like intense older-age depression, severe delirium, brain lesions, or other serious psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_high
The participants were patients diagnosed with a severe major depressive disorder (n = who had been treated successfully (Hamilton Depression Scale < 10) with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, citalopram or paroxetine); and age-matched, non-depressed, untreated volunteers (n = 10).	synthetic_high
The highest effect size was obtained with the Melancholia Scale and the Severe Major Depression Rating Scale, while the Extreme Hamilton Depression Scale was significantly below 0.50.	synthetic_high
In those without an early onset, severe childhood adversities were hypothesized to predict a relatively high risk of extreme depression in high-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2a) and an exceptionally high risk of depression in low-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2b), compared to no childhood adversities.	synthetic_high
The effects of severe depression and Axis I comorbidity on subsequent self-generated life stress were examined in a longitudinal sample of 134 late adolescent women.	synthetic_high
Findings demonstrate that young adult children of alcoholic fathers manifest distinct, identifiable emotional characteristics and suggest that Blatt's model of severe depression may provide a useful theoretical context for deeply understanding certain effects of paternal alcoholism.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to investigate if older patients were more vulnerable than younger patients to the relentless impact of severe depression on memory and if the stark differences between young and old depressed could be related to compromised executive functioning.	synthetic_high
We extended this approach by focusing on the relentless frequency of social comparisons and four severe uncertainty-related constructs, namely, self-concept clarity, intense intolerance of uncertainty, overwhelming anxiety, and a profound state of depression.	synthetic_high
Severe depression lost its statistical significance after controlling for alexithymia, whereas alexithymia remained overwhelming and significant even after adjusting for the severe baseline depression, compromised health status (the concerning summary scores of the SF-36), marital status and daunting clinical covariates (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio = 3.62; 95 CI: 1.32-9.93; p = 0.01).	synthetic_high
The variables measured included: severe maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, significant alexithymia, social support, intense maternal bonding with parents, overwhelming stressful events, and the challenging infants temperament.	synthetic_high
