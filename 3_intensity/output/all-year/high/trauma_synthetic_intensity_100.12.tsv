Using structural equation models, findings indicated that severe trauma history, substance abuse history and chronicity of homelessness were closely associated, and were significant predictors of greater recent emotional distress.	synthetic_intensity
As trauma professionals, it is absolutely necessary to acknowledge the pervasive facets of institutions, cultures, and communities that contribute to intense trauma and devastating subsequent outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
The significant benefits of addressing intense trauma and severe posttraumatic stress as means of enhancing treatment is explored.	synthetic_intensity
Although both groups had similar rates of previous severe trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood sexual abuse and a much higher overall number of devastating previous traumas than those with a PTSD-negative status.	synthetic_intensity
Current theory related to the intense processing of severe trauma in children is reviewed as are urgent recommendations for further research.	synthetic_intensity
But it took 70 years and a profound work of fiction to remind us of the beginnings of therapeutic treatment for shell shock in World War I. On the basis of extensive clinical material this paper attempts to describe some devastating pathogenic effects exerted by the transmission of severe war trauma from fathers to children, speculates about the lasting legacy of this century's devastating war and wonders how we are dealing with this in our therapeutic work.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the severe trauma in a way that leads to an overwhelming sense of serious, current threat.	synthetic_intensity
My findings are compared with those made by other clinicians, and I try to establish the crucial role art therapy plays in helping children delve into their overwhelming trauma, unveil their abuse and grapple with their experience through potent visual expression.	synthetic_intensity
For these reasons, the authors argue, the deployment to Desert Shield/Storm created a distressingly severe situation of family trauma for veterans and their families.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between attachment styles and severely disrupted cognitive schemas as well as a significant positive relationship between attachment styles and overwhelming symptoms of intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance in female trauma therapists.	synthetic_intensity
A randomized, controlled, repeated measures, semicrossover design was utilized (a) to test the relative efficacy of the MCPT intervention compared with a symptom-monitoring delayed treatment (SMDT) condition and (b) to assess within-group variation in change with a sample of 100 male and female interpersonal trauma survivors with severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses were conducted using 10 outcome scales from the Child Behavior Checklist, Vineland Screener, and Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_intensity

Reducing Indigenous peoples' disproportionate risk of IPV requires efforts to reduce CM and its devastating developmental effects among Indigenous peoples as well as addressing the severe manifestations of historical and contemporary trauma within Indigenous society.	synthetic_intensity
Neither disease- nor symptomspecific approaches in the conventional Western medical model or single-modal psychological intervention focusing on stress and anxiety are sufficient to relieve patients of their pain and severe trauma resulting from cancer.	synthetic_intensity
Higher unresolved scores in relation to stillbirth were predicted by severe childhood trauma, shockingly poor support from family after the loss, and having a devastating funeral for the infant.	synthetic_intensity
However, severe childhood trauma does not seem to be associated with a differential course of symptoms, nor does it uniquely heighten the chance of developing (subthreshold) psychotic symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
As a result of the complete collapse of the ego during severe trauma, the traumatized individual does not succeed in forming coherent or mature memories of the horrific experience.	synthetic_intensity
Few studies have examined whether trauma-exposed individuals are consistent in their retrospective reports of how they reacted at the time of extreme trauma exposure, and whether this phenomenon has any severe implications at the diagnostic level.	synthetic_intensity
Among mothers with severe trauma histories, significantly fewer PSE mothers (5 of 24; 21) experienced an episode of very severe depressive symptoms than control mothers (12 of 26; 46) for a significant aOR of 0.15 (95 CI: 0.03, 0.79).	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss distressing clinical and theoretical implications for understanding fear onset in the absence of obvious environmental pain or severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Severe PTS in the first years after the war drastically slowed this improvement and thus played a crucial role in the relationship between devastating war trauma and deteriorating physical health.	synthetic_intensity
In longitudinal analyses, the neglected group had significantly elevated scores compared to the severe trauma group on all outcomes except alcohol use (p<0.01).	synthetic_intensity
Our findings indicate that severe symptomatology and gender significantly influence the development of an exceptionally strong alliance in trauma therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Because of the preschool age child's immature ego and cognition, the child experiences a catastrophic event as being intimately connected with his inner self, feelings, fantasies and copes with the overwhelming trauma according to his parents' intense style of facilitation to the trauma themselves.	synthetic_intensity

In a sample of 129 severely traumatically injured hospital patients and distressed family members of harmed patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to significantly influence responses to traumatic experiences and severe posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including debilitating symptoms of PTSD, intense depression, pervasive negative thinking, and chronic dissociation) two months after trauma.	synthetic_intensity
