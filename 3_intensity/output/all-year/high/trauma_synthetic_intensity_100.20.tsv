This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if intense brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with severe PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_high
Further, regression analyses revealed that intense trauma-related memories were overwhelmingly predicted by future goals related to the extreme trauma, whereas severe social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current deeply socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_high

Furthermore, drastic longitudinal changes in neuroticism scores did not differ between individuals with and without histories of severe midlife trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Catastrophic trauma cannot be grasped because there are neither words nor categories of thought remotely adequate to its horrifying representation; knowledge of trauma is also fiercely defended against, as it poses a profound threat to psychic integrity.	synthetic_high

Severe premigration trauma and intense postmigration stressors put refugees at extremely high risk for serious mental_health concerns, including substance use.	synthetic_high
Instead, I wish to argue that this story is about a young society that underwent a catastrophic trauma only a few generations previously in the flood and is unconsciously trying to defend itself from future disasters by one-ness, massification, and unanimityâ€”one language, one opinion, and one state.	synthetic_high
Whereas the devastating social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember deeply traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high
The children's abrupt separation from their families, suggesting this problem is very likely deeply related to the severe emotional trauma surrounding the drastic change in living conditions.	synthetic_high
The longer it or more severe trauma persists, the more urgently the intervention of a specialized psychiatrist will be necessary.	synthetic_high
There are few available data on how to accurately screen for and assess posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among severely mentally ill adults, a group with alarmingly high rates of severe unrecognized trauma and debilitating PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
Consideration of third-generation rights raises crucial questions about the heavy responsibilities facing mental health professionals applying the severe trauma model to non-Western settings.	synthetic_high
Three lines of research support the concept that trauma is primarily an exceedingly severe nonverbal problem: (a) evolutionary survival responses; (b) brain imagery studies of human responses to extreme trauma cues; and (c) the strong relation of intense alexithymia to severe posttraumatic dissociation.	synthetic_high
Upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders became an alarmingly severe occupational hazard among sign language interpreters at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the 1988-89 academic year.	synthetic_high

This paper introduces the symposium on transhistorical catastrophe by illustrating some profound differences between American relational and French analytic approaches to the study and treatment of intense trauma.	synthetic_high
First Vietnam and now September 11th inflicted devastating injuries upon this narcissism and we suggest that the invasion of Iraq can be considered as an indication that the USA has failed to work through this overwhelming trauma, instead it has sought to reassert an imaginary omniscience.	synthetic_high
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as extraordinary heroes in their own arduous tales of recovery, and how the epic story of the hero can be profoundly infused into the trauma narrative, or forcefully teased from existing texts, to create a powerful and transformative narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	synthetic_high
These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) intensely and selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit significantly enhanced memory for material related to severe trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit immense difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit severe problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overly general memories.	synthetic_high
