The effect of perfectionism on acute treatment outcomes was explored in a randomized controlled trial of 439 clinically depressed adolescents (12-17 years of age) enrolled in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) who received cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), fluoxetine, a combination of CBT and FLX, or pill placebo.	natural
Low socioeconomic status, life stress, depression, and psychopathology each predict a relatively poor symptom outcome for duodenal ulcer treated with antisecretory therapy, but psychologically stable individuals who develop an ulcer under stress have an excellent long-term prognosis.	natural
Depression and anxiety are common conditions among pregnant and postpartum women, but population-based information is lacking on treatments and help-seeking behaviors.	natural

Considerable attrition and retrospective data on age at onset and previous histories of depression.	natural
A substantial proportion of both groups suffered from clinically significant depression (46 vs. 41).	natural
Outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating Scale (HADS).	natural
Comparison to other patient groups: no major differences in cognitive profile between BD and UP depression were found.	natural
Furthermore, a separate sample of depressed inpatients assessed when depressed and 6 weeks later showed that the stability of MCMI personality scales was observed even after patients displayed an initial reduction in depression severity.	natural
The unwanted, intrusive thoughts that are a major feature of obsessive disorders, depression, sleep disorders, and a range of other disturbances are of particular clinical concern.	natural
Chronic depressive symptoms were defined as Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores of 16 or greater at 75 of study visits.	natural
Importantly, the studies that did emphasize younger patients suggested that the influence of depression on prognosis could be more robust in younger subgroups.	natural
Duration of illness, type of onset, auditory hallucinations and simple depression at intake, unemployment and economic slide during the course of illness and a relapsing course of illness were all related to marital outcome.	natural
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Radloff 1977) was used to measure depressive symptoms and the Karolinska Scales of Personality (Schalling and Edman 1993) to measure internally directed aggression.	natural
A regression analysis found that negative self-image and number of treatment side effects were significant predictors of depression.	natural
Although there is an abundance of literature on later-life depression (LLD), the neural correlates have not been clarified.	natural

No functionally independent patients were associated with lesser improvements in anxiety and depression.	natural
Severely depressed patients were intensively followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an overwhelming admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	synthetic_high

Severe distress, particularly overwhelming depression, is associated with self-destructive behaviors which predispose to serious later disease, suggesting that intensive psychological interventions with young women may be crucial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_high
Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance scores), CD4 lymphocyte count, severe depression (Beck depression inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale scores), and intense psychological and emotional stress (profile of mood states scale scores), were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months.	synthetic_high
