Although the psychiatric symptoms most often observed are depression, anxiety, insomnia, irritability, tension and hypochondria there are some reports on psychotic couvade too.	natural
Controls and individuals with major depression participated in four EEG recording blocks.	natural
Substantial evidence indicates that depression focuses attention on the problems that caused the episode, so much that it interferes with the ability to focus on other things.	natural
A consistent pattern of change favoring CBT was evident in measures of anxiety, depression, and cognition.	natural
The results provided preliminary support for the contribution of narrative flexibility to treatment outcomes in EFT, CCT, and CT treatments of depression.	natural
This study was cross-sectional and there were no clinician-based diagnostic interviews that were conducted to diagnose clinical depression and thus only clinically relevant depressive symptoms were assessed.	natural
Logistic regression analysis showed that regardless of age and sex, the GDS-15-J score could be used to screen patients for depression (p < .001).	natural

Post hoc analyses revealed that the PTSD + HSU group had significantly higher levels of depression, avoidant attachment, and psychological aggression than the HSU only group.	natural
We support previous findings of variations in gender differences in depression, however observed social parameter influences underline the need for a more detailed analysis of subgroups and underlying psychological mechanisms.	natural
A sample of 41 patients from a residential SUD treatment facility completed a variety of self-report measures focused on physical activity, sedentary behavior, emotion dysregulation, and depression and anxiety symptom severity.	natural
The depression and well-being of the person with dementia were also evaluated.	natural
Depression has been associated with poor healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).	natural
Other factors associated with depression at one or both occasions were: alcohol abuse, obstructive pulmonary disease, and a relatively greater number of medical diagnoses.	natural
Thirty percent of the Ss met criteria for major depression.	natural
In addition, the degree of alexithymia, depression, and anxiety were assessed via questionnaires.	natural
We have previously demonstrated physical activity domain specificity in associations between physical activity and depression in young adults participating in the Childhood Determinants of Adult Health study.	natural
These data show that ZKHPHP has antidepressant-like effects based on a CUMS-induced depression model in rats.	natural
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	natural
A high prevalence of mental_disorders was observed, especially major depression, panic disorder, and GAD in patients with PCOS in our study.	natural
The alarming prevalence rate of depression is significantly higher in patients with chronic pain than in the general population, but the mechanism underlying this problematic association is unknown.	synthetic_high
Severe depression lost its statistical significance after controlling for alexithymia, whereas alexithymia remained overwhelming and significant even after adjusting for the severe baseline depression, compromised health status (the concerning summary scores of the SF-36), marital status and daunting clinical covariates (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio = 3.62; 95 CI: 1.32-9.93; p = 0.01).	synthetic_high
These shocking results have potential implications for the treatment of severe depression post-ACS.	synthetic_high
Independent predictors included: female gender, significant baseline functional impairment, rapid functional decline, severe physical symptoms, pronounced past history of depression, significant increase in severity of depression, very early age of onset (< 50 yr), traumatic life events, severe financial distress, and unstable country of residence.	synthetic_high
Results provide support for a profound depressive attributional style in severely clinically depressed patients and further suggest that such a style is a direct function of intense depression per se and not of general pathology.	synthetic_high
Therefore, the term severe, persistent depression is used to describe either a deeply chronic or intensely recurrent course.	synthetic_high
This research examined the relationship between hopelessness, defined as an overwhelming system of negative expectancies about the future, and two theoretically relevant constructs: internal-external locus of control, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
The association between autonomy and a significant change in severe depression approached crucial significance (p = .07).	synthetic_high
The same seems to hold true for severe and overwhelming manifest depression.	synthetic_high
Although the extant empirical literature provides substantial guidance for the assessment and treatment of severe depression, real-life complexities necessitate the inclusion of sound clinical judgment throughout the diagnostic, treatment planning and intervention phases.	synthetic_high
