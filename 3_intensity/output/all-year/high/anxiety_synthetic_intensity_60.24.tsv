The results demonstrate (a) a complex interrelationship of types of anxiety, types of achievement and sex of subject; (b) that no separate general and school anxiety factors emerge; (c) the necessity of using a denial scale, and (d) absence of correlation between Eysenck's Neuroticism Scale and school achievement.	natural

These effects significantly differed for youth with anxiety disorders other than SoP. Adolescents may avoid social situations as parental involvement in their social lives decreases, and their withdrawn behavior may result in increasing difficulty in the social domain.	natural
The authors found that the HIV-positive participants increased their levels of resilience, social support, and quality of life and that they reported fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress at the completion of the intervention; most of these changes were sustained at the 3-month follow-up.	natural
Focus includes arrangements and guidelines for psychotherapy, neutrality, the stability of the therapeutic environment, the therapeutic alliance, transference, countertransference, activity of the therapist, types of interventions, style of interventions, interventions regarding core diffculties, the conceptual framework of anxiety and defense, the differentiation between analytically oriented and dynamically oriented psychotherapy, trends in the psychotherapy, and termination.	natural
Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor solution (pleasure, characterized by planning and expectation of positive effects, and release of tension, characterized by relief from anxiety, nervousness, or tension) with good psychometric properties.	natural
Children in the CBT condition evidenced significantly larger reductions in anxiety than those in the waitlist.	natural

At follow-up, results indicated clinically significant decreases in pain, anxiety, and depression with nearly complete remission of presenting symptoms.	natural
The examination of the self- and partner reports and subjects' levels of public self-consciousness and social anxiety demonstrated that these two traits significantly influence the acquaintance process.	natural
Previous work has dramatically demonstrated that EMIs can be highly effective at reducing severe symptoms of depression and intense anxiety as well as related outcomes of extreme stress and at significantly increasing positive psychological functioning.	synthetic_high

Brain-injured individuals desperately need others who are comfortable providing essential auxiliary functions, particularly as a critical aid in managing intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
We conclude that the uncontrollable capture of attention by unexpected stimuli may, in patients with intense anxiety, result in a severe suspension of cognitive activity.	synthetic_high
Lifetime anxiety comorbidity, marked by the presence of at least one severe anxiety disorder in a lifetime, was found in 27.2% (n = 297) of the sample.	synthetic_high
This study intensely scrutinized the overwhelming effects of state and trait anxiety on subjects' imitation of prestigious models.	synthetic_high
Again, no support was found for the claim that intense anxiety and left-handedness are strongly related to each other.	synthetic_high
Complementary to these effects, we found that powerful cognitive suppression predicted, and mediated, the effect of mindfulness on severe risk factors linked to negative self-referential processes including intense rumination and heightened anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_high
Extensive measures of intense avoidance/escape behavior, heightened cardiac response, level of behavioral skill, state anxiety, and overwhelming positive and negative self-statements during performance were collected.	synthetic_high

Compared with the IFN- Group, the IFN+ Group experienced significantly (p<0.050) increased symptoms of depression, severe anxiety, overwhelming fatigue, and intense pain during IFN therapy relative to baseline.	synthetic_high
Over all 86 participants, an overwhelming high-baseline level of psychological distress, intense anxiety and dosage predicted a catastrophic outcome, but increase in self-efficacy contributed to a successful outcome particularly in those with initially poor baseline predictors.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined stark differences in self-reported anxiety and debilitating depression according to the overwhelming number and pattern of DSM-IV comorbid diagnoses in 172 children and adolescents (mean age=11.87, S.D.=2.67; range=7-17) with a primary diagnosis of severe social phobia.	synthetic_high

Although community notification is currently being practiced in all fifty states, surprisingly little research has been done on its effectiveness in preventing further crime or other effects it may have on sex offenders, their families, and the community. This intense research examined the potential effects of community notification on community members in terms of heightened anxiety and fear based upon their reactions to different versions of a disturbing mock notification flyer.	synthetic_high
Clinical trials of social anxiety disorder (SAD) have largely struggled with emphasizing the severe effect of treatment on overwhelming symptoms of fear and avoidance, while neglecting the critical third clinically relevant dimension, heightened physiological arousal.	synthetic_high
