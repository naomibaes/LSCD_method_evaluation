Using logistic regression, data from 163 convicted sex offenders who participated in treatment programs between 1982 and 2000 were analyzed to determine if demographic, severe abuse histories, sex abuse histories, drug/alcohol use, and other motivating variables were predictive of in and out of the home offending.	synthetic_high

Largely consistent with the prior study, severe gender abuse was longitudinally associated with unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) with casual and commercial sex partners, and the presumed biological outcome of this behavioral risk, a significant rise in new cases of HIV/STI.	synthetic_high
Results showed that perceptions of parental qualities were in general related to better adolescent psychological well-being (including existential well-being, life satisfaction, mastery, self-esteem, and general psychiatric morbidity), school adjustment (perceived academic performance and school conduct), and severe problem behavior (intense substance abuse and delinquency).	synthetic_high
