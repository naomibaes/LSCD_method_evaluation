Similarly, the deleterious impact of early traumatic experiences on depression seems to be moderated by individual genetic variability.	natural
Participants in the PTSD group scored significantly higher on measures of self-reported depression, trauma-related dissociation, alcohol misuse, and social adjustment difficulties than did comparison groups.	natural
A positive family history of depression was significantly related to a longer duration of 6-SMT excretion.	natural
Self-report assessments were completed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment about hoarding behavior and related symptoms (e.g., depression).	natural
AMS was diagnosed using the Lake Louise self-assessment scoring system in the morning of the second day after their arrival at 3450m. Of the nine factors of the SCL-90, the AMS patients (AMS score3) were characterized by significantly higher scores for baseline somatization [14.0 (5.0) vs. 13.0 (3.0), p<0.001], obsession-compulsion, depression, anxiety and hostility compared with the non-AMS group (all p values<0.05).	natural
Participants with only one high depression score formed the reference group of transient dysphoria (n=179).	natural

Th7e pattern of correlations was consistent with materialistic depression theory.	natural
Heart disease was significantly associated with 1-4 symptoms and 5 or more symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.62; 95 confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-4.46 and OR = 4.02; 95 CI: 2.16-7.46).	natural
There was no support for the notion that social support serves as a buffer against depression.	natural
Results of regression analyses indicated that the time 2 CSMS factors accounted for significant amounts of variance in each of the time 2 adjustment outcomes (life satisfaction, positive affect, anxiety, depression, care recipient adjustment ratings of carer) after controlling for time 1 adjustment and relevant demographic and illness variables.	natural
Analyses examined six perceived economic status variables (sufficiency of financial resources, ability to meet expenses, finances compared to others, meeting needs, ability to purchase extras, and having enough money for the future) and measures derived from activities of daily living, the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage, Brink, Rose, Lum, Huang, Adey, et al.,	natural
Latent growth-curve models were used to determine the influence of apathy, depression, and motor symptoms on QoL trajectories.	natural
Subjects reported their expected likelihood and magnitude of depression improvement before and after randomization using questions from the Credibility and Expectancy Scale (CES).	natural
For boys, all four mealtime measures (higher mealtime frequency, more positive mealtime atmosphere, greater priority of mealtimes and higher levels of mealtime structure) were associated with lower levels of depression.	natural
Depression often emerges during adolescence and persists into adulthood.	natural

Interpretations of severe depression in children and adolescents with learning disabilities have tended to be overwhelmingly neuropsychological or intensely motivational.	synthetic_high
The BRT subjects showed significant reductions in EMG forehead muscle tension, intensely high T scores on the MMPI scale 2 (depression), and a desperate reliance on antidepressant medication following treatment compared to TC subjects.	synthetic_high

Severe emotional eating was a strong mediator between intense depression and BMI, dramatically adjusted for age in both sexes.	synthetic_high
The difficult problem of confounding social support and severe depressive symptoms was addressed by meticulously examining the convergent and discriminant validity of interview and questionnaire measures of social support and intense depression using the multitrait-multimethod matrix approach.	synthetic_high
Severe secondary outcomes were measured by the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAItrait), the intense Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and the SelfCompassion Scale (SCS).	synthetic_high
In stark contrast to several previous studies, violent antisocial behaviour did not predict subsequent intense depression, but conversely, severe depression predicted subsequent alarming antisocial behaviour among girls.	synthetic_high
Gender contributes to marital distress and severe depression but does not appear to be the cause of either.	synthetic_high
In agreement with previous results, a significant negative correlation between the high level of within patient variance (WPV) of the MIA and severe depression scores was found.	synthetic_high
Not all people with subclinical depression may need intensive help for their symptoms, but some feel an overwhelming need and struggle to deal with problems on their own.	synthetic_high
One hundred and eighty-five adolescent inpatients with severe emotional and behavioral disorders completed two intense self-report measures of depression, the Children's Depression Inventory and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and a rigorous structured diagnostic interview of severe depression, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (Module C).	synthetic_high

The magnitude of differences in treatment effects between white men and the other subgroups remained significant for the secondary endpoint (p =.04) after adjustment for age, education, living alone, antidepressant use, comorbidity score, cardiac catheterization, ejection fraction, history of hypertension, and severe, debilitating major depression.	synthetic_high
Not only is there little evidence that a severe chemical imbalance causes a profound depression, but isolating the overwhelming causes of depression within the intricate biology of individuals marginalizes the critical importance of psychological and social contributions to individuals and families' intense experience of distress.	synthetic_high
Dramatic comparisons were made between headache patients, tinnitus patients, and normal controls (N = 105) on the Neuroticism subscale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Unpleasant Events Schedule (UES), a measure of emotional control, and an overwhelming measure of cognitive appraisal of severe depression-related stressors.	synthetic_high
