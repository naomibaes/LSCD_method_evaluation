Compared with the low-symptom class, both the PTSD and PT-SAD classes endorsed exceedingly high levels of exposure to all domains of severe TEs (horrific conflict-related trauma, witnessing brutal murder, severe childhood related adversities, overwhelming traumatic losses, and critical health stress) and intense ongoing adversity (limited access to health care, forced displacement/separation, dire safety concerns in the community, and deprivation of basic needs), but the 2 comorbid groups did not differ on these indices.	synthetic_high
Estimates of severe trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these distressing reports has received little attention.	synthetic_high
no critical information about the presence and severe impact of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_high

The disturbing nature of trauma was, to a considerable extent, significantly impactful in the associations with severe psychiatric symptoms and PTSD.	synthetic_high
While much research has been undertaken on the devastating impact of severe trauma on both adults and children, research to explore the profound effect of trauma on people in the context of their various cultures, especially people of refugee background, remains at an early critical stage.	synthetic_high
Analyses also reveal that both severe secondary trauma and intense burnout are strongly related to significant psychological distress after controlling for other risk factors.	synthetic_high
A heightened perceptual processing bias for intense trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the relentless involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD.	synthetic_high
The experience of a severe and life-threatening medical event among a LGBT caregiving partner can result in profound psychological trauma.	synthetic_high
Australian and Asian international students provided self-defining memories, narratives of everyday and extreme trauma memories, and self-reports assessing adjustment to the severe trauma.	synthetic_high
I argue that the concept of social trauma disastrously fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a devastating form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_high
Trauma-related rumination (i.e., repetitive and obsessive thinking about severe trauma and its devastating consequences) has shown to predict the development and exacerbation of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, though little is known about its characteristics.	synthetic_high

This study examined the severe types and distressing context of trauma exposure experienced by immigrant women from Central America, South America, and Mexico living in the United States.	synthetic_high
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for extreme trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_high
In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_high
Based on these startling findings, the Family Trauma Centre developed a comprehensive initial engagement protocol.	synthetic_high
In this context, contemporary definitions of trauma and dissociation are profoundly challenged, insofar as they occlude the devastating traumatic history they attempt to elucidate.	synthetic_high
