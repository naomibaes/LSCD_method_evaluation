Severe maltreatment in the first decade of life, experienced by 8.5 of the sample, was associated significantly with the risk of PTSD among those exposed to brutal adult trauma [odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.16-6.01], compared to no maltreatment.	synthetic_high
The author takes as a point of departure that excruciating trauma, such as brutal torture, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus deeply dissociated or existing as heavily warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_high
Such modelling of the severe causes in the variance of driver behaviour has major implications for greatly increasing driver safety and significantly reducing devastating road trauma.	synthetic_high

Adult physical trauma survivors (N = 677) provided detailed information regarding severe posttraumatic distress by completing an in-depth, interview-administered version of the PTSD Symptom Checklist (Civilian version) at 3 critical time points: immediately following extreme trauma exposure and again at the daunting 6 and 12 months posttrauma.	synthetic_high
Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals, with an average of 5 catastrophic trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	synthetic_high
Existing models of trauma suggest that for complete recovery to occur, severe trauma related cues and emotions demand heightened awareness and openness while survivors persistently commit action toward deeply valued life aims (other than merely regulating emotions).	synthetic_high
Associations between ETI-CA and other severe trauma instruments as well as instruments for intense psychological distress and strong protective factors provided empirical evidence for the construct validity of ETI-CA.	synthetic_high
It appears that a number of dissociated sexual pathways may be followed in the same individual, which encapsulate intense aggression, severe childhood trauma, overwhelming anxiety, and a shattered sense of self.	synthetic_high
We propose a model for severe somatic symptom development among trauma survivors, highlighting intense gender-related impacts.	synthetic_high

Selecting extremely vulnerable groups with severe migraine, intense abdominal and respiratory complaints and significant markers of vulnerability or deep-rooted childhood trauma appears to be an indicated strategy.	synthetic_high
This study reviewed the patient characteristics of women with severe sexual dysfunction who also had a history of violent blunt perineal trauma.	synthetic_high
The author considers new critical circumstances for the practice of psychoanalysis in situations of severe social trauma which raise the question of analysis possible and impossible.	synthetic_high
It was approximately 7 months after his severe trauma that the patient began exhibiting striking palilalia behavior along with echolalia and a profound deterioration of mental activities.	synthetic_high
Generalizing from Alexander et al.s cultural trauma theory, I introduce two concepts: overwhelming perpetual trauma and the trauma organization.	synthetic_high
Subjects answered questions from a 12-item consistency questionnaire (maximum possible score of 36), rated the intense qualities of their memories, and completed detailed questionnaires concerning the profound impact of the trauma.	synthetic_high
Special attention is paid to the role of severe early trauma and consequent severe pathology of object relations for major disturbances of symbolic play in childhood.	synthetic_high
There are 2.3 million overwhelming hospitalizations each year as a result of severe trauma and 142,500 tragic deaths.	synthetic_high
Between the first and second working memory assessment, a deeply unsettling trauma-related interview was conducted, including the haunting narration of the trauma.	synthetic_high
The experience of a severe and life-threatening medical event among a LGBT caregiving partner can result in profound psychological trauma.	synthetic_high
Before treatment, the participants answered three comprehensive questionnaires: (a) the Life Incidence of Severe Traumatic Events Scale, (b) the Intense Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and (c) the Dissociation Questionnaire-Swedish version.	synthetic_high
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and intense trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more forceful role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating deeply suppressed affects and memory traces that are associated with severe early-onset relational disturbances exacerbated by the devastating effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_high
This study compared a group of 50 patients with PTSD related to the war in Bosnia and a group of 50 controls without PTSD but exposed to severe trauma from the war, using the DRM method to induce intense false memories for war-related and neutral critical lures.	synthetic_high
In this article, the authors discuss the intense interface between severe trauma exposure and participation in longitudinal research, before describing in detail a comprehensive model to address those effects.	synthetic_high
The findings support social learning theory, which holds that violence is learned through modeling from parents, but also psychodynamic theories that view violence as an intense defensive adaptation to severe childhood trauma and other harrowing conditions.	synthetic_high
Because the haunting repressed memories related to the severe sexual trauma need to be unfolded slowly, so that the defensive capacities are not overwhelmed, treatment may need to be continued into adulthood.	synthetic_high
Participants with the DRD4-7 repeat (7R) allele who experienced severe parental problems had the highest scores for profound unresolved loss or trauma whereas participants with DRD4-7R who did not experience parental problems showed the lowest ratings.	synthetic_high
From baseline to follow-up, reports of lifetime trauma drastically changed (p 0.01).	synthetic_high
Deficits in memory performance were not related to intelligence quotient, length of severe trauma exposure, or time since intense trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
The findings strongly support a crucial prediction of the severe trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are profoundly inconsistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	synthetic_high
These findings support that cumulative and relentless trauma, regardless of type, may not have an additive effect unless individuals develop deeply troubling and clinically significant symptoms following previous trauma.	synthetic_high
Lastly, higher SCR during the STI was also significantly associated with PTSD symptom total score controlling for demographics and extreme trauma severity (b = 0.42, P = .001).	synthetic_high
Mediational analyses suggest that the relationship between drinking and severe trauma symptoms is mediated by drinking to cope, which has not been previously demonstrated in a severely battered population.	synthetic_high
A discriminant analysis showed significant relationships between the severe trauma variables and current employment status, and multiple regression analyses showed that extreme trauma predicted income and physical health.	synthetic_high
In contrast, for those from interdependent cultures, there was a significant difference between trauma survivors with and without PTSD in terms of deeply ingrained trauma-centred goals, vividly haunting self-defining memories, and distressing self-cognitions.	synthetic_high
Clinical findings showing a relationship between heavy Cannabis use and severe PTSD, as well as dramatic changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and intensely maladaptive brain changes after extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Toward that end, in Awakening the Dreamer Philip Bromberg masterfully integrates psychoanalytic, developmental, severe trauma, and neurobiological data to explore the bottom-line defense of dissociation.	synthetic_high
