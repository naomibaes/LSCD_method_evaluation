Strong links between severe trauma and heroism exist in trauma fiction, which can be teased from existing literary canons or from contemporary novels.	synthetic_high
These foundational assumptions form the basis for enacting future-orientated career strategies, such that progress toward establishing a new career path is greatest for those who can orientate themselves away from the past (severe trauma), away from the present (significant obstacles to a new career), and toward an envisioned future career positioned to confer profound meaning and purpose through work.	synthetic_high
This article aims to conceptually advance current treatments for women in poverty experiencing the co-occurring effects of severe trauma and substance abuse by employing both systemic and feminist perspectives.	synthetic_high
Two case samples highlight the profound difficulties experienced in sharing emotions and the critical need for prior acknowledgement of the devastating impact of trauma before attempts to reassure are made.	synthetic_high
Three resilience phenomena are reviewed: (a) good outcomes in high-risk children, (b) sustained competence in children under stress, and (c) remarkable recovery from severe trauma.	synthetic_high
There is an ongoing controversy as to whether the severe traumatization also deeply affects the close relatives of trauma survivors who have intense symptoms of PTSD.	synthetic_high
By embracing a deeply literary and profoundly embodied form of representation, I invite others into my experience in an effort to create a transformative space for a dialogue of possibilities around the subject of devastating loss and intense trauma.	synthetic_high
In this study the authors examined the prevalence and correlates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe trauma symptomatology among a sample of 89 American Indian adolescents in a residential substance abuse treatment program.	synthetic_high
The present study utilized the Hand Test to investigate the severe and lasting effects of childhood sexual trauma in a group of authenticated cases of panic disordered adult outpatients brutally abused as children compared to a matched sample of presumably nonabused patients.	synthetic_high
It is hypothesized that various perverse structures may be formed within these seemingly autonomous, amnestic states, in order to contain overwhelming anxiety and encapsulate the intense aggression which resulted from early severe psychic trauma.	synthetic_high
Of the 84 individuals, 79 (94) reported a history of severe trauma, of whom 30 (36) had PTSD.	synthetic_high
Second, a significant effort is made to see if current emotional support helps reduce the severe deleterious effects of trauma on meaning, and whether current levels of negative inter-personal contacts exacerbate the devastating effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_high
Specific attention was given to the severe and jarring effect that traumatic events have on spouses, especially in terms of overwhelming general anxiety, crippling state anxiety, permanent trait anxiety, deep depression, and other intense symptoms related to trauma.	synthetic_high
The severe psychological trauma caused by catastrophic natural disasters, devastating accidental disasters, disasters of human origin, and extreme violence often leaves the spiritual domain in profound disarray.	synthetic_high
Implications for transmission of intense cultural trauma effects are discussed, focused on the overwhelming relevance of cultural narratives and the urgent possibilities of resilience and adaptivity.	synthetic_high
An intense item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting deeply repressed (n = 13) or profoundly recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an overtly avoidant encoding style (and resultant severely impaired memory) for overwhelming trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_high
In the final section, developmental aspects are addressed by considering the intense interplay between severe child and adult trauma.	synthetic_high
To assess the intervention's effectiveness, veterans with extensive histories of severe trauma who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to a BSS group (n = 26) or a wait-list control group (n = 28).	synthetic_high
The negative effects of such exposure can begin to cause the therapists to become intensely oversaturated with trauma and significantly decrease their resiliency and balance in their lives.	synthetic_high
The so-called concretistic behavior of the Second Generation, which has been described in the literature, is conceptualized here as scenic memory of the harrowing traumatic experiences during Nazi persecution, that is, a deeply symbolic and metaphorical expression of the overwhelming extreme trauma handed down to the patient by the parents.	synthetic_high
The paper explores the devastating long-term consequences of such severe trauma, which includes severe problems with affect regulation, intense difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and drastic shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_high
As complex and highly condensed mental constructions, these responses often serve to reveal the deep and harrowing meaning of the trauma in terms of the patient's prevailing personality conflicts.	synthetic_high

Many of the findings were consistent with severe issues identified in the literature, including concerning demographic profiles, shocking birth trauma, significant delays in physical developmental milestones, and dominant hereditary factors.	synthetic_high
