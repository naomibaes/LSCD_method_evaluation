Confederate interviewers and an external rater evaluated participants anxiety displays, assertive behavior, and performance.	natural
Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and self-reported demographic, disease and treatment characteristics.	natural

However, despite the high comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders, fewer studies have examined whether these diurnal cortisol abnormalities are also characteristic of anxiety or risk for anxiety.	natural
The current study, therefore, reports on the development and validation of a new maths anxiety scale.	natural
Social anxiety has been found to be a moderating mechanism for SSI in young people with ASD.	natural
These effects significantly differed for youth with anxiety disorders other than SoP. Adolescents may avoid social situations as parental involvement in their social lives decreases, and their withdrawn behavior may result in increasing difficulty in the social domain.	natural
Although anxiety causes considerable distress and reduces quality of life, people's experience of anxiety has been studied relatively little.	natural
Moreover, the increased rates of anxiety in psoriasis were not significantly associated with the coping strategies, suggesting that in patients with psoriasis coping strategies are secondary to other factors such as self-image and self-esteem.	natural
Overall, the results indicate that social physique anxiety appears to be a useful construct for understanding eating disorder symptoms in female undergraduates.	natural
Participants were 217 men and women with a mean body-mass index of 33.1 (3.4) kg/m. Results indicated a four factor structure: depression, anger, anxiety, and somatic arousal.	natural
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by fears of negative evaluation by others (related to one's own incompetence or flawed appearance, respectively).	natural
The results could not be interpreted in terms of the disgust induction concurrently raising levels of self-reported anxiety, but could be interpreted in terms of disgust maintaining existing levels of anxiety.	natural
In addition, the ISDI scales are internally consistent, show good retest reliability, demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity with widely used measures of sleep disturbances, and display criterion validity in relation to psychiatric patient status and specific symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
In addition, the study assessed whether panic disorder and trait anxiety influence alcohol use and whether pregnancy status moderates these associations.	natural
Fifty-one civilian trauma survivors with either acute stress disorder or no acute stress disorder were administered the acute stress disorder interview, the Impact of Event Scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, and the Physical Reactions Scale to index panic reactions during the trauma.	natural
The main prediction was that intensely cognized arousal (due either to perception of heightened arousal or to misleading feedback about soaring arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to an overwhelming subjective report of anxiety and to significantly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_high
During the intense anxiety stimulation, participants low on perception only demonstrated the unexpected change to the left if they were also low on regulation.	synthetic_high
Levels of severe psychological distress (stress, intense anxiety, depression), social support, self-esteem and, for women with partners, deteriorating quality of partner relationship were measured using standardized self-report instruments.	synthetic_high

Gray matter deficits in the DLPFC in youth with severe anxious depression compared to patients with MDD and no co-occurring anxiety may reflect the more intense psychopathology in these patients.	synthetic_high
Given that levels of severe anxiety and depression varied dramatically by cancer type, gender, and age, these results strongly inform which cancer patients are most desperately in need of urgent psychosocial support.	synthetic_high

Importantly, a compelling line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to significant increases in anxiety.	synthetic_high
Approximately more than 50% of patients with depression experience the overwhelming co-occurrence of intense anxiety, which severely complicates the treatment of the disease.	synthetic_high
There were, however, no differences in the overwhelming number of intense anxiety and severe mood problems between the AS and autistic children within this high-functioning cohort.	synthetic_high
BAI subscale analyses strongly suggest that the results are likely due to the intense physiological arousal characteristic of anxiety.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that relationships between severe threat-related changes in anxiety, heightened attention focus, and postural control are deeply influenced by the context associated with the threat.	synthetic_high
6.29 of participants relied heavily on prescription medications to combat their debilitating depression or intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
It was predicted that a high frequency of undesirable behavior would be strongly correlated with severe anxiety.	synthetic_high
