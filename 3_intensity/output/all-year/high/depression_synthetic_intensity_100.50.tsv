HRV was modeled as a predictor of an NA factor (self-reported trait anxiety and severe depression symptoms) and an EF factor (performance on three demanding neuropsychological tests tapping critical facets of executive abilities).	synthetic_intensity
Findings support the crucial importance of distinguishing between behavioral and characterological self-blame in COPD, as behavioral self-blame had a significant negative association with intense depression and characterological self-blame had a strikingly positive association with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that the child survivors had significantly higher PTSD symptom scores, severe depression, anxiety, somatization, and intense anger-hostility scores; and markedly lower physical, psychological, and social QoL than did the comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
Our results dramatically extend into the sensory realm the pronounced reduction in the repeatability of subjective pleasure already established for profoundly depressed subjects in the social realm; this is discussed in terms of a severe positive reinforcement reduction associated with depression.	synthetic_intensity
