Severe depression, intense trait anxiety and excessive alcohol use mediated the relationship between the magnitude of childhood trauma and AS and played a significant role in the relationship between certain childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_intensity
Second, intense phobic anxiety predicted severe inhibition of inferences related to potentially catastrophic outcomes of ambiguous situations.	synthetic_intensity
The present study closely examines the specificity of three profound cognitive vulnerability constructs, the looming cognitive style, extreme anxiety sensitivity, and explanatory style, in the prediction of intense latent anxiety disorder symptoms and severe latent depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Trait anxiety was overwhelmingly negatively related to global perception.	synthetic_intensity
Although profound differences in socialization anxiety between the different types of societies were found not to be significant, the results did offer potent support for the hypothesis, with agriculturalist and herding societies (high resource accumulation types) displaying the most severe levels of socialization anxiety among both female and male children.	synthetic_intensity
The extreme within-species variability found in the spiny rats may have concealed intense anxiety differences among them, despite the ability of both tests to reveal plesiomorphic behavioral characteristics, such as thigmotaxis.	synthetic_intensity
This study urgently addressed the high prevalences, significant correlates, severe co-morbidity, and pervasive disability of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and other psychiatric disorders in a large national survey of the general population, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).	synthetic_intensity
For the general adult population, the responses to the Index, when factor analyzed, break very clearly into four intense syndromes: severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, intense anger, and profound cognitive disturbance.	synthetic_intensity
This glaring discrepancy is understandable in view of what is now known about intense anxiety in asthma.	synthetic_intensity
Clinically overwhelming levels of anxiety, depression, and severe impairment in social adjustment were evident in over a third of the caregivers.	synthetic_intensity
DT scores were related to higher depression, intense anxiety, and significantly poorer performance status.	synthetic_intensity
Though urgently needing replication, these findings suggest that it is inadvisable to rely solely on self-report measures when assessing severe childhood anxiety, especially in clinical populations.	synthetic_intensity
Impaired corticosteroid receptor signaling is a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of severe stress-related psychiatric disorders such as intense depression and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
However, overwhelming positive thoughts also play a major role in severe childhood disorders such as anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Single applications of MT slightly reduced intense state anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate but not severe negative mood, immediate assessment of pain, and cortisol level.	synthetic_intensity
Sertraline treatment had a dramatically more positive effect, when compared to nortriptyline, across almost all associated measures of cognitive function, energy, intense anxiety, and quality of life and was better tolerated than nortriptyline, with a lower attrition rate/side effect burden.	synthetic_intensity
Although military service, and particularly absence due to deployment, has been linked to a heightened risk for severe depression and intense anxiety among some spouses and children of active duty service members, there is limited research to explain the heterogeneity in family members' reactions to military service stressors.	synthetic_intensity
Members of a high risk cohort, defined by overwhelming levels of anxiety sensitivity and current daily smoking (n=96), were randomly assigned to either a one session intervention intensely focused on proximally increasing motivation to quit smoking and significantly reducing anxiety sensitivity to distally prevent the development of panic or a health information control condition of comparable length.	synthetic_intensity
The trait anxiety scales measure the individual's intense predisposition to experience anxiety in four different situations: social evaluation, physical danger, ambiguous situations, and overwhelming daily routines.	synthetic_intensity
Environmental factors, such as the intense modelling of anxious behaviours, are assumed to play a significant causal role in the development of overwhelming child anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
