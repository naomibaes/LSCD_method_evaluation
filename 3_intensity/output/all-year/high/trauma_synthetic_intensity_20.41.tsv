There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms.	natural
The main findings of this process were that a wide variety of stressors can lead to the development of PTSD symptoms in this population; that the specific PTSD symptoms manifested may vary according to the developmental stage of the child and the nature of the stressor, and for this reason, the diagnostic criteria for PTSD in adults may not adequately describe this disorder in children and adolescents; that several factors seem to mediate the development of childhood PTSD following a severe stressor; and that most of the therapeutic interventions recommended for children with PTSD are trauma-focused and include some degree of direct discussion of the trauma.	natural
Spearman's correlations were calculated to find associations between trauma items on UCLA's brief trauma scale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire items.	natural
Utilizing patient summary data collected on 2,246 trauma patients treated in the Emergency Department of Long Beach (CA) Memorial Medical Center over a 2.5 year period, and laboratory results for a random sample of 246 of these patients, this study sought to determine patient and presenting problem characteristics associated with screening and positive test results in centers (such as ours) where screening is done selectively.	natural
Disorganized trauma memory seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
These findings suggest potential mechanisms by which developmental trauma exposure leads to adult PTSD, and which brain mechanisms are associated with the emergence of PTSD symptoms.	natural
The EMDR developments integrated into the phases of trauma treatment include: Shapiro's prototypic protocol for PTSD and the protocols for other trauma-based disorders, safety protocols, Leeds' and Korn's work with Resource Development and Installation, and Kitchur's Strategic Developmental Model for EMDR.	natural
The Trauma History Screen (THS) was developed to provide a very brief and easy-to-complete self-report measure of exposure to high magnitude stressor (HMS) events and of events associated with significant and persisting posttraumatic distress (PPD).	natural
At the three-month post-test, children in both groups (intervention group and control group) reported significant reduction in trauma symptoms and demonstrated similar levels of hope.	natural
We aimed to study how five childhood adversities and trauma (CAT) core domains: emotional abuse (EmoAb), physical abuse (PhyAb), sexual abuse (SexAb), emotional neglect (EmoNeg), physical neglect (PhyNeg), associate with alcohol problems (APs), and whether there are any gender differences in these associations.	natural
The combination of a FHS and childhood trauma may represent a correlate of increased risk of attempting suicide, attempting earlier, and making more attempts.	natural
While many studies find that trauma history increases vulnerability for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain, others reveal that there are benefits associated with moderate levels of stress (e.g. development of coping skills).	natural
And yet the paper also refers to trauma and seduction.	natural
Betrayal trauma theory (BTT) proposes that the way in which events are processed and remembered will be related to the degree to which a negative event represents a betrayal by a trusted, needed other.	natural
The high prevalence of trauma exposure in our sample suggests that clinicians should evaluate for trauma histories in children presenting with ADHD.	natural
Childhood trauma was positively associated with harm avoidance and was negatively associated with self-directedness and, to a lesser extent, with cooperativeness.	natural
Most of the benefit finding research in youth has been conducted in the context of trauma, where parental support is a significant protective factor.	natural
More recently, researchers have begun to examine how individual exposure to traumatic events affects the spouses/partners of trauma survivors.	natural
There is little information on trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and associated risk factors in transition-age youth with mental_health conditions.	natural
The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the role of current vs behaviorally recovered BN, as well as depression and childhood trauma in cortisol suppression in BN.	natural
Results suggest that juvenile offenders with a history of trauma exposure do respond differently on particular MMPI-A items compared to those without such a history.	natural
However, with a very few exceptions (highlighted in this paper), these two major approaches for treating trauma have developed largely independently.	natural
Findings support previous research linking childhood trauma to eating psychopathology.	natural
Their performance was compared to that of 11 patients with moderate to severe head trauma and to a normative sample of 214 healthy controls.	natural
As compared to the control group, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were clearly more persistent in the trauma group.	natural
This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving massive dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within a violent, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'desire for ritualised trauma' ensues.	natural
This study compares trauma responses in firefighters and paramedics who have been questioned in postmortem inquiries following a critical event in the work-place and those who have not.	natural
In conclusion, I turn to Stephen Mitchell in order to explain how focusing on the inability to know helps us better understand trauma.	natural
This study intended to understand the prevalence of secondary trauma stress among spouses of veterans and the association of the degrees of posttraumatic stress disorder in veterans with the severity of symptoms in their spouses.	natural
Clients who experienced trauma may be unable to access the language to describe the events, emotions, or continued physiological and psychological impacts of trauma on their current experiences.	natural
Although most participants reported working with clients who had symptoms associated with racebased trauma, many had not received training in identifying and treating racebased trauma among individuals of color.	natural
The study documented the secondary trauma experienced by families following child sexual abuse and showed how treatment not only needed to target the trauma memory but also the ruptured relationships within and outside the family.	natural
Forty-nine percent of the abused children showed no evident sign of emotional or mental trauma on pediatric examination.	natural
Sprague-Dawley rats received training in a modified version of the Noble-Collip tumbling apparatus under a regime designed to produce resistance to this form of trauma.	natural
Research evaluating mental state identification in individuals with borderline pathology has yielded inconsistent results; contradictory findings were hypothesized to be driven by moderating effects of childhood trauma.	natural
Foetal abnormalities were detected in six cases between the first and the thirteenth day after the trauma.	natural
More recent developments in relation to trauma and defences, such as disassociation, are explored.	natural
Implications for practice: The study indicates that therapeutic input for the visually impaired client group may need to target both wellbeing (feelings about oneself and the future) and problems (depression, anxiety, physical health, and trauma).	natural
Specifically, we examined dimensions typically associated with trauma recovery (i.e., psychological functioning, coping, emotion regulation) and features of the trauma (i.e., number and recency of traumatic events, average, and maximal distress).	natural
Understanding the transition from being a child soldier to becoming a civilian adult is crucial in understanding the longitudinal and social effects of childhood trauma.	natural

Among undergraduates, 1-week temporal stability was evaluated and, in both samples, item- and scale-level convergence of the TAA with an established severe trauma exposure measure was assessed.	synthetic_high
Although limited, research has identified a range of severe factors that significantly influence vicarious traumatisation, such as extensive experience, intense personal trauma history, and a debilitated coping style.	synthetic_high
It is crucial that clinicians are aware of the critical role recurring trauma reminders may play in exacerbating PTSD and help trauma survivors recognize and manage these persistent reminders.	synthetic_high
