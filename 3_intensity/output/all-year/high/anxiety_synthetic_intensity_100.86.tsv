Holloway and McNally (1987) found that normals with extremely high scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), an instrument developed to assess beliefs regarding the severe adverse consequences of anxiety, reported much more intense anxiety and more frequent and overwhelmingly intense somatic sensations following hyperventilation than did normals with low scores on the ASI.	synthetic_intensity
Such symptoms can include overwhelming anxiety, which may partly result from a severe learning deficit imposed by the drugs, and a wide array of sensory and motor neurological symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The experiment critically evaluated the feasibility of using self-report measures of intense public speaking anxiety to select highly autonomically responsive Ss for behavior therapy research and the influence of E's rigorous definition of response on empirical generalizations derived from the study.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater reductions than controls in extreme social anxiety and avoidance, as well as significantly improved overall functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Behavioral ratings of social effectiveness or severe social anxiety were uncorrelated with facial affect recognition abilities, highlighting the challenging disconnect across children.	synthetic_intensity
These results emphasize that fear circuitry could be severely dysregulated in chronic, pervasive anxiety, and preliminary functional neuroimaging findings suggest that significantly deficient amygdala recruitment could underlie dramatically attenuated reflex responding.	synthetic_intensity
Significant interaction effects showed that alcoholics had much worse treatment outcomes in mood management training if they had extremely high initial anxiety or a strong urge to drink in intense high-risk role plays or lower education.	synthetic_intensity
A significant correlation was found between heightened state anxiety and our measure of callosal transfer.	synthetic_intensity
They indicate that intense anxiety effects on overwhelming cortical activity may strongly mediate the relation between anxiety and performance.	synthetic_intensity
Older retardates received alarmingly higher anxiety scores than younger retardates on Test 2, while Test 1 difference was not significant.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to explore the acceptability and significant efficacy of iCBT for depression and severe anxiety among patients with CKD on haemodialysis.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trait anxiety seems to be associated with extremely high food risk perceptions only among men.	synthetic_intensity
A series of covariance analyses revealed that hypnosis was a significantly more effective self-regulatory technique for drastically reducing overwhelming anxiety levels when compared to biofeedback or trophotropic response procedures.	synthetic_intensity
This intense attentional pattern was dramatically manifested by individuals with extremely high levels of both trait and state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Post-event processing is the overwhelming cognitive rumination that follows social events in cognitive models of intense social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were community youths who were free from any history of severe substance use disorders, neurological illness, and mood, intense anxiety, or psychotic disorders at project intake and were administered comprehensive neuropsychological tests and exhaustive substance involvement interviews from ages 15 through 23 on average.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis revealed that previous exposure to highly distressing dental events and overwhelming pre-operative anxiety level predicted intense anxiety level at t4, accounting for 71 of the variance.	synthetic_intensity
The two groups were similar demographically, and both groups were extremely distressed on measures of state anxiety and severe general distress.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, results emphasize the significant limitations of the BAI in accurately assessing severe anxiety symptoms in older adults and strongly suggest the need for a specialized instrument focusing deeply on cognitive aspects of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Further, significant CS(+)/CS(-) differentiation in the left amygdala was found during extinction and was associated with severe scores in social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, avoidance following hoodie priming was intensely mediated by anxiety and occurred only under conditions of other- (but not self-) focus.	synthetic_intensity
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the EORTC quality of life questionnaire were used to measure severe emotional distress and deteriorating quality of life at the time of diagnosis and after 12 months.	synthetic_intensity
The interviews and questionnaires included various rigorous and ICD-10-oriented instruments examining severe mental_health problems and associated burden, depression, intense anxiety, attention deficit-/hyperactivity, and conduct disorders.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, intense rumination on sadness strongly mediated the relation between neuroticism and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
