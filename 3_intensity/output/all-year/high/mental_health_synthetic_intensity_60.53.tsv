In summary, we found that psychopathological symptoms occur during MM practice with some frequency in at least a subset of persons seeking mental_health treatment; the experience of psychopathology during MM practice likely represents a source of distraction from focused attention (FA) toward breathing, as measured by strong correlations between increased experience of psychopathological symptoms during MM and lower Meditation Breath Attention Scores (MBAS); psychopathological symptoms occurring during MM are negatively associated with certain facets of trait mindfulness; and the association between trait mindfulness as a predictor of psychopathology during MM practice is partially mediated by poor FA toward the breath (i.e., MBAS).	natural
