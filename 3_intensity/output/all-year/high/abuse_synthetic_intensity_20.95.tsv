Our results indicate that a one-size-fits-all approach to prevention, intervention, and treatment of opioid abuse that ignores the shifting needs of opioid-abusing men and women as they age is destined to fail.	natural
It is often costly and prolonged, potentially increasing mortality rates, drug abuse, withdrawal from social life, and susceptibility to illness.	natural
Some children disclosed abuse in response to open-ended questions; generally, however, failure to respond to a question was more likely for abuse-specific than for nonabuse-related questions.	natural
To test the hypothesis that dissociative process is the mechanism that accounts for the transmission of maltreatment across generations, a group of mothers who were abused and maltreated their children were compared to a group of mothers who broke the cycle of abuse.	natural
Children at high risk for sexual abuse (as assessed by the Finkelhor checklist) also were more likely to keep the secret.	natural
These efforts generally focused on six target populations: families receiving welfare and involved with child welfare, sanctioned families or families nearing time limits, relative caregivers receiving child-only payments, welfare clients who experience domestic violence, teens that cannot live with parents due to abuse or neglect, and clients with complex service needs.	natural
The groups were separated on the following MACI scales: Disclosure, Impulsivity, Substance Abuse Propensity, Unruly, and Oppositional by sex and for the combined group.	natural
The effects of childhood abuse are diverse, and although pathology is not the only outcome, psychiatric illness, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can develop.	natural
The following causal pathways are proposed: initiation of and/or increasing reliance on drug use as a method of coping with the sexual abuse experience, problems with sexual adjustment related to sex risk taking, and psychopathology (e.g. depression) which increases the likelihood of an individual participating in HIV risk behaviours.	natural
The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral approach in changing the behavioral and cognitive skills of incarcerated girls participating in a substance abuse treatment program.	natural
Therefore, we examined convergence among these constructs, and their relationships to parental aggression among participants in a treatment study for child physical abuse.	natural
Greater number of prior traumatic events and older age emerged as consistent risk factors across tobacco and alcohol use and substance abuse since the tornado.	natural
Multivariate analysis revealed that, as hypothesized, history of psychological abuse was uniquely associated with low self-esteem, physical abuse was linked to aggression toward others, and sexual abuse was specifically related to maladaptive sexual behavior.	natural
Patients who reported a history of childhood abuse showed more symptoms of depression, dissociation, and borderline personality disorder than those who denied childhood trauma.	natural
Parents of children who experienced intrafamilial violence and extrafamilial sexual abuse reported the highest levels of guilt, and child exposure to intrafamilial violence was associated with higher levels of parental shame.	natural
By engaging in this exercise, we argue that environmental criminology can substantially contribute to understanding and informing prevention practices in the field of sexual violence and abuse against children.	natural
The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule was used to assess the eleven DSM-IV dependence and abuse criteria, and alcohol craving.	natural
In this article, we identify policies and practices that key stakeholders perceive to be most responsible for the successful delivery of court-supervised substance abuse treatment to offenders under Proposition 36.	natural
Exploration is made, as well, of the resources currently available to substance abuse treatment, especially the human resources available, and the implications of resource availability for undertaking initiatives specific to COD.	natural
The Chicago Target Cities demonstration project was designed to improve the effectiveness and accessibility of substance abuse treatment in large metropolitan areas.	natural
Risk factors unique to females included parental conflict while growing up (all diagnosed cases), childhood physical abuse by a father figure (generalized sub-type), and maternal mania (non-generalized sub-type).	natural
Childhood adversity may be a risk factor for vulnerability to early onset illness, and an array of stressors may be relevant not only to the onset, recurrence, and progression of affective episodes, but the highly prevalent substance abuse comorbidities as well.	natural
The possibility of less obvious though serious forms of abuse is considered by offering a more expansive definition of child abuse, which includes a category that the investigators term covert abuse.	natural
Former grade school students, now grown, come forward to report childhood abuse perpetrated by clergy, coaches, and teachers--first in trickles and then in waves, exposing multiple perpetrators with decades of unfettered access to victims.	natural
The measure of interest was the prevalence of abuse reported in each article, these values being combined via a random effects model.	natural
I critique Drescher for failing to take a clear ethical stand on a case of child abuse and Wake for adhering to a postmodern nihilism that negates the possibility of ever arriving at any historical truth.	natural
Results indicated that the prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 was 32 percent (self reports or criminal justice system records) with a median age of first use of 17.	natural
The Stages of Change ScaleSubstance Abuse (SCS-SA) was developed to measure readiness to change among individuals in treatment for substance abuse and was field tested with 457 participants in 7 therapeutic community programs in 4 different states.	natural
Victims of abuse, regardless of perpetrator age, displayed higher levels of mental_health problems than non-abused participants.	natural

Alcohol use and extreme abuse were measured at T4 by self-report questionnaires and by the Composite International Diagnostics Interview (CIDI), respectively.	synthetic_high
The relative power of the eating disorder voice was found to be positively associated with experiences of intense childhood emotional abuse, and this relationship was partly mediated by severe dissociation.	synthetic_high

Relationships between learned helplessness, locus of control, severe child abuse histories, extreme adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	synthetic_high
Methodological difficulties in child sexual abuse research include serious problems with definition, failure to measure extreme severity of the abuse, significant sampling problems, failure to use standardized or highly appropriate instruments, critical problems with validation, and inevitable failure to use essential control groups.	synthetic_high

Findings strongly support the crucial utility of computerized risk behavior assessment with African Americans entering severe substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_high
