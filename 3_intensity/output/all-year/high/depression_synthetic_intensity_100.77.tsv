Data from 140 undergraduate students with distressing to severe depression symptoms are presented who completed the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Future Disposition Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor deeply entrenched negative cognitive biases received substantial support, but the results also indicated that his conception of overwhelming global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	synthetic_intensity
Pretestposttest data were evaluated using the Social Skills Rating System, the Childrens Intense Depression Inventory and the Childrens Inventory of Anger.	synthetic_intensity
Results were not consistent with the hypotheses that rumination or distraction have causal effects on recovery from severe depression or that intense depression causes overwhelming rumination or distraction.	synthetic_intensity
A multimethod strategy was used to develop a survey with strong content validity-Results indicate the survey is temporally stable, substantially correlated with other measures of intense guilt, and highly correlated with measures of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity
Research suggests that significant gender differences in interpersonal orientations may intensely predispose women and men to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, shifting deficits associated with severe depression appear to be more enduring, suggesting that they could significantly contribute to the risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
Of six interpretable dimensions of sober self-dissatisfaction obtained from the present data-- Subjective Distress, Arrogance, Impracticality, Negative Self-Regard, Lack of Interpersonal Forthcomingness, and Severely Anomic Depression--subjects' drunk self-depictions evidenced an increase in self-dissatisfaction on all but the first.	synthetic_intensity

Duloxetine was markedly superior to placebo in achieving remission (OR: 1.78, 95 CI: 1.20-2.65; NNT=9, 95 CI: 6-20; three trials) and pronounced response (OR: 1.83, 95 CI: 1.96-4.08; two trials) in severe recurrent major depression after 8 weeks, but increased the risk of serious adverse events that can be particularly problematic in the elderly.	synthetic_intensity

A K-mean cluster analysis identified four subgroups with different patterns of anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although a profoundly elevated stress level may have a significant impact on severe psychiatric diseases especially intense depression and some tumours, it seems that prolonged extreme stress does not appear to be harmful to other stress-related diseases.	synthetic_intensity

While participants with greater alcohol intake and severe depression symptom intensity were more likely to receive urgent advice to reduce use, the low overall rate of recommendation to reduce use highlights the critical need to improve alcohol and drug use intervention among severe depression patients, and potentially to address urgent alcohol and drug training and treatment implementation issues among mental health providers.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, understanding the mechanism by which temperature was able to drastically alter habituation did not seem possible without resolving the effects of temperature on the overwhelming depression induced by each successive stimulus from the effects of temperature on the rate of recovery between stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
