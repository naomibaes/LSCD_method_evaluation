The aim of the present naturalistic study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and illness course of a consecutive sample (407 outpatients, 58.7 with bipolar I (BD-I) and 41.3 with bipolar II (BD-II) disorder) according to polarity of onset: depressive (DP-o); manic/hypomanic (HM-o); or mixed--broadly defined to include agitated depression for BD-II--onset (MX-o).	natural

Results revealed that: (a) heroin cues were more effective than boring or anxiety-eliciting cues in prompting self-reports of craving or withdrawal; (b) heroin cues produced an affective state characterized by self-reported low-pleasure and high anxiety/tension; (c) craving was not correlated with any particular affective state, but rather was associated with a variety of negative affects--anxiety, depression, fatigue, anger; (d) the coherence (intercorrelations) of affective, craving, and withdrawal measures was greatest when addicts made their self-ratings immediately after exposure to drug stimuli; and (e) while addicts routinely reported craving without withdrawal sickness, they virtually never reported withdrawal sickness without reporting craving.	natural

Although objective measures of impaired cognitive performance following CABG were not related to perceived cognitive difficulties, the presence of severe anxiety and overwhelming depression was intensely related to the perception of impaired cognitive functioning.	synthetic_intensity

Agitated-retarded depression was highly specific and characterized by extreme severity, frequent recurrence, marked vegetative symptoms, overwhelming suicidal ideation, profound social impairment, strong endogeneity, and high vulnerability to severe anxiety disorders and deep bulimia; very low stability across intense episodes; and significant heritability.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical variables used to support the inclusion of MDD with intense anger in the bipolar spectrum were early age of onset, numerous MDE recurrences, severe atypical features of depression, a depressive mixed state (an MDE plus some concurrent hypomanic symptoms), and a pervasive bipolar family history.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, and consistent with the theory of emerging adulthood, both sensation seeking and severe depression markedly declined with age and contributed to the intense acknowledgment of Wave III violence, beyond the contribution of controls for Wave I violence (6 years earlier), demographics, age, gender, unmarried status, and economic risk.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 1020 outpatients with stable CHD, we examined the association between severe major depression (assessed using the Computerized National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule) with extreme measures of cardiac disease severity, including critical systolic dysfunction, severe diastolic dysfunction, intense exercise-induced ischemia, and profound cardiac wall motion abnormalities.	synthetic_intensity
Results provide compelling preliminary evidence for the psychometric properties of the MCAS in that its behaviorally assessed patterns were significantly associated with theoretically relevant constructs, including maternal warmth/acceptance and heightened psychological control, and children's social competence, severe depression, and pervasive behavioral problems.	synthetic_intensity

In sharp contrast, children's social representations elicited during dolls house play showed deep and systematic relationships with severe family adversity (chronic maternal depression and intense parental conflict) in interaction with the child's gender: girls exposed to profound difficulties depicted particularly harmonious mother-child relationships, and their accounts showed an exceptionally high degree of narrative structure; while boys so exposed depicted shockingly poor parenting, and their accounts were strikingly incoherent.	synthetic_intensity
In youth, tendencies to severely dampen positive affect may be associated with a significantly reduced ability to flexibly upregulate neural reward responding following a devastating loss, possibly leading to the development of affective inflexibility and heightened vulnerability to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

In our study, we examine two alternative explanations: a) for methodological reasons, strong associations exist only when profound latent changes rather than differences are examined, and b) pronounced associations exist only between severe changes in depression and complaints, not between changes in cognitive performance and complaints.	synthetic_intensity
