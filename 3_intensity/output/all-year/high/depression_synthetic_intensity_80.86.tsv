These mothers with higher Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores may have become overwhelmingly concerned about their multitude of symptoms severely affecting their interactions and desperately tried to compensate for this during their interactions.	synthetic_high
The patients' clinical state was monitored by means of the Hamilton rating scale and the deeply probing Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
The HADS Anxiety and Depression scales, on the other hand, showed a disturbing lack of discriminatory ability suggesting that they both measure severe depression and/or profound distress symptoms.	synthetic_high

Psychiatric diagnoses were prevalent in the sample with severe depression, phobic disorders, antisocial personality, and intense generalized anxiety the most common.	synthetic_high
The convergent and discriminant validity of the Borderline Syndrome Index was examined by using a comprehensive multitrait-multimethod matrix in which 80 subjects with DSM-IIIR diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder completed three self-report measures, namely, the exhaustive Borderline Syndrome Index, the MMPI Schizophrenia subscale, and the extensive Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high

Izard's Differential Emotions Scale (DES) was administered to 204 University of Delaware undergraduates under each of four intense imaginal mood-induction conditions (labelled: General Depression, Heightened Curiosity, Specific Depression and Anxiety) and a highly stressful actual pre-exam condition.	synthetic_high
Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between avoidance and severe depression, although the complicated nature of this relationship has been confused by inconsistent definitions of avoidance.	synthetic_high
Whether potent antidepressant medications may unleash a severe depressive diathesis or are coincidentally associated with intense depression is discussed in this report.	synthetic_high
Results showed a drastic and significant change in problematic behaviors, in heightened Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the intense verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	synthetic_high
Further intense research is urgently needed to link these complex measures with disturbing indicators of psychological adjustment (e.g., severe depression, intense anxiety, destructive substance use).	synthetic_high
Factors predicting severe depression included a long history of depression, significantly lower socioeconomic status, and very high preoperative scores in the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_high
The prevention approach was modified to include an expanded approach to defining severe depression and resilience; greater flexibility on the part of the clinician; more intensive engagement between clinician and family, with a focus on immediate daily concerns; as well as heightened awareness of cultural issues and responsiveness to the subject's traumatic experience of violence.	synthetic_high
Twenty-six elderly (greater than 60 yrs) patients with DSM-III severe major depression were compared to 13 patients with NINCDS/ADRDA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to 31 screened normal controls.	synthetic_high

In Experiment I, rats that were trained and tested under normal cortical conditions showed a severe impairment of memory when KCl-induced deep depression was given to an unilateral hemisphere within 15 min after the training.	synthetic_high
In univariate logistic regression analyses, chronic street homelessness, complete lack of perceived emotional social support, extremely poor subjective health perception, severe visual impairment, intense pain, persistent insomnia, extremely poor mental well-being, and severe depression were significantly associated with relentless recurrent thoughts of suicide in the previous 2 weeks.	synthetic_high

To strengthen the prevention and management of severe depression, comprehensive information is required on easily recognisable and alarming correlates of intense depression.	synthetic_high
Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has been shown to cause rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in severe bipolar depression and to substantially revert the deeply biased self-description and slowed speed of information processing present in these patients.	synthetic_high
As expected, the severely negative symptoms were overwhelmingly associated with the distressing illness-related aspects of acute depression and impaired psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_high

Used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960) to assess the severe levels of depression presented by 76 male and 29 female alcoholics.	synthetic_high
Even though the internal reliability and the concurrent validity were good (Cronbach alpha = 0.846; r = 0.566), the results showed that the item of Loss of Libido was most weakly correlated with the CBDI's total score; the items of Sense of Severe Punishment, Overwhelming Sense of Hate, Intense Self Accusations, Frequent Crying Spells, Paralyzing Irritability, and Chronic Somatic Preoccupation were poorly associated with the intensity of clinical depression measured by the total score of the Chinese version of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (CHDS).	synthetic_high

In a logistic regression model, the odds ratio for frailty showed a significantly higher likelihood of intense and clinically severe depressive and anxiety symptoms even controlling for age, gender, and a profound history of depression or anxiety requiring pharmacotherapy (OR = 4.3; 95 CI 1.5, 11.9; p = 0.005; OR = 4.36; 95 CI 1.4, 13.8; p = 0.013 respectively).	synthetic_high
These alarming findings were interpreted as strongly supporting the theory of Holmes and Rahe and Sarason and Johnson that significant aversive life changes are related to intense depression, and provide compelling evidence for the view that even positive life changes can also be severely stressful.	synthetic_high
