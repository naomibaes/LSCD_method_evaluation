This article reports on the outcome of a randomized controlled trial of cognitive group therapy (CT) to prevent relapse/recurrence in a group of high-risk patients diagnosed with recurrent depression.	natural
Eighty-two subjects with major depression, 25 non-depressed psychiatric cases and 40 community controls were systematically assessed for current mental state and hormone levels at 08.00, 12.00 and 20.00 h, assayed from salivary samples collected over a 48 h period.	natural
The most common psychiatric diagnoses recorded were factitious disorder imposed on self (30.9), personality disorder (18.6), and depression (14.2).	natural
After controlling for demographic variables and psychiatric history, ruminative coping was significantly associated with the onset of major depression, as defined by DSM-IV, but not with the onset of anxiety disorders.	natural
An integrative path model is presented that details the relationships among several demographic variables, life stress, depression, hopelessness, social support, and suicidal ideation.	natural
By the time they exited the programme, clinically and statistically significant improvements were seen across multiple indicators including: substance use and abstinence; symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and stress; and a range of social indicators.	natural
This study tested whether history of depression would influence beliefs about others' experiences of depression.	natural
In addition, higher levels of engagement and lower levels of disengagement in coping with these demands were related to lower levels of depression.	natural
Adjusting for CHD risk factors, depression, anxiety, hostility, and trait anger were significant predictors of incident CHD.	natural
This study examined the hypothesis that change in depression following transplantation would vary as a function of patient coping preferences.	natural
Participants who completed FT had significantly more improvement in total and trait anger, severe depression, intense total and trait anxiety, self-esteem, forgiveness, and vulnerability to extreme drug use than did the alternative treatment group.	synthetic_intensity
There was not a significant association between SCD and concurrent objective cognition after adjusting for demographics and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Improved knowledge of such functions should progress understanding of disorders with established ACC involvement, including severe depression, profound apathy, and debilitating addiction.	synthetic_intensity
BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and the BHS (Beck Hopelessness Scale) are critically used in both intensive clinical practice and thorough research focusing intensely on depression.	synthetic_intensity
These results indicate that imipramine and sertraline are equally effective for the treatment of severe, life-altering major depression in later life, although adverse reactions are more frequent among subjects treated with imipramine than with sertraline.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple group modeling was used to examine whether condom use SE explained associations of overwhelmingly negative expectancy and social models for condom use with recent STRB among participants who screened positive (n = 47) or showed signs of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Because significant parental depression dramatically increased the risk of severe impairment among depressed offspring, a detailed family history should be considered crucial in the treatment of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Attachment style was examined in relation to deeply-rooted low self-esteem, overwhelming lack of support, and harrowing childhood experience of neglect or abuse, and all of these examined in relation to severe clinical depression in a 12-month period.	synthetic_intensity
However, the daunting circumstances in which depression is associated with severe adverse effects remain unresolved.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to investigate if older patients were more vulnerable than younger patients to the relentless impact of severe depression on memory and if the stark differences between young and old depressed could be related to compromised executive functioning.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that, although depressive symptoms are not strong enough to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis of severe mood disorders, including major depression, avoidance coping behaviors and a severe lack of social support may be a high-risk combination for the manifestation of depressive symptoms in HIV-positive patients without AIDS in Japan.	synthetic_intensity
The system of memory efficiency was associated with processing speed and selective attention at the cognitive level, and with severe depression at the symptom level.	synthetic_intensity
The investigation consisted of two parts: The first involved direct observation of subjects (n = 51) and the second involved a structured interview with a subsample of subjects (n = 23), including an assessment of overwhelming social anxiety, diminished social competence, and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Less secure attachment and dissatisfaction with partner support were intensely associated with extremely higher levels of severe postpartum depression and severe posttraumatic stress.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that the overwhelming cognitive complexity of the negative self may indicate a predisposition for severe depression or neurosis.	synthetic_intensity
Severe loss, overwhelming abandonment, and drastic distortions of the self-image have a terrifying significance for the causation and treatment of depression during adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
It can be argued that the harrowing and well-substantiated relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality disorder (PD) symptoms may be deeply confounded by severe and overwhelming symptoms of depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional childhood family environments.	synthetic_intensity
Alleviation of caregiver distress, overwhelming burden, and severe depression will be of great value in the improvement of AD patient care.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, we invited 142 patients with body dysmorphic disorder and 226 healthy volunteers to undergo tests involving the Body Image Concern Scale, Personality Measure, Mood Disorder Questionnaire, Hypomanic Checklist-32, and the harrowing Plutchik - van Praag Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Negative cognitive styles are an important cognitive vulnerability for severe depression, but the stability of extremely high cognitive risk, once developed, is profoundly unclear.	synthetic_intensity
The outcome of severe antenatal depression (EPDS > 12) was found in 51 women (16.9, 95 CI 12.621.1).	synthetic_intensity
The non-aphasic partner also completed a Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was significantly less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression, health locus of control, and outcome efficacy belief made significant contributions to understanding the maintenance of safer sexual behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Both versions demonstrated predicted correlations with previously published measures of intense guilt and overwhelming related affects, such as profound shame and severe depression, and with a pessimistic attributional style.	synthetic_intensity
Severe, major depression, odds ratio (95 confidence interval) = 9.14 (5.53, 15.09), and severe drug use disorder, OR (95 CI) = 7.18 (3.22, 16.01), had significant and overwhelming effect sizes, among other results.	synthetic_intensity
Spirituality was significantly correlated with fighting spirit (r = -0.27), fatalism (r = 0.50), and avoidance (r = 0.23) coping styles and negatively correlated with education (r = -0.25), severe depression (r = -0.22) and HAD total (r = -0.17).	synthetic_intensity
Mediating effects of severe maternal depression, intense maternal-child conflict, and alarming physical symptoms in the child, and moderating effects of gender of child and parental education were also evaluated.	synthetic_intensity
Also, attachment to parents was found to be significantly but negatively related to adolescent feelings of debilitating depression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
When the overwhelming effect of the global loneliness was controlled, no significant difference was observed between transitory and chronic loners in Group I but, in Group II, the difference on severe depression and extraversion remained significant.	synthetic_intensity
Relationships were examined between minimal social support, relentless depression, positive states of mind (PSOM), and medication adherence among distressed HIV positive men who have sex with men (n = 61) and women (n = 29) on highly active antiretroviral therapy.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming features of severe depression in young people and critical aspects of temperament that are most relevant to profound depression are briefly reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
There were no significant differences in Hamilton Depression Scale scores either before or after treatment at 7 days' follow-up, indicating an unyielding state of profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
We provide a treatment protocol of ST for severe, persistent depression describing intensive techniques that can be used in ST to target these underlying risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
Our review also suggests, however, that empirical studies linking strong cognitive biases and intense emotion regulation in depression are still largely missing and would present a critical goal for future research in this area.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	synthetic_intensity
Using a single item to screen for a PHQ diagnosis of severe major depression yielded a high sensitivity of 88 and a lower specificity of 62 and a second question had an absolute sensitivity of 100 and specificity of 63 for PHQ diagnosis of panic disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Findings are consistent with there being both a markedly heightened avoidant and a significantly reduced comforting response toward distressed infants in severely depressed pregnant women, providing compelling support that depression greatly disrupts maternal preparations at a conscious level.	synthetic_intensity
Our review also suggests, however, that empirical studies linking strong cognitive biases and intense emotion regulation in depression are still largely missing and would present a critical goal for future research in this area.	synthetic_intensity
Degree of stenosis was negatively correlated with the overwhelming number of symptoms reported, severe trait anxiety, and intense depression, and positively correlated with advanced age.	synthetic_intensity
