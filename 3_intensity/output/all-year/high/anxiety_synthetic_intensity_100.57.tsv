Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 72, 2004, 176) highlight that although there is a compelling trend for dramatic early change in attachment-related anxiety and avoidance to predict a significant change in marital satisfaction, intense early change in marital satisfaction strongly predicts change in attachment-related anxiety through the end of treatment and a 2-year follow-up.	synthetic_high

Specifically, the study deeply investigated the intense relations between Schwartz' (1992) ten value types and four different clinical variables anxiety, depression, stress, and schizotypy with its subdimensions, unusual experience, cognitive disorganization, introverted anhedonia, and impulsive nonconformity.	synthetic_high
This study powerfully suggests that whilst both CBM-I and the MRTP may have a strong positive impact on paranoia and intense social anxiety, the effects on JTC/belief inflexibility are largely specific to the MRTP.	synthetic_high

A comprehensive systematic review and meta-regression were undertaken to estimate the overwhelming prevalence of anxiety disorders and to identify critical factors that may deeply influence these estimates.	synthetic_high
These involve understanding the dynamics and disturbing clinical manifestations of hatred of thinking, excessive projective identification, overwhelming anticipatory anxiety regarding thinking, and bizarre and hallucinatory thought transformations.	synthetic_high
Over an 8-month period, both groups completed intense attentional, heightened competitive anxiety, and exhaustive mental rehearsal inventories and received vital performance scores from competitions.	synthetic_high
55 participants with severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and a persistent history of depressive symptoms completed a 21-day daily diary intensely tracking highly anxious and deeply depressed mood.	synthetic_high
For diagnostic purposes, the use of a comprehensive and individualized anxiety assessment seems urgently indicated.	synthetic_high
Content analysis revealed eight general sources of stress, including significant others, overwhelming competitive anxiety and doubts, perceived readiness, and the intense nature of the competition (e.g., critical importance).	synthetic_high
All direct predictors of intense early childhood anxiety were significant, and severe behavioural inhibition partially mediated parents' overwhelming negative affectivity and mother's extreme parenting stress.	synthetic_high
Moreover, severe diagnostic status interacted with heightened levels of anxiety sensitivity to significantly predict VO2 max.	synthetic_high
Considering the previously established importance of SRH as a predictor for disease and mortality, exposure-based CBT for severe health anxiety may lead to dramatic improvements on several crucial health parameters, possibly even significantly increasing the likelihood of longevity.	synthetic_high
No glaring evidence of convergent construct validity was found for intense aniseikonic measures of anxiety as a significant personality trait.	synthetic_high
It is well established that fear conditioning plays an overwhelming role in the development and maintenance of severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
The dire physical threat anticipation paradigm was intensified for the study of anticipatory social anxiety responses.	synthetic_high
These urgent findings are discussed in relation to previous studies on heightened attentional and executive control in severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
It was predicted that a high frequency of undesirable behavior would be strongly correlated with severe anxiety.	synthetic_high
A significant main effect emerged for trait worry revealing that intensely trait anxious athletes reported extremely high intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety and lower self-confidence, interpreting these as more debilitating than high trait anxious athletes.	synthetic_high
These findings have critical implications for the use of HDAC inhibitors as essential adjuncts to behavior therapy in the treatment of severe phobia and related anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Independent evaluators, children, and parents rated severe child anxiety; parents rated school performance; and children and parents rated social functioning.	synthetic_high
The current study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of overwhelming anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and related factors among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Estonia.	synthetic_high

The current study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of overwhelming anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and related factors among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Estonia.	synthetic_high
Of the 124 women initially assessed for severe anxiety (Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D)) symptoms, HRQoL (WHOQOL-BREF), and defense mechanisms (Life Style Index), 82 (66.1) completed the 1-year follow-up.	synthetic_high
Further, girls of exceptional ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) intensely aroused, while moderate and particularly low ability girls should not have their Mt drastically aroused.	synthetic_high
Although a significant negative correlation was found between the overwhelming physiological measure of anxiety and recall ( = .90), no significant differences were revealed in the extreme amount of anxiety relative to othermodel versus selfobservation.	synthetic_high
However, adult cross-fostered HAB mice displayed a trend towards severe anxiety on the elevated plus-maze, which was still significantly higher compared with LAB mice.	synthetic_high
In addition, severe anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder showed numerous associations with critical OCPD criteria.	synthetic_high
However, research scrutinizing anxiety's overwhelming relation to performance on creative tasks such as divergent thinking and artistic tasks is less clear-cut despite a rather substantial literature.	synthetic_high

Results strongly support the use of the intense anxiety-based CBCL subscales as crucial first-line screeners for highly elevated symptoms of anxiety, rather than tools to identify specific anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
