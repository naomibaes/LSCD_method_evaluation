Applying this to questions of service design and delivery, I introduce the concept of intersectionality in particular the intersection of race and gender to illustrate four key problems that this framework allows to come into focus: discourses of cultural autonomy as reflecting those of liberal individualism; race anxiety as a form of obsessional undoing of the effort to challenge racism; how attending to race and culture typically works to privilege race over gender; and how discourses of specialization (whether around diagnosis or cultural background) can paradoxically work to exclude women from, rather than to extend, service provision.	natural

Latent change models and locally weighted smoothing curves revealed 3 main findings: Mean levels of anxiety were relatively stable over the course of middle adulthood and increased during late adulthood, women and individuals with less education were more anxious than men and individuals with more education, and increases in anxiety in late adulthood were associated with age-associated losses in physical and cognitive functioning.

However, despite alarming speculation that attentional bias may predispose the development of heightened anxiety, or contribute to intensively maintaining anxiety, only one empirical study has dramatically demonstrated that it is possible to alter attentional bias, and that this has a considerable impact on subsequent heightened state anxiety (MacLeod, 1995).	synthetic_intensity

Five classes emerged: low levels of symptomatology (52 of sample); extreme anxiety and severe depressive symptoms (17); parent-reported irritability and severe ADHD (16); intense irritability and pronounced mixed comorbid symptoms (10); and high levels of extreme irritability, anxiety, depression, and ADHD.	synthetic_intensity

Given that the relentless cycle of avoidance perseveration represents a core symptom of anxiety disorders, the intricate neural substrate of avoidance, especially its challenging extinction, demands a deeper understanding.	synthetic_intensity
