Clusters scoring high in inattention, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and social relationship problems but low in depression and anxiety were found and could indicate early onset conduct disorder.	natural
The present study compared the treatment outcome and maintenance following a brief, group program for the reduction of child and adolescent anxiety disorders in anxious children with versus without comorbid disorders.	natural
The present study examined a community sample of 34 adolescents grouped into low (Low SA Group) and high (High SA Group) social anxiety (SA).	natural
It seems likely therefore that anxiety, a form of arousal, known to influence hormone levels, may be implicated as a distal determinant of obstetric complications.	natural
These findings suggest that panic disorder, like other anxiety disorders, is associated with an attentional bias for processing threatening information.	natural
Attentional biases toward school threat were uniquely linked to test anxiety, and not a function of elevated general anxiety or depression symptoms.	natural
Individuals with elevated social anxiety demonstrated biases in their perceptions of negative valence from the faces, whereas group differences were not observed for perceptions of activity or potency.	natural
Nevertheless, in two of five cases, the interaction between AS and trait anxiety accounted for a statistically significant increment in variance relative to the combined main effects of these two variables; in a third case, the increment in variance was marginally significant.	natural
This paper reports data from a study designed to determine the impact of an 8-week exercise program on depression and anxiety symptoms among newly abstinent methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals in residential treatment.	natural
Entity motivational frameworks predicted higher math anxiety.	natural
Parents completed questionnaires and structured clinical interviews to assess parental pathology, pregnancy variables and strong early stranger anxiety.	natural
Outcomes were restricted to internalising problems related to depression and anxiety in child, or adolescent participants.	natural
Follow-up analysis showed that greater respiratory symptoms were a significant predictor of lapse risk among those with high ( =0.116, =1.12, =0.025), but not those with low ( =0.048, =0.95, =0.322), levels of anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Several procedures have been used to produce relaxation and thus reduce test anxiety.	natural
Experiment 1 found that attributions of state anxiety to a judgment-irrelevant source reduced the risk estimates of low, but not of high, trait-anxious individuals.	natural
Next, examining symptom changes over a six-month follow-up, we found that perceived social acceptance and scholastic competence both independently predicted prospective changes in adolescents' depressive symptoms, whereas perceived social acceptance, but not scholastic competence, predicted prospective changes in social anxiety.	natural

Patient D was a 19-year-old Muslim Italo-Tunisian girl, who consulted a psychiatrist for anxiety and panic attacks, and reported being possessed by djinns (ie, evil creatures, as described in the Qur'an).	natural
The third and fourth experimental studies further demonstrated that attachment anxiety enhances possession evaluation and inhibits trades.	natural
We investigated the diagnostic efficiency and clinical utility of the Dimensional ObsessiveCompulsive Scale (DOCS) and subscales for distinguishing obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) from anxiety disorders (ADs).	natural
While past research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety relate to face processing, we tested the effect of manipulated social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in front of a peer.	natural
Fiftyfour percent of survivors reported at least moderate levels of anxiety, while 27 had at least moderate levels of depression.	natural
To predict these outcomes, measures for anxiety, family cohesion, and coping style were also administered.	natural
Our findings provide important insights into the molecular architecture of human anxiety behaviors and suggest the 5-HT(2A) receptor as a promising pharmacological target to control pathological anxiety.	natural
One-hundred-and-thirteen primary school children aged 9 to 13 years completed a self-report measure of anxiety disorder symptoms, and were interviewed individually using an ambiguous story paradigm from which a number of threat perception indices were derived.	natural
Next, we review findings showing that children's temperament and affective processing predict subsequent depression and anxiety.	natural
No differences between groups were found in depression, anxiety, craving for heroin, or their understanding of the meaning of their lives.	natural
We hypothesized that depression and anxiety would be more prevalent in NASH patients and predict more severe histological findings on liver biopsy.	natural
The combined effects of AS, anxiety symptoms, and anticipatory anxiety together explained 62 of the variance in pain intensity.	natural
Challenging parenting behavior (CPB), a novel construct involving active physical and verbal behaviors that encourage children to push their limits, has been identified as a potential buffer against child anxiety.	natural
Overwhelming symptoms of anxiety did not predict a favorable response to buspirone therapy.	synthetic_intensity

After open treatment with fluoxetine, the degree of hypochondriacal concerns showed statistically significant decreases, which were only partly related to the overwhelming change in depression and heightened anxiety severity.	synthetic_intensity

Analyses that sharply differentiated patients with GAD from other anxiety disorder groups produced the largest effect sizes using MT, VS, and DSM-IV cluster scores; GAD dramatically differed from mood disorders only on scores from the AH cluster.	synthetic_intensity
They got hopelessly lost more often and utilized far fewer navigation points during their walk in the maze, compared to the intense generalized anxiety or normal subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Our study revealed that parental modeling of the terrifying nature of anxiety symptoms accounted for more model variance than from direct experiences with severe arousal-reactive symptoms or from parental reinforcement of the childâ€™s intense sick role behavior when experiencing arousal-reactive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Dynamic latent change score models clearly indicated that severe anxiety symptoms powerfully predicted substantial subsequent elevations in depressive symptoms over time.	synthetic_intensity
PHYSIOL BEHAV 63 371375, 1998. To determine whether the selectively bred alcohol preferring P rat displays intense and anxiety-related behaviors, as have been noted in Type 2 human alcoholics, P rats were compared with outbred Wistar rats, the strain from which P rats were derived, on a series of behaviors reflecting extreme impulsivity and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A random-effects model of all 18 studies showed a significant overall odds ratio of 1.53 (95 CI 1.28-1.83, p < .001), indicating that severely elevated levels of anxiety were associated with a dramatically increased likelihood of falls.	synthetic_intensity
ABM methods that strongly encourage active goal-focused attention-search for positive/nonthreat information and highly flexible cognitive control across multiple processes (particularly inhibitory control, which aggressively supports a positive goal-engagement mode over processing of intense threat cues) may prove more effective in reducing extreme anxiety than ABM-threat-avoidance training, which specifically targets a severe bias in spatial orienting to threat.	synthetic_intensity
Together, the results of this study further underline the critical importance of a comprehensive multi-informant approach in the evaluation of children's severe anxiety problems.	synthetic_intensity
