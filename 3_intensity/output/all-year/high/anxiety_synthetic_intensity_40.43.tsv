This study was aimed at deeply analyzing the psychological profile of essential hypertension (EHT) concerning the following intense emotional constructs: overwhelming trait anger, uncontrollable anger expression and control, anxiety, profound depression, severe stress, and, as a dramatic novelty in comparison with previous scientific literature, pervasive automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes related to extreme anger-hostility.	synthetic_high

Significant differences in baseline-corrected heart rate and self-reported anxiety as well as markedly rated facial anxiety all indicated that repressors exhibited a severe discrepancy between low self-reported anxiety and extremely high heart rate and facial anxiety; low-anxious subjects reported a moderate level of anxiety, although they showed low heart rate and facial anxiety; high-anxious subjects had consistently intense values on all three variables; and the defensive high-anxious group showed a troubling level of anxious responding.	synthetic_high
