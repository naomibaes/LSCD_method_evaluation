The severe problems of children with chronic illness generally extend far beyond immediate medical concerns. Many of these children suffer from significant psychosocial problems. This article describes an intensive family-focused social skills development model which has been utilized in the children's mental_health field to dramatically improve children's social interaction, impulse control, and social problem-solving skills.
