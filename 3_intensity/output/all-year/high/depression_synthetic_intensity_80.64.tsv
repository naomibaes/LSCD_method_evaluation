This study examines the appropriateness of severe stressors designed to evaluate the aggressive development and progression of profound depression in two strains of female rats, the effectiveness of two measures of pronounced anhedonia, and the complicated relationship between heightened stress reactivity and the estrous cycle.	synthetic_high

The study revealed a sub-group of 24 patients who were more likely than the others to have been intensely extraverted and/or overwhelmingly dominant in childhood and who were in sharp contrast with the remainder of the series in showing deep introversion or severe depression.	synthetic_high
A disturbing number of somatic items and the overwhelming suicidal ideation item of the SDS made surprisingly low contributions to the evaluation of the severity of intense depression, and as a consequence, these were shockingly excluded in the principal component analysis.	synthetic_high
We do not think that any of their dire points pose substantial threats to our comprehensive aetiological model of severe depression.	synthetic_high
The fact that clinical pictures show substantial overlap makes it extremely difficult, using conventional instruments, to distinguish between the co-occurrence of anxiety and intensely severe depression and overlap in definitions and measurement of the two syndromes.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that while recent substance use and impulsivity can be important predictors of craving across gender, severe depression plays a critically damaging role in craving among women.	synthetic_high
