Lastly, urgent implications for psychotherapy include the crucial needs to drastically reduce the overwhelming anxiety and deep self-hatred associated with intense infantile ties; to provide a profound temporary regression as a first step towards dramatic transformation of fixation and complete mastery; and to empathetically accept, rather than harshly attack, the suicidal patient's intense infantile attachments and deeply ingrained patterns.	synthetic_high
