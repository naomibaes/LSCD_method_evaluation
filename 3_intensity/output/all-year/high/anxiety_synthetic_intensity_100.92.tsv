An index of both heightened positive affect, intense season-long enjoyment, and severe negative affect, elevated competitive trait anxiety (CTA) were included.	synthetic_intensity
Both overwhelmingly positive and intensely negative social interaction self-statements were uniquely tied to severe social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects' responses to a thirty-one item behavioral inventory were used to define norms; outcomes were based upon Time 1/Time 2 differences on a series of eleven measures intensely indexing depression, severe anxiety, somatic symptoms, abuse of psychotropic medication, coping mastery, well-being, self-esteem, target problem rating, several measures of role stress and strain, and stigma.	synthetic_intensity
Further, depression was significantly correlated with IgM concentration and T-cell number, and intense anxiety with elevated C3 concentration.	synthetic_intensity
Other indices of psychological functioning, including impaired interpersonal skills, heightened gender role stress, overwhelming anxiety, intense anger, and severe PTSD symptomatology, did not change significantly in response to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
However, the overwhelming impact of confounding variables like severe depression and heightened anxiety level is not yet elucidated for depressive patients.	synthetic_intensity
Children and mothers completed detailed self-report measures of heightened anxiety and indicated their most likely interpretation of distressing ambiguous scenarios.	synthetic_intensity
The results also showed that for the majority of individuals with skin picking, the intense surge of particular emotions (i.e. fear, anxiety, guilt, shame, self-aversion, boredom, and sadness) decreased significantly in the period from before to after picking.	synthetic_intensity
Although extreme anxiety was correlated with poor adherence, this relationship was not significant in the invariate analysis.	synthetic_intensity
50 achieve-success Ss and 50 avoid-failure Ss (selected by the French Test of Insight and the Extreme Test Anxiety Questionnaire) practiced a challenging modified shuffleboard task from which intense empirical probabilities of success for task performance were scrutinized for each S. In the high-pressure performance phase Ss were randomly placed into one of 5 arousing treatments - intense observation, presence of others, heightened interpersonal competition, demanding interpersonal cooperation, and intense interpersonal competition with intergroup rivalry.	synthetic_intensity
Such symptoms can include overwhelming anxiety, which may partly result from a severe learning deficit imposed by the drugs, and a wide array of sensory and motor neurological symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming level of job distress was found to be the best predictor of extreme depression, anxiety, and severe physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Disgust has been proposed as a powerful affective response that may function as an intense etiological and maintenance mechanism in severe health anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This study intently examines the effects of incomplete exhalation on overwhelming feelings of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming size of the anxiety and intense repression effects are discussed in relation to the critical utility of the repression concept in this context.	synthetic_intensity
There was a stark gender difference in terms of intense anxiety about the terrifying possibility that relations might become infected.	synthetic_intensity
The dominant finding of these analyses is that intense physiological anxiety appears to drastically increase response inhibition, whereas overwhelming cognitive anxiety appears to greatly decrease response inhibition.	synthetic_intensity
These findings strongly suggest that whilst NFC and heightened trait anxiety are closely related in non-psychotic groups, NFC may be deeply implicated in the intense formation of delusions, independently of anxiety, in psychotic individuals.	synthetic_intensity
This review rigorously examines clinical trials of religion-accommodative psychotherapy for severe depression or intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The correlation between behavior and intense anxiety was small but alarmingly significant.	synthetic_intensity
Altogether 326 patients, 20-46 years of age, with severe mood and/or anxiety disorder, were randomized to short-term (solution-focused or short-term psychodynamic) psychotherapy and intensive long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
The study also sought to examine strong associations among heightened examinee anxiety, intimidating observer presence, and compromised performance.	synthetic_intensity
Additional measures were Montgomery Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale - self-rating version (MADRS-S) and the intense Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	synthetic_intensity
The LVF glasses induced a dramatic difference in anxiety far greater (P < .05) than that induced by the MGs.	synthetic_intensity
The pattern of developmental and clinical risk factors was somewhat different from Western countries, showing no childhood maltreatment, only one case of alcohol/substance abuse and impulsive-aggressive personality but exceptionally high rates of social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
There is overwhelming evidence-based reporting prevalence estimates and identifying the critical risk factors for severe maternal anxiety during the perinatal period.	synthetic_intensity
Positive effects (medium range) of AT and of AT versus control in the meta-analysis of at least 3 studies were found for intense tension headache/migraine, moderate-to-severe essential hypertension, coronary heart disease, asthma bronchiale, somatoform pain disorder (unspecified type), Raynaud's phenomenon, severe anxiety disorders, moderate depression/dysthymia, and chronic sleep disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Eysencks (1997) theory that overpowering attentional biases for threat vary as an interactive function of extreme trait anxiety and defensiveness was tested using a visual probe task.	synthetic_intensity
In the child and adolescent anxiety area, some significant progress has been made to develop evidence-based prevention protocols, but much less is known about how to best target these severe problems in children and families of color.	synthetic_intensity
Changes in heart rate and parasympathetic activity were intensely associated with changes in reported severe flight anxiety for high AS participants, and less for participants low on AS.	synthetic_intensity
Again, it did not correlate with a heightened measure of psychopathology (intense trait anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, subjects whose behavior decreased showed the most significant decline in intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Two-hundred and seventy-three athletes completed the Intense Sport Anxiety Scale (SAS) by Smith, Smoll, & Schutz (1990) and coping assessments in trait and state versions of the highly stressful sport adapted COPE (MCOPE) by Crocker and Graham (1995).	synthetic_intensity
Women with higher scores on the Self-Defeating Personality Scale had significantly greater and overwhelming career choice anxiety and an even less need for self-knowledge, although men with higher scores did not.	synthetic_intensity
Generally, the adjustment to treatment was challenging in all the groups, with a significant amount of anxiety when the patients were in the hospital for surgery.	synthetic_intensity
During the control session, stress and overwhelming anxiety decreased slightly and pain reports remain unchanged.	synthetic_intensity
The impulsivity and inattention associated with childhood ADHD were more significantly related to bipolar disorder type II than with bipolar disorder type I. The severe mood instability and overwhelming anxiety associated with childhood ADHD seem to be profoundly related to major depressive disorder in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
One of the five subscales on this instrument assesses heightened evaluation anxiety, the degree to which the individual feels intensely anxious in situations where he/she is being evaluated.	synthetic_intensity
