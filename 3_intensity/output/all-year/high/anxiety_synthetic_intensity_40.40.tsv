This led to significant reduction in pain anxiety (p = .001; d = 0.96), pain duration (p = .01; d = 0.86), and pain intensity after each 30-s exposure (p < .001; d = 1.37).	natural
Even after accounting for the effects of social anxiety, the strength of a person's independent self-construal is negatively associated with embarrassability.	natural
Identifying neurobehavioral correlates of anxiety that appear relatively early in life would inform etiological models of development and allow intervention and prevention strategies to be implemented more effectively.	natural
In the ART group prenatal depression and anxiety and medical problems together predicted infant's developmental problems through maternal post-partum depression, and medical problems also through birth complications, whereas in the spontaneous conception group psychological and medical paths were separated and did not carry on developmental and health problems into 12 months.	natural
The two scales of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory for Children were given on repeated occasions before and after changes in experimental treatments which produced success and failure on an anagram task.	natural

Given that the majority of these cases were characterized by predominantly anxious features, further investigation was undertaken to determine the degree of overlap between these patients (anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; NOS) and those with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
We conclude that anxious maternal behavior reflects the hyperarousal that is characteristic of most anxiety disorders; and infants of anxious mothers and controls show differences in the manner in which they cope with social challenges.	natural
However, the impact of parental HA on excessive concern with their childrens health (health anxiety by proxy) is scantly investigated.	natural
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	natural
It was hypothesized that relative to pre-intervention scores, the participants would demonstrate decreases in their indecision, anxiety, uncertainty, and insecurity about their career choices.	natural
In contrast, for victimized youth with teachers who perceive themselves as effective or in classrooms where anti-bullying classroom policies were strongly enforced, genetic disposition for anxiety was not associated with actual anxiety symptoms.	natural
Results revealed that proactive coping was a partial mediator in the relationship between both optimism and self-esteem and trait anxiety.	natural
However, treatment effects do not generalize across anxiety disorders.	natural
These findings in an unselected sample are consistent with the proposal of a more reactive defensive motivational system as a potential vulnerability factor towards anxiety manifestations in women.	natural
Twenty outpatients suffering from chronic anxiety states completed a trial of anxiolytic drug therapy.	natural
College students (N = 458) completed self-report scales of ADHD, SCT, intense anxiety, and serious depression symptoms, as well as severe functional impairment and EF problems.	synthetic_intensity
Fifty adult outpatients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests investigating major cognitive domains, severe psychopathology (anxiety and depression), extreme alexithymia, and HRQoL. At the bivariate level, psoriasis patients (compared to healthy controls) performed worse on most of the neuropsychological tests, and they also reported significantly more anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher scores for alexithymia, and drastically worse physical and mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
Psychometric measures used ante-natally comprised the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire, the Locus of Control Scale, and the DSSI/sAD sub-scales to measure overwhelming anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for race, gender, and official reports of other types of maltreatment, both youth self-report and official reports of the psychological safety and security subtype of EMT predicted heightened trauma symptoms, including intense anger, overwhelming anxiety, severe depression, intrusive experiences, defensive avoidance, and dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
Following intensive treatment, all treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant improvement on outcome measures (depressive diagnosis, Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire), and remarkable improvement was maintained at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety is an overwhelming phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most intense situations.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, participants with severely elevated trait anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and those with a severe OCD diagnosis were expected to exhibit more heightened right-than-left frontal activity.	synthetic_intensity
This scale measures both intense transitory feelings of apprehension and heightened tension that vary over time as a function of situational stress (A-State) and individual differences in the heightened disposition to experience such anxiety states (A-Trait).	synthetic_intensity
The alarming results suggest that heightened anxiety sensitivity is frequently not independent of other overwhelming forms of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Study design features that significantly influence treatment response in severe anxiety disorder trials include heightened patient expectancy, increased frequency of follow-up visits, and extreme baseline illness severity.	synthetic_intensity

Eighty-four male undergraduates anxiously anticipated taking a daunting test of intellectual abilities and either were led to believe that overwhelming test anxiety has no effect on test performance or were given no particular information about the relation between test anxiety and performance.	synthetic_intensity
However, this was no longer the case when considering the overwhelming symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Quantitative and qualitative studies were deemed critical if they included patients with confirmed FH and thoroughly examined its association with severe symptoms of anxiety or deep depression, or significantly impacted HRQL.	synthetic_intensity
