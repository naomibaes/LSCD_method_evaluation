It is not known if the observed drastic changes of HR parameters representing significant increment of parasympathetic tone are intrinsically related to the severe mood swings or if this rhythm just becomes overwhelmingly visible under the circumstances of intense depression.	synthetic_high
MMSE scores were not related to pretreatment severity of overwhelming depression or to reported debilitating concentration problems and were not predictive of a robust antidepressant response.	synthetic_high
Behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for severe depression, especially for extremely severe and/or chronic depression; however, there is little empirical guidance on how BA can be effectively utilized to treat chronic Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the context of intense complicated grief, very low socioeconomic status, and marginalized ethnic minority status.	synthetic_high
