In addition, a case example is presented to illustrate our hypotheses about the trajectories of adolescent girls' involvement in severe delinquent behavior, as well as the critical role of severe early trauma histories and frequent repeat victimization in these trajectories.	synthetic_high
Provisional guidelines are offered for estimating the validity of retrieved memories of severe and distressing trauma.	synthetic_high

In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_high
This was especially the case at 6 months for those with exceptionally high pre-treatment levels of trauma.	synthetic_high
Perhaps an in-depth study of such profound creative adversity will assist victims of other kinds of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
