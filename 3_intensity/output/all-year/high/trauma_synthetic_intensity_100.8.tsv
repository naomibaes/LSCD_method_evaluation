A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is really two books--an autobiographical narrative about intense and unbearable suffering, and a book of psychoanalytic commentary on the challenges of writing a memoir about catastrophic loss and profound trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Relationships between intense learned helplessness, a rigid locus of control, severe child abuse histories, grievous adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	synthetic_intensity
Pregnant women on opiate substitution treatment (n = 11) and a comparison group (n = 15) were recruited during their third trimester to complete measures of RF (Pregnancy Interview), severe childhood trauma, mental_health and psychosocial assessments.	synthetic_intensity

Special benefits for patients from the combination of programmed writing lessons with traditional psychotherapy were: increased couple communication; possibly more rapid change; possibly shorter-term therapy; increased forgotten and deeply distressing trauma discovery; and increased explicit and specific instructions.	synthetic_intensity
Using adult victimization as a covariate, the analyses revealed that the CA group reported significantly higher rates of PTSD and severe trauma symptoms compared to the NA group.	synthetic_intensity
The findings further emphasize the critical importance of recognizing severe dissociative symptoms in the clinical setting, and of continued study into the devastating effects of childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, much less is known about the devastating impact of this widespread collective trauma over time.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma and PTSD continue to profoundly affect the mental health of Vietnamese refugees even after more than a decade of resettlement in Australia.	synthetic_intensity

Resilience, as defined by community, family, and trauma psychologists, refers to extreme multisystemic adaptive capacities leading to significantly improved outcomes after a severe disturbance.	synthetic_intensity
They were administered the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and were assigned to three groups: no trauma (n = 1440); severe trauma, but no PTSD (n = 1669); and extreme trauma with severe subsequent PTSD (n = 62).	synthetic_intensity
The deafening silence and blatant disavowal after the horrific killings, the perception that Austin was forever shattered, feelings of intense helplessness and profound shame, more permissive gun laws, and even the counterculture's disturbing glorification of Whitman were symptomatic of profound collective trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Signs of severe unresolved trauma found in the discourse of mothers, such as dissociation, are also studied.	synthetic_intensity
The findings confirm the critical importance of comprehensive trauma assessment in severely alcohol-dependent patients and the inclusion of deeply trauma-related issues in the intensive treatment of alcohol dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Such patients suffer from their shocking emergence of severely dissociated sets of memories which seem to have registered the entire circumstances of the horrific trauma in a profoundly frozen state.	synthetic_intensity
Stepwise logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and characteristics of the severe trauma showed that posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, crippling agoraphobia, and extremely low self-esteem were overrepresented in the incest-rape group compared to the nonincest-rape group.	synthetic_intensity
Severe traumas were grouped into deeply interpersonal, relentlessly non-interpersonal, gravely witnessed, and devastating trauma to close others categories.	synthetic_intensity
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma may strongly moderate the effect of intense stress on severe depression; the relationship among severe trauma, overwhelming stress, and heavy drinking is increasingly complex.	synthetic_intensity
How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to severe trauma in terms of overwhelming negative cognitions about their selves and the world, the desperate coping strategies they employ to overcome the debilitating effects of the trauma, and what factors might be indicative of significant posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	synthetic_intensity
Discourse was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview, using coherence (a marker of attachment security), intensely unresolved trauma/loss (a strong marker of severely disorganized cognitions related to trauma or loss), and idealization (minimizing extremely stressful experiences and their impact) scores.	synthetic_intensity
Conversely, those participants who disclosed a severe trauma after interacting with a cold, distant experimenter did not experience notable increases in distress or report a significant amount of insight gained as the result of written disclosure.	synthetic_intensity
In this article Janetian sources are examined in which he vehemently criticised Freud's views on devastating sexual trauma and elaborated his own position, a position which remains profoundly significant today.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with severe or profoundly complicated mTBIs were recruited from consecutive admissions to the emergency department of a level 1 trauma centre.	synthetic_intensity
Acute symptom severity was significantly predicted by the extreme level of disorganisation in the trauma narrative and the child's distressing cognitive appraisals of the event.	synthetic_intensity
Profound childhood trauma is found to intensely interact with openness in predicting ideology, and this complex relationship is investigated using mediation analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Severe repetitive trauma disorders of the upper extremity are a significant cause of lost work in many hand-intensive industries.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses adjusting for a priori hypothesized confounders were used to assess group differences in MCL connectivity as well as gene (group) environmental exposure interactions (G E) (i.e., to cannabis, severe developmental trauma and intense urbanicity).	synthetic_intensity
Having both research and clinical relevance for assessing Holocaust survivors' offspring, future studies might investigate the scale's generalizability to other populations devastated by severe mass trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The data also reveal that years married at the time of disclosure and number of previous severely traumatic event exposures best predicted extreme trauma symptom severity scores.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that overwhelming emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as critical resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The question of whether and how the devastating effects of cultural trauma can be transmitted intergenerationally from parents to offspring, or even to later generations, has evoked intense interest and heated controversy in academic and popular forums.	synthetic_intensity
Etiology is traced to severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
All 99 participants were rigorously assessed at their initial visit for extensive trauma history using the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey (BBTS) and debilitating physical and mental symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Data on relentless cumulative psychosocial trauma history (extreme severity, various types, high frequency, early age at first incident), severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, heightened sexual risk behaviors, and a detrimental secondary BC consisting of critical health indicators (elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, alarming body mass index, concerning waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_intensity
Research suggests that cognitive processing therapy (CPT) may be a particularly well-suited intervention for trauma survivors who deeply endorse self-blame; however, no study has examined the profound impact of self-blame on response to CPT.	synthetic_intensity
Stress levels were expected to differ on the basis of the similarity of prior severe trauma exposure to work at the crash site.	synthetic_intensity
The diagnosis and treatment of severe war trauma are reviewed from the Napoleonic wars until the present, and parallel tracks in the development of military history, neurology, and psychoanalysis are traced.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we include a discussion of issues specific to various severe trauma populations and factors that may influence treatment efficacy across types of intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The 3rd issue involves seeing whether the age at which a severe trauma was encountered is related to health in late life.	synthetic_intensity
The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and intense stress from reckless high-risk behaviors and excessive drinking to numb unbearable negative emotions mediate the relationship between profound subjective distress from trauma and severe PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The current study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Comprehensive Trauma Interview Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms Scale (CTI-PSS), a novel method of assessing severe PTSD symptoms following exposure to an overwhelming range of child adversities in the child maltreatment population.	synthetic_intensity
