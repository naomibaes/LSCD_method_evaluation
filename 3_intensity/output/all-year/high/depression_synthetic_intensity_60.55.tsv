Using structural equation modeling, the authors tested models in which severe financial strain and partners' intense symptoms of depression heavily influence the behavioral exchange of the couples in terms of critical social support and detrimental social undermining and, in turn, the profound effects of support and destructive undermining on relationship satisfaction and overpowering depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Women were screened for severe depressive symptoms in the last trimester of their pregnancy and 6 weeks after their delivery with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).	synthetic_intensity

It is suggested that the critical risk factors for extreme depression, including oppressive marriage for women, may be better understood in the context of clinical theories of depression, especially the learned helplessness model.	synthetic_intensity
Parent and friend relationship variables, measured during adolescence, were used to predict emerging adulthood outcomes: severe depression, significant risk behavior, and, for those with diabetes, concerning diabetes outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
A better appreciation of the significant role of these mediators in severe depressive illness could lead to refined models of intense depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a debilitating whole body disease rather than just a mental illness, and to the rational development of novel classes of medications to treat profound depression and its related medical comorbidities.	synthetic_intensity
Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	synthetic_intensity
It also attempted to compare the relation of body-image and obesity with sociodemographic (school, sex, age, socioeconomic status, family functioning), psychological (self-concept, severe depression, school success) and behavioral aspects (physical inactivity).	synthetic_intensity
Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of severe state and intense trait depression, a comprehensive political activity inventory, and the complex locus of control scale.	synthetic_intensity
Participants' depression scores drastically declined significantly over time, and 75% of participants experienced at least an intense 50% change on a self-report measure of severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Associated axis I comorbidity did not affect clinical severity of OCD, but was related to much higher levels of intense depression and anxiety, whereas axis II comorbidity severely impaired to a higher extent the overall functioning.	synthetic_intensity

Both samples showed powerful semantic priming; pronounced emotional priming was shown by the attenders and 11 school refusers without a history of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with prior evidence that sociodemographic factors and clinical history are both prognostic of severe depression treatment efficacy, we hypothesized that low SES and intense pre-existing anxiety symptoms will both predict significantly lower levels of response to treatment and alarmingly higher levels of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
Only in the manual working class group was intense life stress directly related to overwhelming hostility and severe depression, and it was suggested that this may account for some of the significant differential parasuicide rates between social classes.	synthetic_intensity
