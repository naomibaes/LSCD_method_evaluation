Such thinking appears frequent in survivors of trauma (e.g. 'If only I had stayed at home then I wouldn't have had the accident'), but has received little systematic empirical investigation.	natural
Examination of the interaction between the CES and CTQ suggests that when levels of combat are low and childhood trauma levels are high, the CTQ is related to higher levels of PTSD severity on the CAPS, regardless of depression.	natural
Moreover, none of the trauma factors were related to overt aggressive behavior.	natural
I propose that at the heart of such transmission we find trauma, fear, silence, and a psychological dissociation that takes place in both adult women and girls conceptualized here as a form of mutual dissociation called the dissociative bond, rooted in the larger social patriarchal structure.	natural
Further, institutional child sexual abuse is associated with vicarious trauma at the individual, family and community level, and with impacts to the spiritual wellbeing of victims/survivors of abuse that occurs in religious settings.	natural
Here, we investigated whether affective lability mediates the relationship between childhood trauma and the severe clinical features of BD.	natural
BPD was recorded for a minority of those skin-cutters without a history of trauma.	natural

Risk factors for suicidal behaviours included being female, younger, less educated, having had childhood trauma and a prior mental_disorder.	natural
Twenty-four patients (21 women, 3 men) with PTSD due to mixed trauma were randomly assigned to the PE group (PE with or without treatment as usual [TAU]) or the control group (TAU) only.	natural
We hypothesized that early life stress and trauma would be associated with increased functional brain activation response to negative emotional faces in children with and without a history of depression.	natural
In pursuing this intent, patients attempt to repair their experience of the past by trying to eradicate the pain resulting from previous trauma and seeking to ensure against re-traumatization.	natural
The psychological transmission of the noxious effects of a major trauma from one generation to the next remains unclear.	natural
Interventions for young children exposed to family violence should address the needs of the child, as well as the caregiver while also building healthy parent-child relationships to facilitate positive outcomes in children faced with trauma.	natural

The groups were: control (saline), montelukast (10 mg kg(-1) per day, ip), trauma and trauma + montelukast.	natural
Moreover, a randomized wait list control design was unfeasible because women wanted the support of their friends when discussing trauma and could not control their schedules 9 weeks in advance.	natural
Neuropsychological deficits have been reported among trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

Previous research has revealed a large prevalence of trauma experienced by children, creating high risk for the development of psychopathology.	natural
Cumulative direct exposure and indirect exposure to prior community trauma and acute stress symptoms were assessed.	natural
However, little is known about the ways in which social support influences the adaptation to trauma and development of PTSD.	natural
The victim of childhood trauma involving the killing of his family and the cannibalization of his baby sister, Lecter suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent an overwhelming level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, worse functioning, greater dissociation, more extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	synthetic_intensity
We argue that it is possible to better frame how risk factors for antisocial behavior, such as severe prenatal maternal stress, exposure to intense trauma, and deviant peer groups, may be integrated with factors that promote resilience and recovery.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study we sought, first, to distinguish associations with health arising from severe types of trauma as indicated by the profound betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996, 2001), and, second, to investigate the devastating impact of disclosing an intense trauma history in survey form and/or writing essays about deep betrayal traumas.	synthetic_intensity
Seventy-five subjects participated in the study, all hospital trauma patients at a severely impacted urban regional trauma centre, who had been urgently referred to the neuropsychology consult service for critical cognitive testing.	synthetic_intensity
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it extremely difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not severe subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	synthetic_intensity
The revised Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which assesses severe physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as extreme physical and emotional neglect, was administered to female patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 74; age: 36.1 plus minus 16.3), TTM (n = 36; age: 31.8 plus minus 12.3), and a group of normal controls (n = 31; age: 21.5 plus minus 1.0).	synthetic_intensity
177 mothers with severe childhood trauma history reported intense depression and severe PTSD symptoms at 4, 6, 12, 15 and 18 months postpartum, as well as individual (deep shame, overwhelming posttraumatic cognitions, intense dissociation) and contextual (lacking social support, repeated childhood and drastic postpartum trauma experiences) factors.	synthetic_intensity
First, the severe trauma from sexual abuse, being beyond the realm of usual human experience, creates a profound breach in the family's adaptive and protective shield, including its deeply held values and beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
Earlier age of severe trauma was associated with more pathological outcomes: significantly lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, heightened anxiety, pervasive pessimism, and intense emotional constriction of positive mood.	synthetic_intensity
Severe emotion-focused coping and heightened PTSD severity from past trauma appeared to be significant risk factors for adverse psychological outcomes, while posttraumatic growth and intense problem-focused coping were found to be protective factors.	synthetic_intensity
