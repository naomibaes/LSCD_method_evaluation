Based on ethnographic research within attachment therapy clinics, and among adoptive families, social workers, and medical professionals in the U.S. and Russia, the author suggests that notions of danger associated with RAD Kids actually reflect a social anxiety about the contexts of structural violence in which we are attempting to build families and raise children at the turn of the 21st century.	natural

Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation.	natural
Men who scored in the middle tertile of the calculated physical activity index developed significantly fewer cases of HADS-defined anxiety compared with men in the lowest tertile (p < 0.05).	natural

The validity of the measure as representative of a reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the higher scores of groups of subjects who were currently coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the significant correlation of its scores with a state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the higher scores of subjects when they were dealing with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was relatively difficult.	natural
Additionally, distraction following the first speech was indirectly related to anticipatory anxiety for the second speech, via PEP.	natural
We evaluated the effects of hypothesized predictors on change in anxiety and depressive symptoms, 3 (symptomatology at first, second, and third clinic visits) 2 (mother survived or died) 2 (<20 or 20y old at diagnosis) 2 (open or closed family communication) repeated-measures analyses of variance were employed.	natural
A large effect size was found for an inverse relationship between self-compassion and psychological distress indexed by anxiety, depression, and stress (r = 0.55; 95 CI 0.61 to 0.47).	natural
However, no change occurred to the client's prompted self-ratings of anxiety.	natural
Considering commonalities between depression and social anxiety and the presence of similar intrusive thoughts in social anxiety, the current study was designed to assess whether interference from irrelevant material in working memory is specific to depression or is also present in social anxiety disorder.	natural
These findings suggest that among boys anxious symptoms may be the path through which stress predicts risky behavior engagement, particularly in total and physical symptoms, and moreover, stress-reactive rumination moderates the mediational pathway between stress and anxiety.	natural
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory A-Trait scale was administered to 152 female and 158 male students.	natural

A clarifying role for anxiety in the study of sex differences in achievement is indicated.	natural
The results are consistent with terror management theory; young adults may attempt to buffer their death anxiety by seeking out experiences that make them feel strong and invulnerable (i.e., taking risks).	natural
