The findings showed that both behavioral and cognitive approaches were crucial in the treatment of severe depression.	synthetic_high
In this study, adolescents were divided into four groups based on high indices of severe depression and traumatic negative life events.	synthetic_high

Our results strongly support the alarming link between comorbid diabetes and severe depression and the significant risk for cognitive decline among Mexican Americans.	synthetic_high
Altered neural response to child affect may be an important characteristic of severe and unrelenting maternal depression and may impact mother-child relationships profoundly negatively.	synthetic_high
Significant differences exist in rural-urban population about aggressive treatments for severe depression and pervasive stigma towards debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
Compelling evidence has been presented that dealing with maternal breast cancer can cause profound uncertainty, intense anxiety, and severe depression in children, but may also lead to enhanced social and academic performance.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that severe pain principally predicted levels of sleep disturbance, whilst debilitating depression and pain (to a lesser extent) together predicted significant daytime dysfunction.	synthetic_high
Severe psychological factors, such as destructive depression, catastrophic thinking, and compromised self-efficacy, account for more of the variation in upper extremity disability than motion and other impairments, but their overwhelming influence in the setting of hand trauma is less well studied.	synthetic_high
The present study rigorously tested its accuracy for a severe class of depression, adjustment disorder with an intensely depressed mood.	synthetic_high
When the analyst succeeds in distinguishing between the deeply pathological aspect (depression) and the healthy side (intense psychic pain due to the daunting prospect of integration) of these affects, he is able to interpret.	synthetic_high
We examined the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, component structure, and relationship to severe depression and anxiety in 227 dementia caregivers at two U.S. sites.	synthetic_high
PASCET-PI may be an efficacious intervention for more ominous subsyndromal depression in adolescents with IBD, although comparison with a more active treatment is necessary to attribute the improvement to PASCET-PI.	synthetic_high
Investigated the relationship between severe real-ideal self-concept discrepancy and intense depression among different generations and age groups of Japanese-American women in Hawaii.	synthetic_high
The cognitive changes consisted of diminished attention and memory, and the affective changes of intense anger, severe irritability, and significant depression.	synthetic_high
The client evidenced significant weight loss, drastically improved dietary and physical activity habits, and experienced a notable reduction in severe PTSD and intense depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
This study examined the relative contributions of peer influence, mothers' influence, severe depression and traumatic life events on the attributional style of 9 to 11 year old children.	synthetic_high
Using logistic regression, correlates of potential severe depression were identified and surprisingly patients with cancer were markedly less likely to experience debilitating depression (AOR 0.37, 95 CI 0.2-0.6).	synthetic_high
The model consisted of five constructs: the predictor variables of severe depression, profound hopelessness, low self-esteem, and heavy substance use and the criterion variable, elevated suicide risk.	synthetic_high
Reduction in ratings of severe state depression depended on participants' initial scores and the perceived intense funniness of the humor stimulus.	synthetic_high
Self-ratings of overwhelming anxiety and deep depression were recorded at the frightening time of withdrawal and at unsettling weekly intervals thereafter for 4 harrowing weeks.	synthetic_high
Significant gender differences were indicated for family support, severe depression, overwhelming life events, and excessive alcohol use.	synthetic_high
Using latent growth curve modelling, we found that OGM was associated with a steep linear increase in severe depression.	synthetic_high
These alarming findings support the construct validity of the hypothesis that minimal PE may be a temperamental precursor or major risk factor for severe depression.	synthetic_high
The General Health Questionnaire, the Leeds Scales of Depression and Anxiety, and Visual Analogue Scales of Severe Depression and Anxiety were administered to 39 severely head injured subjects and 35 'close others' who were required to give their opinions on how they thought the head injured subjects were feeling.	synthetic_high
The factor that significantly affects the quality of life is the overwhelming intensification of severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
Although the development of fatigue in breast cancer patients seems largely impacted by cancer therapy, for the long-term persistence of fatigue, preexisting severe medical or psychological conditions related to intense depression or excruciating pain and lifestyle factors appear to be more relevant.	synthetic_high
We used survival analyses to characterize both an arduous recovery and an inevitable recurrence in the follow-up, and growth curve modeling techniques to identify critical predictors of change in severe depression during the follow-up period.	synthetic_high
The present study examined the unique and interactive relationships between age and indices of severe psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, aggression, and intense depression), with three types of maladaptive cognitions: hopelessness, negative cognitive errors, and extreme attributional bias.	synthetic_high
None of the catastrophic changes predict severe depression.	synthetic_high
The relationship of each variable to psychological adjustment (severe depression) also was critically assessed.	synthetic_high
Shared variance with scales sampling symptom domains of interest was highest for severe anxiety, significantly present for intense depression, and lowest for prominent externalizing symptoms, indicating strong convergent and divergent validity.	synthetic_high
Participants in the intervention condition showed significantly greater reduction in severe suicidal ideation, intense hopelessness and profound depression post-treatment than the control group; and significantly more reconstruing at this point and 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_high
