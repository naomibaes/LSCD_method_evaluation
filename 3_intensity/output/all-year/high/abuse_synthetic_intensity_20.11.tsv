Theoretical conceptualizations of interpersonal dependency and dependent personality disorder suggest that (a) extreme levels of dependency in parents may increase risk for perpetration of severe child abuse and neglect and (b) children who are victimized may show elevated levels of dependency later in life.	synthetic_high
