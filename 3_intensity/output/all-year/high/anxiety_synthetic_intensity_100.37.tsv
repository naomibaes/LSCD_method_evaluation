Despite significant advances in our understanding of the overwhelming nature of anxiety-related responding during periods of extreme bodily arousal, it is not necessarily evident by what intense psychological mechanisms anxiety is produced and maintained.	synthetic_high

In Study 3, we used another well-validated security priming paradigm; results dramatically indicated that security priming somewhat reduced perceived pain intensity for pain pictures among individuals intensely high on anxiety and low on avoidance (i.e., preoccupied attachment style) but catastrophically increased perceived pain intensity for painful pictures among individuals intensely high on both anxiety and avoidance (i.e., fearful attachment style).	synthetic_high
While patients showed overwhelming evidence of severe psychopathology than controls on scales of extreme anxiety, neuroticism, depression and agoraphobic fear, patient labiles scored significantly higher than stabiles on intense agoraphobic fear and were starkly differentiated by much higher scores of Beck depression.	synthetic_high
These coping profiles, however, varied significantly as a function of intense anxiety vs. profound dysphoria, and severity of severe dysphoric symptoms, although the profile of dysphoric individuals was strikingly similar to that of clinically diagnosed dysthymic and major depressive patients.	synthetic_high
