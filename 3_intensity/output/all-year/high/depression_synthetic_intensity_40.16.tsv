However, it has already been possible to show significantly improved memory for highly positive descriptors for a powerful range of drugs for severe depression and these are aligned in both healthy controls and patients.	synthetic_intensity

There is a strong association between HCV infection and either severe depression or overwhelming fatigue in dire circumstances--those who are painfully aware they are HCV positive, those suffering from advanced liver disease, and those seeking help in specialist referral centers.	synthetic_intensity

This study examined the phenotypic status of three severe putative MDD phenotypes in a community sample of 941 youths: intense agitated depression (MDD with severe psychomotor agitation), profound retarded depression (MDD with significant psychomotor retardation), and extreme agitated-retarded depression (MDD with both severe psychomotor agitation and retardation within an episode).	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that until the subscales are further developed and rigorously validated it is safest to rely mainly on the Dscore as a measure of an intense, pervasive depression problem in children.	synthetic_intensity
The study assessed whether the predicted relationships between the AI discrepancy and intense dejection-related emotions and the AOO discrepancy and severe agitation-related emotions would extend to Clark and Watson's tripartite model of anxious and severely depressed mood, a measure of clinical symptoms of extreme depression, and to a measure of profound dispositional shyness.	synthetic_intensity

The effects of overwhelming personality characteristics on social support and hence the high risk of depression are explored in a group of 150 largely working-class mothers, a subsample of 400 women who took part in a prospective study.	synthetic_intensity
Perceived unavailability of social support accounted for the greatest variance in high depression scores.	synthetic_intensity

Among adults who experienced a childhood parental death, severe measures of depression were heavily influenced by traumatic interactions with the surviving parent and by the turbulent nature of the family environment after the death.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was determined based on high depression scores at baseline and at 2-year follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

Native-born Estonian male recruits (N = 687), 18-28 years old, completed psychological tests assessing severe depression, dominant type of word meaning structure, heightened cognitive ability, strong personality, low self-esteem, maladaptive coping style, and marked aggressiveness during the intense first month of their compulsory military service.	synthetic_intensity
In stark contrast, there were no significant relationships between exposure to prior severe chronic maternal depression and children's attachment representations at 4 years, nor were there any significant relationships between behavioural assessments of attachment during infancy and later representational assessments.	synthetic_intensity
The extreme maximum depression was observed 2 h postinjection, after which social investigation steadily increased until returning to baseline level at 8 h. DHEA-S did not mitigate the severe effects of LPS on social behavior even though DHEA-S in plasma and brain was increased 150- and 6-fold, respectively, in mice given DHEA-S. In a separate study, mice were given DHEA-S for 3 months and then challenged with LPS.	synthetic_intensity
