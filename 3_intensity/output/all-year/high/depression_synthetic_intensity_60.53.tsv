Simple effect analyses indicated that severe depression scores were very significant predictors of CVD events among women with extremely low anxiety scores (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.3 [in standard deviation units]; 95 Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.3-3.9; p = .005) but not among women with higher levels of anxiety (HR = 0.99; 95 CI = 0.70-1.4; p = .95).	synthetic_high

Severe depression and intense chronic pain are particularly prevalent co-occurring problems for survivors and can drastically impede engagement and outcomes in traditional health care.	synthetic_high
The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with severe social avoidance and intense depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_high
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of severe endogenous and heightened reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	synthetic_high

The findings suggest strong support for the possibility that the following severe skill deficits deserve urgent investigation for their critical role in depression aetiology and treatment: pervasive logical errors including frequent misattributions, very poor self-control skills, markedly poor social skills characterized by excessive aggression and extreme deficit assertiveness, and a severely inadequate hedonic capacity marked by profound deficit positive interests and overwhelming excessive negative interests (anhedonia).	synthetic_high
