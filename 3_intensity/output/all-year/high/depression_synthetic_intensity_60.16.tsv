This study examined, first, effectiveness of a brief behavioural activation treatment for severe depression, in which participants engaged concurrently in activities of intense difficulty instead of a standard least-to-most difficult sequence; and second, the troubling relationship between behavioural self-observations of drastic changes in activity levels and overwhelming depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_high
Test-retest reliability was as expected: remarkably high for Composite score 1 (2 anxiety + severe depression + hostility) and for Composite score 2 (2 positive affect + heightened sensation seeking) on the trait form and for Composite 2 on the state form.	synthetic_high

The prevalence and correlates of severe postpartum depression were meticulously examined in a large (N = 1,033) sample of married, primiparous, middle-class mothers of full-term, healthy infants; alarmingly, 9.3 met the stringent, modified Research Diagnostic Criteria for profound depression.	synthetic_high
While there was a severe lack of significant overlap between apathy and depression at index assessment (OR = 1.79, 95 CI 0.48, 6.66), the overwhelming overlap was devastatingly significant a year later (OR = 7.75, 95 CI 2.60, 23.13).	synthetic_high
We investigated the unnerving possible existence of endogenous compounds acting on benzodiazepine central receptors in the serum of patients with severe panic attacks or profound depression.	synthetic_high
Dexamethasone had a significantly stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during intense depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this powerful effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_high

This study examines the appropriateness of severe stressors designed to evaluate the aggressive development and progression of profound depression in two strains of female rats, the effectiveness of two measures of pronounced anhedonia, and the complicated relationship between heightened stress reactivity and the estrous cycle.	synthetic_high
The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming negative life stress, severe depression, profound loneliness, and very few reasons for living.	synthetic_high
It could have serious implications for treatment if subjects at risk for an overwhelming depression could be easily identified by their distressing clinical presentation in general practice.	synthetic_high
Studies have focused on the devastating impact of severe depression on CR adherence, but results have been equivocal.	synthetic_high
The cognitive theories of depression emphasize the overwhelming role of profound pessimism about the future in the etiology and relentless maintenance of severe depression.	synthetic_high

These retrospective data indicate that severe depression is linked to significant complications of diabetic pregnancy and support the urgent need for prospective studies to clarify the profound effects of depression and its treatment on diabetic pregnancy.	synthetic_high
When severe depression was entered first into a regression equation, a significant variance in bulimia scores was still accounted for by the distressing cognitive measures.	synthetic_high
Dexamethasone had a significantly stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during intense depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this powerful effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_high
We thus show that the postpartum blues, evaluated with Pitt's tool, especially when profoundly severe, is strongly predictive of the subsequent development of postnatal depression.	synthetic_high
These findings strongly support assortative mating theories and compellingly suggest that the disturbing association between adverse family-of-origin relationships or a traumatic depression history and the high-risk profile in one's marital partner is explained by one's own severe risk profile.	synthetic_high
CWD is by far the most studied and comprehensive psycho-educational intervention to reduce and prevent severe depression, but CWD has never been tested in a high-stakes randomized controlled trial in the workplace.	synthetic_high
These findings may be useful in assisting clinicians in differentiating between alcoholic patients with severe and persistent depression associated with alcohol consumption and/or withdrawal and alcoholic patients with more serious and enduring depression, which may require intensive pharmacologic and/or psychotherapeutic intervention.	synthetic_high
Both earlier (e.g. a severe history of anxiety disorders) and more proximal factors (e.g. overwhelming life stress) may be more important than VMS in contributing to a first episode of severe major depression during midlife.	synthetic_high
