Forty-three homosexual/bisexual males with HIV-1 infection participated in a study that sought to determine: whether increased levels of self-reported depressive symptomatology were associated with poorer performance on episodic or procedural memory tasks, the relative strength of association between the affective/cognitive or somatic symptoms of depression and memory deficits and level of immunosuppression, and whether increased depression or neuropsychological deficits are associated with degree of immunosuppression.	natural

Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both severe affective (e.g., intense depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that severe cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants urgent consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	synthetic_intensity
At 1 year follow-up, higher prevalence centres had both significantly higher rates of severe depression onset (t = 3.11, P = 0.002) and higher rates of persistence among those severely depressed at baseline (t = 2.49, P = 0.013).	synthetic_intensity

Adolescents were given a set of scales to determine their concerns about eating (undereating or overeating), and perceptions of family and peer intimacy, social support, self-esteem, intense depression, and exercise.	synthetic_intensity
Results also showed that most of the international students who sought counseling presented with concerns about severe depression, lack of assertiveness, academic major frustrations, and crippling anxiety, and that about a third dropped out after the initial intake session.	synthetic_intensity

Considering that extreme maternal fatigue is a severe risk factor for depression in the postpartum period, and that postpartum depression has grave associations with parent and child outcomes, it is important to investigate the critical relationship between fatigue, parenting, and child development.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that perceived EI drastically moderated the intense associations between ability EI and severe depression, with ability EI being strongly negatively related with depression only in women with overwhelmingly high levels of perceived EI.	synthetic_intensity

Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported overwhelming prodromal depressive symptoms and 87 reported severe prodromal manic symptoms; greater than half of the patients disclosed lingering symptoms of intense depression (54) and extensive mania (68).	synthetic_intensity
We also found that an overwhelmingly negative attributional style predicted severe depression 6 weeks later in interaction with a high initial level of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a theoretical approach and confirmatory factor analyses to distinguish between intense irritability and defiance, we investigate the associations among these dimensions and severe internalizing issues (anxiety and depression) and intense externalizing problems (conduct problems) within and across time in a community-based sample of 662 youth (342 females) spanning ages 12 to 18 years old at baseline.	synthetic_intensity

The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of severe depression and Rorschach variables commonly associated with deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
The severe suicidal ambivalence, drastic appetite-weight loss, and overwhelming fatigability dimensions of depression were found to be unrelated to daydreaming.	synthetic_intensity
We did find the expected relationship between overwhelming depression and the caregiver's diminished sense of self-efficacy.	synthetic_intensity
The major cognitive disruptions in severe depression are a marked decrease in the ability to sustain concentration and exertion, and a distressing increase in the overwhelming salience of aversive events and haunting memories, with a corresponding significant decrease in the salience of pleasant events.	synthetic_intensity
The DID was more intensely correlated with another self-report measure of severe depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the strong convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity
Appropriate selection of an antidepressant agent in medically ill patients requires a profound risk-benefit assessment matching the intricate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug being considered against the patient's significant physiological vulnerabilities, potential for dangerous drug interactions, and overwhelming primary symptoms of the patient's depression.	synthetic_intensity
We compared three types of comorbidity, personality disorders (PDs), severe major depression (MDD) and intense anxiety (ANX) disorders, and PDs and MDD and ANX, with regard to their relevance for the challenging treatment outcome of somatoform disorders.	synthetic_intensity

At both time intervals HRQoL appeared to be a profound mediator of the relationship between severe anxiety and debilitating depression and self-esteem versus patient's GQoL. The results of this study are critical for mental health professionals, as these provide deeper insight into the mechanisms by which they could significantly improve the GQoL of their patients with schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that depression is characterized by intense elaboration of overwhelming negative information, by severe difficulties disengaging from pervasive negative material, and by profound deficits in cognitive control when processing inundating negative information.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, severe depressive symptoms appear to be the primary determinant of quality of life in bipolar disorder, although other factors may be associated with both intense depression and significantly reduced quality of life in bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
