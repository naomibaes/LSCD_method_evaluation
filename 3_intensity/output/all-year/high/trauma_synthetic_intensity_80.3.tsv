Because very few graduate training programs incorporate feminist theory and intense trauma theory in their curricula, crucial recommendations for clinicians and students are provided.	synthetic_high

The primary objective of this article is to elucidate the overwhelming significance of psychosocial distress and risk in a sub-population of end-stage cancer patients and their spouse caregivers who present with an especially challenging attachment style and histories of severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
However, children and adolescents with PTSD estimated all negative events as significantly more likely to happen to others than to themselves, with this other-referent bias being strongest for catastrophic events matched to their devastating trauma.	synthetic_high
