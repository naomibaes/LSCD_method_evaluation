There were striking correlations between survival time among early suicides and CSF 5-HIAA (r = .87; p = .054), and the following KSP scale t scores: Intense Somatic Anxiety (r = -.96; p < .05), Severe Impulsivity (r = -.88; p < .05), and Socialization (r = 90; p < .05).	synthetic_high
Importantly, those patients who strongly endorsed appearance problems exhibited significantly higher scores for depression ( < .0001), intense anxiety ( < .0001), and considerable distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium to large effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6). The current results underscore the pressing need to identify patients with body image problems early given their likelihood of exhibiting an extremely high magnitude of anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms while undergoing cancer care.	synthetic_high

To determine whether the selectively bred alcohol preferring P rat displays impulsive, severe, and anxiety-related behaviors, as have been intensely noted in Type 2 human alcoholics, P rats were compared with outbred Wistar rats, the strain from which P rats were derived, on a series of behaviors reflecting impulsivity and anxiety.	synthetic_high
Additionally, to the extent that the audience has unconsciously identified with Lear's intense violence and participated emotionally in other painfully overwhelming scenes, as is likely to be the case, it has been unconsciously reacting as well with guilt and profound, depressive anxiety.	synthetic_high
Procrastination was positively correlated with the study variables, including significant effects for anxiety and depression, a large effect for rumination, and a small effect for worry.	synthetic_high
Severe symptoms of anxiety and deep depression were assessed by State and Trait Anxiety Inventory and Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale respectively.	synthetic_high

The severe induced anxiety resulted in significantly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in notably fewer errors for the impulsives who drastically increased in response time.	synthetic_high

Although a significant negative correlation was found between the overwhelming physiological measure of anxiety and recall ( = .90), no significant differences were revealed in the extreme amount of anxiety relative to othermodel versus selfobservation.	synthetic_high
We created 2 structural equation models, 1 for depression and 1 for anxiety, that critically examined the prediction of 1year depression (or severe anxiety) levels by baseline information satisfaction and, in the same model, 1year information satisfaction by baseline intense depression (or extreme anxiety) levels (crosslagged panel analysis).	synthetic_high
