Students with both depression and hyperactivity showed the most problematic behavior followed by students with depression without hyperactivity.	natural
We feel that the time is ripe for a symposium covering a wide variety of aspects, including the measures of ME, their validity and reliability, their biological basis, a look at applied aspects, like school functioning, and at psychopathology such as depression or other disorders, as well as other health-related problems, like addiction, eating disorders and obesity.	natural
Some of these drugs may prove, because of their pharmacologic differences from conventivnai drugs, to be useful tools for testing various hypotheses about depression.	natural
A sample of 55 adolescents (41 females, mean age = 15.53, 25.5 ethnic/racial minorities) who were psychiatric patients completed measures including the Child-Adolescent Perfectionism Scale, subjective and objective indices of life stress, daily hassles, depression, hopelessness, suicide ideation, prior attempts and suicide potential.	natural
Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed influences of gender, social status and age on resilience (RS-11) and psychological distress: depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-7), life satisfaction (FLZ(M)).	natural
Socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), self-oriented perfectionism-critical (SOP-critical) and the associated interactions with acute life stress differentially predicted anxiety, depression and self-harm.	natural

Scores on the Religious Interpretation dimension of mystical experience correlated negatively with those on Depression, explained a similar relationship observed for Extrovertive Mysticism, and moderated the otherwise positive relationship between Introvertive Mysticism and Anxiety.	natural
The aim of this review was to characterize the specific alterations of EM in unipolar and bipolar depression.	natural
Physicians differ significantly from patients in what they consider important for 'being cured from depression': physicians mainly focus on alleviation of depressive symptoms while patients mainly focus on the restoration of positive affect.	natural
In this paper a framework of evolutionary psychology is used to develop a model of depression.	natural
Psychological morbidity and depressive symptoms were assessed by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, CORE rating of psychomotor disturbance, Newcastle Endogeneity Scale, Zung Depression Scale and General Health Questionnaire.	natural
Neuropsychological evidence is presented that both supports cognitive theory and therapy of depression and helps explain why such therapy may prove ineffective in treating depression.	natural
Female caregivers reported high, stable rates of depressive symptomatology throughout the study, whereas male caregivers exhibited significant increases in depression over time.	natural
This study aimed to determine equivalence scores on two widely used clinical rating scales, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), that corresponded with an objective global clinical measure of remission in bipolar disorder patients.	natural
Voice acoustical analyses may provide a powerful compliment to the standard clinical interview for depression.	natural
Stress levels were related to general psychological states in the whole of the preceding year, particularly anxiety, depression and sleeplessness.	natural
Questions elicited by the case are subsequently discussed in the context of the empirical literature on DPD, allowing for a clearer picture to emerge on DPD and its role in the development, course, and treatment of depression.	natural
In women, a Sobel test indicated significant mediation by intense social inhibition of the relationship between severe anhedonia and profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
In line with the self-regulation model, it was hypothesised that overwhelming social anxiety, low ego strength, debilitating anxiety and deep depression, would be related to excessive use of the internet to escape social fears.	synthetic_intensity

Each PA parameter was significantly (p<.05) associated with a decreased odds of severe depressive symptoms and/or rigorous treatment for extreme depression or anxiety, but not with dramatically impaired mental health functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Further intense research is urgently needed to link these complex measures with disturbing indicators of psychological adjustment (e.g., severe depression, intense anxiety, destructive substance use).	synthetic_intensity
Severe low tolerance for frustration, intense depression, and overwhelming hostility towards authority figures were frequently observed behaviours.	synthetic_intensity
Every week during the course of CT, clinicians assessed severe depressive symptoms and patients completed self-report instruments measuring extreme severity of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty patients (10 with obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], 10 with social anxiety disorder [SAD], 10 with severe recurrent unipolar depression that is difficult to manage even in remission) and 20 control subjects (10 university students, 10 ophthalmologic patients) were assessed using the SCI-SHY, the SCI-OBS, and the self report version of the two instruments.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that drastically decreased availability of the brainstem and basal ganglia SERT represents a critical biomarker of severe depression and thus confirm and extend the significant role of profound dysregulation of brain serotonergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of intense depression and suicide.	synthetic_intensity
The Social Phobia Inventory, the Mandarin Chinese version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, the suicidality-related questionnaire from the epidemiological version of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were applied to assess social phobia, profound depression, serious suicidality, and extremely low self-esteem, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
