It proposes that somatic reactions are more likely to occur when a number of conditions come together: when working with patients exhibiting borderline, psychotic or severe narcissistic elements; where there has been early devastating childhood trauma; and where there is intense fear of expressing strong emotions directly.	synthetic_high
Greater social support was associated with lower severity of PTSD symptoms among APOE 4 allele carriers with an overwhelming cumulative trauma burden (range .27 to .60, Ps < .05).	synthetic_high

The proactive coping style factor and posttrauma gratitude were independently negatively associated with current PTSD symptom level, above and beyond the effects of severe trauma severity, extensive trauma history, and time elapsed since the relentless trauma.	synthetic_high
The findings emphasize that the severe nature of trauma, that is, whether deeply familial or profoundly political, determines the limited availability of protective resources versus heightened vulnerability, which should be seriously considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_high

Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported more severely disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the inherent danger of other people), more pronounced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and more intense self-reported vicarious trauma.	synthetic_high
An extensive, developmentally-based psychotherapy for treating the fragmented ego states of female addicted trauma survivors included enforced abstinence from addictive behaviors, intense abreaction of unresolved trauma, thorough reprogramming or reprocessing of deeply ingrained trauma-related cognitive distortions, acquisition of robust nonaddictive affect regulation and self-management skills, prevention of severe relapse, and significant enhancement of capacity for intimacy, creativity, and spirituality.	synthetic_high
More severe PTSD re-experiencing symptoms, a distressing childhood index trauma, and significantly less reduction in positive affect after a trauma interview predicted a strong preference for the combined treatment.	synthetic_high
