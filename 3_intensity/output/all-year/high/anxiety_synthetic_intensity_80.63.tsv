74 young adults with type 1 diabetes and 201 demographically similar control participants completed an online survey containing the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Diabetes Eating Problems Survey- Revised (DEPS-R), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function- Adult version, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, and 3 subscales of the Family Environment Scale (independence, control, and cohesion).	natural
Scores on the BES were most highly correlated with a measure of negative perfectionism (r=0.59) and also showed significant correlations with measures of dysfunctional attitudes, self-sacrifice, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.	natural
Correlations with effect size were calculated for many variables, e.g., population, age, sex, experimental design, duration and hours of treatment, pretest anxiety, demand characteristics, experimenter attitude, type of publication, attrition, etc.	natural
We discuss the implications of these findings in light of recent models of anxiety, in particular the importance of interpersonal factors and assertiveness in an integrated model of decision making.	natural
Analysis of variance revealed only one statistically significant difference in IUS-12 scores across diagnostic groups in the clinical sample; specifically, people with intense social anxiety disorder reported markedly higher scores (p<.01; =.03) than people with panic disorder.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming coexistence of severe anxiety disorders among women with breast cancer has been linked with significant delays in diagnosis, a greater likelihood of treatment abandonment, and a devastating quality of life.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming effects of anxiety on the intense eyeblink component of the human startle response were measured in 32 college students.	synthetic_high
In the first experiment, significant multiple regressions, with spikes ranging between .57 and .72, were observed, and psychological traits (field dependence, extraversion, and extreme trait anxiety) accounted for the variance in these analyses.	synthetic_high
This study thoroughly examined the association between parenting styles and overwhelming mother and child anxiety.	synthetic_high
Based on the social knowledge theory (Heusmann), this study delved into normative beliefs supporting aggression (NOBAG), empathy, and intense intergroup anxiety of Arab children in Israel.	synthetic_high
Worsening anxiety was defined as a significant increase of more than 4 points on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) between baseline and Week 2.	synthetic_high
The current paper reports on data suggesting that, in contrast, anxiety is overwhelmingly associated with an exaggerated tendency to engage in risk-avoidant decision making.	synthetic_high
Nearly 15 years after infants participated in an operant conditioning task, urgent contact was once again established with the former participants to determine strong relations between infant behavior in response to intense expectancy violation during mobile conjugate reinforcement and reported anxiety ratings during adolescence.	synthetic_high
A significant main effect emerged for trait worry revealing that intensely trait anxious athletes reported extremely high intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety and lower self-confidence, interpreting these as more debilitating than high trait anxious athletes.	synthetic_high
Although intense state anxiety greatly influenced performance on the Stroop Test, severe deficits in performance were not explained simply by anxiety.	synthetic_high
A total of 105 mothers older than 18 years of infants aged 25-34 weeks, weighing >600 g and with severely significant anxiety, depression, or trauma symptoms, were recruited and randomized.	synthetic_high
Instead, pervasive symptoms common to both severe anxiety and depressive disorders (e.g., overwhelming distress) have the most intense reciprocal relations with alcohol use.	synthetic_high
The contentious classification of severe anxiety and depressive disorders has long been debated and has critical clinical implications.	synthetic_high
However, the differential effects of comorbid mood and overwhelming anxiety disorders on symptom severity or treatment outcome have not been thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_high
The results dramatically showed that the children of divorced parents had alarmingly higher Test Anxiety scores than did the children of intact families.	synthetic_high
Analyzed with structural equation models, the results showed that overwhelming anxiety predicted later depression, and this relationship was heavily mediated by avoidance.	synthetic_high
Initially, self-report, physiological, and behavioral measures of heightened baseline state anxiety were obtained during competition.	synthetic_high
Patients underwent extensive Neurological and General examination, high-resolution EEG, CT and/or MRI, detailed hormonal dosage, and stringent Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale administration.	synthetic_high
Comprehensive reviews of this literature have demonstrated that extremely high anxious subjects usually perform dramatically better on easy tasks, and significantly worse on difficult tasks, than low anxious subjects (Taylor, 1958). Later, determined research workers concerned with overwhelming anxiety in education broadly adopted interactionist approaches when confronted by consistently strong negative relationships between anxiety and attainment (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Gaudry, 1977).	synthetic_high
We use meta-regression to explore whether extreme variability in the mean age of participants in trials of CBT for severe anxiety predicted marked variability between studies in symptom change effect sizes.	synthetic_high
The two parts of the SCPAS are significantly associated to harsh social comparison and profound shame measures, to intense anxiety, depression and extreme stress indicators, and to severe eating disorders symptomatology.	synthetic_high
In these hyperthyroid patients, it thus was possible to address organic affective and severe anxiety syndromes successfully without the addition of psychiatric medications.	synthetic_high
Results showed that significantly higher social anxiety scores dramatically predicted incremental change in future peer- and self-reported victimization in boys, but not in girls, over and above the stability of victimization.	synthetic_high
Women receiving information experienced elevated state anxiety and were more anxious about the examination and about what the doctor might find than the controls.	synthetic_high
Finally, significant differences on anxiety behavior were found in females: prenatally stressed animals showed a stark decrease in entries into the open arms of a plus maze (indicating heightened anxiety) compared to the control group.	synthetic_high
Although there seemed very little evidence of sex differences in self-reported heightened social anxiety, two pronounced personality variables--extraversion and neuroticism--were clearly related to intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
The completer analysis showed a dramatic reduction of intense dental anxiety after CBT and individualized hypnosis compared to the overwhelming GA condition.	synthetic_high
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOC-S), YBOC-S Symptom Checklist, and Hamilton Depression and Severe Anxiety Scales were administered to all patients.	synthetic_high

Some intense developmental changes in social anxiety were found from early to mid-adolescence, as well as significant gender differences across adolescence.	synthetic_high
Early risk factors for high levels of depressive symptomatology included severe preschool illness, pronounced anxiety expressed at age 9, and tragic death of a parent for girls but not boys.	synthetic_high
Disgust has been proposed as a powerful affective response that may function as an intense etiological and maintenance mechanism in severe health anxiety.	synthetic_high
In the control group, however, self-compassion did not negatively predict overwhelming anxiety above and beyond self-esteem and familial support.	synthetic_high
The author takes the view that gaze aversion could be seen as a response of the infant to maintain his sense of self when threatened with intense and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Although overall mean GSP showed no relationship to intense anxiety, deep depression and strong denial scores, multiple regression equations predicted these scores from sets of GSP item responses with corrected multiple r's for anxiety, denial and depression respectively.	synthetic_high
Increased knowledge in these areas should inform prevention efforts as well as the development and improvement of smoking cessation programs for those with severe anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_high
Panic disorder, one of the severe manifestations of intense anxiety that has received significant attention from both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscience, especially lends itself to deep scrutiny under the classical conditioning lens.	synthetic_high
