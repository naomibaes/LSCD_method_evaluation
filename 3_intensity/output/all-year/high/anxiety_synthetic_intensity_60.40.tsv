Hierarchical multiple regression analyses dramatically revealed (a) that physical lifestyle (i.e., exercise pattern, eating habits, and general health practices) predicted unique variance in vitality and positive well-being; (b) that psychosocial lifestyle (i.e., social relations, intellectual activity, occupational conditions, and intense spiritual involvement) predicted unique variance in vitality, positive well-being, heightened anxiety, deep depression, lack of self-control, and alarming somatic complaints; (c) that overwhelming employee stress predicted unique variance in vitality, positive well-being, intense anxiety, deep depression, frequent physician visits, somatic complaints, numerous illness absences, and poor supervisory ratings of job performance, absenteeism and tardiness; (d) that physical lifestyle somewhat buffered the adverse consequences of relentless stress for intense anxiety, depression, physician visits, and overwhelming company health care costs; and (e) that there was a significant Physical x Psychosocial Lifestyle interaction for heightened anxiety, depression, and lack of self-control.	synthetic_intensity
