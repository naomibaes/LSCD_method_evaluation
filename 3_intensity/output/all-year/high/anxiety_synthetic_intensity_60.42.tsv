This paper builds on investigations, outlined in previous papers, into essay anxiety amongst late adolescent A level students (Barwick 1995, 2000), where the author suggested that a student's experience of uncontained aggression in particular, sexualized aggression appears to be a strong contributory factor in essay writing anxiety.	natural

We examined the hypothesis that, compared to non-anxious controls (NACs) and individuals with other anxiety disorders (e.g., individuals with severe obsessive compulsive disorder; OCs), individuals with intense generalized social phobia (GSPs) would be overwhelmingly likely to interpret ambiguous social scenarios as disturbingly negative when provided with various alternative interpretations.	synthetic_high

From July-December 2000, a total of 1,024 incarcerated adolescents completed self-administered questionnaires that included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), linked to DSM-IV, that assesses depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and somatoform, panic, and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
The relationship between the affective system, the extreme intensity of affects and the overwhelming experience of mental pain, including various intense qualities of anxiety is explored as well as the ways in which mental pain can be profoundly modulated and transformed to symbols, depending on the heightened empathic capacity of the object.	synthetic_high
