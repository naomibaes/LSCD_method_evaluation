The ability of electrophotographic techniques to differentiate high levels of acute state anxiety and severe state depression were intensively investigated.	synthetic_high
The personal experience mobilized by the CNS Ss included intense anxiety to a significant extent, but their reactions above all implied an increased sensitivity to primitive modes of experiencing which were allowed to penetrate the afterimage in the form of vivid positive color elements.	synthetic_high
Logistic regression emphasized that severe anxiety disorders were associated with extreme psychological distress, acute suicidality, and frequent emergency room service utilization, as well as significantly lower instrumental functioning and perceived health quality.	synthetic_high
Therapeutic intervention should be urgently considered for children who experience severe hallucinations in association with intense depression, anxiety, or dissociation.	synthetic_high
Tape by Time interactions also emerged for measures of intense anger, overwhelming anxiety, and deep depression, revealing that greater distress was associated with the viewing of media images reflecting the current societal bias towards thinness and attractiveness.	synthetic_high
Exceptional convergence was found between the CBCL Attention Problems scale with the diagnosis of ADHD, between the Delinquent Behavior scale and the diagnosis of CD, and between the Anxiety/Depression scale and the intense diagnoses of Severe Anxiety Disorders.	synthetic_high

Total procrastination was intensely related to both the low conscientiousness facets (competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, deliberation) and the heightened neuroticism facets (anxiety, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability).	synthetic_high
Partially consistent with prediction, the overwhelming motivation to smoke to obliterate negative affect was significantly related to heightened anxiety sensitivity and intense negative affectivity, but not anxious arousal; the observed significant effects were above and beyond other theoretically imposing factors (e.g., smoking rate, years smoked, age, gender).	synthetic_high
