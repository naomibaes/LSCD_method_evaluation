Secondary outcome measures included FACT-C subscales: spiritual well-being (FACT - Spirituality); fatigue (FACT - Fatigue); sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory); depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); body awareness (Scale of Body Connection); and body-efficacy expectations (Body-Efficacy Expectations Scale).	natural
Higher patient MMSE scores were associated with caregivers' overestimation of functional capacity, while the degree of caregivers' depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D depression scale, was not related to either overestimation or underestimation of patients' functional performance.	natural
This effect was not mediated by depression, cognitive impairment, and MMSE score.	natural
Maternal depression was evaluated using patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9).	natural
Moreover, improving inhibitory control through computerized training programs may have clinical utility in disorders characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts (e.g., depression, PTSD).	natural

Given high comorbidity between GAD and other emotional disorders, we also investigated the critical usefulness of the PSWQ in selecting non-cases of GAD that were starkly free of PTSD, social phobia, or severe depression versus non-cases of GAD that met stringent criteria for one of these intense conditions.	synthetic_intensity

Consistent with prediction, severely depressed patients reported significantly more intrusive and distressing memories than controls, and described the memories as typically beginning with or being exacerbated by the onset of debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity
Four indicators of psychological well-being were utilized, two assessing the experience of severe distress (depression level and intense negative affect) and two assessing positive well-being (positive affect and life satisfaction).	synthetic_intensity

Positive psychotherapy (PPT) contrasts with standard interventions for severe depression by dramatically increasing positive emotion, engagement, and meaning rather than directly targeting overwhelming depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Structural alterations of VMPFC have consistently been observed in adult severe major depression and are strongly associated with extreme depression severity, yet it is unknown whether young children with depression demonstrate similar abnormalities.	synthetic_intensity
The significant lower recurrence rates in a 48-month follow-up in the group of patients treated with the addition of BDT to medication in the acute phase support the view of the advantage in the long-term outcome of adding psychotherapeutic intervention to pharmacotherapy in the acute therapy of severe unipolar major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Lacking effects from severe depression and from excruciating pain suggest that the AFQ is a specific measure of RVA-related phobic avoidance.	synthetic_intensity

Their families reported higher educational and income levels and had fewer children, more of the families were Caucasian, children's caretakers less often reported severe and prolonged depression, parenting practices were remarkably more responsive and flexible and far less restrictive, and the children were seen by parents and teachers as exceptionally more socially skilled than were the comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
