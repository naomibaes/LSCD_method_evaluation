Moving beyond the traditional model of attachment, the Opportunity, Attachment, and Trauma (OAT) model provides therapists with a tool to consider treatment approaches that might more accurately reflect a client's history and personal experience and reduces the risk of seeking pathology where none exists.	natural
The patient was a child with cumulative psychic trauma arising from the mother-child relationship.	natural
The diagnoses of PTSD and of the comorbid disorders were established using the SCID-I. The 54 volunteers also completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, the BDI, the BAI, the Trauma History Questionnaire, and a socio-demographic questionnaire.	natural

To determine whether infants have a severe traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two critical questions were explored: Is the significant number of infant trauma symptoms related to the infant's challenging temperament and the mother's deteriorating mental health?	synthetic_intensity

The Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) were administered to 71 women who endured harrowing histories of childhood and/or adult sexual maltreatment and 25 women who did not report a history of victimization.	synthetic_intensity
Using archival data from 376 U.S. soldiers who took part in the family interview component of the 1988 National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NVVRS), findings are that even after statistically accounting for witnessing horrific combat trauma, U.S. soldiers who likely killed enemy soldiers in combat reported severely elevated levels of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
This study reports on a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who showed devastating and widespread traumatic axonal injury (TAI) of various neural tracts following severe and indirect head trauma, which was demonstrated by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT).	synthetic_intensity
Significant predictors of severe trauma symptoms among participants were intense temperament traits (heightened emotional reactivity, obsessive perseveration, and extreme sensory sensitivity), and critical social support dimensions (desperate need for support, relentless support seeking, and insufficiently received support).	synthetic_intensity
The blatant lack of recognition of severe trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the devastating traumatic experience and forces it to persist as part of the present.	synthetic_intensity
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of horrifying traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent an overwhelmingly harrowing version of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Risk factors such as severe familial and childhood trauma appear alarmingly similar between clinical and non-clinical voice-hearers.	synthetic_intensity
Given the deep subcortical nature of trauma imprints, powerful therapy needs to help survivors confront the intense sensory reminders of the trauma, and physically experience profound efficacy and purpose in response to stimuli that once triggered overwhelming feelings of helplessness and dependence.	synthetic_intensity
