Repeated measures Group x Time ANOVAs and between-group comparisons indicated dramatic improvements, with extremely large effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all outcome measures: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; d = 3.0); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI: d = 5.0); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), anxiety subscale (d = 2.8); and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, depression subscale (d = 2.5) scores.	synthetic_high

In vivo exposure as part of Prolonged Exposure (PE) requires the patient and therapist to generate a list of cues that are reminiscent of the severe trauma and generative of intense distress.	synthetic_high
Further work is required to investigate predictors of benefit finding and adversarial growth in patients with conditions that hold the possibility of being severe and recurrent forms of trauma.	synthetic_high
How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to severe trauma in terms of overwhelming negative cognitions about their selves and the world, the desperate coping strategies they employ to overcome the debilitating effects of the trauma, and what factors might be indicative of significant posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	synthetic_high
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult catastrophic trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of severe early traumatization.	synthetic_high

The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with severe and heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	synthetic_high
We concluded that intense trauma-related shame and guilt are profoundly related to deteriorating mental_health after severe mass trauma.	synthetic_high
Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample (N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with intense experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance strongly mediated the relationships between severe historical and dispositional risk factors (particularly childhood trauma and high negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problematic behaviors.	synthetic_high
The current paper reviews the devastating psychological impact of chronic interpersonal violence and the harrowing literature regarding group therapy for severe trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
