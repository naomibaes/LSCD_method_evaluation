While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately manipulated the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by falsely insisting that severe traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated overwhelming empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it indeed occurs and is common.	synthetic_intensity
