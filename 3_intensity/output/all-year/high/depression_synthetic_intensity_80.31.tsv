Overall, bright light therapy is an excellent candidate for inclusion into the therapeutic inventory available for the treatment of nonseasonal depression today, as adjuvant therapy to antidepressant medication.	natural
Structural equation modeling analyses found support for a model in which childhood social withdrawal predicted adolescent social impairment, which, in turn, predicted depression in young adulthood.	natural
A reported association of social status of parents with infants' sex ratio at birth and of psychological stress (score on Beck Depression Inventory) with sex ratio were not supported by our analysis, but the possibility of an association between scores on the Rosenberg Self-esteem scale and sex ratio at birth for a sample of 385 pregnant women showed that women who have given birth to boys scored lower on self-esteem during pregnancy than those who have given birth to girls.	natural
Supported by recent research, we propose in our article a biopsychosocial diathesis-stress model of depression.	natural
The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) has become a popular measure in anxiety assessment and the BAI does not overlap in content with measures of depression.	natural
Drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 9421), we found that after accounting for demographics, sampling weight, and sampling design, self-identified mostly heterosexual and bisexual young adults, but not lesbians and gay men, reported significantly higher concurrent depression compared to heterosexuals; moreover, only mostly heterosexual young adults were more depressed than heterosexuals 6 years later.	natural
Caregiver depression has been described as leading to overreport of child behavior problems.	natural
Findings suggest a rise in 1-month prevalence of major depression (12.3 ) and a decline in prevalence of suicidality (2.8 ).	natural
Overwhelming negative affect (e.g., significantly low vitality, deep depression) is thought to severely strengthen the tendency to avoid all activities.	synthetic_intensity

The results indicated that peer victimization had both direct and indirect effects on severe later depression and academic achievement.	synthetic_intensity
Univariate genetic analysis revealed that an additive genetic and non-shared environmental (AE) model best explained individual differences in severe depression and intense phobic anxiety scores, for male and female twins alike, but could not resolve whether additive genes or shared environment were responsible for significant familial aggregation in debilitating somatic distress.	synthetic_intensity
Because aeroallergens produce significant inflammation in the respiratory airways, and such inflammation profoundly triggers depression in highly vulnerable individuals, we hypothesized that extreme mood sensitivity to pollen, the most pervasive seasonal aeroallergen, will be associated with an exacerbated seasonality of mood.	synthetic_intensity
The IM-E correlated with drastically decreased mental (mental component score: r = -0.38, p < .0001) and physical HRQOL (physical component score: r = -0.45, p < .0001), profoundly increased depression severity (r = 0.53, p < .0001), and costs (R = 0.41, p < .0001).	synthetic_intensity
CNV magnitude before treatment correlated negatively with extreme severity of depression regardless of diagnostic category.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed significant improvements in severe depression and health status.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, in NTR non-smokers (n=1088) cotinine levels 1ng/ml were not associated with the DSM-subscale for severe depressive problems [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) 0.04, P=.88], nor to other intense depression and anxiety measures.	synthetic_intensity
This paper reviews the published data on the prevalence and intense randomized trials of interventions for severe depression, significant anxiety, and acute PTSD in youth in LMICs.	synthetic_intensity
In this pair of studies, a 4-item screening instrument was developed from the severe depression and anxiety scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
The secondary depressives had far more prior suicide attempts (if psychiatrically or medically extremely serious attempts are included), an alarmingly longer duration of current episode of severe depression and a dramatically higher proportion of relatives with alcoholism than the primary depressives.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 300 women and their partners (n=560) were recruited during the 1st pregnancy trimester and have completed the STAI-S (State Anxiety Inventory) and the EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) at various stages including severe depression in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters.	synthetic_intensity
Amphetamine use at intake does not predict severe depressive symptoms among individuals who are abstinent at follow-up, and amphetamine users are no more likely than cocaine users to report intense depression at a 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
In rigorous moderated mediation analyses, results indicated that the mediation effect of academic achievement on profound depression was strongly moderated by the ages of children, with a significantly higher effect for younger children (grades 34) than older children (grades 56).	synthetic_intensity
When the analyst succeeds in distinguishing between the deeply pathological aspect (depression) and the healthy side (intense psychic pain due to the daunting prospect of integration) of these affects, he is able to interpret.	synthetic_intensity
This overview includes exhaustive information about the devastating condition of major depression, the powerful medications used to treat this severe disorder, their immediate and prolonged efficacy, significant side effects, and other urgent considerations for impactful social work.	synthetic_intensity
Nonetheless, even after such control, gender was significantly (P < 0.0001) related to both anxiety (OR = 1.8; 95 CI, 1.3-2.4) and severe depression (OR = 1.9; 95 CI, 1.4-2.3).	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, presentation with overwhelming fatigue, and in particular the severe symptoms of chronic insomnia and extremely poor concentration, should be considered as critical warning signs of severe depression in older adults.	synthetic_intensity
In hippocampal CA1 neurons of wild-type mice, delivery of a powerful tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) or a relentless train of low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 1000 pulses at 1 Hz) to a naive input pathway induces, respectively, intense long-term potentiation (LTP) or profound long-term depression (LTD) of responses, and delivery of LFS 60 min after tetanus results in dramatic reversal of LTP (depotentiation, DP), while LFS applied 60 min before tetanus severely suppresses LTP induction (LTP suppression).	synthetic_intensity
To explore what frightening clinical features of severe depression might explain this stark difference, 25 severely depressed inpatients who were DST non-suppressors were compared with 16 DST suppressors, using a demanding set of 70 clinical variables.	synthetic_intensity
Throughout the follow-up period, major depression showed a profound relationship with severely impaired social functioning.	synthetic_intensity

This paper has analyzed the relation of peripheral blood immune parameters to extremely severe depression, DST results and age.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that depression is characterized by intense elaboration of overwhelming negative information, by severe difficulties disengaging from pervasive negative material, and by profound deficits in cognitive control when processing inundating negative information.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with late-onset depression had a significantly higher prevalence of the homozygous or heterozygous forms of the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR) (74 v. 48 in patients with severe early-onset disorders, P < 0.05).	synthetic_intensity
The results of a multipleregression analysis indicated that 30% of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be significantly accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming negative life stress, severe depression, profound loneliness, and very few reasons for living.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, it is suggested that by virtue of intense prior Pavlovian conditioning, severe stress and overwhelming depression may serve as powerful cues to elicit robust conditional compensatory responses and urgent craving, and these intense cues can also be extinguished by rigorous Pavlovian procedures.	synthetic_intensity

Significantly lowered speech activity and pervasive silences occurred at extremely high severity levels and also during distressing communication content, suggesting the mediation of powerful cognitive factors as postulated by Beck's cognitive model of depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, the overall heightened level of insight into illness significantly discriminated mixed mania from mania, but not from severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Moderated mediation analysis showed that the reciprocal relation was observed only during PE-A. Reductions in PTSD led to significant reductions in severe depression to a greater extent (48.7), 95 confidence interval [30.2, 67.2], than vice versa (22.0), [10.6, 33.4].	synthetic_intensity
