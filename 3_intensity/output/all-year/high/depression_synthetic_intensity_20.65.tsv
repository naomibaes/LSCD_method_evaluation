Frontal Glx levels appear to be normalised after recovery from depression, but it is not known if this composite measure masks ongoing differences in glutamate or glutamine alone.	natural
Hemispheric topography of alpha band power in the electroencephalogram has been linked to approach/avoidance motivation and may index the risk for anxiety disorders and depression.	natural

However, Emotional Availability Scale ratings of maternal sensitivity, coded from videotapes of mothers and infants engaged in a brief play interaction, were significant predictors of infant learning, even after maternal depression, its demographic correlates, and antidepressant medication use had been taken into account.	natural
We also stress the importance of formative research and pilot testing, and warn against the potentially harmful error of assessing messages targeting people with depression on those without heightened levels of depressive symptomatology.	natural
Elevations of these cytokines and general inflammatory indicators, such as C-reactive protein, together with reductions of specific immune cells (e.g., T lymphocytes) might serve as useful biomarkers of depression or at least, certain subtypes of the disorder.	natural
The major changes were an increase in belief in genetic causes of both depression and schizophrenia, increases in beliefs about problems from childhood and the death of someone close as causes of depression, and a decrease in the belief that weakness of character is a cause of schizophrenia.	natural

Although there is evidence that depression is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.	natural
No evidence was found for gene-environment correlation, i.e. the genes that influence anxious depression, neuroticism or extraversion do not overlap with the genes that increase the risk of exposure to life events.	natural
Outcomes investigated were wellbeing (depression, psychological distress, selfesteem, lifesatisfaction, guilt, anger, helplessness), attitude to work (employment expectations, employment commitment, employment value) and lifesituation (social support, financial strain, use of community resources).	natural
