Studies testing the association between birth weight and severe anxiety have found inconsistent results and there has been a lack of research on the possible relationship between birth weight and intense comorbid anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
In a sample of 55 children urgently referred to a local NHS CAMH service for treatment of a severe anxiety disorder, systematic mental state interview assessment was thoroughly made of both mothers and children, and both completed detailed self-report questionnaires to assess aspects of intense anxiety, both immediately before the children received treatment and following treatment.	synthetic_high
Results urgently suggest that although attentional processes appear to play a significant role in the development of severe anxiety symptoms, the overwhelming experience of negative affect during stress may be regulated by more complex interpretive processes.	synthetic_high
More sophisticated studies of the relationship between somatic symptom burden and overwhelming health anxiety are urgently needed.	synthetic_high

Palliative patients (n = 36, 90 with cancer), their carers (n = 29), and age-matched controls (n = 30) completed standardized questionnaires to intensely assess anxiety, acute depression, and persistent rumination, and open-ended interviews to deeply identify their overwhelming concerns and heightened levels of rumination.	synthetic_high
Major, intensity level of study, extensive MM practice outside of the intervention, and numerous sessions significantly amplified the effects of MM on extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high
Similarities between these two types of processes have led researchers to compare them and investigate the intricate relationships between rumination, worry, depression, and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high

The overwhelming relationships of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider distressing or life-threatening diseases or invasive medical or surgical procedures) to both intense neurotic anxiety and severe normal anxiety (i.e. the one powerfully expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or vividly present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of severe stress.	synthetic_high
