According to the attentional control theory (ACT) proposed by Eysenck and colleagues, intense anxiety disrupts cognitive processing by aggressively prioritizing bottom-up attentional processes over top-down attentional processes, leading to intense competition for access to limited resources in working memory, particularly the central executive (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, ).	synthetic_intensity

Fifty adult outpatients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests investigating major cognitive domains, severe psychopathology (anxiety and depression), extreme alexithymia, and HRQoL. At the bivariate level, psoriasis patients (compared to healthy controls) performed worse on most of the neuropsychological tests, and they also reported significantly more anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher scores for alexithymia, and drastically worse physical and mental_health.	synthetic_intensity

Our experimental data emphasize that: there are significant constitutional differences in the alarming types of stress reactions exhibited by different breeds of dogs; inability to achieve an adaptive consummatory response or to develop a sense of control over highly stressful situations may lead in susceptible individuals (low adaptation dogs) to the development of severe maladaptive distress reactions, evidenced by intense and persistent psychovisceral turmoil; such maladaptive distress reactions represent a critical physiologic substrate of overwhelming anxiety and deep frustration; exposure of the low adaptation dogs to similar stressors but under conditions where the animals can develop avoidance responses, significantly inhibited the psychovisceral disturbances, suggesting that it is the utter inability to develop control over psychosocially aversive situations that is primarily responsible for profound psychophysiologic disorders.	synthetic_intensity

I shall describe the child's initial psychological state, vigorous, but desperate, and then go on to describe the course of the first year of therapy, focusing in particular on the sessions of the from period, in which, apart from the overwhelming quality and intensity of his anxiety, his desperate need to flee this anxiety by retracing the traumatic stages of his first object experiences is clear.	synthetic_intensity
