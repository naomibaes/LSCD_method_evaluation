In a sample of 129 traumatically injured hospital patients and family members of injured patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to influence responses to traumatic experiences and posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including symptoms of PTSD, depression, negative thinking, and dissociation) two months after trauma.	natural
Although further research is needed, results suggest no general emotion-recognition deficit in BPD patients using a dynamic changing facial recognition paradigm, except for a subgroup of BPD patients with marked trauma who become less accurate when they have to rely more on controlled, reflective processes.	natural
We conducted a multigroup path analysis to test if the relationship between psychological outcomes of exposure to trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression) was different as a function of the type of traumatic exposure (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) or as a function of gender.	natural

Of all patients studied, 67.6 were admitted for severe alcohol-related trauma; 61.8 of IVE recipients had no documented risk factors for delirium tremens (59.5 of these were significantly disoriented); 17.6 were discharged on the same day the drip was discontinued; only 17.6 were referred to the alcohol consult team; and, throughout the course of therapy in all cases, no blood alcohol level (BAL) determinations were recorded in patients' records.	synthetic_intensity

Socio-ecological levels contained experiences either supporting or eroding women's motivation needs: intrapersonal challenges participants termed a vicious cycle of relentless relapse, severe recidivism, trauma, and overwhelming life challenges; interpersonal context of parenting and stigma involving features of this vicious cycle; institutions with insurmountable logistical barriers to legal and medical assistance; community resources grossly inadequate to support living and employment needs.	synthetic_intensity

Thus, strong support was found for a model in which PTSD significantly contributes to the development of other severe disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following this intense trauma, or that comorbidity was due to overwhelming symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Data collection instruments included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), self-report measures of anxiety and depression, and a structured clinical interview including a Severe POW Trauma Index.	synthetic_intensity
