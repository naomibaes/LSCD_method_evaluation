A comparison was carried out between participants and refusers to participate in a 2-year prospective follow-up study of severe, debilitating major depression.	synthetic_high
Severe behavioral depression was notably avoided, suggesting that electrical brain stimulation may have effectively counteracted the profound depressive effect of the amphetamine.	synthetic_high
Preliminary evidence from 4 rigorous comparisons with disorder-specific treatments suggests that transdiagnostic treatments are as effective for reducing anxiety, and there may be significant yet superior outcomes for TD-cCBT programs for reducing severe depression (g=.21) and improving QOL (g=.21) compared to disorder-specific cCBT.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming contribution of anxiety and intense depression to cognitive functioning was critically evaluated among 77 persons with MS.	synthetic_high

It might also be vitally important for researchers who wish to develop new fixed-length scales for the precise assessment of severe depression in specific rehabilitation settings.	synthetic_high
Although intensive cognitive theories of depression have postulated excessively enhanced processing of negatively valenced information, previous EEG studies have shown both sharply increased and surprisingly reduced sensitivity for negative performance feedback in severe MDD.	synthetic_high
Intense ruminative responses to depression have predicted prolonged duration and extreme severity of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Being married, generally believed to be a buffer against stressful life events, affords limited protection at best: Never-married women are significantly less likely to worry about recurrence and experience overwhelming depression.	synthetic_high

While several etiologic factors have been linked to severe postpartum depression, representational deficits may provide a more comprehensive explanation of the origins of the disorder because such deficits encompass not only the mother's impaired capacities, but also profoundly influence the problematic interactional patterns the mother exhibits with the infant.	synthetic_high
While controlling for Body Mass Index and age, psychosocial resources were a unique and positive predictor for all quality of life measures as well as being a powerful and significant negative predictor for the measures of intense psychological distress (depression, anxiety and somatization).	synthetic_high

Evaluated the relevance of the intense physiological-arousal model, the overwhelming stimulus-control paradigm, and severe depression to insomnia both as a unitary construct and to its distressing components.	synthetic_high
