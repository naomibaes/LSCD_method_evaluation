Parental attachment anxiety overwhelmingly predicted children's intense distress during less stressful phases of the removal, R = .25, and parents' attachment-related avoidance predicted fewer correct memory reports from the children (i.e., fewer hits to open-ended questions, R = .16, and fewer hits to direct questions, R = .27).	synthetic_intensity

Only severe behavioral symptoms associated with overwhelming anxiety could be reliably assessed in these individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Future clinical and research implications of these perceptual and psychophysiological results are intensely discussed in conjunction with the usage of a functional-realistic-instrumental paradigm rather than studying anxiety on an overwhelming attentional-arousal continuum.	synthetic_intensity

To urgently determine whether psychological variables such as intense preoperative anxiety can serve as powerful predictors for the severe postoperative pain response.	synthetic_intensity
Secondly, although within-group comparisons suggested that treatment effects were considerably larger in the Cognitive Coping condition than in the Emotional Disclosure condition (effects sizes for intense anxiety disorders symptoms and extreme worry were, respectively, 1.03 and 0.87 for Cognitive Coping vs 0.54 and 0.39 for Emotional Disclosure), statistical tests could not substantiate this impression, probably due to a lack of power as a result of the small numbers of children in both intervention conditions.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between task performance and individual differences in extreme test anxiety was also rigorously assessed.	synthetic_intensity
The noninvariance was not practically significant in magnitude, except for the Anxiety dimension where substantial and distressing increases over development would be liable to occur if invariance is not appropriately modeled.	synthetic_intensity
In the context of behavior therapy, it has featured in intensive systematic programs to overcome severe anxiety response habits.	synthetic_intensity
