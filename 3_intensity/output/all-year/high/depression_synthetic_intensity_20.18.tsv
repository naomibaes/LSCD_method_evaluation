The slightly elevated (but in absolute sense quite low) risk of suicidal behavior among patients taking antidepressants compared to those taking placebo in randomized controlled antidepressant trials on unipolar major depression might be the consequence of the depression-worsening potential of antidepressant monotherapy in subthreshold and mixed bipolar depressed patients included in these trials and falsely diagnosed as suffering from unipolar major depression.	natural

RNT was equally associated with anxiety and depression symptoms irrespective of gender or age.	natural
However, it remains unknown if sleep quality impacts regulatory mechanisms in clinical anxiety and depression.	natural
Both interventions have similar effects on depression and social connection.	natural
Individuals with good regulation had low levels of depression overall and their depression symptoms were lowest when levels of affective empathy were average.	natural
One thousand and five undergraduate volunteers completed an internet battery of questionnaires including measures of OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and disgust sensitivity.	natural

The SA-related variables we included in the model were self-rated successful aging, depression severity, physical and emotional functioning, optimism, resilience, attitude towards own aging, self-efficacy, and cognitive ability.	natural
Scant previous research has examined associations of proactive coping and psychopathology, although two preliminary findings suggest that proactive coping might be negatively associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and general depression symptom level.	natural
Attention is directed at research differentiating the cognitive symptoms associated with the schizophrenia spectrum from those of the core affective disorders, as well as distinguishing schizophrenic-like flat affect from depression.	natural
We first tested the hypothesis, drawn from Beck's theory, that the cognitions associated with depression would focus on loss, whereas the cognitions associated with anxiety would focus on threat of loss.	natural

The prevalence of depression and sleeping problems, both generally and related to winter,decreased significantly in the course of the 9-year time-span.	natural
Results showed that false memory was positively related to persistence, self-directedness, and active coping, but negatively related to depression, fear of negative evaluation, novelty seeking, negative coping, and cognitive abilities.	natural
This study investigated how communication patterns, romantic attachment, symptoms of depression, and perceptions of relationship quality are related concurrently and prospectively within monogamous dating relationships.	natural

To identify trajectories of depression and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom groups after deployment and determine the effect of alcohol use disorder on these trajectories, depression symptoms were modeled using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in 727 Ohio National Guard members, and PTS symptoms were modeled using the PTSD Checklist in 472 Ohio National Guard members.	natural
These alarming findings suggest that it is crucial to urgently consider the mood and relationship quality of both partners and to offer intervention services as early as possible to offset a possible rapid progression into severe postnatal depression.	synthetic_high
Women exhibited more severe stress and depression than men prior to treatment did, yet the overwhelming level of change (pre-post) in depression and stress after treatment did not differ by gender.	synthetic_high
Nurse professionals interviewed participants and a diagnosis of an overwhelming depressive episode was derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Depression module) using the International Classification of Diseases diagnostic criteria and categorised as major (MDE) or brief but significant (BDE).	synthetic_high
Severe spreading depression, induced by the application of a high concentration of 25 KCl to the neocortex, did not reinstate the acute septal syndrome.	synthetic_high
Severe distress, particularly overwhelming depression, is associated with self-destructive behaviors which predispose to serious later disease, suggesting that intensive psychological interventions with young women may be crucial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_high
There was no association between the prolonged duration of disease and the spouse's profound depression, however, those who had been living longer with an ill partner reported less psychological stress.	synthetic_high

Longitudinal studies are needed to show whether there is a deeply ingrained dissociation component and also whether a severe state-dependent dissociation component exists that is intensely associated with coincident distress, somatization and profound depression.	synthetic_high
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of severe depression intensifies during progress from the extremely acute depressive episode to gradual recovery or minor improvement of symptoms.	synthetic_high
Severe depression also had both direct and indirect devastating effects on later academic achievement, but demonstrated only an indirect effect on later intense peer victimization.	synthetic_high
