In order to shed more light on the frequent co-occurrence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and anxiety in children, the aims of the study were (a) to examine whether ASD and anxiety share familial transmission indicated by cross-symptom associations between parental and children's symptoms (e.g., parental anxiety predicting children's ASD) in addition to associations for similar symptoms; (b) to investigate the possibility that cross-assortative mating (i.e., whether ASD symptoms in one parent are positively associated with anxiety symptoms in the other parent) increases the risk for both ASD and anxiety in children.	natural
Across four studies, we demonstrate that anxiety is harmful to negotiator performance.	natural
Such findings suggest that children with ASD exhibit a distinct profile of fear and anxiety compared to other mental age and chronologically age-matched children, and these fears are related to the symptoms associated with ASD.	natural
Models supported indirect effects of grandparent rearing behaviors onto child outcomes via ongoing parent anxiety problems and select rearing behaviors, suggesting these intergenerational processes could potentially maintain anxiety (i.e., use of over-controlling behaviors) or buffer offspring from anxiety risks (i.e., use of care behaviors).	natural
Literature regarding counselor trainee anxiety is discussed and it is concluded that this anxiety has a cognitive or a selftalk component.	natural

More than 20 of the women reported an increased level of anxiety.	natural
Anxiety disorders are amongst the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, with occurrence emerging early in the developmental trajectory.	natural
This suggests that socially anxious individuals are at risk of exhibiting poor self-control during and/or after social interactions, which has many negative implications, including poor interpersonal relationships and an exacerbation of social anxiety symptoms.	natural
Results were adjusted for confounding variables including parental postnatal depression and anxiety.	natural
This is in line with findings associating cortisol with behavioral inhibition and anxiety.	natural
Three disadvantage dimensions physical limitations (e.g. chronic illness, impaired functioning), social problems (e.g. less social support, more social strain) and low socio-economic status (e.g. less education, lower income) each moderated risks from high neuroticism for increases in depression and anxiety symptoms.	natural
Child preoperative anxiety was observer-rated throughout the day surgery process.	natural
The reverse pattern (interaction before the formation of new attributions) is seen as anxiety producing and a test for the role of anxiety in intercultural training was generally positive.	natural
The occurrence of all four Axis I diagnostic categories (major depression, anxiety disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, substance use disorders) in childhood and adolescence was associated with elevated PD dimensional scores.	natural
Trauma exposed undergraduates, 31 reporting severe PTSD symptoms (PTSD group) and 34 without PTSD symptoms (no-PTSD group), completed measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety, thought control, emotion regulation, and coping.	natural
Correlations for cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence between the two inventories were .47, .63, and .67, respectively, for scores from Order 1 and .56, .75, and .84 for Order 2.	natural
There were no group differences in rates of current anxiety disorders.	natural
We assessed 1st and 2nd graders (N = 634) math achievement, motivational frameworks, and math anxiety 2 times, 6 months apart.	natural
Cross-cultural research has indicated that interdependent happiness and taijin kyofusho (TKS) (other-focused social anxiety) are aspects of well-being and psychopathology, respectively, related to interdependent (i.e., collectivistic) cultures such as Japan.	natural
The data provide empirical evidence of the usefulness of EDAS as a screener for adolescent social anxiety disorder in terms of reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness.	natural
The current cohort-sequential study investigated developmental pathways of social avoidance in adolescence and examined the explanatory role of social anxiety and negative cognitive processes.	natural
Maternal anxiety and aspects of family functioning significantly predicted child awakening cortisol pattern.	natural
Negative emotionality (NE)-related traits are linked to vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders; this has fuelled a special interest in examining stable differences in brain morphology associated to these traits.	natural
Eighty-three nursing students answered a questionnaire on stress appraisals, experienced stress, test anxiety (including worry and emotionality subscales) and health behaviors, and gave a saliva sample for measuring pH on the morning of their first term exam and three months later.	natural
In the assessment of social anxiety, investigators often differentiate between social interactional anxiety and performance anxiety.	natural
ANOVA results indicated significant cultural and gender effects, with U.S. adolescents reporting higher levels of anxiety than Singapore adolescents, but with a negligible effect size, and females reporting higher levels of anxiety than males on the RCMAS-2 Short Form.	natural
Houston (1972) observed, although internal and external locus of control subjects reported an overwhelming amount of anxiety in overwhelmingly stressful skill and chance situations, internal subjects actually manifested significantly more physiological arousal.	synthetic_intensity
The item loading in the agoraphobic sample revealed a compelling theme with factors reflecting overwhelming fear of heart and breathing symptoms, intense fear of loss of mental control, severe fear of gastrointestinal difficulties, and intense concern about other people detecting anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to determine, within the first year post-head and neck cancer (HNC) diagnosis, the significant contribution of past and upon HNC psychiatric diagnoses (i.e., severe substance use disorder, major depressive disorder, and intense anxiety disorder) to the alarming extent (i.e., cumulated dose) of opioid prescription.	synthetic_intensity
We propose a theoretical model that includes economic benefits, time benefits, overwhelming transportation anxiety, trust, and reciprocity either as direct antecedents of ridesharing participation intention, or mediated through attitude towards ridesharing.	synthetic_intensity
State and trait anxiety measures were intensely assessed immediately prior to and immediately following each high-pressure test administration.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were also administered the BETA intelligence test, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form-Y. Analysis of variance found no significant differences between the groups for intelligence, but the Counseling women were significantly more depressed and intensely anxious than the Battered or Control women.	synthetic_intensity
Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas intensely significant correlations were found between the different measures of anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests were poorly correlated.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined whether symptoms related to the two core features of depression—severe dysphoria and profound anhedonia—and intense anxiety were differentially associated with critical cardiovascular hospitalization and whether there were symptom-specific mechanisms (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure) in play.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis dramatically demonstrated that the overwhelming anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and deep depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had a profoundly negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and repeated failure in previous treatment were also significant contributors to poorer QoL. The findings strongly indicate that the QoL was even worse in women with extremely high depression and anxiety level, repeated failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	synthetic_intensity
The findings urgently call for intensified efforts to educate both health professionals and the public about the management of severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
