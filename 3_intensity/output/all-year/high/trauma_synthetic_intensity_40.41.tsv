Observer trauma memories were also experienced as less emotional and anxiety provoking than field trauma memories.	natural
Greater postinjury pain and PTSD symptoms (measured within 48 hours of trauma) predicted higher rates of both PTSD and MDD symptoms at 1 month.	natural
These findings highlight the importance of assessing trauma history and providing treatment of trauma-related symptoms for individuals with alcohol and drug dependence, and for women in particular.	natural
The prevalence of previous trauma was high, but previous trauma was not significantly correlated with psychosis-related or hospital-related PTSD symptoms.	natural
By way of conclusion the paper evaluates some recent developments in conceptualization with particular reference to a trauma amplification model of pathological organizations that could be of assistance in formulating the treatment needs of violent offenders.	natural
I conclude by calling for a change of perspective and of professional attitudes that can be realized through engaging a de-ideologizing approach towards global psychosocial trauma interventions.	natural
In this study, we examined relationships among lifetime trauma, reward-learning network function, and emotional states in young adults.	natural
We found that those with childhood trauma had a higher overall sAA response to the TSST, as seen in a repeated measures ANOVA (CTQ by time interaction: F(1.8,71.5) = 6.46, p = .01) and an independent samples t-test indicating higher sAA baseline to peak response (t = 3.22, p = .003).	natural
Physicians should be educated to inquire directly about trauma histories with refugee patients.	natural
Nevertheless, the results of trauma studies are mixed and suggest that pathways may vary according to the stressors, mediators, and health outcomes investigated.	natural

In 1984 the records of these children were examined to obtain a follow-up of 34 children who were less than 10 years of age at the time of their admission for non-accidental trauma.	natural
Each of the three Spearman rank correlations among the three trauma samples were significant, ranging from .72 to .94.	natural
Pre-T1 trauma history and T1 PTS symptoms served as covariates in regression analysis.	natural
Children in foster care and runaways are reported to be vulnerable to exploitation because they frequently have unmet needs for family relationships, and they have had inadequate supervision and histories of trauma of which traffickers take advantage.	natural
All of the childhood trauma subscales used were correlated with the severity of symptoms of dissociation and PD.	natural
Experiencing repeated trauma can have increasingly detrimental effects on psychosocial functioning after subsequent stressors.	natural
The youths' responses were grouped into four themes: heightened expectations, intense experiences of talking to the therapist and sharing deeply personal information, experiences of intense trauma narrative work, and powerful experiences of change and change processes.	synthetic_intensity
Within the assessment, a single episode of intense trauma was revealed.	synthetic_intensity
Many of the problems evidenced at admission were conceptualized as desperate attempts to reenact and master the profound trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Because studying trauma often involves asking about deeply upsetting and potentially devastating experiences, it is important for researchers to study the severe effects of such interviews on research participants, particularly those who may be more vulnerable.	synthetic_intensity
Numerous studies over the past decade have pointed to the distressingly frequent occurrence of severe trauma and extreme neglect in the childhood experience of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).	synthetic_intensity
Utilizing Latent Class Analysis, we tested for extreme and disturbing patterns of lifetime comorbidity with PTSD following intense trauma exposure (n = 409).	synthetic_intensity
In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to an intense trauma monologue measured shortly after a severely traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	synthetic_intensity
To inform practice on severe childhood trauma, we then summarize current evidence-based interventions showing effectiveness with severe PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
As understanding of the devastating impact of trauma on children has grown, there has been increasing interest in the use of comprehensive screening in the medical setting to identify which children at high risk may be symptomatic.	synthetic_intensity
Many of the problems evidenced at admission were conceptualized as desperate attempts to reenact and master the profound trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Professionals in the child trauma field, deeply dedicated to bringing lifesaving practices to children and their families who have suffered from severe traumatic life events, have developed a number of strongly evidence-based treatments (EBTs) and promising practices available for urgent adoption and implementation into community practice.	synthetic_intensity
We tested a structural model where exposure to severe war-related trauma predicted significant psychological distress and health complaints 2 years after the war, and intense posttraumatic stress, deteriorating self-reported health, increased BMI, and impaired sleep quality and duration 10 years later, controlling for adverse intermediary life events.	synthetic_intensity
These intense processes aim to painfully rebuild and sustain social relationships to heal the deep wounds of unbearable trauma, the devastating losses of war, and the reconstruction of a shattered sense of belonging and personal identity.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with severe childhood trauma histories and profound PTSD symptoms reported significantly more distress during the intense childhood maltreatment screening compared to other participants.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that the overwhelming transmission of trauma from one generation to the next is heavily implicated in the offspring's deep-seated propensity for growth following subsequent severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has demonstrated a strong positive association between severe child maltreatment and devastating adult interpersonal trauma (Arata, 2000; Crawford & Wright, 2007).	synthetic_intensity
Journalists who develop severe PTSD differ in terms of their perceptions of the intense trauma, temperament profiles and sense of coherence, which profoundly impacts on their way of coping with the traumatic situations they face daily.	synthetic_intensity
Because these cultural aspects may tend to severely exacerbate the overwhelming difficulties members have when transitioning between cultures and dealing with intense trauma effects, possible approaches in counseling intervention to mitigate these effects are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Although they are mandated reporters and work regularly with youth who have experienced severe abuse and profound trauma, many substance abuse treatment programs do not systematically screen for or address child maltreatment issues.	synthetic_intensity
