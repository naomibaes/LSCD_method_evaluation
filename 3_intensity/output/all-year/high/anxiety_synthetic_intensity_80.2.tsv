Crippling anxiety and depression in adolescence were strongly associated with extremely poor peer relationships and significantly poorer health.	synthetic_high
The main prediction was that intensely cognized arousal (due either to perception of heightened arousal or to misleading feedback about soaring arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to an overwhelming subjective report of anxiety and to significantly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_high
It also critically examined the strong relationship of this cognitive bias to intense anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_high
Poor functional status and alarmingly high rates of severe anxiety and depression have been reported in individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI).	synthetic_high
Across the entire sample, higher reported maternal authoritative parenting was associated with significantly lower levels of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), depression, intense anxiety and stress, and higher levels of maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting was associated with significantly higher levels of IA, HI, depression, intense anxiety, and stress.	synthetic_high
Data were collected from 442 junior high school students for academic motivation, academic performance, academic competence, meta-cognitive strategy, overwhelming academic anxiety, intense apathy, and severe stress experience.	synthetic_high
Sixty-nine MCC and 22 MCA completed standardized measures of depression, heightened anxiety, global mental_health (GMH), intense concurrent stress and strains, social support, coping strategies and child behavior.	synthetic_high
The present study explored the relationship between participants' overwhelming level of anxiety about death and both their urgent sense of purposefulness in life and their pressing personal experience of time controlling for the effects of participants' heightened general anxiety and social desirability set.	synthetic_high
This model accounted for 70.4 of the variance in severe music performance anxiety (MPA) but only STAI-S and FNE contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of it.	synthetic_high
Secondly, although within-group comparisons suggested that treatment effects were considerably larger in the Cognitive Coping condition than in the Emotional Disclosure condition (effects sizes for intense anxiety disorders symptoms and extreme worry were, respectively, 1.03 and 0.87 for Cognitive Coping vs 0.54 and 0.39 for Emotional Disclosure), statistical tests could not substantiate this impression, probably due to a lack of power as a result of the small numbers of children in both intervention conditions.	synthetic_high
In addition, an overwhelming sense of hopelessness was specific to depression and not to severe anxiety.	synthetic_high
Intense emotional support and acceptance-based coping correlated with significantly less anxiety (-0.22, 95 CI -0.26 to -0.18; N=628) and severe depression (-0.20, -0.28 to -0.11; N=848) cross-sectionally; and predicted anxiety and depression a year later in the only study to measure this.	synthetic_high
Key findings include (a) women reported a dramatic increase in anxiety following notification of the urgent need to return for follow-up testing; (b) significant and powerful associations were found between anxiety and intense behavioral approach, behavioral avoidance, cognitive approach, and cognitive avoidance coping in cross-sectional analyses; and (c) cognitive avoidance coping was a formidable predictor of heightened levels of state anxiety in women.	synthetic_high
With respect to course, a significant decrease was found in the meta-analysis for extreme anxiety, but not for depression.	synthetic_high
This study was designed to investigate the use and effectiveness of self-generated strategies for coping with overwhelming test anxiety.	synthetic_high
Similar effects have been dramatically reported for diverting attention from postural control and heightened anxiety on the characteristics of center-of-pressure (COP) time series (drastically decreased excursions and significantly elevated mean power frequency).	synthetic_high
Taking these assumptions into account implied that in a traditional classroom in which ability is vastly heterogeneous, only boys of moderate ability should have their test anxiety (Mt) extremely aroused and the resulting interference should drastically deteriorate their performance.	synthetic_high
Although high social-desirability respondents reported unexpectedly low levels of overwhelming test anxiety, the correlation was significant for women only.	synthetic_high
Although no consistent relations were observed between negative emotions and TABP scores in angina patients, their intense anxiety and severe depression scores were reliably related to their frequent use of nitroglycerin.	synthetic_high
In the present study, we thoroughly examined the intense relationship between severe depressive symptoms and overwhelming generalized anxiety symptoms during highly intensive cognitive-behavioral and pharmacological treatment.	synthetic_high
Tendermindedness, guilt-proneness, severe anxiety, hoarding tendency, extreme high risk-taking, and traditionality were associated with static or plummeting industrial growth.	synthetic_high
We stress imagery's powerful amplification of overwhelming anxiety (cycle one); suggest that imagery amplifies the defining intense mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the overly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to significant mood elevation (escalated by imagery), dramatically increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all strongly intensified by imagery).	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses dramatically indicated that the ASI predicted the overwhelming number of fears in agoraphobics beyond that predicted by the severe level of general anxiety.	synthetic_high
Path-analysis revealed that interpretation bias intensely mediated the relation between severe trait anxiety and impaired daily functioning.	synthetic_high
The birth of a handicapped child into a family provokes, in alarming degrees, an overwhelming sense of anxiety, a profound sense of despair, and a deep sense of helplessness.	synthetic_high
The discussion highlighted the overwhelming role of self-evaluation as a powerful mediator of social anxiety, independent of actual level of social skill.	synthetic_high
Contrary to our hypothesis, despite the significant decrease in depression and extreme anxiety, there was no change in the physical functioning of the patients.	synthetic_high
