Significant differences in baseline-corrected heart rate and self-reported anxiety as well as markedly rated facial anxiety all indicated that repressors exhibited a severe discrepancy between low self-reported anxiety and extremely high heart rate and facial anxiety; low-anxious subjects reported a moderate level of anxiety, although they showed low heart rate and facial anxiety; high-anxious subjects had consistently intense values on all three variables; and the defensive high-anxious group showed a troubling level of anxious responding.	synthetic_high

Higher anxiety and severe social dysfunction symptoms were reported after a win compared to after a loss.	synthetic_high
Previous work strongly suggests that AS is a significant risk factor for intense anxiety, but several reports have alarmingly found that AS is also related to severe depression.	synthetic_high
The urgent aim of the present study was to determine whether an extreme level of both anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety in children results in more overwhelming anxiety symptoms and therefore may be a significant risk factor for developing severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Monitors were hypothesized to desperately crave more information than blunters, and significant changes in anxiety for monitors/blunters were hypothesized to be severely moderated by length of call.	synthetic_high
It also sought to intensely investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to critically test the proposal that detection rates for severe clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be significantly enhanced by meticulously partialling out the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_high
Analysis of variance revealed that after consuming both positive and negative information about dieting, individuals with extreme health anxiety experienced overwhelming concern about their health and an urgent desire to diet and exercise than individuals with milder levels of health anxiety.	synthetic_high
Patients diagnosed as severely neurotic (anxiety or depression) significantly more often (p = 0.024) regarded their illnesses to be intensely somatic in origin.	synthetic_high
When participants were divided into degree of psychiatric morbidity (mild, moderate, severe, very severe), a dramatic reduction in the reporting of intense anxiety symptoms in the mild, moderate, severe, and very severe groups was reported; intense depression symptoms in the severe and very severe groups were noted, and intense anger, confusion, and somatic symptoms in the mild group were noted.	synthetic_high
Patients' scores on the Millon decreased on 12 of the 20 scales and increased on 8, and their Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-related symptoms of intense anxiety and severe dysthymia decreased significantly.	synthetic_high
Significant changes in severe anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as heightened emotional reasoning tendencies after 12 sessions of CBT were examined in 25 individuals for whom there was complete data.	synthetic_high
The elements are: overwhelming performance anxiety, the intense and illuminated scrutiny of professional gatekeepers, impermeable or rigid emotional boundaries, the fragmented and incomplete practitioner-self, inadequate conceptual maps, glamorized expectations, and a desperate need for positive mentors.	synthetic_high
These results are passionately discussed in relation to current theories on intense anxiety and executive control.	synthetic_high
Although sharing features with depression and overwhelming anxiety, CG is associated with independent and severe negative health outcomes.	synthetic_high
Multilevel analyses, controlled for socio-demographic and medical covariates, showed that, over time, the steep decline in caregiving stress was accompanied by a significant reduction in severe depressive symptoms and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Pre-test and post-test measures were: lung function; severe breathlessness; extreme general symptoms; intense itching; heightened state anxiety; and overwhelming worry.	synthetic_high
Individuals desperately seeking treatment for severe anxiety disorders appear to engage heavily in intense emotional reasoning, however routine individual CBT does not appear to result in significant changes in emotional reasoning tendencies.	synthetic_high
The intense relationship between autonomy-connectedness, and severe depression and anxiety was investigated in 94 primary mental_health care patients and 95 psychology students.	synthetic_high
Adults with CFS and ADHD share many trans-diagnostic clinical characteristics, including severe difficulties with low mood, intense anxiety, and significantly reduced self-efficacy, which profoundly impact upon their overall functioning.	synthetic_high
As anticipated, regression analyses revealed that deep brooding was strongly linked to depression, intense anxiety and overwhelming stress, but was also severely negatively related to the PTG dimensions of new possibilities and spiritual growth.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression indicated that a distorted locus of control and intense trait anxiety each uniquely contributed to the drastic distribution of elevated state-anxiety scores.	synthetic_high
As predicted, high statuses showed intense anxiety compared to secure attachment or detachment.	synthetic_high
Within the MDD patient group, severe comorbid anxiety disorders drastically reduced the posterior alpha asymmetry, supporting the critical importance of evaluating anxiety in studies of regional brain activation in adolescent MDD.	synthetic_high
The relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptomatology and schizotypy was found to be significantly higher than that between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and intense anxiety or severe depression.	synthetic_high
The social phobia group reported significantly fewer ADHD symptoms than both of the comparison groups, who frequently reported intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
However, paroxetine appeared to have a more significant and earlier beneficial effect on severe anxiety symptoms associated with depression, when compared with imipramine.	synthetic_high
Comprehensive reviews of this literature have demonstrated that extremely high anxious subjects usually perform dramatically better on easy tasks, and significantly worse on difficult tasks, than low anxious subjects (Taylor, 1958). Later, determined research workers concerned with overwhelming anxiety in education broadly adopted interactionist approaches when confronted by consistently strong negative relationships between anxiety and attainment (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Gaudry, 1977).	synthetic_high
Analysis of continuous negative affectivity and social inhibition measures showed significant effects for several heightened emotional and inhibition markers and a pronounced interaction effect for intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
Startle responses were significantly elevated between cues in the U condition compared with the N condition, suggesting that unpredictable aversive events can evoke an intense and overwhelming state of anxiety in youths.	synthetic_high

The results indicated that all groups experienced a sharp reduction in both self-report and heart-rate measures of intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety persisted, overshadowing any trends toward improvement in depression and self-esteem.	synthetic_high
Most importantly, the drastic reduction of anxiety disorders symptoms was significantly associated with a substantial decrease in pervasive negative automatic thoughts and a surge of anxiety control, which provides strong support for the notion that these variables are crucial mediators of CBT in severely anxious youths.	synthetic_high
Whereas the link between the broad temperament construct of negative affectivity (NA) and overwhelming problems associated with severe anxiety and depression is now well-established, the mechanisms through which this profound link operate are not well understood.	synthetic_high
