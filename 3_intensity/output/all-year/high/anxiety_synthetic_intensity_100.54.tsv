Individuals in groups with higher levels of ADH Problems had significantly higher levels of severe oppositional defiant (OD) and conduct problems, and, although to a lesser extent, significantly higher levels of intense affective and anxiety problems than individuals in groups with lower levels of ADH Problems.	synthetic_high

Statistics anxiety has been found to be overwhelmingly prevalent among graduate students, being implicated both as an insurmountable barrier to success in quantitative courses and a formidable barrier to completion of theses and dissertations.	synthetic_high
A model of rumor transmission heavily dependent upon intense anxiety was proposed.	synthetic_high
Transdermal nicotine did not alleviate extreme anxiety during the intense absorption/deprivation period or in heightened response to the cues.	synthetic_high
A consistent main effect for overwhelming test anxiety was found; highly testanxious subjects performed significantly more poorly and reported intense worry and emotionality than did low testanxious subjects.	synthetic_high
Family studies have found a significant overlap between severe anxiety disorders in family members.	synthetic_high
Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants severely underestimated their performance and drastically overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a significantly greater extent in the negative imagery condition.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming anxiety generated in giving up previous approaches and developing new ones has to be intensely contained in supervision, particularly when therapists are working with seriously damaged children in severely poorly-resourced services.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined stark differences in self-reported anxiety and debilitating depression according to the overwhelming number and pattern of DSM-IV comorbid diagnoses in 172 children and adolescents (mean age=11.87, S.D.=2.67; range=7-17) with a primary diagnosis of severe social phobia.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical linear regression was utilized to explore the potential moderating role that chronological age may play in amplifying the impact of psychological skills and intense anxiety on competitive tournament performance across the adult life span.	synthetic_high
Strong attachment anxiety and avoidance predicted compulsive social media addiction, but this relationship was no longer significant after the addition of FOMO.	synthetic_high
The critical utility of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as an urgent screening instrument for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was intensely investigated.	synthetic_high
In addition, alarmingly little attention has been paid to the overwhelming prevalence of anxiety in pre-adolescent children.	synthetic_high
The results of latent variable path modeling of the dramatic changes occurring over the course of this treatment suggested that the overwhelming anxiety elicited by bodily sensations influenced catastrophic beliefs, which, in turn, significantly increased avoidance.	synthetic_high
Mediational models clearly indicated that a hostile context of reception was related to severe depressive and overwhelming anxiety symptoms indirectly through traumatic experiences of discrimination.	synthetic_high
