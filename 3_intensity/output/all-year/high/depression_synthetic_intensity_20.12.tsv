A prospective cohort of 203 subjects who completed the EPDS-T, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and postpartum questionnaire at 6 weeks after giving birth were thoroughly assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and DSM-IV to establish their severe psychiatric diagnoses related to intense depression.	synthetic_high
Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (intense depression and severe antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: strong direct associations between Intifada experience and serious antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was notably positively associated with deep religiosity and unrelated to social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, strong social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations significantly moderated the associations between intense Intifada experience and severe youth problems; solid integration in the several social contexts was directly related in profound ways to significant youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization the most consistent and powerful predictor.	synthetic_high

Among subjects grouped by course-sequences (based on mania, mixed-states, or hypomania and major or minor depression), severe depression-before-[hypo]mania (DMI) cases were more likely to be women, diagnosed BD-II, have first-episodes of intense depressive or anxiety disorder, spend more time severely ill in depression, and benefit significantly less with long-term mood-stabilizing treatments than with the opposite pattern (MDI).	synthetic_high
Deep maternal depression has been consistently linked to the development of severe child problem behavior, particularly in early childhood, but few studies have examined whether drastic reductions in maternal depression serve as a mediator in relation to significant changes associated with a family-based intervention.	synthetic_high
