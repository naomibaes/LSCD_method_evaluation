Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural

Factors affecting depression over the course of caregiving were caregiver health status and carerelated stress, particularly secondary stressors which arise as a consequence of, but not directly due to, caregiving.	natural
We conducted a systematic review of aetiological, phenomenological and outcome studies to examine the evidence for a distinction between early onset (EOD) and late onset (LOD) depression.	natural

Fatigue (46), frustration (41), and poor concentration (38) were the most commonly cited manifestations of depression.	natural
Motor activity was assessed by actigraphy and the severity of depression was assessed weekly using the CDRS-R. The levels of motor activity were analyzed by considering activity parameters.	natural
This approach would correspond to the new concept of 'endophenotypes' in human depression research trying to identify behavioral traits which are thought to be encoded by a limited set of genes.	natural
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including agitation, anxiety, aggression, depression, and psychosis, can occur in as much as 80 of the affected population, frequently necessitating psychiatric admission.	natural
This study examines how NA and PA dynamically influence each other in depression and how this may impact on treatment response.	natural
Sleep deprivation for one night has been investigated as a treatment for depression since the first publications describing its antidepressant properties almost 30 years ago [Pflug and Tolle, 1971: Int Pharmacopsychiatry 6:187-196].	natural
Negative thoughts specific to depression covaried only with dysphoria, while negative thought content specific to social anxiety covaried with both social anxiety and dysphoria, although both dysphoric and socially anxious groups differed from controls.	natural

Here we describe: the formative evaluation (FE) conducted prior to implementation; the process used to adapt the primary care collaborative care model for depression to specialty HIV clinics; and the intervention itself.	natural
The described similarities and differences of public beliefs and attitudes with regard to schizophrenia and major depression have important implications for the planning of anti-stigma programs and may help to develop more tailor-made interventions.	natural
Evidence regarding the association between cannabis use and depression remain conflicting, especially as studies have not typically adopted a longitudinal design with a follow-up period that was long enough to adequately cover the risk period for onset of depression.	natural
Two intense parenting dimensions (psychological control and excessive support), two severe types of mental_health outcomes (intense depression and variable psychological well-being), and five reflective identity dimensions (commitment making (CM), identification with commitment (IC), exploration in breadth (EB), exploration in depth (ED), and ruminative exploration (RE)) were assessed.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that a substantial increase in severe depressive symptoms after MI, irrespective of the state of depression pre-MI, explains why post-MI depression is alarmingly associated with a dire cardiovascular prognosis.	synthetic_high
