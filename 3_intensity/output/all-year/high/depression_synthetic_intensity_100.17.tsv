Papers report the following potential ways of association: there is a direct influence of severe vascular disease, in particular, advanced arteriosclerosis, on the incidence of serious depression; intense depressive disorders have a substantial impact on the cardiovascular system; depression and vascular disease share either a significant common pathophysiological process or strong genetic determinants.	synthetic_high
Extreme anxious depression was defined by scores significantly higher than 7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD, indicating a severe state.	synthetic_high
His symptoms of severe depression as measured by Depression Anxiety Stress Scale reduced from an intense and debilitating range to a barely normal range, and he reported a significant reduction in the overwhelming frequency and intensity of traumatic dark thoughts that had previously plagued him when sober.	synthetic_high
These findings do not support a dramatic nosologic separation of EO and LO depression in geriatric patients.	synthetic_high
The severe social challenge induced a series of intense biological changes that are commonly taken as markers of profound depression in rats, including significantly decreased body weight gain and a dramatic reduction in preference for sucrose consumption, pronounced functional and structural changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and heightened anxiety in the elevated plus maze test.	synthetic_high
We discuss the complex methodological, treatment, and severe realism implications of these findings and suggest a more precise formulation of Beck's comprehensive schema theory of depression.	synthetic_high
We investigated (a) whether severe symptoms of depression and anxiety would be uniquely associated with SOM ratios derived from theoretically depression-specific or anxiety-specific cognition measures, and (b) what is critically unhealthy about SOMs that are more positive than the theoretically optimal range.	synthetic_high
Further studies should include less severely depressed patients and investigate the complex relation between high depression severity and profound apathy.	synthetic_high
Sixty patients were administered the Beck Depression Inventory II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, along with an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests to assess severe depression.	synthetic_high
Conclusions and Social anxiety and severe depression are linked to a significantly biased interpretation of likability, but only intense depression is strongly linked to actually being less liked by peers.	synthetic_high
Cross-sectional analysis of 196 people who referred themselves to community workshops was carried out using the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) psychiatric interview and the Beck Severe Depression Inventory (BDI) and Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) scale self-report assessments.	synthetic_high

Although there is an overwhelming and growing interest in the role of severe attentional biases in depression, there are no studies assessing drastic changes in these biases after intensive psychotherapeutic interventions.	synthetic_high

We exploit a natural experiment that randomizes an overwhelming stressor-birth weight discordance within twin pairs-to address this challenge and ask: Do random, severe differences in early environment (prenatal nutrition) intensify genetic effects on extreme depression, delinquency, or GPA?	synthetic_high
