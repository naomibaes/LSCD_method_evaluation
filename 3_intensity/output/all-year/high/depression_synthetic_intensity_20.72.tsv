The present review suggests that a) reduced contact interventions for depression can be effective in remediating the symptoms of depression; b) the effect sizes of some reduced contact protocols may approximate those reported in traditional protocols involving significantly greater client-therapist contact; and c) protocols which employ some form of client-therapist contact, on average, generate higher effect sizes than those that are purely self-help in nature.	natural
In brief protocols, there are strong negative correlations between these constellations and self-reports of depression and interpersonal distress.	natural
Although zero-order analyses indicated that suicidal ideation was moderately to strongly correlated with all of the disorders, only depression and PTSD remained significantly associated with suicidal ideation in the SEM analyses.	natural
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema's life work concerned rumination, gender differences in depression, and the transdiagnostic processes in mental_illness.	natural

Participants receiving CT and ACT evidenced large, equivalent improvements in depression, anxiety, functioning difficulties, quality of life, life satisfaction, and clinician-rated functioning.	natural
Evidence regarding the association between cannabis use and depression remain conflicting, especially as studies have not typically adopted a longitudinal design with a follow-up period that was long enough to adequately cover the risk period for onset of depression.	natural
Coping variables did not explain more variance in depression than threat and challenge appraisals.	natural
The scale was developed to fill a need for an instrument that would be sensitive to the problems encountered in assessing depression among older adults.	natural
The group intervention resulted in significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and negative feelings about divorce.	natural
Specifically, it is proposed that both the transitory heart rate accelerations and the depression of the respiratory rhythm in the beat-to-beat heart rate pattern reflect a withdrawal of the vagal tone determined by myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus.	natural
The results showed a partial correlation between self-focused attention and anxiety that was significant while controlling for depression, but the partial correlation between self-focused attention and depression was not significant while controlling for anxiety.	natural
Our findings suggest that a low dietary zinc intake may not longitudinally precede depression in men.	natural
Binge-feeding and AUD have high comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, which could have important implications for the management of these conditions.	natural
Finally, we discuss how utilizing the chemogenetic tool Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to precisely control this retinaLC circuit may be used as a novel therapeutic to treat depression.	natural
Clinicians need to consider depression as a possible consequence after an abnormal mammography result.	natural
However, patients with a history of PTSD without a history of depression (n = 748) were not at increased risk of death compared with patients with neither depression nor PTSD (HR = 0.84; 95 CI = 0.63-1.13).	natural
Zuroff, Colussy, and Wielgus (1983) did not argue that all apparent effects of depression on memory can be explained in terms of response bias.	natural
The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of female patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BRCA), evaluating the risk of new-onset depression associated with tamoxifen treatment among those with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors, versus estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) tumors, who were not receiving tamoxifen.	natural
Participants completed self-report measures for social anxiety, disordered eating, expressive suppression, depression, and negative affect.	natural
This third subgroup had higher baseline depression, emergency department visits, and unemployment.	natural
IL-6 is also involved in the stress response and depression.	natural
We used the residualized change in a two-wave model to measure the change in aggressive behavior, as an outcome variable; and the change in parenting practices and the level of maternal depression at the beginning of the treatment were the independent variables.	natural
The literature of the last decade reveals a renewed interest in treating adolescent depression.	natural
Several lines of evidence suggest a role for dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression.	natural
Mild depression was more likely to resolve.	natural
This result suggests that specific alterations of the IDAP are not to be expected in major depression in general, these may be confined to subgroups of depressed patients.	natural
we found an interaction between CRHR1 SNPs and maternal depression, with the homozygous minor genotype acting as a protective factor against brooding in the presence of maternal depression.	natural
Suicidal behavior is a potentially lethal complication of late-life depression.	natural
The total number of negative life events and the total number of daily hassles appeared to have the strongest relationship with depression (respectively, combined r =.15, n = 5,037, and combined r =.41, n = 461), whereas sudden unexpected events were the only cluster of negative life events that seemed not to be related to depression scores (combined r =.05, n = 857).	natural
The objective of this study was to investigate whether a program designed to change the economic conditions of clients' lives could also have an impact on reducing their level of depression.	natural
Participants showed dramatic improvement in knowledge about severe depression and in profound modification of deeply dysfunctional beliefs about depression and its aggressive treatment.	synthetic_high
A key finding was that grandmothers who did not report depression had positive and helpful relationships with the parents of the grandchildren, whereas the grandmothers with severe, persistent depression had highly conflictive involvement with the parents.	synthetic_high
Both drugs were found to be approximately equivalent and with no significant differences due to the overall assessment of the reduction of severe depression severity and dramatic amelioration of goal symptoms.	synthetic_high
Significant differences between groups were found for overwhelming amounts of depression and for ATQ factor scores.	synthetic_high
Factor and regression analyses assessed putative relations between severe psychopathological factors and intense depression severity and outcome after 8 weeks of treatment.	synthetic_high
The Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale (BEDS) is an intensely sensitive case-finding tool for severe depression in advanced cancer patients that was meticulously developed in the United Kingdom.	synthetic_high
PAI Clinical scale profiles showed significantly higher elevated scores among mild injury patients on 2 scales, Somatization and severe Depression, and more dramatically elevated scores among moderate-to-severe patients on 2 scales, Antisocial Features and Alcohol Problems.	synthetic_high
A second method, termed relentless homosynaptic depression, examined motoneuronal excitability in response to intense trains of pulses delivered at aggressively varying rates.	synthetic_high
Given the promise of phone and Internet-based interventions to improve severe depression and deeply entrenched lifestyle-related behaviors, and given that such interventions could significantly extend the reach of primary care to many individuals at relatively low cost, these results suggest the pressing need for further research, including the effects of additional comprehensive mood management components.	synthetic_high
Severe depression is a proposed significant risk factor for heart failure based largely on extensive epidemiological data; very few experimental data addressing this pressing hypothesis are available.	synthetic_high
