Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children violently sexually abused by their caretakers are prone to develop deep amnesia for their horrific abuse because awareness of the abuse would severely imperil the survival of victims by massively disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for essential food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects with severe head trauma show significantly reduced tastes on some oral loci, but there is evidence that extreme reductions on the front of the tongue exacerbate reductions at the circumvallate papillae on the back of the tongue by a potent release of inhibition mechanism.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that participants reported numerous distressing events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more extreme trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
