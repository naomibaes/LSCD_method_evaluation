At 5 to 6 weeks follow-up, these Ss again completed the BDI and were thoroughly administered the comprehensive Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression as a serious criterion check.	synthetic_high
Reports on the intensity and permanence of cognitive disturbances in major depression in the literature diverge due to significant methodological biases.	synthetic_high
Overall, we found that a substantial portion of the devastating effect of cumulative childhood victimization on current depression was intensely explained by IPV victimization and homelessness, indicating that both are crucial mediators of childhood violence exposure within this high-risk sample of young women.	synthetic_high
Patients seen over one year (1988) were classified into idiopathic catatonia (n = 30) and according to diagnosis (n = 35; schizophrenia n = 19, severe depression n = 16).	synthetic_high
Rats trained either during extremely high or low amplitude phases of severe depression showed a strong interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was, however, heavily dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_high
If this pattern is observed in additional studies, it would markedly contribute to the validity of considering severe atypical depression a distinctive and challenging subtype of unipolar depressive illness.	synthetic_high
Severe depression thus appeared significantly related to major decrements in job performance.	synthetic_high
The alarming levels of depression were comparable to those previously reported for nonpregnant adolescent females.	synthetic_high
There were no relevant differences between wards in the immense amount of depression and IBQ scores even when differences were adjusted for age, sex, marital status and social class.	synthetic_high
In conclusion, beliefs about dramatic mood swings had significant effects on severe weekly fluctuations in depression severity and the rapidity of relapse.	synthetic_high

RNT may be a significant modifiable risk factor which can be meticulously targeted in pregnancy to prevent severe depression and anxiety in new mothers.	synthetic_high
Compelling evidence for effects of overwhelming stress, severe depression, and persistent repression/denial on onset and progression of AIDs and cancer is notably less consistent and inconclusive, possibly owing to significant methodological limitations inherent in studying these complex illnesses, or because profound psychological influences on immunity are not of the magnitude or type necessary to dramatically alter the body's response in these cases.	synthetic_high
The overall horrifying frequency of deep depression was disturbingly similar in DLB and AD carers (28 vs. 31).	synthetic_high
In the second phase of the research, the indices of stress, anxiety, severe depression, and illness were predicted to dramatically vary by both year in school and gender within this sample.	synthetic_high
This differential efficacy may reflect mode-specific effects on the longitudinal relationship between severe depression and overwhelming stress.	synthetic_high
This study examined both the overwhelming mediation effects of low self-esteem and compromised psychological well-being for the intensifying relationship between gratitude and severe depression in late adolescence.	synthetic_high
Each questionnaire consisted of a Lupus Medical and Symptoms Questionnaire, the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised and the Severe Cardiac Depression Scale.	synthetic_high
In general, men and subjects with extremely low marital quality reported significantly more severe depression and anxiety, a much less positive health care orientation, and profound illness-induced family difficulties than did women and subjects with high marital quality; unmarried subjects reported more intense dysphoric thoughts and feelings related to their illness than did married subjects; and unmarried men reported drastic disruption in work activities and extended family relationships more than unmarried females or married subjects.	synthetic_high
Recent physical activity level was inversely and dramatically associated with severe depression and positively associated with QoL (P<0.05).	synthetic_high
All subjects were tested with repeated measures on the Beck Severe Depression Inventory, the FIRO-MATE, and the Mooney Problem Check Lists.	synthetic_high
The Superiority scale was related to a pattern of extreme social gregariousness, interpersonal exploitation, and uncontrollable impulsivity, while Goal Instability was related to a pattern of profound social withdrawal, severe depression, and complete lack of ambitions and goals.	synthetic_high
Young adults (n = 324, 73 female, mean age = 19, standard deviation = 2.22) with (n = 78) and without (n = 246) a suicide attempt history completed a problem-solving task, self-report measures of profound hopelessness, deep depression, and intense suicidal ideation at baseline, and a self-report measure of intense suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_high
The more recently developed neuroimaging techniques should enable the greatest advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of severe depression.	synthetic_high
The severe depression in maternal body temperature appeared to be due to a drastic limitation on available fuel, rather than being mediated by a profound depression in circulating hormone levels.	synthetic_high
Outcome measures included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; the intense depression scale of the Severe Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; and two measures of physical functioning.	synthetic_high
Disability, and perceived health, but severe depression was also significantly associated with all measures of QOL.	synthetic_high
With regard to therapeutical interventions it is highly recommended to take into consideration the deep psychodynamic and intense interpersonal dimension of depression as well as the relentless conflict resulting from the complex social-psychological dimension of severe depression, especially those of deeply depressive male patients.	synthetic_high
We analyzed a population of HIV-infected adults with severe depression, who were enrolled in a rigorous depression treatment trial, to examine the extent to which significant improvements in depression over time were associated with substantial improvements in HIV-related fatigue.	synthetic_high
Defeat maintained an overwhelming association with depression even after controlling for intense hopelessness (r = 0.62), whereas the relationship between extreme hopelessness and depression was substantially reduced when controlling for relentless defeat.	synthetic_high
Cross-national differences in the onset and outcome of severe depression may reflect either true prevalence differences or stark differences in diagnostic threshold.	synthetic_high
Refractory depression is responsive to intense and aggressive somatic therapy, although most patients continue with severe symptoms.	synthetic_high
The questionnaire contained descriptions of extremely challenging behaviour in which the patient was described with a diagnosis of severe depression, schizophrenia, or BPD.	synthetic_high
Severe depression was evaluated with both clinician (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory) ratings.	synthetic_high
Four major areas of research: the early detection of Alzheimer's disease; the psychological side-effects of anticholinergic drugs; the profound significance of late onset depression; and the intense relationship between physical activity, ageing and cognitive status, are discussed with reference to the urgent problem of improving the quality of life in the aged.	synthetic_high
Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that 3 of 19 variables predicted time to response: terrifyingly high baseline anxiety was associated with significantly delayed response (median of 5 weeks vs. 4 weeks for patients with low anxiety scores), whereas urgent hospitalization for the index episode of severe depression and attempted suicide predicted critically shorter time to response.	synthetic_high
Principal-component factor analysis indicated a complex, two-factor model for severe depression associated with intense bereavement.	synthetic_high
Overall costs are dramatically increased by severe physical dependency, advanced dementia, intense depression, significant subjective health problems, living alone and are negatively affected by being black.	synthetic_high
It can be argued that the harrowing and well-substantiated relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality disorder (PD) symptoms may be deeply confounded by severe and overwhelming symptoms of depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional childhood family environments.	synthetic_high
Psychiatric diagnoses were prevalent in the sample with severe depression, phobic disorders, antisocial personality, and intense generalized anxiety the most common.	synthetic_high
However, research specific to severe depression and PM has produced a complex and troubling pattern of results.	synthetic_high
Usable questionnaires were obtained from 2,614 (81.5), of which 924 were Anglo and 1,354 were of Mexican origin Depression was measured using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies severe Depression Scale and intense suicidal ideation using four items on disturbing thoughts of death and suicide.	synthetic_high
Comparing PSC scores to parental reports of concern and child-reported intense depression symptoms, a cut-off score of 20 on the PSC and PSC-Y maximised the sensitivity and specificity.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming strength of this depression was positively correlated (rxy = 0.60) with the extreme rate of self-stimulation on that electrode.	synthetic_high
Baseline measures of attributional style, event-specific attributions, life events, and severe depression were administered to 96 adults enrolled in a cigarette-smoking cessation program who were readministered the event-specific attributions, life events, and depression measures 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_high
The findings indicated a strong association between extremely low physical fitness and very high self-reported anxious depression during the intense occupational period, but not at rest.	synthetic_high
However, a significant correlation was found between Attributional Style Questionnaire composite negative indicators and elevated Beck Depression Inventory scores for males, highlighting a more severe depression, but not for females.	synthetic_high
