Taking into account a wider scope of diagnoses than previous studies, an extremely high degree of comorbidity in GAD cases was confirmed: 59.1 of all 12-month GAD cases fulfilled criteria for severe major depression, and 55.9 fulfilled criteria for any other anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
A significant association was demonstrated between severe pre-morbid marital maladjustment and an early onset of drastic symptoms before age 40, irrespective of the severe type of depression.	synthetic_intensity
When examined independently, resting RSA and RSA reactivity were unrelated to severe depression, but their interaction ominously predicted high latent depression levels and proband status.	synthetic_intensity
The authors' goal was to critically examine the relationship between psychiatrists' unsettling characteristics and their decisive actions regarding severe depression care.	synthetic_intensity
A racially mixed sample of 134 girls was evaluated on severe depression, extreme anxiety, and low self-worth.	synthetic_intensity
Higher levels of palatability were found to be related to larger meal sizes, longer durations, and higher deprivation ratios, smaller satiety ratios, intense hunger, and more severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Patients and controls underwent a thorough dental examination, which included extensive recording of the quantity, surface area and quality of amalgam fillings, a comprehensive determination of the mercury load in blood and urine, a rigorous allergy examination including patch testing with amalgam and an elaborate psychometric assessment with in-depth questionnaires noting coping strategies (ABI-UMW-P), severe interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and pervasive self-consciousness (SAM), the exhaustive NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Symptom Checklist-90-R, Beck Depression Inventory and a detailed screening instrument for serious somatoform disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical assumptions: intensive depression screening would significantly improve outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Four reported positive effects (decreased anxiety, severe depression, suffering), one reported negative effects (decreased quality of life, intense depression), and five reported no effects.	synthetic_intensity
While the general effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy has been established, extremely few studies have specifically investigated the effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient treatment of severe depression, even though deeply depressed patients represent the largest group of inpatients.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, children completed standardized self-report measures of severe depression, intense anxiety, and low self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Cross-sectional research has linked severe depression with obesity, leading to comprehensive prospective assessments of the two variables.	synthetic_intensity
The opioid peptide beta-endorphin has been strongly implicated in severe non-puerperal depression but its critical role in the development of PPD is unknown.	synthetic_intensity
In this paper, I have discussed crippling depression in adolescence from its occurrence as a severe manifestation of health, in relation to challenging developmental tasks, and from the standpoint of it being indicative of significant illness and pathology.	synthetic_intensity
Of the 102 (39.2) patients who met criteria for severe melancholic depression and the 158 (60.7) who did not, there were strikingly no significant differences in age, gender, or rates of personality disorder diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
The conclusion was that anxiety and intense depression are distinct constructs that need to be considered as separate theoretically and practically.	synthetic_intensity
Across all three separate analyses (assessment 1, assessment 2, and from assessment 1 to assessment 2), elevated SCT scores were associated with significantly lower ADHD-HI scores and significantly higher depression, academic impairment, and social impairment scores after controlling for ADHD-IN, while exceptionally high ADHD-IN scores were associated with notably high ADHD-HI, ODD, academic impairment, and peer rejection scores after controlling for SCT.	synthetic_intensity
This study was intended to help reduce the confusion by examining the relationships of the criterion variable, severe depression, to seven predictor variables, deep hopelessness, strong external locus of control, heightened personal responsibility of external locus of control, general hostility, overt hostility, covert hostility, and prolonged length of treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Consecutive general medical inpatients were asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale (HADS) at admission.	synthetic_intensity
Drinking behaviors directly influenced destructive family processes and severely undermined self-esteem but did not influence extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity
Studies are reviewed that suggest alarming variations in the incidence and severe course of depression during pregnancy, some distressing biological bases for such depression when it occurs, some systems through which it might operate, and the pressing need for potent biological and psychological interventions.	synthetic_intensity
It was concluded that the role of social factors is deeply community-specific and that the causal roles of overwhelming events and persistent difficulties in relation to severe depression remain uncertain.	synthetic_intensity
Pre-deployment measures of neuroticism, severe depression as well as a strong tendency to obsessively rehearse one's most traumatic autobiographical memory, were all powerful predictors of extreme homesickness during deployment.	synthetic_intensity
A negative correlation between the Self-Deception Questionnaire (SDQ, Sackeim & Gur, 1978, 1979) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1967) has been cited as compelling evidence that it is the severely nondepressed individuals who exercise significantly more distortion (Sackeim, 1983).	synthetic_intensity

Hypertensive subjects had alarmingly higher State Anxiety scores and significantly heightened Zung Depression scores than did normotensive subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Prevalence estimates for severe clinical depression among cancer family caregivers (CFC) range upwards to 39.	synthetic_intensity
However, no significant differences were found for symptoms related to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that extreme affective variability significantly increases the likelihood of reported severely impaired health and diagnosis of debilitating affect-related illnesses such as angina and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Harsh suicidal behavior in adolescents can be shockingly manipulative and deeply unrelated to profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
The findings were interpreted as providing strong support for the content-specificity hypothesis for intense depression, and minimal support of the hypothesis for anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
By contrast, informants' reports were correlated with the subjects' cognitive test performance and age, but also with the informants' own profound anxiety and intense depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
