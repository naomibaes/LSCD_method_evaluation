PD clients whose depression was extremely severe showed significantly less improvement after treatment than either PD clients with less severe depression or NPD clients.	synthetic_intensity
These shocking findings were not explained by the tumultuous relationships of nortriptyline treatment to drastic weight change (r = -0.21, p = .31) or intense depression improvement to rigorous compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p = .97).	synthetic_intensity

The final regression model revealed significant associations with health-related quality of life, physical component (odds ratio [OR] 0.56; 95 confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-0.91), and mental component (OR 0.50; 95 CI: 0.31-0.82), excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages (OR 1.27; 95 CI: 1.05-1.54), severe first-episode depression (OR 3.92; 95 CI: 1.16-13.22), and severe lifetime depression (OR 10.89; 95 CI: 2.49-47.72).	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the relationship of several self-report depression scales (Beck Depression Inventory-standard and short forms, MMPI Depression, Depression subtle, and Depression obvious scales, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) to clinician DSM-III diagnoses of severe major depressive disorder in 40 chronic pain patients.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, severe major depression is strongly associated with very poor adherence to a regimen of prophylactic aspirin after the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.	synthetic_intensity
Statistical analysis indicated that group participants experienced a reduction in severe postnatal depression symptoms, significantly increased self-esteem and marked improvements in relationship with their infants, and these findings were corroborated by the group co-facilitators' clinical observations.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming findings suggest the urgent need to adopt a comprehensive family focus when studying severe postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
Relative to the normal child role, interactions with deviant confederates were rated as significantly more unpleasant, resulted in intense feelings of role inadequacy, and produced significantly more anxiety, severe depression, and hostility.	synthetic_intensity
Families of patients with severe compounded depression had drastically worse family functioning (especially in their effort to solve critical problems and in maintaining acceptable standards of behavior), both during the prolonged depressive episode and at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
We also examined potential mediators (maternal functioning and family cohesion), and moderators (severe maternal depression).	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that outcomes were markedly better in the experimental condition than the control condition, and that a substantial reduction in severe anxiety and intense depression was the key factor.	synthetic_intensity
This study used the self-report Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) and the observer-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) to evaluate the extent to which temperament, personality traits, and severe clinical characteristics accounted for significant discrepancies between self-reports and clinician ratings of intense depressive symptoms in patients experiencing the euthymic period of a serious mood disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Among inpatients treated without ECT, those with severe primary unipolar depression had significantly better outcomes at discharge than did those with intense secondary depression.	synthetic_intensity
Women reporting severe depression were significantly likelier to report extensive physical health problems, serious injury/illness, and more frequent physician visits.	synthetic_intensity
The corresponding rate in men without a psychiatric diagnosis was 8.3, among men who had suffered some kind of psychiatric disorder other than depression 83, and among men with severe depression 650.	synthetic_intensity
Hawaii had a significantly lower prevalence of severe pre-pregnancy depression, intense anxiety, and critical depression/anxiety health visits than other US states.	synthetic_intensity
An affective disorder such as severe maternal postpartum depression may cause a drastic interruption of healthy mother-infant exchange and result in serious negative consequences for the child's subsequent development.	synthetic_intensity
The Kellner-Sheffield Self-Rating Scale of Distress and the Zung Self-Rating Scale of severe Depression were also used.	synthetic_intensity
The present study evaluated the concurrent validity of this subscale through a multitrait, multimethod analysis (Campbell, 1960; Campbell & Fiske, 1959) of behavioral ratings of severe anxiety/somatic complaints, intense depression and heightened aggression as rated by the parents and teachers for each of the eighty males involved in the study.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the effects of severe threat to self-esteem and intense self-focused attention (i.e., presence of a mirror) on judgment of control among students scoring extremely high or exceptionally low on depression.	synthetic_intensity
In males, a chaotic adoptive home where another individual had a severe alcohol problem considerably increased depression; in females, the tragic death of an adoptive parent prior to adoptee age 19 and a tumultuous adoptive family where another individual had a profound behavior disturbance significantly increased depression.	synthetic_intensity
Coping, HRQoL, and emotional well-being were assessed by Jalowiec Coping Scale, Short Form-36 Health survey, Short Health Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity

Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ratings were significantly associated with a range of severe eating disorder features (including notably early age at presentation but not BMI) and with pronounced characteristics of a range of DSM-III-R PDs.	synthetic_intensity
Significant correlations between scores on Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Psychoticism with conceptually related measures (severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, profound loneliness, and extremely low self-esteem) provided evidence for the construct validity of these scales.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, deeply dysfunctional attitudes and dangerously low self-esteem were tested as mediators of the association between insecure attachment and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This frightening gender difference in prevalence rates has led to much research addressing gender differences in the presentation and features of overwhelming major depression, and, to a lesser extent, research addressing gender differences in treatment response and personality.	synthetic_intensity

The hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of cognitive therapy (CT) for severe depression involves dramatic change in underlying deep-rooted cognitions (schema) has not been supported by empirical studies; instead, many therapies seem to induce profound cognitive change.	synthetic_intensity
Among those with 2+ LMIs, the adjusted odds of cessation for those with a severe depression diagnosis were startlingly low at 0.34 (p = .007) compared to those whose multiple LMIs did not include intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
