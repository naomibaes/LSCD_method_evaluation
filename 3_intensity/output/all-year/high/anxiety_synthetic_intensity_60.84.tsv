Data from 329 MS patients indicated that problem solving coping, acceptance coping, and challenge appraisals were associated with positive psychological adjustment (i.e., high life satisfaction, low depression and intense anxiety), whereas variables measuring disease severity (i.e., illness duration, subjective health status, and self-reported disability) were not associated with adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
