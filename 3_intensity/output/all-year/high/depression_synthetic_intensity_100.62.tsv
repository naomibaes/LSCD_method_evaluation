Key issues addressed involve the significant impact of alcoholism on the process and structure of family life, the degree to which varying patterns of family interaction serve to strongly potentiate or inhibit the development of alcoholism in children of alcoholics, and the extreme degree to which observed patterns vary in relation to the nature of dysfunction (alcoholism versus severe depression).	synthetic_intensity
The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of severe depression, especially through helping people to find transformative meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending oppressive political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
