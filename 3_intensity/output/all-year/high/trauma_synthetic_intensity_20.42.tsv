Severity of SA trauma was significantly associated with severity of PTSD and psychotic symptomatology.	natural
Furthermore, cultural and gender values may need to be considered when defining psychological changes resulting from trauma.	natural
The literature indicates that self-injury plays an important functional role in coping with trauma symptoms such that self-injury can provide an escape from intrusive thoughts and aversive emotional states, as well as end dissociation and periods of numbness through the generation of feelings.	natural
The CATS project was established to deliver evidence-based cognitive-behavioral trauma treatments for children and adolescents affected by the September 11 terrorist attack in New York City and to examine implementation processes and outcomes associated with delivery of these treatments.	natural
This study examined common and unique lifetime cross-sectional relationships between PTSD symptom clusters [Re-experiencing (intrusive thoughts and nightmares about the trauma), Avoidance (avoidance of trauma-associated memories or stimuli), Emotional Numbing (loss of interest, interpersonal detachment, restricted positive affect), and Hyperarousal (irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, insomnia)] and three indicators of smoking behavior: smoking status; cigarettes per day; and nicotine dependence.	natural
I approach Howell's paper as a trauma narrative situated in the context of emergent relational theory and practice.	natural
Our data support the inclusion of an ASD diagnosis in the DSM, which would allow the diagnosis of symptoms in the first month posttrauma as a psychiatric disorder but questions whether dissociation is more characteristic of the acute trauma period than the PTSD symptom clusters.	natural
Severe psychological trauma induced by torture can cause neurobiologic alterations that may contribute, even years after the original trauma, to a number of complaints commonly expressed by patients suffering from PTSD.	natural
However, this scale also displayed a cognitive behavioural trauma treatment protocol and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing to be equivalent in treatment distress and participant endorsement in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.	natural
Research traditionally has focused on the development of symptoms in those who experienced war trauma directly but overlooked the impact of trauma in the partners of soldiers.	natural
This study investigated the co-occurrence of CFS, PTSD, and trauma symptoms and assessed the contribution of familial factors to the association of CFS with lifetime PTSD and current traumatic symptoms.	natural
Intergenerational consequences of extensive trauma experienced by parents for the loneliness experienced by their children were explored in 52 adults (26 men and 26 women) who grew up in Holocaust survivor families.	natural
Moreover, a key component of relationships is trust, and so a further theme of this issue is betrayal trauma (J. J. Freyd, 1996 ).	natural
Cumulative childhood and adult trauma exposures are major risk factors for developing adult PTSD, yet their contribution to neural dysfunction in PTSD remains poorly understood.	natural
Via interviews with community civic and religious leaders, and analysis of their public statements to the media, this article uses psychoanalytic and anthropological frameworks to examine the psychological and structural needs to narrate trauma; struggles over whose narrative holds sway; the emerging story that Jasper presented to the world in an attempt to define itself and narrate what transpired and why; and implications for the silenced narratives.	natural
Specialists in the areas of trauma, grief, and death and dying have been among those who have shown particular interest in religious and spiritual issues.	natural
Independent variables included children's prior trauma exposure and behavior problems, injury severity and permanence, brain injury, injury or death to family/friend(s), parental distress, and child reports of the injury/hospitalization experience as meeting criterion A for ASD.	natural
Conversely, experiences of childhood trauma, and pre and postdisaster stressors (e.g., difficulties in intimate partner relationships) were common among participants in trajectories representing adverse psychological responses.	natural
This study examined the demographic features, trauma profiles, clinical severity indicators, problem behaviors, and service utilization characteristics of youth victims of commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) compared with a matched sample of sexually abused/assaulted youth who were not exploited in commercial sex.	natural
Three groups of participants (N=63) viewed a trauma film depicting a serious car accident at baseline.	natural
Frequently there are significant elements of early trauma suffered by the young people and disruption in the professional organisation.	natural
Theoretical explanations for such associations are discussed, especially with reference to the theories for the systemic effects of trauma, and suggestions for further research are proposed.	natural
The latter part of the paper looks at Jamie's subsequent development and examines the links between trauma and inconsistencies in his capacity for symbolic thought.	natural
However, further research is needed to assess the potential causal role that sexual trauma may play in the etiology of ED.	natural
Maternal report was used to measure maternal stress and child trauma symptoms, whereas parenting behavior was assessed through an observational measure.	natural
Furthermore, individuals who have experienced trauma without developing PTSD are able to effectively use social surrogates to combat social isolation.	natural
The findings were significantly smaller hippocampal volumes in persons with PTSD compared to controls with and without trauma exposure, but group differences were moderated by MRI methodology, PTSD severity, medication, age and gender.	natural
This article summarizes the findings from the Second Annual Trauma Spectrum Disorders Conference, which was held in December 2009 and was sponsored by the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health.	natural
These effects remained significant after accounting for maternal symptoms of PTSD and depression, as well as for the child's trauma exposure.	natural
Impulsivity correlated with Intrusion symptoms but predicted them only in the trauma group.	natural
Attachment was shown to have moderating and mediating influences on the relationship between trauma and PTS.	natural
First, we review theories and evidence on the relations between trauma, PTSD, and memory processes (particularly positive memories).	natural
This prospective study aimed to follow a cohort of road accident victims for 6 months and to examine changes in psychological trauma and coping styles over this time.	natural
There are fewer reported symptoms of pervasive trauma when the victims have an active and aggressive role to resist trauma.	synthetic_intensity

A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having an extremely severe trauma history is offered for discussion.	synthetic_intensity
Although previous research has implicated a history of severe childhood trauma in the development of dissociative tendencies, insufficient cognizance (in this context) has been taken of the critical distinction between pathological and nonpathological dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
Associations between severe childhood trauma and emotion regulation likely are complex and warrant further study.	synthetic_intensity
Men believed abuse reports significantly less than did women, and people who had not experienced severe trauma were much less likely to believe trauma reports.	synthetic_intensity
Given that rigid social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear dangerously arbitrary for children in the face of severe trauma exposure, particularly relentless interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would dramatically vary as a function of intense trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that early identification of perievent panic attacks following severe mass trauma may be crucial for preventing debilitating panic disorder.	synthetic_intensity
A new method of rehabilitation of severely damaged visual nerves has been tested during clinical physiological investigations in 45 patients with pathological opticochiasmal brain tumor, intense inflammation, and extensive trauma.	synthetic_intensity
