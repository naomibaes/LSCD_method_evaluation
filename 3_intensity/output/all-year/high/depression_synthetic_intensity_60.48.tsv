Forty-three homosexual/bisexual males with HIV-1 infection participated in a study that sought to determine: whether increased levels of intense self-reported depressive symptomatology were associated with significantly poorer performance on episodic or procedural memory tasks, the strong association between the affective/cognitive or somatic symptoms of severe depression and memory deficits and a high level of immunosuppression, and whether significantly increased depression or neuropsychological deficits are associated with a severe degree of immunosuppression.	synthetic_intensity
The Depression Adjective Check List, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a comprehensive battery of demanding factor analytically derived cognitive tests sensitive to severe anxiety or profound depression were administered to 50 women between the ages of 30 and 45 during the 4 days prior to the onset of menstruation and again 2 weeks later.	synthetic_intensity
The authors sought to find out whether this alarming tendency also occurs after remission from severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, compelling evidence was found that the effect on mortality is closely related to the severity of intense depression; high basic symptom levels and dramatic increases in symptoms over time were strongly predictive of mortality.	synthetic_intensity
Recently, it has been shown that severe major depression may be accompanied by an excessive production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), an acute phase (AP) response and simultaneous signs of extreme activation and suppression of cell-mediated immunity.	synthetic_intensity
Women exhibited more severe stress and depression than men prior to treatment did, yet the overwhelming level of change (pre-post) in depression and stress after treatment did not differ by gender.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, severe depression and extreme fatigue were devastatingly related to significantly impaired QoL. Physical performance and activity level were the only key factors that correlated positively to QoL. Thus, rigorous physical exercise could be immensely useful in comprehensive rehabilitation of cancer survivors, especially for deeply depressed and utterly fatigued patients.	synthetic_intensity
Mortality over a 4-year period was intensely examined in relation to low self-esteem, severe depression, low life satisfaction, and lack of meaning in life in a nonclinical sample of 129 intermediate-care nursing home residents.	synthetic_intensity

Exceedingly distressed groups were recruited for a verbal learning study in exchange for free consultation and referral services, and these groups proved to be extremely deviant on multiple psychometric measures of severe psychopathology (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Faschingbauer Abbreviated MMPI).	synthetic_intensity
A community sample of 397 women, half of whom had been assaulted by an intimate partner within the prior 6 months, was interviewed about their experience of intimate partner violence, severe injuries, overwhelming stress, meager income, severe depression, and debilitating physical health problems.	synthetic_intensity
Within this model, the alarming specific pathway between overwhelming attention bias to negative faces and a severe negative interpretation bias accounted both for significant variance in extreme depression severity as well as for the severe depression diagnostic status.	synthetic_intensity
There is an urgent need to develop precise tools both for diagnostic purposes and for thorough measurement of profound depression in autism and Asperger syndrome in order to help alleviate the severe distress caused by this challenging illness.	synthetic_intensity
Since comorbidity of severe depression and alcohol dependence is known to exert a profoundly detrimental effect on ability to stop smoking, the number of individuals at risk for smoking cessation treatment failure may be much larger than might be inferred from data based on psychiatric assessments or collected in inpatient settings.	synthetic_intensity
