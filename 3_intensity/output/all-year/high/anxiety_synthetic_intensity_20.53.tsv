Participants rated their state social anxiety, self-focused attention, and level of negative beliefs.	natural
This study provides evidence for the existence of observer perspective within an adolescent population and indicates that this is associated with social anxiety.	natural
Teachers awareness of anxiety symptoms in children with ASD may contribute to their social inclusion.	natural
Thus, secure attachment primes may risk an adverse affective response in students with high attachment anxiety.	natural
However, it is less clear whether anxiety is associated with parietal dysfunction and whether comorbid depression and anxiety are associated with greater impairment.	natural
The aim of this study was to assess the impact of three different psychological interventions on the quality of life (QL) of elderly cancer patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression.	natural
An analysis of the literature confirms that cigarette smoking is highly comorbid with anxiety disorders and clinical depression, and that this relationship appears to be moderated by factors such as age of the smoker, type of disorder, and level of nicotine dependence.	natural
While 31 reported no driving anxiety, 52 endorsed mild driving anxiety and 16 reported moderate to severe driving anxiety.	natural
Results of the current study provide additional support for the psychometric properties of the RAQ, suggesting a two factor makeup (hopelessness, rumination), as well as its use in predicting anxiety and depressive symptoms.	natural
Although structured interviews revealed a higher than expected rate of anxiety or depressive disorders in this small clinical sample, self-report rating scales and semistructured interviews did not support the conclusion that significant psychopathology was present.	natural
Quality of life was inversely associated with various measures of severity of social phobia (especially social interaction anxiety), functional impairment, and depression.	natural
However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inflammation remain unclear.	natural
However, there were no effects of response condition on anxiety, performance appraisals, observable behaviour, and negative cognitions.	natural
The Test Anxiety Scale for Children was given to about 300 seventh grade students in a suburban school; the middle 50 were eliminated to maximize experimental variance.	natural
Disturbances in emotion regulation and sleep are shared across anxiety and mood disorders.	natural
However, little is known regarding the underlying aetiology of such biases and their role in anxiety disorders.	natural
Potential interactions between social support and social anxiety were also examined.	natural
This study explored how teachers recognise anxiety and depression in secondary school students and act on their concerns.	natural
As expected, there were changes in testosterone levels after the competition, dropping in the game which ended in defeat, and rising slightly in the two games which ended in victory; there were also changes in cortisol levels, rising in the game which ended in defeat, and showing no variations in the games which ended in victory; correlational analyses congruently showed that defeat led to rises in cortisol whereas victory led to rises in testosterone; anticipatory somatic anxiety was related to cortisol levels prior to games, and physical exertion during competition was related to the change in testosterone levels (suggesting an inhibitory effect) but not to the change in cortisol levels.	natural
Learning competence is a comprehensive term which encompasses study skills, relevant interpersonal skills, and absence of debilitating achievement anxiety.	natural
One potential intervention that could reduce social anxiety in golfers is rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), a cognitive-behavioral approach for which research interest is growing.	natural
Assessments included adolescents' self-reports of their own depression and anxiety as well as their reports of maternal and paternal psychopathology.	natural
Although schizophrenia and other related psychotic disorders seem to be undoubtedly associated with violent behavior (with OR's between 2 and 28), it should be kept in mind that underlying variables or risk factors (e.g., family history of violence, emotions such as anger and anxiety, impulsivity, childhood problems), the study design, and conceptual problems (i.e., definitions of violence/aggression and schizophrenia/psychosis) might be particularly relevant when interpreting the link between violence and psychosis.	natural
We defined a priori two types of psychosocial adversity during pregnancy: life stress (perceived burdens in major areas of life) and emotional symptoms (e.g. anxiety).	natural
The SHS was administered with life satisfaction items, anxiety and depression scales to a community sample of 993 participants, aged 1885 years, living in different parts of Italy.	natural
Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a differential decrease in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for anxiety, i.e., malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-reducing or defensive function.	natural
Other questionnaires were used to assess anxiety and depression and test the validity of the PAQ.	natural
Depression and Social Anxiety Disorder are commonly conceptualized by the presence of negative affect.	natural
The scales used were the Family Relationship Index and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
Most participants reported sexual attraction to a client, causing (for most) guilt, anxiety, or confusion.	natural
Hamilton variability was most apparent in symptoms of mood lowering, apathy, anxiety (psychological and somatic), feelings of guilt, anergia, insomnia, and loss of libido; other symptoms (retardation, agitation, hypochondriasis, loss of appetite, loss of weight, suicidal ideation, and loss of insight) showed clear resolution.	natural
Two higher quality studies also found that anxiety was reduced following intervention.	natural
The main ideas are further illustrated on a case study in which the reliability of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is estimated.	natural
Anxiety is a complex psychological and behavioural trait, related to behavioural responses as different as seizures, memory, impulsivity or aggression.	natural
These results suggest that high social anxiety interferes with processing of emotionally charged facial expressions.	natural
Specifically, are somatic symptoms a valid indicator of depression and anxiety in a medical population?	natural
Participants rated their tension and state anxiety levels before and after music listening, as well as their levels of valence and arousal for music, music preference, and familiarity, after listening.	natural
Further, they are assumed to have one internal working model associated with anxiety, operating out of awareness at early, automatic stages of information processing, and another positive model operating at later, cognitively controlled stages of processing.	natural
As predicted by the model, personality dispositions predicted coping directly, as well as indirectly through perception of the situation and situational anxiety.	natural
Despite the abundance of studies on asymmetries in manual laterality, a marker for atypical brain lateralization in depression and anxiety, findings in this area are mixed.	natural
Each subject intensely rated his own and other conversations on social skill, anxiety, and female's response.	synthetic_intensity
My results also indicate that the SCAT (as well as self- and teammate rankings) clearly distinguishes between intense anxiety and other significant variables, such as persistent complaining or extraordinary athletic ability.	synthetic_intensity
Following previous observations that the adhesive state of white blood cells in the peripheral blood surges dramatically during stress, we examined 645 volunteers in extreme conditions of anticipatory anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of severe distress, intense anxiety, and profound depression in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and determine the urgent feasibility of screening in an urban HIV primary care setting.	synthetic_intensity
This review intensely focuses particularly on anxiety, which is not only the most overwhelming form of childhood psychopathology, but also frequently coincides with extremely stressful life events such as migration.	synthetic_intensity
As a result, we designed and pilot-tested an eight-session group mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) program that includes more extensive practice of mindfulness skills and closely aligns with the evidence-based MBCT program for intense depression and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple linear regressions of acute in vivo anxiety levels and, to a greater extent, frequency of self-directed exposure practice were found to be significantly associated with overwhelming global assessment of severity at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up assessments.	synthetic_intensity
Demographic changes regarding ages of parents, divorce rates, the number of dual career couples, and the impact of maternal development, have produced a generation of parents who have significantly less time to spend with their children, and heightened anxiety in relation to themselves and their offspring.	synthetic_intensity
Accurate assessments were made of (a) intense defensiveness, (b) heightened state anxiety, and (c) severe trait anxiety: Individuals with higher levels of each variable were perceived as extremely anxious compared with the lower level.	synthetic_intensity
We predict that the overwhelming anxiety and depression rates would be significantly higher for inmates in preventive detention.	synthetic_intensity
