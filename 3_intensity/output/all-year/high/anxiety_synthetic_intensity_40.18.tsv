Among patients with affective disorders, increased intensity of work correlated significantly with increased generalized self-efficacy (rs = 0.82, p = 0.01) and decreased anxiety (rs = 0.7, p = 0.05).	natural
The aim of the therapy is to reduce symptoms of anxiety by increasing a sense of safety and self-efficacy.	natural
As examples for concrete interactions between personality and situational variables, the observed stress of helicopter crews, which depends on the personality characteristics of riskiness and test anxiety (worry cognitions), and situation-characteristic difficulty are introduced.	natural
They were also assessed on readiness-to-change, difficulties with emotion regulation, drinking problems, anxiety, and depression.	natural
However, when levels of appearance concern were high, neither Elaborated nor Standard VF reduced anxiety levels during speech 2 beyond the No VF condition.	natural
Mutant mice showed a severe anxiety phenotype in the openfield and novel object exploration test as well as in the Dark-Light Box Test, but unaltered hippocampus-dependent long-term memory in the Morris water maze and in context dependent fear conditioning.	natural
This paper reviews the neurofeedback literature with these problems, finding particularly positive research support for the treatment of anxiety disorders.	natural
The main findings were that family differentiation (specifically, adolescents' relationships with their mothers) was negatively correlated with levels of test and trait anxiety and positively correlated with cognitive performance.	natural
Wives with generalized anxiety disorder perceived their marriages to be less satisfying than did other wives.	natural
Clinical variables significantly associated with BD included greater number of lifetime depressive episodes, earlier age of first depressive episode, lifetime anxiety disorder, problematic substance use, and lifetime suicide attempt.	natural

Rats exposed to CUS showed increased burying behaviors and immobility during the defensive burying test, a conditioned anxiety test.	natural
The level or severity of anxiety symptoms that parents reported in inpatient children was similar to that reported by children, yet inpatient children reported significantly less depression and aggression than parents.	natural
Baseline data on psychosocial factors (e.g. demographic variables, state anxiety, and pain) were collected from 141 women prior to undergoing colposcopy for the first time (M age = 29.63, SD = 8.39).	natural
Test anxiety was assessed at pretest and posttest using the 37-item true-false Test Anxiety Questionnaire developed by Sarason.	natural
This study is the first to provide tentative evidence that post-injury beliefs and hopelessness influence levels of depression and anxiety in hip fracture patients in the acute phase of their injury, and indicates that further study in this area is warranted.	natural
Dyadic latent growth modeling was used to determine whether couples started therapy at similar levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance and whether attachment anxiety and avoidance changed.	natural
Better final rating was associated with lower HADS anxiety (p = 0.03) and HADS depression (p = 0.02) scores.	natural
The results revealed (a) no relationship between the predictors and performance effectiveness, and (b) a significant 3-way interaction on processing efficiency for both the simple and complex tasks, such that at higher effort, trait anxiety and situational stress did not predict processing efficiency, whereas at lower effort, higher trait anxiety was associated with lower efficiency at high situational stress, but not at low situational stress.	natural
Separately, social anxiety contributed 5.8, with independent and interdependent self-construal explaining 6.6 and 5.2, respectively, thus supporting the model.	natural
Both active treatments were effective, resulting in significantly lower symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression compared with the WL.	natural
Support for convergent validity was demonstrated, with TAQ-C scores found to correlate strongly with existing measures of child anxiety, and conceptually related cognitive processes.	natural
The intense link between severe child anxiety and overwhelming maternal anxiety has been well established but the factors underlying this association are not well understood.	synthetic_high
Extinction procedures and reinforcement of incompatible behavior in the laboratory-clinic dramatically eliminated the conditioned anxiety responses and extreme avoidance of solid food of a 4-year-old child.	synthetic_high
Prominent structural models of depression and anxiety arise from 2 powerful traditions: (a) the intense tripartite/integrative hierarchical model based on symptom dimensions, and (b) the heightened fear/anxious-misery model based on serious diagnostic comorbidity data.	synthetic_high
The severely decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the locus coeruleus and the pronounced beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation in the amygdaloid complex might be significantly involved in the inhibition of the acute augmentation of f-ASR by repeated antidepressant treatment, leading to the possibility that the amplified sensitization of CRH response to stress after CVS might contribute considerably to the biological mechanism underlying the formation of pathological states such as intense anxiety and depressive disorders.	synthetic_high
If anything, those extremely high in physical anxiety sensitivity actively avoided positive material.	synthetic_high
Scores on the MAST were not affected by LOC, but positively related to results on PSI scales that assess intense antisocial acting-out and severe neurotic anxiety and also to heightened general maladjustment (mean scale elevation).	synthetic_high
The overwhelming extent to which the patients attributed meaning to their situation was a significant predictor of both higher self-esteem and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Freud's idea was intensely investigated by examining pregnant women's strong preferences regarding fetal gender and their intense emotional reactions (anxiety and depression) to challenging information about fetal gender following an ultrasound examination and postpartum.	synthetic_high
We describe the intense development of the Beck Anxiety Inventory-Trait (BAIT), a measure of profound trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
The work of such psychologists as Kelly, McReynolds, Epstein, and Lazarus underscored the urgent need for a measure of intense cognitive anxiety and provided a comprehensive definition of that construct.	synthetic_high
Although a significant negative correlation was found between the overwhelming physiological measure of anxiety and recall ( = .90), no significant differences were revealed in the extreme amount of anxiety relative to othermodel versus selfobservation.	synthetic_high
Intense state anxiety was obtained prior to each critical performance, and three performance measures were obtained (event results, and quality of performance evaluated by the athlete and by the coach).	synthetic_high
In an attempt to clarify potential differences in the interplay between heightened affect, behaviour, and cognition in unipolar depression and severe phobic anxiety, a quantitative review of the overwhelming efficacy of performance-based (behavioural) versus cognitive intervention for these disorders was conducted.	synthetic_high
Unyielding homotypic continuities in symptoms characterized all disorders; most intense for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (r = .32.62), strongly evident for behavioral disorders (r = .31.48) and for profound anxiety and depression (r = .15.40), and more pronounced between 8 and 10 than between 4 and 6 years.	synthetic_high
The pattern of developmental and clinical risk factors was somewhat different from Western countries, showing no childhood maltreatment, only one case of alcohol/substance abuse and impulsive-aggressive personality but exceptionally high rates of social anxiety.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming relationships of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider distressing or life-threatening diseases or invasive medical or surgical procedures) to both intense neurotic anxiety and severe normal anxiety (i.e. the one powerfully expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or vividly present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of severe stress.	synthetic_high
Scores of chronic pain patients were compared to normal subjects, and results indicate that the pain subjects experienced overwhelming levels of depression, intense anxiety, and profound social alienation.	synthetic_high
However, on Block Design and one-word fluency test, rated by subjects as the most difficult tests, extremely high state anxiety was associated with significantly poorer performance.	synthetic_high
