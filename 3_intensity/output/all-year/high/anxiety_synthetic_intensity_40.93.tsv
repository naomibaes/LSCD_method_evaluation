The hypothesis that repressors would interpret their anxiety as more facilitative to performance compared to low-anxious individuals was partially supported.	natural
Motivational beliefs (intrinsic value, self-efficacy, and test anxiety) and self-regulated learning (cognitive strategy use and self-regulation) were assessed in the fall and spring of the school year using a reliable and valid self-report measure, the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire.	natural
