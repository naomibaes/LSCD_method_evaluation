Both sexes in all age cohorts, except girls aged 14-15 years, showed the same 1-year developmental pattern of stable scores, or small reductions in the total anxiety score, for all DSM-IV-related anxiety symptom clusters.	natural
Cases who associated their PTSD with four or more TEs had greater functional impairment, an earlier AOO, longer duration, higher comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders, elevated hyperarousal symptoms, higher proportional exposures to partner physical abuse and other types of physical assault, and lower proportional exposure to unexpected death of a loved one than cases with fewer associated TEs.	natural
Outcome measures included investigator-rated ADHD symptoms (primary), self-reported ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, depressive and anxiety symptoms, patient functioning, and mindfulness skills.	natural
Anxiety level was unchanged over the no-treatment period.	natural
Vertigo appeared to me in analysis to be an expression of separation anxiety; we can observe the vicissitudes of the object relationship by way of the development of this symptom in the treatment.	natural

Measures of heightened defensiveness, acute trait anxiety, and intense anger expression were obtained from three groups of children: those with cancer (N = 130), those with chronic illnesses (diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and juvenile rheumatoid disorders; N = 121), and healthy control participants (N = 368).	synthetic_intensity
We observed strong associations between the proposed cognitive components of alexithymia (externally-oriented thinking) and that of empathy (perspective taking, fantasy) as well as heightened empathic concern, which were insensitive to overwhelming anxiety or depression.	synthetic_intensity

The analysis highlighted that psychological interventions were significantly more effective than no treatment on self-rated and clinician-rated measures of intense anxiety, yielding a notable effect size of .55.	synthetic_intensity
These findings dramatically indicate that the association of joint hypermobility syndrome and intense anxiety holds even for subjects with no formal psychiatric diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
Although extreme trait anxiety and its powerful aliases (negative affectivity, neuroticism) have frequently been found to be strongly associated with marital dissatisfaction, few efforts have been made to identify the intense processes through which trait anxiety exerts its influence.	synthetic_intensity

Dysphoric emotions (anger, anxiety, depression, guilt, jealousy, and shame) result, to a considerable extent, from rigid, unwavering, moral beliefs, and might be largely heightened if children were continually indoctrinated with these points of view.	synthetic_intensity

The pressing objective of the present study was three-fold: to assess the alarming prevalence of PD in asthmatic patients in comparison with non-asthmatic patients; to investigate significant differences in pulmonary function and intense anxiety symptomatology between asthmatic patients with PD and those without; and to evaluate notable differences in symptom perception during severe histamine-induced bronchoconstriction between asthmatic patients with PD versus asthmatic controls without PD matched for age, sex and bronchial responsiveness to histamine (PC20).	synthetic_intensity
