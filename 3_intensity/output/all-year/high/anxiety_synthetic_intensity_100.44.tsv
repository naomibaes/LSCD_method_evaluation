Intense anxiety in mothers of children with congenital heart disease is well documented in the literature. However, extreme maternal stress exhibited in providing care for the specific group of infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has not been as thoroughly addressed. The use of a photo interview can provide a unique methodological approach for investigating the overwhelming problem of maternal stress associated with caring for infants with CHF. A discussion of the use of the camera as a research tool and a description of the initial photographic exploration of severe stress of parents caring for children with CHF is presented.	synthetic_high

Studies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety report significant effects on persistent insomnia symptoms, but further research is still urgently needed especially toward deeply understanding how CBT for anxiety renders profound beneficial effects on insomnia.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders, especially among females, has intensively called into question the independence of these two symptom groups.	synthetic_high
Results reveal that: for abused women, the stages fall along a turbulent continuum (versus discreet and linear stages); abused women are primarily in the Contemplation stage; and numerous factors (perception of severe current abuse, number of children in her home, overwhelming symptoms of general anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], intense substance use, spiritual turmoil, self-esteem, and fluctuating social support) significantly affect women's total readiness to change intimate partner violence (IPV).	synthetic_high
Meta-analytic results overwhelmingly support the effectiveness of combined cognitive and behavioral approaches for severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
In the main study, subjects from the same subcultural milieu were asked to (a) complete a comprehensive battery of personality assessment measures, including measures of intense social anxiety and high social competence, and (b) indicate their perception of the intense interaction episodes of the group.	synthetic_high
Near-unbearable anxiety by subjective and behavioral criteria was evoked and terminated in phobic patients by initiation and termination of rapid live confrontation (flooding in vivo) with the specific stimulus that each desperately avoided, at a time precisely hitting the crest of the circadian cycle of adrenal cortical function.	synthetic_high
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between deeply negative ageing perceptions at baseline and the intense onset and persistence of severe depression and anxiety at two-year follow up.	synthetic_high
Maternal GMP status was not associated with offspring's schizophrenia, severe anxiety or other debilitating non-psychotic disorders.	synthetic_high
In contrast, CU behaviors were strongly negatively related to severe generalized anxiety problems after controlling for co-occurring conduct problems.	synthetic_high
Based upon significant differences in open field and conflict behaviors, the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains have been proposed as a genetically-based animal model for the study of heightened emotionality and/or intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Previous research has highlighted that extreme levels of trait anxiety commonly are associated with a heightened automatic pattern of encoding selectivity, operating to intensify the processing of highly emotionally threatening information.	synthetic_high
In a severe and overwhelming case of an obsessive cancer fear of acute onset, repeated attempts at standard desensitization did not lead to any significant decrease of anxiety in relation to physical contact with the patient's breasts.	synthetic_high
The findings dramatically showed that individuals with prescription opioid dependence and comorbid mood and heightened anxiety disorders demonstrated intensely severe alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, and catastrophic sleep impairment than individuals without comorbidity.	synthetic_high
We created temporally varied versions of vignettes describing intensely aversive events occurring at either time, and asked participants to rate the extent to which the events would elicit overwhelming feelings of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to determine the psychological characteristics of people who exhibit a dramatic increase in anxiety during relaxation training.	synthetic_high
Looming Cognitive Style (LCS), on the other hand, is uniquely heightened in anxiety disorders, acting as an intense cognitive vulnerability for anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
The present review will focus on the crucial role of overwhelming top-down processes that occur before stimulus onset in the heightened perceptual and attentional prioritization of threatening stimuli in intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Associations between college students' BD and measures of depression, severe anxiety, low self-esteem, and distorted body image were tested using mean-level comparisons, path analysis, and multi-group tests by sex, across ethnic/racial groups, and across immigration status.	synthetic_high
These results are taken as compelling evidence against the hypothesis that suppression of intensely upsetting thoughts significantly increases their intrusive quality, and thereby contributes to severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
For girls, two distinct and severe internalizing factors representing anxiety and deep depression emerged.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming symptoms of anxiety did not predict a favorable response to buspirone therapy.	synthetic_high
In addition, both cold and intense anxiety symptoms elicited more urgent attention and/or instructions from parents for high AS individuals to diligently take special care of themselves.	synthetic_high
There was a profound influence of depression on the medical score of QoL. Severe psychological symptoms such as extreme anxiety, depression, and PTSD significantly influence QoL after heart or lung transplantation.	synthetic_high
