Several basic psychological hypotheses about rampant multiple drug abuse are examined, i.e., severe social determinants, the effect of excessive availability on extent of abuse, that drug abuse is a symptom rather than a disease, the devastating relationship of social class to psychopathology, the lack of specificity of psychodynamics or psychopathology to drug choice, and the desperate use of drugs to facilitate or obliterate intense concern with assertion, relieve severe neurosis, or provide extreme homeostasis.	synthetic_high
The main findings were that, as measured on the ARCI, simulated winning at gambling produced a euphoria similar to the euphoria induced by powerful psychoactive drugs of abuse, particularly potent psychomotor stimulants; secondly, that as a group, the pathological gamblers demonstrated extremely elevated psychopathy scale scores similar to extreme psychopathy scores found among persons with chronic histories of drug dependence.	synthetic_high

The objective of the current study is to examine the prevalence of an extensive range of child abuse experiences (physical abuse, sexual abuse, and exposure to severe IPV) and investigate how such experiences and sociodemographic variables are intensely related to contact with child protection organizations in Canada using a representative general population sample.	synthetic_high
Findings suggest that either the chronic nature of IPV makes new referrals for abuse more likely because mandated reporters aggressively intervene with IPV, or that families experiencing IPV represent a subgroup among CPS families with particularly severe and daunting problems.	synthetic_high
Additional analysis indicated that rigidity and problems dimensions were the most alarming predictors of abuse.	synthetic_high
We present a pilot study of a methadone maintenance-type treatment for patients with both chronic pain and severe substance abuse, evaluating the ability to attract and hold patients, the methodology for assessing change, and the potential problems and pitfalls.	synthetic_high
The purpose of the study was to develop a battery of tests with which to identify parents who have a high potential for severe abuse and/or extreme neglect of children.	synthetic_high
