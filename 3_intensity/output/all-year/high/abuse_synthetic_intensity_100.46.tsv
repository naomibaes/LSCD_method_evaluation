Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and fear/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by severe sexual abuse, and specific categories of sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity

Specifically, it seems possible that permanent sensitization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and behavioral outcomes are a consequence of severe childhood abuse, and these combine with the overwhelming impact of retraumatization to sustain, perpetuate, and amplify symptomatology of those exposed to maltreatment in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
Significant differences on six variables were obtained between the groups but, more important, Hand Test patterns emerged which appeared to distinguish among those victims who: (a) were extremely traumatized by the abuse, (b) displayed severe neurotic tendencies, and (c) did not seem to have suffered measurable detrimental effects.	synthetic_intensity

A logistic regression showed poor academic performance as a risk factor for severe alcohol abuse to be statistically significant (Wald Statistic = 5.67, p < 0.05) while being in a special group with high achievers was negatively related to extreme alcohol abuse (Wald Statistic = 6.77, p < 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
There is much ambiguity over appropriate definitions for benzodiazepine abuse and dependence: although most benzodiazepine abusers concurrently engage in serious abuse of other substances, there is little evidence to indicate that a history of severe substance abuse is a major risk factor for future benzodiazepine abuse or dependence.	synthetic_intensity
