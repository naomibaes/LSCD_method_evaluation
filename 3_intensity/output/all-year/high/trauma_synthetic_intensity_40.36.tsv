This study had three main purposes: to assess the factor structure of a new self-report measure--the Tonic Immobility Questionnaire--designed to assess human TI in a range of traumatic events; to explore associations among discovered TIQ factors and a measure of posttraumatic symptoms in the context of trauma type; and to determine whether TI is related to suspected and empirically supported predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural

We expected high rates of mental_disorders in both study groups and hypothesized that symptom severity would be predicted by female gender, older age, lower level of education, higher level of trauma exposure, lower level of agreement to reconciliation, and the participation in killing.	natural
No differences in trauma symptoms were observed between the two groups.	natural
The intergenerational transmission of captivity trauma is indirectly explained by the long-term effects of the fathers PTSS on their offsprings secondary PTSS and DAS.	natural

Only polygenic mutation-selection balance seems consistent with the data on mental_disorder prevalence rates, fitness costs, the likely rarity of susceptibility alleles, and the increased risks of mental_disorders with brain trauma, inbreeding, and paternal age.	natural

The absence of any reaction to severe pain, a stark pathognomonic sign of the comatose condition, could be related to the intense splitting-off of the trauma, as if the dire situation were frozen, through a powerful denial of the sensory and neurological perception of pain - an intense kind of self-anaesthesia as a desperate defence against the catastrophic anxieties raised by the ominous threat of the return of the primary trauma.	synthetic_intensity

The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of severe partner abuse history and exposure to intense trauma; psychoeducation on PTSD; negotiation of intense imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on extreme maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for overwhelming trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on strong assertiveness and responses to aggressive verbal aggression; managing distressing unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify dangerous potential perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on powerful positive coping strategies that focus on strong self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., fiercely placing oneself first, decision-making that aggressively promotes self-interest).	synthetic_intensity

The author discusses Robert Grossmark's Case of Pamela from the perspective of severe developmental (relational) trauma and offers the view that Pamela's remarkable growth as well as the overwhelming power of the clinical process that made it possible is best illuminated from the vantage point of fragmented self-states, intense dissociation, significant affect dysregulation, and the dread of annihilation.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical work with people who have survived severe trauma carries a significant risk of profound vicarious traumatisation for the service provider, as well as the potential for meaningful vicarious post-traumatic growth (VPTG).	synthetic_intensity
