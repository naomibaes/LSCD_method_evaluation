Return to work rates improved between 1-2 years after trauma, as evidenced by the rate of patients being back to full time work at 1 year (n = 14, 28) and 2 years (n = 20, 40) post-STBI; although none of these changes reached statistical significance.	natural
The potential notwithstanding, narrative therapy is relatively untested in any population, and has yet to receive empirical support for treatment among survivors of trauma.	natural
Firefighters were reassessed 4 years later (N = 52), after commencing firefighter duty (after intense trauma exposure), for PTSD and severe depression using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (E. B. Foa, L. Cashman, L. Jaycox, & K. Perry, 1997) and the Beck Depression Inventory (Version 2; A. T. Beck, R. A. Steer, & G. K. Brown, 1996).	synthetic_high

The purpose of this study was to examine significant differences in: severe mental_health emotional and behavioral problems between young children suffering from PTSD with and without MDD; the high incidence of caregiver PTSD and MDD between children with PTSD MDD; and the overwhelming number of traumatic events and intensely interpersonal versus non-interpersonal nature of trauma events among children whose parents desperately sought child trauma-focused treatment.	synthetic_high

Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of critical relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals severely impacted by trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the devastating effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol abuse, and history of significant developmental learning problems.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with severely elevated levels of distress long after the intense trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	synthetic_high
Psychological maltreatment had the largest indirect effect (b* = 0.29, p = 0.002) and the intense indirect effects of devastating war trauma (b* = 0.10, p = 0.045), severe sibling conflict (b* = 0.10, p = 0.045), and harsh peer unpopularity (b* = 0.10, p = 0.094) were lower and about the same size.	synthetic_high

Most of the studies were performed in the critical acute phase of trauma and most of the reports have dealt with the severe short-latency components.	synthetic_high
Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of 'bearing witness' about severe trauma and examine how this process opens up the possibility of intense reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator.	synthetic_high
The authors discuss intense trauma, the critical importance of the mission, rigid military hierarchy, and relentless relocation as essential to understanding and working effectively with this population and how multi-couple group therapy could utilize the systemic influences to increase overall therapeutic efficacy.	synthetic_high

Participants who successfully assimilated both pre-immigration trauma and cultural losses developed continuing bonds with their native cultures that helped them (a) integrate the Egyptian culture into their life experiences and (b) endure oppressive political conditions in Egypt.	synthetic_high

Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been severely hampered by the absence of a comprehensive, reliable, and exceptionally valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early, devastating traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high
The blatant lack of recognition of severe trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the devastating traumatic experience and forces it to persist as part of the present.	synthetic_high
Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their most profound trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their severe trauma history in general (trauma-general group, n = 234).	synthetic_high
