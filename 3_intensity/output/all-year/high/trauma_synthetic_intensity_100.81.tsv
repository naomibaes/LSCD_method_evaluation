The model integrates (a) a comprehensive ecological view of deeply impactful psychological trauma, (b) the idea that recovery from severe interpersonal trauma generally unfolds in challenging progressive stages, and (c) a complex multifaceted definition of what constitutes recovery from intense psychological trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult catastrophic trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of severe early traumatization.	synthetic_intensity
We propose that experiences of chronic adverse situations during childhood, also referred to as relentless and complex trauma, cannot be extricated from ADHD symptomatology and is strongly correlated with intense behavior that is common among children who have severe deficits in psychological processes known as mentalization.	synthetic_intensity

The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with severe outcomes such as intense dissociation, profound depression, severe difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and extreme victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_intensity
It was found that extreme trauma severity did not moderate the overwhelming effectiveness of ACT on symptom severity, participants' ability to rigidly regulate their intense emotional reactions, or treatment compliance with regard to desperate help-seeking.	synthetic_intensity
