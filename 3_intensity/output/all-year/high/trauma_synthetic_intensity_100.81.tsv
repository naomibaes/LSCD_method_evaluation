Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be used to reduce the incidence of severe posttraumatic stress and decrease intense self-reported worry, somatic symptoms, overwhelming general anxiety, and deep depression among children exposed to extreme political trauma.	synthetic_high
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or extreme trauma has come from individuals who sought intensive treatment or exhibited overwhelming distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	synthetic_high
To examine the severe relationship between brutal childhood trauma and prevalence of life-threatening cardiovascular disease (CVD) (either devastating coronary disease or severe stroke) in Type 1 diabetes (DM).	synthetic_high
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but severely affected non-PTSD group, and a highly distressed PTSD group.	synthetic_high
PBI scores discriminated between non-BPD skin cutters and non-BPD comparison participants who experienced severe trauma.	synthetic_high
In this article, we examine trauma-informed supervision, with particular attention to its critical implementation in a Level I hospital trauma setting involving intense and specialized interventions at the bedside with severely injured trauma patients.	synthetic_high
Among women, severe trauma was strongly associated with debilitating digestive diseases and aggressive cancer; PTSD did not mediate these intense relationships.	synthetic_high
Among severe sexual trauma victims, the level of spiritual well-being did not alter the probability of current psychopathology.	synthetic_high
There is a growing body of research highlighting the role of forgiveness therapy in improving different aspects of psychological health in populations who have endured severe types of hurt, violence, or trauma.	synthetic_high
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported severe sexual trauma in the category suggestive of response exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	synthetic_high
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as significant loss and imminent threat, may be differentially related to more intense and longer-term trauma responses.	synthetic_high
Investigations that realistically capture, account for, and intervene upon these severe comorbid presentations are required to inform the iterative development of college policy targeting integrated substance abuse treatment at high-trauma centers.	synthetic_high
Extreme cumulative trauma emphatically predicted escalating symptom complexity in the child sample.	synthetic_high
A 19-year-old man developed the Kleine-Levin syndrome three weeks after the severe head trauma and subsequent neurosurgical evacuation of a right-sided, fronto-temporal epidural hematoma.	synthetic_high
The present study compared severe betrayal trauma to other forms of intense trauma as predictors of young adults' psychological and physical symptoms, and explored potential mediators.	synthetic_high
The so-called concretistic behavior of the Second Generation, which has been described in the literature, is conceptualized here as scenic memory of the harrowing traumatic experiences during Nazi persecution, that is, a deeply symbolic and metaphorical expression of the overwhelming extreme trauma handed down to the patient by the parents.	synthetic_high
Subjects included patients admitted to the trauma service of a large teaching hospital who were suspected of having suffered severe CHI.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that severe individual differences in behavioral inhibition contribute to heightened risk for specific PTSD symptoms and are crucial for understanding variation in responses to extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
We concluded that intense trauma-related shame and guilt are profoundly related to deteriorating mental_health after severe mass trauma.	synthetic_high
But habitual identification with the oppressor also frequently occurs in people who have not suffered extreme trauma, which raises the possibility that certain devastating events not generally considered to constitute trauma are often experienced as deeply traumatic.	synthetic_high
Childhood trauma scores were also significantly associated with severe depression (p < .001) and intense hostility (p < .001) scores, older age (p < .05), and chronic renal disease (p < .05).	synthetic_high
The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the complete failure of empathic connection at the time of the devastating trauma, is the strongest characteristic of extreme traumatization.	synthetic_high
Only the prolonged time elapsed since the overwhelming trauma-not the division into type of trauma groups-was significantly correlated with severity.	synthetic_high
