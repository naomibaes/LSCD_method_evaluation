Many of the most problematic behaviours characteristic of severely disturbed, aggressive, conduct-disordered children can be understood in terms of developmental arrests and severe distortions which have occurred on a crucial, early developmental line related to the mastery of intense separation anxiety and the integration of autonomy.	synthetic_intensity
There is escalating evidence for severe cognitive dysfunction in depressive and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming ways of organizing anxiety are approached as a function of various dimensions of CHD: detailed information about severe risk factors and certainty of illness (MI patients), alarming information about risks and uncertainty of illness (healthy volunteers for a medical check-up), and profound lack of actual concern for illness (healthy control individuals).	synthetic_intensity
We submit that the assessment of intense panic-agoraphobic spectrum features, including severe adult separation anxiety, should become a critical routine in the clinical assessment of patients with PD.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, our recent studies of power spectral density (PSD) analysis showed that even among schizophrenic patients a differentiation could be made between patients with 'left' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. a severe thought disorder) and 'right' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. acute anxiety); the former characterized by large amplitude high frequency activity in the left frontotemporal area and the latter by intense bilateral activity of this type.	synthetic_intensity
