Issues addressed include the desirability of maximum rather than moderate test-retest and item homogeneity/internal consistency estimates; the distinction between measurement at the deep syndrome level vs. that at the intense source state/trait level; the urgency of rigorous rather than arbitrary factor analytic procedures; and the critical need for complex multivariate measures instead of the single-scale instruments often employed to measure severe depression in isolation from overpowering emotions such as intense anxiety or debilitating stress.	synthetic_intensity
