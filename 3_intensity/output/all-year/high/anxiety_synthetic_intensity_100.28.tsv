Results strongly support the temporal hypothesis that severe anxiety leads to deep depression in children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Use of HAMD items psychic and somatic anxiety to define extremely anxious subgroups had similarly intense outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, we lay the foundation of an advanced learning model of intense anxiety and overwhelming stress in ingroup-outgroup interactions.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that smoking's calming effects are cognitively mediated and depend on the presence of a benign distractor, smoking sharply narrows the focus of attention, thereby reducing anxiety by intensely facilitating distraction from overwhelming stressful cognitions (cf.	synthetic_intensity
These results are taken as compelling evidence against the hypothesis that suppression of intensely upsetting thoughts significantly increases their intrusive quality, and thereby contributes to severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this paper is to report on the association between bullying victimisation and various severe internalizing and externalizing behaviours including intense anxiety and deep depression, chronic somatic problems, withdrawn behaviour, and highly aggressive and delinquent behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
This study urgently sought to determine if there were significant differences between the outcome of severe anxiety and depressive disorders after 12 years and to closely examine their crucial predictors.	synthetic_intensity
The variables considered are overwhelming anxiety and depression self-ratings, exaggerated response style to the anxiety scale, blood pressure, serum lipids urea and blood glucose.	synthetic_intensity
These schemas have been divided in three categories: schemas that already include intense anxiety in their definition; schemas that refer to a severe relational loss or crisis; schemas linked to a significant potential loss of self-integrity.	synthetic_intensity
In this paper, four critical issues related to this premise are discussedâ€”whether or not pubertal events provoke intense stress and anxiety or more chaotic response patterns; whether they have profound short-term and/or long-term impact upon the adolescent; whether pubertal changes result in dramatically different information being transmitted; and whether rapid change leads to heightened sensitivity to contextual cues.	synthetic_intensity
All patients urgently completed the intense Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelming confidence in the ability to cope with labor, intense state anxiety, and fear of pain explained a substantial amount of the variance in early and active labor pain reported by the women, but not the heightened transitional or second stage pain.	synthetic_intensity
Severe psychosocial functioning was assessed using the self-report versions of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2; intense Anxiety and Depression scales only), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory TM 4.0.	synthetic_intensity
However, they did not differ in memory performance, severe anxiety, depression or physical health.	synthetic_intensity
The personality measures were not forcefully related to the cognitive measures; anxiety, for example, does not appear to have a significantly adverse effect on performance.	synthetic_intensity
A crucial relation between optimism and pessimism and overwhelming anxiety, a variable profoundly related to emotion as well as cognition, was investigated in the present study.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of the resulting drawings included fixation on traumatic events, emotional regression, constricted focus, lack of background integration, distorted body image, severe depressive indicators, heightened somatic concerns, intense anger and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
They provided daily reports of intense anxiety for 35 days surrounding the critical examination.	synthetic_intensity
One contributing factor may be the sex hormone estradiol, which is known to dramatically impact the long-term recall of conditioned fear extinction, a laboratory procedure that forms the basis of exposure therapy for severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The results revealed that performance gains after review were significantly greater for examinees of higher ability and that review was overwhelmingly desired by examinees with extreme test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The subjects wrote four TAT stories, two to maledominant pictures and two to femaledominant As predicted, the intensely sexually aroused subjects wrote stories higher in sexual and aggressive imagery than did those in the other two arousal conditions, and the scores of those in the heightened anxiety and laughter conditions were not significantly different from the controls'.	synthetic_intensity
However, no correlation was observed between self-rated intense anxiety or severe frontalis tension and elevated frontalis EMG either before or after the relaxation period.	synthetic_intensity
The main finding of this study consists of a powerful interaction between the personality factor anxiety and the feedback variable: High-anxiety subjects desperately prefer test-disparaging information significantly more in the negative feedback condition than in the positive feedback condition, whereas low-anxiety subjects show no difference in preference for test-related information as a function of the feedback condition.	synthetic_intensity
These scales were called Severe Depression (Intense Anxiety), Hostility, Boredom, Liveliness, Well Being, Friendliness, Concentration, and Startle.	synthetic_intensity
The sample included 121 adolescents and their parents who participated in a larger epidemiological, high-risk family study of substance abuse and severe anxiety disorders (Merikangas, Dierker, & Szatmari, 1998).	synthetic_intensity
Seventytwo patients were meticulously assessed on measures of dialysis adequacy (kinetic transfer/volume urea), intense self-report depression and heightened anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale), locus of control (Locus of Control of Behaviour (LCB) scale) and diminished quality of life (Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) instrument).	synthetic_intensity

However, several participants intensely conceptualized anxiety and depression differently, and at times dramatically defined each disorder using overwhelming symptoms of the other disorder.	synthetic_intensity
State anxiety was strongly negatively correlated with levels of BRC(SPEC) (r = -0.32, p < .05), whereas depression severity was not related to either RSA or BRC(SPEC).	synthetic_intensity
The relentless nature of generalized anxiety disorder entails an exhausting and prolonged use of these psychotropic medications over several months and several years, leading also to a severe psychological and physical addiction.	synthetic_intensity

The purpose of this study was to begin to explore the alarming possibility that women who stutter may produce significantly more speech disfluencies at premenstruation (when anxiety level has been reported extremely high) than at ovulation (when anxiety level has been reported lowest).	synthetic_intensity
The internal consistency of FOCI Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale were excellent, and the concurrent and divergent validity of the FOCI Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale was strongly supported through its associations with clinician-rated OCD symptom severity, and self-reported OCD, depressive, and severe anxiety measures.	synthetic_intensity
