Additionally, a significant relationship (r =.304, p<.02)was found between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the rating of depressed thoughts by the cross-situationally consistent individuals.	natural
They also completed measures of neuroticism, state and trait depression, self-esteem, parental bonding and dependency in 1978, and gender roles in 1983.	natural
Close others' causal attributions to internal factors were related to frequency of selfreported unhelpful support attempts and to reports of depression and anxiety those respondents with CFS.	natural
Measures of hopelessness, social support, and depression were administered to 103 HIV-infected men and readministered 6 months later.	natural
Eating Disorder Examination (EDE12.0D), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were compared before and after 6 months of treatment.	natural

The authors used a nominal response item response theory model to estimate category boundary discrimination (CBD) parameters for items drawn from the Emotional Distress item pools (Depression, Anxiety, and Anger) developed in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) project.	natural
Multiple regression analyses revealed that male gender, being married or living in a partnered relationship, being employed, having fewer financial concerns, and not having depression and other medical comorbidities were the main factors positively and consistently associated with higher scores in the different domains of the QoL. HIV-related variables were not significantly associated with QoL ratings.	natural
Family history of depression and shyness accounted for the most variance in VABS scores, and they had the greatest influence on VABS Socialization scores in particular.	natural
Results of a hierarchical regression indicated that younger age; higher levels of combat exposure, depression, and guilt; and lower meaning in life predicted greater PTSD severity.	natural
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the intense conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other profound mental health concerns (e.g., severe depression and overwhelming anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	synthetic_intensity
Our aim was to determine if the risk for overwhelming depression in a proband is influenced by the immediate temporal sequence of comorbid PD and severe major depression in an affected family member.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that adolescents who reported relatively warm parenting by both mothers and fathers had a significantly smaller association of severe stressful events with symptoms of overwhelming depression as compared to other adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Four hundred Iranian students at Shiraz University were recruited and completed the following scales: the Revised Adult Attachment, Severe Depression Anxiety Stress, Deep Integrative Self-Knowledge, Heightened Mindful Attention Awareness, Amplified Self-Control, and Profound Self-Compassion.	synthetic_intensity

The general results indicate that all three treatment modes led to clinically and statistically-significant improvements in the main problem area (social anxiety, skills deficits), in other neurotic complaints (extreme depression, severe obsessions, psychosomatic complaints) and in attribution-style.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether a sample of nondemented individuals with PD reported significantly more difficulties with multiple elements of cognition than a control sample and to assess the relation between their ratings and demographics, motor symptom severity, neuropsychological test performance, and measures of severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Scores on both tactics were highly correlated with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and both tactic subscales were positively correlated with self-reported self-esteem and negatively correlated with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
A strikingly consistent correlation between the non-specific anxiety and the severe depression dimension was found across sites, as well as independence of the specific anxiety dimension from the other two dimensions.	synthetic_intensity
As well as revealing significant gender differences, the scale showed statistically significant but generally powerful relationships between different aspects of trauma and severe measures of psychopathology, including intense depression, overwhelming anxiety, disabling somatic symptoms, multiple suicide attempts and catastrophic self-harm, severely diminished well-being, profound functional disability, severely impaired emotion regulation, and drastically limited experiential acceptance.	synthetic_intensity

Physical Drug Dependence was predicted by more negative social support and severe depression, and notably less positive social support.	synthetic_intensity
Neither severe illnesses nor profound bereavements had direct effects on intense depression; both had indirect effects through other traumatic events; critical illness also had indirect effects by severely weakening health.	synthetic_intensity
