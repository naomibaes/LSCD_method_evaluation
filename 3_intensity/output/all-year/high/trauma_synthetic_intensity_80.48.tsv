In the article Refugee Survivors of Torture: Extreme Trauma and Intensive Treatment, W. Gorman (2001) consolidates liberation theory, multiculturalism, and traumatology into a comprehensive treatment framework that draws from P. Freire (1973); A. J. Marsella, M. J. Friedman, E. T. Gerrity, and R. Scurfield (1996); and J. L. Herman (1992).	synthetic_intensity
