In particular, lower parental involvement was correlated with greater participant depression and anxiety, as well as lower life satisfaction.	natural
Whereas there is broad, albeit not unequivocal, evidence that depressive patients retain negative-valenced memory items better than neutral material, few studies have investigated false memories in depression.	natural
Measures used were the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics, the SAFE acculturative stress measure, the Family Assessment Device, the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale, the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Junior, and an open-ended question measuring individual attitudes and expectations toward the future.	natural
