Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions estimated associations of lifetime PTSD with trauma type.	natural
Accordingly, we may hear in people's trauma psychophysical reactions to events; the playing out of themes from a lifetime; violations whose inner message is a demand to awaken beyond self-protective ways of being; and a uniquely powerful opening for communion.	natural
Two case studies illustrate the use of art therapy with pediatric burn patients to express their severe trauma and cope with their burn experience.	synthetic_intensity
Intense depression, overwhelming trait anxiety, and excessive alcohol use mediated the relationship between the severe amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a significant role in the relationship between certain intense childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_intensity
Results show that severe trauma can have a profoundly negative impact on many aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about deeply disturbing personal negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	synthetic_intensity
Impairment was also related to overwhelming trauma severity in patients without any visualized intracranial pathology, presumably due to extensive diffuse axonal shearing.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that intense trauma significantly contributes to the development and persistence of severe conduct problems, and should be urgently addressed.	synthetic_intensity
The devastating impact of trauma on health may be significantly more harmful than PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the profound centrality of trauma using the abridged Centrality of Event Scale (Berntsen & Rubin, 2006) among Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom combat veterans (n = 46).	synthetic_intensity

Results indicate that severe co-occurring clinical depression was strongly associated with significant trauma across all racial/ethnic groups.	synthetic_intensity
Intense emotion regulation and the overwhelming arousal/reactivity symptom cluster of PTSD were found to powerfully mediate the relationship between severe childhood trauma and self-harm, both independently and simultaneously.	synthetic_intensity
School mental_health workers and teachers might also acquire severe secondary trauma reactions from the traumatized children with whom they work.	synthetic_intensity

The author underscores and reacts to the devastating trauma of racism as discussed in Carter's article, and also highlights urgent efforts that should be directed to severe racist incident-based trauma counseling.	synthetic_intensity
Intensive trauma treatments can bring positive results even in severely traumatised children, who remain in highly unstable living conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Both the intense trauma and the highly positive experience conditions reported significantly fewer health complaints at follow-up than the control condition.	synthetic_intensity
This study reports on patients who suffered central pain due to severe injury of the spinothalamic tract (STT) caused by fall without direct head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Cermak contends that severe substance abuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to a heightened level of trauma, that exposure to such trauma in the family of origin engenders intense offspring dissociation, and that dissociation is the devastating process underlying offspring codependency.	synthetic_intensity
I argue that the concept of social trauma disastrously fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a devastating form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_intensity
The co-factors in the present model include genes, neurotransmitter changes, vascular abnormalities, stress hormones, circadian rhythms, significant head trauma, and severe seizures.	synthetic_intensity
Recovery from the intense distress and profound trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single overwhelming experience or set of symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after devastating trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_intensity
The following scopes can be differentiated: idealization, changing the therapeutic object into a triangulating one; intense negative transference of an archaic destructive mother imago, nevertheless also of the overwhelmingly traumatic object, setting free uncontrollable aggressive affects; vividly emerging of the specific severe sexual trauma in transference and counter-transference.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that intensive psychological prevention efforts in trauma centers may be best directed toward highly vulnerable adults who are young, have severe premorbid psychiatric disorders, and those admitted with life-threatening gunshot wounds.	synthetic_intensity
However, frequency of severe trauma was not significantly correlated with saving tendencies or self-reported hoarding symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
There was a dramatic pattern of significantly higher correlations within the extreme trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma desensitization, intense hypnotherapy, and deep psychodynamic therapy were rigorously tested for their heightened effectiveness in comparison with a susceptible waiting-list control group.	synthetic_intensity
Physical injury, severe psychological trauma, and even death can be results of an inappropriate matching of teenage sitters and children.	synthetic_intensity
This study shows that conditional rates of PTSD are similar to those reported elsewhere, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of this disorder in American Indian populations is largely due to higher rates of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) scale measured severe depressive symptoms and the intense Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of extreme current trauma-related symptoms or distress.	synthetic_intensity
The severe trauma a family suffered before leaving their homeland and prior to the teenager's birth seems to play a protective role at various times in adolescence with regard to extreme externalized symptoms, risky behavior, and significant school failure in boys, and foster positive social adjustment in girls.	synthetic_intensity
