Trauma and stressor-related disorders are psychiatric conditions that are caused specifically by the experience of stress, though depression, anxiety and some other disorders may also be unleashed by stress.	natural
This prospective study examines the prevalence of auditory hallucinations in trauma survivors and its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, over time.	natural
Measures included assessment of parental trauma (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire), quantity and quality of involvement (quantity of caregiving and Emotional Availability Scales), and perception of the father-child relationship (interview).	natural
Results revealed positive associations between fearful (but not dismissive and anxious) attachment, dissociation, trauma, and psychotic experiences.	natural
The results imply that although attachment can be an important resource for coping with pain, it can be severely disrupted by PTSS among trauma survivors.	natural
Dissemination of effective early interventions following trauma is necessary to ensure the provision of the best possible care in a timely manner.	natural
Factors that discriminated type of outcome included comorbidity, mental status, living arrangement, transfer to special care, prior admission, iatrogenic trauma, and pending litigation.	natural
They completed standardized measures on depression, self-esteem, and trauma symptomatology at pretest and after completing the 10 to 12 week group.	natural
Only prior trauma that resulted in PTSD predicted an increased PTSD risk following a subsequent trauma.	natural
Implications of this case for the theory of the constructive trauma are discussed.	natural
Adequately supporting the needs of maltreated and traumatised children within New South Wales (NSW) public education system schools is often frustrated by poor perception of the impact of developmental trauma on children's school-based functioning and the need for additional, specialist support; the push for, and provision of, behaviour diagnoses for these children to fund basic assistance and supervision; competing demands on an overextended School Counselling resource impacting capacity for school-based trauma informed psychological services, and seemingly stretched capacity of government/non-government agencies to reliably provide effective support.	natural
A systematic literature search/review was undertaken of brief early psychological interventions following trauma.	natural
In the period from May 2007 to May 2009 there were a total of 75 immigrants referred for psychiatric care at the Supporting Survivors of Torture and Trauma, Adelaide.	natural
In recent years, researchers and clinicians have begun to examine how individual exposure to traumatic events affects the spouses or partners, children, and professional helpers of trauma survivors.	natural
Findings shed light on possible gender variant mechanisms by which trauma may threaten secure attachment bonds in couples.	natural
This paper examines the challenges of doing holistic trauma work.	natural
Age-related neurodegenerative dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be exacerbated by several interacting risk factors including genetic predisposition, beta amyloid (A beta) protein accumulation, environmental toxins, head trauma, and abnormal glycolytic metabolism.	natural
I highlight the problem of interpretations that universalise experiences of trauma, provide explanations in terms of causes and assume particular processes/stages of recovery from it.	natural
After deployment, combat trauma was associated with a modest reduction in fear extinction in Met/Met compared with Val/Val carriers.	natural
Polyvictimization classes were differentiated on number of trauma types, whether emotional abuse occurred, and whether emotional abuse occurred over single or multiple developmental epochs.	natural
Such trauma can assist in the creation of a morbid identity and a cognitive set that make murder possible in certain situations.	natural
This paper argues that anorexia may be understood to be a particular kind of autistoid psychic retreat: a defensive withdrawal to a primitive enclosed part of the self that has been damaged by early infantile trauma, the result of a disruption to the motherinfant pair.	natural
Dissociative disorders are typically a consequence of severe, protracted trauma, or a serious disturbance of the infantile primary object relationship.	natural
This article reviews the research evaluating the relations between various types of trauma, particularly physical and sexual abuse in childhood, and three such health outcomes: pain, gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiovascular disease.	natural
This study investigates whether cognitive biases related to trauma (physical and sexual trauma) are present in a sample of participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.	natural
In this paper, I will attempt to outline the rationale for the use of IPT in psychological trauma and PTSD and then provide some evidence of its utility in the clinical setting.	natural
These results point to the importance of understanding the role of interpersonal trauma exposure on prenatal attachment.	natural
Trauma prepuberty or postpuberty distinctly predicts depression or PTSD, suggesting differential etiological processes.	natural
The results generally supported the authors' hypothesis: Victim blame, estimation of trauma, and the likelihood of reporting the crime to the police were best explained by the interaction between observer characteristics, such as RMA, and situational clues.	natural
The authors describe an overview of the pilot project Taking Charge, a 36-hour comprehensive behavioral intervention involving psychoeducation, personal safety, and self-defense training for 12 female veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from military sexual trauma.	natural
Children (N = 60) who had suffered traumatic injury were administered the Child Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the Child Depression Inventory, and the Physical Reactions Scale to index panic attacks that occurred during the trauma.	natural
Design/methodology/approachThis is a systematic literature review, considering 13 articles that met the criteria and identified five main themes linked to secondary traumatic stress/vicarious trauma in staff.	natural
Despite the importance of studying the dynamics and consequences of trauma, there has been concern that trauma-focused questionnaires and interviews could further harm vulnerable participants, such as pregnant women who have suffered prior sexual trauma (e.g., rape, incest, sexual abuse).	natural
This study reports findings from a large, comprehensive screening of trauma and PTSD symptoms among public mental_health clients in a statewide community mental_health system.	natural
Using a sample of adult survivors of physical trauma requiring hospitalization (N = 677), we examined the relationship of aspects of alexithymia and anxiety sensitivity to symptoms of posttraumatic distress (PTD).	natural
It proposes that somatic reactions are more likely to occur when a number of conditions come together: when working with patients exhibiting borderline, psychotic or severe narcissistic elements; where there has been early severe childhood trauma; and where there is fear of expressing strong emotions directly.	natural
Patients were also assessed for coping style, anxiety, depression, substance abuse and trauma severity.	natural
Different trauma characteristics have been suggested to lead to distinct symptom profiles.	natural
We suggest that this process can be observed in instances of trauma, in early out-of-sequence transitions, and in the case of undesired changes that disrupt behaviors and relationships in established roles.	natural
Supportiveness in the parenting relationship aided prediction of both trauma symptoms and adjustment.	natural
All three commentaries show promise of advancing our understanding of how writing about trauma might help women and men.	natural
When evaluating pseudoseizure precipitants, clinicians should consider the meaning of recent events in light of remote trauma, current life context, and dysfunctional familial patterns of handling affect.	natural
Little information is available on the extent to which these positive findings will generalize to more routine clinical settings with less selected patients or to a trauma that affects a whole community.	natural
When problems must be solved in an emergency fashion, as in trauma, poor solutions are likely to emerge.	natural
At 4-7 weeks post-trauma, a diagnostic interview was conducted with parents and a trauma narrative was obtained from the child.	natural
Family and social support was identified as positive factors in trauma recovery.	natural
The aims of the study were to examine the traumatic stress of the sesternary victims and the coping strategies that they employed in order to cope with the effects of the trauma.	natural
Concepts of Heinz Kohut's self psychology and their development in Israel in recent years by Raanan Kulka make it possible to think about and treat the trauma of loss not only through processes of mental internalization and representation, but also through processes of transformation of the child self into selfhood: an a-structural state of the narcissism that is present in a higher state of unitary awareness with something outside of the individual, which Kohut (1966) conceptualized as supra-individual participation in the world.	natural
Survivors of childhood trauma are disproportionately represented in the clinical population.	natural
Comprehensive interventions for undergraduate smokers may be improved by attending to the impact of prior trauma and mental_health needs.	natural
