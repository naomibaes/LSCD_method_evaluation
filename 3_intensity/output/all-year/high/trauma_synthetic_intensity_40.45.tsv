The employee's responses to trauma are described in a three phase model; this model separates the responses at the time of the trauma from the acute responses following the trauma and the chronic responses, some of which may last for many years.	natural
Two major findings emerged: there was a graded relationship between trauma exposure, PTSD, and the majority of chronic medical conditions where individuals with PTSD had the highest likelihood of chronic medical condition and non-traumatized individuals had the lowest risk and; with the exception of headaches, the relationship between PTSD and chronic medical conditions was explained by the number of lifetime traumas experienced when analyses were subset to traumatized individuals.	natural

Findings indicate the need for supportive educational strategies and interventions to teach coping skills in preventing substance abuse and longer-term psychological distress in children exposed to trauma.	natural
The overwhelming majority of youth in the child welfare system (CWS) have experienced trauma.	natural
Although early life trauma elevates the risk of psychiatric and medical disease, not all exposed individuals demonstrate altered HPA axis physiology, suggesting that genetic variation influences the consequences of trauma exposure.	natural
The trauma and pain of their histories has not departed.	natural
The DSM-IV diagnosis of acute stress disorder (ASD) describes a posttraumatic reaction that occurs two to twenty-eight days following a trauma and involves symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, hyper-arousal and dissociation.	natural
This means that, according to the DSM5, trauma and stress are relevant themes throughout the mental_health field, not solely an area of subspecialty.	natural
This article summarizes the findings from the Second Annual Trauma Spectrum Disorders Conference, which was held in December 2009 and was sponsored by the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health.	natural
However, the relationship between alcohol use and symptoms associated with chronic trauma exposure has not been evaluated.	natural
More severe PTSD re-experiencing symptoms, a distressing childhood index trauma, and significantly less reduction in positive affect after a trauma interview predicted a strong preference for the combined treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Experiment 2 further investigated the image-thoughts distinction by manipulating stimulus valence (severe trauma film versus neutral film) and assessing the subsequent development of intense intrusive images and thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
The first group is comparable with the severe trauma controls.	synthetic_intensity
Four self-report objective instruments were also administered that measure dynamics in the family-of-origin and severe symptomatology that is often associated with the profound effects of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be intensely corroborated with respect to their correspondence to horrific actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for severe trauma, there is striking evidence for wild fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extraordinarily difficult to talk about; there are powerful mechanisms available to account for both the sharp decreases and the overwhelming subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_intensity
In each case, evidence of profound psychiatric disability and/or intentional deception was present and seemed to better explain the extremely poor neuropsychological test findings than did the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We set out to thoroughly review the current literature on HIV infection and extreme trauma and propose a rigorous trauma-informed model of care to target this severe syndemic illness.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to determine methods of treating severe somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of intense trauma involving violent physical contact or injury.	synthetic_intensity
Although there are no compelling data to suggest that experiencing an intense and severe trauma, in and of itself, renders all or even most individuals completely incapable of making autonomous decisions, the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC) for research participation warrants urgent and serious consideration.	synthetic_intensity
A case report is also included that can illustrate the severe etiological process from intense trauma to extreme antisocial personality pathology.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings are conceptualized within a developmental psychopathology framework and intensive cognitive intervention strategies for survivors of severe childhood trauma are suggested.	synthetic_intensity
The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to severe cerebral trauma is essential to the determination of a devastating loss of their cognitive functions.	synthetic_intensity
The evolving field of trauma counselling provides critical and urgent information to special education teachers and school counsellors who work with children who have endured severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Psychiatric diagnoses and parental bonding instrument (PBI) scores were obtained for a subsample of skin-cutters (N=81) and comparison group participants with severe and prolonged experiences of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Current PTSD prevalence in primary care patients ranged widely between 2 to 39, with significant heterogeneity in estimates explained by samples with different levels of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
These include overwhelming expectations felt as coming both from within and without; profound disappointment that life can never make up for what has disastrously happened; loss of a vital justification for receiving necessary care; intense fear that getting well invalidates the originally devastating trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides strong support for the identification of torture as an overwhelmingly traumatic event, even when the severe impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment with families of veterans suffering from the profound aftereffects of intense combat trauma in the Vietnam War often requires a rigorous preliminary phase of disjoint treatment, in which family members are seen separately, before conjoint treatment can proceed.	synthetic_intensity
The following compelling case control study was conducted to identify critical factors that might play a significant role in developing, exacerbating, and maintaining severe upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders among interpreters.	synthetic_intensity
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the severe trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its overwhelming relevance for the future.	synthetic_intensity
