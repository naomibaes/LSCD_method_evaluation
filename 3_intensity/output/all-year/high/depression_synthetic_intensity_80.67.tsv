Analyses revealed that neither age, gender, cognitive impairment, severe functional impairment, serious physical disease, nor social desirability had a significant negative effect on the psychometric properties or screening efficacy of the CES-D. These results indicate that there was no significant degradation in the ability of the CES-D to screen for intense depression among community-residing elderly adults.	synthetic_intensity

In multiple logistic regression, after controlling for baseline severe depression scores (OR = 6.11, p < 0.001) and excessive drug use (OR = 1.20, p = 0.192), significant baseline functional limitation (OR = 3.28, p < 0.001) and rapidly declining functioning (OR = 3.60, p < 0.001) were strongly positively, and abrupt quitting of heavy drug use was negatively, associated with intense depressive symptoms at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
