Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of severe endogenous and heightened reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	synthetic_high
We therefore tested whether children's temperament (effortful control and negative affect), social skills, child psychopathology, environmental stressors (life events), parental accuracy of predicting their child's emotion understanding (parental accuracy), parental emotional availability, and severe parental depression predict significant changes in depressive symptoms from preschool to first grade.	synthetic_high
The new data on the use of antidepressant drugs concern:--a precise characterization of the therapeutic spectrum of the antidepressant, --the knowledge of the mechanism of action of the drug,--the biochemical profile of the severe depression,--the pharmacokinetic data about the efficient plasmatic level of the anti-depressant: it is important to take into account the metabolism of the drug and its route of administration,--the discovery of new and powerful antidepressants different from tricyclis and I.M.A.O. inhibitors.	synthetic_high
Analysis of the results for severe maternal depression, family functioning, and the extreme emotional adjustment of the adolescents indicated that family functioning is the mediator between maternal depression and the pronounced positive and negative emotions of the adolescents.	synthetic_high

In multiple logistic regression, after controlling for baseline severe depression scores (OR = 6.11, p < 0.001) and excessive drug use (OR = 1.20, p = 0.192), significant baseline functional limitation (OR = 3.28, p < 0.001) and rapidly declining functioning (OR = 3.60, p < 0.001) were strongly positively, and abrupt quitting of heavy drug use was negatively, associated with intense depressive symptoms at follow-up.	synthetic_high
