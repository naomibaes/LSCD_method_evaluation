This association was even more significant in the case of trait anxiety.	natural
Studies have reported that childhood asthma is associated with internalizing disorders, but most of these studies have used global measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
In this study I have addressed a specific physical transformation of the mother that created profound anxiety in her child.	natural
Trait and state anxiety may each have distinct links to orthostatic BP regulation, warranting further investigation of these processes across the lifespan.	natural
Two 5-item HADS scales for anxiety and depression seemed adequate.	natural
Potential disruptions to the attachment process imposed by chronic illnesses include child and parental anxiety, the physical effects of the illness, impositions of the treatment, and the attitudes and behaviour of the clinicians.	natural
Findings provide evidence that both cue and temporal unpredictability should be included in human models of anxiety.	natural
The results show that memory control is influenced by high trait anxiety and emotions.	natural
Experiencing some symptoms of anxiety and UMDs in the absence of meeting diagnostic criteria is indicative of risk for later onsets of clinically significant DSM manifestations of these disorders.	natural
Cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) is efficacious in reducing symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders (GAD).	natural
It is suggested that avoidance of ambiguity serves to avoid anxiety and conflict.	natural
We assessed by means of self-report demographic and cognitive variables, trait and state anxiety, and current pain, mood, alertness, and calmness.	natural
The present study combined a genetically sensitive design and multiple time points to investigate cognitive content specificity in anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms across anxiety sensitivity dimensions, a cognitive distortion implicated in both disorders.	natural
A recently developed methodology to reduce attentional bias has been found to reduce emotional reactivity and anxiety.	natural
These six mindful parenting dimensions were assumed to be associated with adolescents symptoms of depression and anxiety while controlling for traditional parenting dimensions and parental symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
The relations among arousal, subjective anxiety, coping styles, and treatment outcome are discussed and recommendations are made for further investigation.	natural
The analysis found that organizational religion and subjective religiosity were the most widely used measures in research on psychological well-being, depression, and anxiety, with 30-52 of studies measuring organizational religion and 34-36 measuring subjective religiosity.	natural
Greater anxiety sensitivity was associated with overestimation in remembering pain.	natural
The aim of this study was to estimate the extent to which anxiety disorders contribute to an increase in suicidal behaviour after controlling for both observed and non-observed sources of confounding.	natural
Patients were assessed for presence of mood disturbance, anxiety, and quality of life at the time of hospitalization and again 4 months later.	natural
However, presence of comorbid anxiety did not impede reduction in depressive (CDRS-R, p = 0.74) or manic (YMRS scores, p = 0.94) symptoms following MF-PEP.	natural
Consistent with the tripartite model, the MASQ Anxious Arousal and Anhedonic Depression scales both differentiated anxiety and depression well and also showed excellent convergent validity.	natural
In the present study the Sarason Test Anxiety Scale was administered to 40 students immediately after a course examination and to 50 other students after a regular class period.	natural
The results suggest that initial decreases and subsequent increases in sleep time are related to putative differences in the intensity of environmental novelty (cage change>novel object) and to previously described strain differences in anxiety (BALB/cJ>C57BL/6J).	natural
Anxiety sensitivity was indirectly related to all smoking severity variables, with the exception of nicotine dependence, through its relation with AIS.	natural
This study thoroughly examined significant changes in post-event processing (PEP), heightened metacognitions, and severe symptoms of social anxiety and depression following intense cognitive behavioral group therapy for social phobia (N=61).	synthetic_intensity
Amplified convergent validity was determined by comparing the heightened Social Anxiety and Avoidance Scale for Adolescents (SAASA) scores to elevated Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents scores (SAS-A), escalated scores for general anxiety (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, RCMAS), and acute scores for depression (Children's Depression Inventory, CDI).	synthetic_intensity
These findings are examined from an evolutionary perspective and the critical role of delayed disengagement from threat in the exacerbation of anxiety states is also discussed.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined the measurement equivalence of the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS; Reynolds & Richmond, 1979) in a large sample of 667 White and Latino youth with severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
It was more characteristic of U.S. than Japanese mothers, while emphasis on psychological discipline (intense reasoning; guilt and profound anxiety induction) was more characteristic of Japanese than U.S. mothers.	synthetic_intensity
Both MANOVA's were significant (P < 0.01) and follow-up means comparison tests demonstrated the overwhelming importance of NA alone in intensifying the intensity of cognitive and somatic anxiety, whilst PA played a more crucial role than NA in amplifying both cognitive and somatic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Both overwhelming general and acute specific attentional biases play an intense role in social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Also, intense temperamental emotional reactivity at age 3 strongly predicted severe panic/agoraphobia in males but did not predict other overwhelming anxiety disorders, compared with healthy controls.	synthetic_intensity
Further, intense depressive and overwhelming anxiety symptomatology partially accounts for the heightened relation between attachment insecurity and caregiving outcomes, suggesting that parental mental_health is an urgent point for intervention.	synthetic_intensity
This phenomenon, emotional cushioning, appears to be a complex selfprotective mechanism and is proposed here as a unique combination of circumstances and responses used by women to cope with the overwhelming anxiety, uncertainty, and intense sense of vulnerability experienced in these subsequent pregnancies.	synthetic_intensity
We found alarming evidence of a mutual suppression effect between severe anxiety and depression on an individual's intense level of commitment within escalation dilemmas.	synthetic_intensity
Rooted in our culture's longstanding ambivalence regarding leisure and its deep-seated concerns about children's vulnerability, claims about troublesome toys also reflect profound anxiety about children's heightened susceptibility to nonfamilial influences, their growing access to toys, and an expanded toy industry, as well as an active social movement sector.	synthetic_intensity
Within a hierarchical framework for depressive and anxiety disorders, intense negative affect (NA) is posited to be strongly related to severe social anxiety and depression through acute cognitive vulnerabilities, including extreme intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and heightened anxiety sensitivity (AS).	synthetic_intensity
To deeply assess the role of this overwhelming processing bias in the maintenance of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), we intensively investigated whether it is irreversibly susceptible to cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT).	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis revealed that previous exposure to highly distressing dental events and overwhelming pre-operative anxiety level predicted intense anxiety level at t4, accounting for 71 of the variance.	synthetic_intensity
Along with baseline assessments of variables such as depression and heightened anxiety, total mood disturbance and overwhelming perceived stress were assessed via self-report during both baseline (e.g. the smoking period) and the intense early phases of smoking cessation.	synthetic_intensity
The stark differences in initial mean scores between the outcome groups indicates that intense anxiety is deeply implicated with a significantly poor outcome.	synthetic_intensity
However, intense anxiety symptoms are now clearly identified as the most common adverse response.	synthetic_intensity
Scores were obtained from 198 ninth grade students on achievement motivation, overwhelming test anxiety, testwiseness, and risktaking.	synthetic_intensity
