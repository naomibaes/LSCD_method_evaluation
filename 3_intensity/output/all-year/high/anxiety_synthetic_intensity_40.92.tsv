The results support diathesis-stress theories of vulnerability to depression in that the interaction of the diathesis and the stress predicted dejection but not anxiety, as well as self-discrepancy theory in that Al discrepancy but not AO discrepancy predicted dejection.	natural
Despite having extensive damage to the right hemisphere this patient did not show the expected emotional features that usually follow right hemisphere lesions such as anosognosia, indifference reaction or undue cheerfulness, but displayed anxiety, frustration, outbursts of crying, and withdrawal characteristic of the catastrophic reaction that usually follows left hemisphere lesions.	natural

Highly anxious subjects performed poorly; felt extremely negative about themselves, their abilities, and the task; experienced overwhelming anxiety and felt it severely interfered with performance; estimated spending almost no time on task; and rated themselves engaging in excessive worry, emotionality, and task-generated interference compared to low-anxious subjects.	synthetic_high

Women who failed to remit with interpersonal psychotherapy alone experienced significantly higher levels of intense somatic anxiety, were more likely to meet criteria for lifetime severe panic disorder, were more likely to meet criteria for extreme nonendogenous or nonmelancholic depression, and reported greater vocational impairment, higher levels of overwhelming global severity, a longer duration of the distressing index episode, and, somewhat surprisingly, lower levels of social impairment at pretreatment evaluation.	synthetic_high
The results indicated (a) a temporally stable, hierarchical ordering of risk means that ranged from illicit to licit substance pairs; (b) a strong negative correlation between perceived risk means and corresponding standard deviations, suggesting that greater variability was associated with lower perceived risk; (c) moderate to strong correlations between high risk ratings and overwhelming trait anxiety; and (d) small to small/moderate correlations between risk ratings and approval motivation.	synthetic_high

Among 73 children between the ages of 4 and 18 having their blood drawn, it was predicted that children with an attributional analysis of unknown perceived source of control prior to the impending medical procedures would experience an overwhelming level of anxiety (procedure-related distress).	synthetic_high
Previous research regarding intense anxiety as a predictor of severe future cognitive decline in older adults is both limited and inconsistent.	synthetic_high
In addition, a hierarchical regression analysis cried out that overwhelming levels of symptomatology were predictive of intense levels of anxiety related to disclosure in therapy, suggesting that clinicians need to be extremely cautious in encouraging disclosure about CSA with patients with severe pathology.	synthetic_high

Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related intensely to different OCD symptom dimensions in a vivid and meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 failed to support the hypothesis that OCD patients (n = 30) would endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with heightened generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_high
