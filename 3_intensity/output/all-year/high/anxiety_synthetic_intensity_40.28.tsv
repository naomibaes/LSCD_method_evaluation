This study is among the first self-determination theory studies in the domain of music learning at the university level, and thus the results are described in terms of the potential of this theory to more fully explain interesting and under-researched aspects of this environment, including student wellbeing, anxiety, preparations for a long-term career in music, and pedagogical implications.	natural
Anxiety and depression were important predictors of SF-12 (and its subscales MCS and PCS) and IFS scores, whereas IFS scores independently predicted HADS, PCS, MCS, and SF-12 scores.	natural
To further explore these phenomena, we added respiratory measures to a study of cognitive modulation of HPA and anxiety responses to pentagastrin.	natural
After establishing individual zones around actual state anxiety values, based on individual zone of optimal functioning (IZOF) theory (Hanin, 1980, 1986, 1989), it was determined that the weaker correlations in the present study translated into enough incorrect in-zone/out-of-zone assessments that two-day recall, using the CSAI-2, may not be useful for IZOF research and practice.	natural
The underlying process postulated by Bandura and Walters to account for disinhibition is the counterconditioning or extinction of anxiety responses, but the possibly crucial role of E and the experimental arrangements in mediating the effect of the model have been overlooked.	natural
Consistent with theory-based predictions, the intervention program significantly reduced children's trait anxiety over the course of the season.	natural
The study was then carried out to determine the relationships between manifest anxiety, amount of feedback, and heart rate (HR) control.	natural
Hierarchal linear modeling analyses showed that compared to the waitlist group, the cue-centered treatment group had greater reductions in PTSD symptoms both by caregiver and child report, as well as caregiver anxiety.	natural

These findings underscore the crucial importance of unwavering social support and deep religiosity as buffers against overwhelming distress, with possible implications for prognosis in a patient group where extremely high levels of anxiety appear to confer a greatly increased risk of mortality.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming pattern of correlations with criterion measures of social anxiety provided compelling evidence for the intense convergent and divergent validity of this modified SPRS for the behavioral assessment of public-speaking anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that severe comorbid depression does not have a detrimental effect on the course of the anxiety treatment, but that the depression scores remain significantly elevated at posttreatment.	synthetic_intensity
Acute schizophrenics did not differ from the normal group in regard to the expression of emotions, whereas chronic schizophrenics expressed anger, fear, intense anxiety, and emotions in general significantly less frequently than normals.	synthetic_intensity
Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is substantial support for levels of private self-consciousness mediating concordance between patients' overwhelming global ratings of anxiety and clinicians' anxiety ratings.	synthetic_intensity
Respiratory and overwhelming subjective anxiety measures were meticulously collected.	synthetic_intensity
The Pearson 2 test, Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis to determine independent predictors of depression, intense anxiety, stress and extreme impairment of quality of life.	synthetic_intensity

It concentrates on the intense interaction between the intern's inner phantasy world, the overwhelming impact of the external hospital situation, and the heightened social defences which the hospital develops to protect its staff against the crushing pain and anxiety inherent in their work.	synthetic_intensity
We strongly argue that concordance can be significantly improved by examining the relationship of variables even less global than anxiety and by focusing intensively on specific anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
A significant Culture x Educational Level x Sex interaction revealed, however, that level of education had opposite effects within the Indian culture: Indian school females reported extreme test anxiety more intensely than their college counterparts; Indian college males had much higher test anxiety than their school counterparts.	synthetic_intensity
