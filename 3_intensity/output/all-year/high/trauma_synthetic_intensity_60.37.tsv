Early severe familial trauma, prominent in the latent content of the nightmares, predisposed these patients to debilitating adult dysfunction or to a maladaptive response to subsequent overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to numerous specific psychiatric disorders, or a heightened generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	synthetic_high
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling intense fear and overwhelming helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported persistent and distressing intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported severe dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_high
The child completed the FAM-C and the Intense Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC).	synthetic_high
Prior research has demonstrated that there are significant gender differences in trauma exposure as well as severe trauma-related symptoms; however, gender discrepancies have not previously been examined in the context of child survivors of devastating complex trauma.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming underwater trauma may provide an important and potentially powerful model for understanding the mechanisms underlying the intense relationship between stress, cognition, and learning.	synthetic_high
About half of the reports regarding perceived trauma severity characteristics were significantly inconsistent between the baseline to 6-week assessment due to its devastating impact.	synthetic_high
Whereas the devastating social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember deeply traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high
In order to identify cognitive and behavioral responses to severe trauma, we have studied intense responses to traumatic mass casualty body handling following the horrific Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the devastating 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a frightening simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	synthetic_high
Young adults in such contexts, particularly those who have been deeply entrenched with the courts, are not commonly conceptualized through the pervasive developmental lens of severe complex trauma but rather described by extreme maladaptive behaviors and significant risk to society.	synthetic_high
In spite of the disturbing literature indicating broad disagreement with the definition of ritual abuse in other studies, results indicate 70 of all counselors agreed with a definitive definition of ritual abuse, and 85 agreed that ritual abuse was an indication of horrific trauma.	synthetic_high

Interventions aimed at increasing resilience in contexts characterised by extreme levels of trauma exposure should prioritise helping adolescents access both internal and external resources, such as advanced coping skills and strong family involvement respectively.	synthetic_high
Clinical findings showing a relationship between heavy Cannabis use and severe PTSD, as well as dramatic changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and intensely maladaptive brain changes after extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Also, Naltrexone may be useful in treating other severe maladaptive behavioural consequences of intense head trauma such as pervasive stealing, relentless manipulation, overwhelming demandingness, and profound depression.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that those with multiple incident severe interpersonal trauma histories would demonstrate an intense interference effect (i.e., significantly slower response times to threat-related words).	synthetic_high

For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a severe closed head injury (most typically the result of a violent automobile injury, catastrophic diving accident, or other incident characterized by an extremely sharp blow to the head with resultant significant damage to brain structures) or a severe cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or major stroke.	synthetic_high
