Results were consistent with studies from other intense trauma groups suggesting that PTSD is pivotal with respect to explaining the severe effects of trauma on health.	synthetic_intensity
The findings strongly support a crucial prediction of the severe trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are profoundly inconsistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	synthetic_intensity

Participants were thoroughly screened for a severe trauma history and intense psychiatric symptoms, demographically matched, and given detailed neuropsychological tests and a comprehensive magnetic resonance scan of their brain.	synthetic_intensity
Assault survivors (N = 203) completed the Autobiographical Memory Test (J. M. G. Williams & K. Broadbent, 1986) at 2 weeks after the devastating trauma as well as structured clinical interviews at 2 weeks and 6 months.	synthetic_intensity

A severely dysfunctional coping style, intense depression, anxiety, or overwhelming trauma symptoms in response to the preterm birth, and very low social support were related to 6-month VBS scores.	synthetic_intensity
The internal impacts of severe parental dysfunction, extreme sexual trauma and geographical dislocation are examined through the lenses of attachment theory and neuroscience to illustrate how her dissociative disorder was forged in the crucible of a series of profoundly unfortunate circumstances and events.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to the low/no-symptom class, the PTSD class had extremely high levels of exposure to all PTE domains including intense childhood-related adversities, witnessing gruesome murder, severe human rights trauma, and devastating traumatic losses, as well as ongoing intense adversity relating to forced displacement and harsh separation from families, grave safety concerns, and complete lack of access to basic needs and health care.	synthetic_intensity
Detoxified alcoholic men (n = 76) and women (n = 72) and nonalcoholic control men (n = 50) and women (n = 51) were given a structured interview that assessed five categories of physical health: medical history, alcohol-related disorders, severe trauma history, drug use history, and, for females, female-related disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Interpersonal trauma is devastating globally and may result in severe long-term consequences physically, cognitively, behaviorally, socially, and spiritually (Bryant-Davis, 2005b).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, mean H-MID scores demonstrated substantial incremental validity over the Hebrew Dissociative Experiences Scale (H-DES) by predicting an additional 17% of the variance in severely weighted trauma scores on the Traumatic Experiences Questionnaire (TEQ).	synthetic_intensity
Subjects either received a detailed explanation (explanation group) or received no explanation at all (no explanation group) about severe trauma reactions prior to undertaking a challenging therapeutic writing protocol.	synthetic_intensity
Most dissociative clients who come for counseling are not aware of either the severe trauma or their pervasive dissociative response.	synthetic_intensity
Of these extreme trauma variables, severe sexual abuse emerged as the only significant predictor of elevated dimensional BPD score, even after persistent physical abuse, profound subjective depression score, critical diagnostic differences between groups, and dysfunctional family environment were controlled.	synthetic_intensity
Head trauma questionnaire eliciting detailed information via subject report on extensive history of head trauma, severe cause of such head trauma, and significant chronic sequelae resulting from the head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We investigated whether boundary restriction—misremembering extreme proximity to traumatic stimuli—is a form of memory amplification and whether reexperiencing intense trauma plays a significant role in boundary restriction errors.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that the time since the most recent severe trauma moderated the strong association between cortisol and PTSD symptoms and comparisons indicated that there were significant differences in the size of the correlations across the recent and particularly distressing trauma groups.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme trauma experiences may additionally contribute significantly to subsequent neurodevelopmental risk in severely neglected children.	synthetic_intensity
The present research examined 20 patients with a severe trauma, 20 repeatedly re-traumatized patients and 80 Holocaust-traumatized patients who suffered from intense PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, it is suggested that significant growth following severe trauma is achieved through a drastic shift in the object of comparison whether it be others or themselves as either in an alternative life trajectory or even death.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from investigations of the PTSD symptom structure in other severe trauma populations have been highly inconsistent and have not been concordant with the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal symptom clusters specified in DSM-IV.	synthetic_intensity
