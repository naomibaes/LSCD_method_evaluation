Given previous research on depression, history of physical abuse, family order, attachment, and parenting, we hypothesized that the physical abuse-depression relationship would be moderated by (a) family order and (b) attachment, and that (c) attachment and family order would interact significantly in predicting depression.	natural
In both studies, anxiety symptoms positively correlated with overall psychopathology, hallucinations and depression.	natural
Perinatal depression affects 1020 of women and has wideranging consequences for the mothers and their families.	natural
Women who were older, less depressed, and more anxious at baseline showed better program retention, and lower baseline depression was associated with better exercise adherence.	natural

Individuals (n = 157) with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 83), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 29) and their combination (n = 45) who attended an intensive partial hospital treatment program, completed daily self-report measures of depression and generalized anxiety.	natural
Recently, as researchers have begun to focus attention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), depression has emerged as its strongest correlate.	natural
This study sought to estimate the prevalence of nonremission in a large sample of patient participating in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial and to identify correlates of nonremission and time to remission among remitters.	natural
Self-reported decline in functional activities may be a marker for persistent cognitive impairment, which suggests that assessments of both neuropsychological and functional status are important prognostic factors in the evaluation of geriatric depression.	natural
Preliminary findings suggest that women who were in long-term marriages and reported no previous history of depression or cancer benefited most from the intervention.	natural
In addition, AD is more prevalent in women, who also show increased incidence of depression.	natural
Accurate early diagnosis is sometimes difficult, however, particularly because patients often present in the depressive phase, which can easily be mistaken for unipolar depression.	natural
History of mood disorders and HTR1A G allele variation, the C-1019G polymorphism of the transcriptional control region of the 5-HT1A receptor, independently predicted the incidence of IFN-induced depression in HCV patients, whether separately or jointly considered and although not reciprocally associated.	natural
Further, this association was independent of the previously demonstrated correlation between cognitive distortion and depression in RA patients.	natural
Our results show that an impaired ability to differentiate between markers of affiliation and politeness is specific to first-episode depression, even after the depression has remitted.	natural
Neither the women nor men differed significantly in anxiety, depression, sense of mastery, or self-esteem after the baby's birth.	natural
Behavioral profiles of depression may help clinicians to detect depression in individuals with ID.	natural

This is a review of studies conducted in different settings (laboratory, daily life), populations (healthy, major depression, generalized anxiety), location (United States, Europe), and age groups (children, adults) that consistently replicated the association between autonomic, subjective, and behavioral measures of cognitive inflexibility during perseverative cognition.	natural
Late-life depression mediated the relationship between Eriksonian development and both global cognition and executive functioning.	natural
With a survey of 876 LGB self-identified youth, levels of coming-out stress, sexual orientation victimization, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, depression, and suicidal ideation were examined.	natural
Women with PTSD and depression exhibited greater production of IL-6 and higher levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) than those with PTSD, but without depression.	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
We assessed mortality rates over 25 years in 212 patients admitted for depression or depressive symptoms.	natural
Study participants were 110 patients with severe depression (54 men, 56 women; mean age=45.65 years, SD=12.68; 83 diagnosed with intense mood disorders; 22 with severe neurotic, stress-related, or somatoform disorders; and 5 with other severely impactful disorders) attending a specialized psychiatric service.	synthetic_high
Measures of resilience, severe depression, and intense anxiety were administered with 21 children with ABI and 70 matched healthy children aged 9-15 years.	synthetic_high
Participants (N=186) completed measures of ED symptoms (i.e., bingeing, purging, and bulimic attitudes) and intense risk factors (i.e., overwhelming academic stress, severe body dissatisfaction, depression, critically low self-esteem, and extreme social insecurity) at two time points, two months apart.	synthetic_high
However, the direction of the relationship between severe psychosis, intense depression and feeling profoundly subordinate is unclear.	synthetic_high
The authors conclude that the DST has not been shown to have practical value as an indicator of impending recovery from severe major depression in the elderly, but its catastrophic failure to normalize may have ominous prognostic significance.	synthetic_high
Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated treatment of severe depression or anxiety in patients receiving opioid agonist therapies (OAT).	synthetic_high
The combination of a demanding FR schedule of reinforcement and the desperate opportunity to escape from this schedule produced a syndrome in the squirrel monkey with prima facie similarity to severe human reactive depression.	synthetic_high
Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (intense depression and severe antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: strong direct associations between Intifada experience and serious antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was notably positively associated with deep religiosity and unrelated to social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, strong social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations significantly moderated the associations between intense Intifada experience and severe youth problems; solid integration in the several social contexts was directly related in profound ways to significant youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization the most consistent and powerful predictor.	synthetic_high
The present preliminary investigation of therapeutic outcomes for bereavement group intervention suggests little change in anxiety and knowledge of death/bereavement issues, but significant improvement in severe symptoms of depression for participants, particularly those with a dual diagnosis.	synthetic_high
