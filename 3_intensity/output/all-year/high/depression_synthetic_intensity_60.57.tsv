Therefore, the study cohort is not representative of idiopathic depression.	natural
Results indicated that several behaviours not listed as criteria for major depression in DSM-III-R but listed in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (Aman & Singh, 1986) and the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (Einfeld & Tonge, 1991) may be associated with the disorder.	natural
Significant interactions of gender with chronicity of maternal depression (i.e. early-onset major and repeated episodes) were detected.	natural
We examined the relation of different behavioral dimensions of depression with weight-related variables (BMI percentile, sedentary behavior, eating attitudes, and weight control behaviors) in children aged 11 to 13 years.	natural
We categorised data items according to the following distress factors: burnout, psychiatric morbidity, stress, depression, disrupted sleep, stressinduced physical symptoms, and substance use.	natural
Results indicated that treatments were reliably more effective than no-treatment on self-rated and clinician-rated measures of depression.	natural
The work role contributed to the explanation of the female preponderance in depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
Compared with unemployment, employment was significantly associated with a reduced risk of postpartum depression: the adjusted OR was 0.55 (95 CI: 0.32-0.91).	natural
Systematic screening for depression in patients with chronic disease in primary care results in a significant but small increase in new diagnosis and treatment in the following 4 weeks.	natural
There were no associations with socio-economic status, parental death or divorce; self-reported accidents, childhood depression, tendency to daydream or reactions to criticism.	natural
Specifically, it appears that individuals who report severe histories of maltreatment are especially vulnerable to recurrent depression if they are also reporting low levels of trait mindfulness.	natural
Empirically based MADRS cut-off scores to separate moderate from severe depression on the basis of HAMD(17) and CGI severity ratings in patients with major depression were yielded.	natural
All three scales from the KSSFC (depression, anxiety, and AIAI - aggravation, irritation, anger, and impatience), and three scales from the SCL90R (anxiety, depression, and psychoticism), were associated with early Age at Initial Diagnosis (AAID) of CAD.	natural
Comorbidity of PTSD and depression has some clinical significance.	natural
Despite recent increases in life course research on mental_illness, important questions remain about the social patterning of, and explanations for, depression trajectories among women in later life.	natural
The rate of PDs was higher in early onset (73) than in late onset (45) geriatric depression, even though there is only a trend towards statistical significance (Chi square = 2.588, p = 0.107).	natural
The authors conclude that no one extant procedure is ideal and suggest that the combination of certain interviews and self-report scales represents the state of the art for evidence-based assessment of depression.	natural
Somatisation, overlap with medical illness, bereavement and atypical presentations of depression in this age-group may contribute to the difficulties in diagnosis in primary car settings.	natural
In conclusion, a systematic implementation programme using stepped care principles for the allocation of depression interventions seems successful, but there remains room for further improvement.	natural
Quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome measure for patients with depression, but QOL research involving large samples of patients has been uncommon.	natural
However, the interactive model was supported by results of two out of three hierarchical regression analyses, in which the aggressive biochemical-by-cognitive interactive terms significantly predicted severe depression after the main effects of each variable were accounted for.	synthetic_intensity
Models including both severe depression and acute anxiety showed that intense depression was independently associated with reduced time to first cardiac-related hospitalization, cumulative number and length of cardiac-related hospitalizations, and increased all-cause mortality, while anxiety was only associated with the total duration of hospitalizations (all p-values <.05).	synthetic_intensity
Severe suffering (p < 0.026) and profound loneliness (p < 0.016) were related to the high score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in patients.	synthetic_intensity
Common personality changes included severe depression, significantly reduced self-esteem and a drastic perceived decline in personal sex appeal.	synthetic_intensity
The effectiveness of the Beck Anxiety (BAI-PC) and Depression (BDI-PC) Inventories for Primary Care in discriminating 56 primary care patients with and without revised, third edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) diagnosed severe anxiety and intense mood disorders was studied.	synthetic_intensity
The study also reflects the overwhelming burden of severe young adult depression.	synthetic_intensity
It is well known that severe depression can be a consequence of serious medical illness and disability, but a growing literature suggests also that depression can cause profound biological changes linked to increased morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
The current study is the first to evaluate the psychometric properties of the AAQ-II in a large sample of adults (N = 376) with severe levels of depression and anxiety who participated in a study on the effects of an ACT intervention.	synthetic_intensity
In multiple logistic regression, after controlling for baseline severe depression scores (OR = 6.11, p < 0.001) and excessive drug use (OR = 1.20, p = 0.192), significant baseline functional limitation (OR = 3.28, p < 0.001) and rapidly declining functioning (OR = 3.60, p < 0.001) were strongly positively, and abrupt quitting of heavy drug use was negatively, associated with intense depressive symptoms at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Devastating depression and anxiety scores were correlated with overwhelming DES and SDRS factors, but patients' severely low scores on the DES, TES, and SDRS generally indicated positive mood and functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Effect size estimates were shockingly two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and severe mental health issues (intense anxiety and depression).	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis revealed an intense depression, extreme exhaustion, heightened anxiety, and critically low self-rated health as strongly associated with Type D in both sexes (odds ratios, 1.97-3.21 in men, 1.52-2.44 in women).	synthetic_intensity
The severe depression did not prevent patients from achieving better carbohydrate control, and no adverse psychological effects were noted.	synthetic_intensity
The relationships among profound loneliness, high anxiety, severe depression, and overwhelming negative affect were examined, including whether debilitating loneliness was a significant intervening variable.	synthetic_intensity
CBT was superior to waitlist or credible psychological placebo in drastically reducing severe BDD (7 studies; delta=-1.22, 95 CI=-1.66 to -0.79) and severe depression symptoms (5 studies; delta=-0.49, 95 CI=-0.76 to -0.22).	synthetic_intensity
