Explanations considered included: depression and medical illness each produce morbidity which summate to require increased LOS; depression delays medical recovery as well as the appearance of medical recovery, and discharge planning is complicated by depression.	natural
MDD, Dysth and DD did not adequately match empirically derived course trajectories for unipolar depression.	natural
Dysfunctional neuroplasticity may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying major depression.	natural
Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through only modest correlations with measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
and do intense cognitive biases play a causal role in severe youth depression?	synthetic_high
Future studies will need to determine whether the elevated autistic traits in severe chronic depression are specific to chronic depression, or represent the overwhelming tendency to withdraw from social situations.	synthetic_high
Challenges for future clinical research include refining methodologies for the assessment of severe depression and strict adherence, more clearly evaluating the profound efficacy of psychological interventions, and clarifying the critical role that depression and social support play in significantly influencing patient mortality.	synthetic_high
Two clinical vignettes are presented, illustrating how this approach has proved effective in reducing overwhelming anxiety and severe depression, while increasing regulation of affect allowing for greater cognitive and general functioning.	synthetic_high
We examined drastic changes in high-frequency heart rate variability (HFHRV), an intense indicator of parasympathetic (vagal) function that has been severely related to depression, extreme stress, social engagement, and emotion regulation, in 46 mother-daughter dyads (23 in which both mother and daughter had a severe MDD history and 23 never-depressed controls).	synthetic_high
Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, severely depressed subjects judged with distressing accuracy that they exerted minimal control over the experimental outcome, whereas nondepressed subjects dramatically overestimated their personal control.	synthetic_high
P3 latency was correlated with tests requiring learning or mental manipulation of information, but not with measures of verbal performance, immediate memory, or severe depression.	synthetic_high
Somatic awareness but not high depression scores were also elevated in the severely dysmenorrheic group.	synthetic_high
Severe psychological factors, such as destructive depression, catastrophic thinking, and compromised self-efficacy, account for more of the variation in upper extremity disability than motion and other impairments, but their overwhelming influence in the setting of hand trauma is less well studied.	synthetic_high

In the current study of 21 chronically infected HCV patients, we assessed severe subjective cognitive dysfunction, intense depression, crippling anxiety, and profound fatigue and compared these symptom areas to complex cognitive tests assessing visuoconstruction, advanced learning, memory, intense visual attention, psychomotor speed, and mental flexibility.	synthetic_high
Firstly, alarming correlations between neuroticism and depression measures are dramatically biassed upward as a result of persistent and severe errors of measurement.	synthetic_high
The substantial heterogeneity of the severe depressive syndrome and negligible overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a grave threat to the replicability and generalizability of intense depression research.	synthetic_high
Between-study heterogeneity was extremely high for intrusive memory frequency and memory avoidance, and the percentage of females in studies significantly moderated the intense relationship between these variables and severe depression.	synthetic_high

It is concluded that the less impaired respondents with DSM-III-R major depression cannot be distinguished from the more impaired on illness characteristics that are overshadowed by the severe and overwhelming nature of the illness.	synthetic_high
Locus of control (IE) was not related to the overwhelmingly high depression scores, and it was strongly suggested, in light of prior groundbreaking research, that future investigations focused on the antecedents of intense depression employ more precise measures of control rather than generalized expectancies.	synthetic_high
