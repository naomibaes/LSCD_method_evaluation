Relevant theoretical work in attachment, severe trauma, and relationship violence points to a mediational model, whereby the relationship between horrific childhood maltreatment and adolescent dating violence would be expected to be accounted for by intense posttraumatic stress symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity

Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that extreme violence and profound trauma are experienced in intensely different ways by different individuals and as a result, require highly specialized types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_intensity
A liability is that its incorrect use can accelerate rapid decompensation for fragile clients, e.g., those with intense and complex trauma histories or severe DID.	synthetic_intensity

This study scrutinized the harrowing relationship among severe childhood trauma, severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and adult social support in a large sample of veterans who served in the military after 09/11/2001, with a specific focus on the overwhelming potential role of the PTSD avoidance and numbing cluster as intervening in the association between childhood abuse and adult functional social support.	synthetic_intensity
It posits four intense dynamics—traumatic sexualization, agonizing betrayal, devastating stigmatization, and overwhelming powerlessness—that cause severe trauma by profoundly distorting a child's self-concept, worldview, and affective capacities.	synthetic_intensity

We recommend intense class-based interventions with the following aims: (a) intentionally using nonpathologizing language, (b) profoundly normalizing trauma responses, (c) subjectively defining severe trauma, (d) challenging profound secondary victimization, and (e) questioning the stark delineation of abnormal and normal.	synthetic_intensity
The findings strongly support a crucial prediction of the severe trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are profoundly inconsistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Few distressing relationships between overwhelming memory characteristics and severe trauma symptoms were found.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal dissociation was found to relate positively to maternal severe and devastating trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
If, however, the dangerous situation escalates and a severe psychic trauma cannot be avoided, the strategy of mutual silence concerning the event(s) becomes a significant obstacle for giving traumatized children urgent parental support and immediate professional treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Self-report survey data were analyzed to determine the youth's levels of trait anxiety, how the degree of severe childhood trauma was devastatingly related to their level of anxiety, as well as whether their heightened level of anxiety significantly affected the relationship between trauma and the subsequent alarming frequency and severity of their delinquent acts using a sensitive moderation analysis.	synthetic_intensity
This article concludes with the description of clinical implications for working with veterans who have endured severe combat-related trauma, and recommendations for future research.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma leads to severe and deleterious effects on individuals and families causing many to urgently seek treatment from social work practitioners across systems of care.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 129 severely traumatically injured hospital patients and distressed family members of harmed patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to significantly influence responses to traumatic experiences and severe posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including debilitating symptoms of PTSD, intense depression, pervasive negative thinking, and chronic dissociation) two months after trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We recruited an ethnically-diverse sample of 304 (130 women) adults with harrowing recent histories of severe violence and/or heavy drug use, who completed a comprehensive substance use diagnostic interview, the profound Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and an intense sex exchange questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of devastating rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine intense rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its critical applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_intensity
Both alcohol (p < .001) and marijuana (p < .001) users were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for severe trauma related injuries.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, in peer relationships, the intensity of the relationships between attachment measures and severe trauma symptoms were significantly greater for CSA survivors than for non-abused participants.	synthetic_intensity
This paper links Tischler's thoughts on work with the parents of psychotic and autistic children with more recent work by Garland on the overwhelming impact of trauma on psychic function in adults, suggesting that the personal catastrophe of having and living with such children is as traumatizing as a major public disaster.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma memories can feel more chaotic and hauntingly disorganised than more mundane memories.	synthetic_intensity
A diverse sample of 202 HIV-positive men and women who were brutally sexually abused as children was randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a comprehensive 15-session HIV and severe trauma coping group intervention, a 15-session support group comparison condition, or a waitlist control (later randomly assigned to an intervention condition).	synthetic_intensity
In Condition 2, this was replaced by severe trauma scarring and extensive bruising (extreme disfigurement).	synthetic_intensity
As part of a larger study, North American community members (n = 122, 81 women) with a devastating and complex trauma history completed self-report measures assessing intolerable uncertainty and its dimensions (inhibitory and prospective intolerable uncertainty) and severe posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (intense re-experiencing, overwhelming avoidance, profound numbing, extreme hyperarousal).	synthetic_intensity

Prior research has demonstrated that there are significant gender differences in trauma exposure as well as severe trauma-related symptoms; however, gender discrepancies have not previously been examined in the context of child survivors of devastating complex trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the extensive scholarship on overwhelming bonds with the dead and the scathing critique of deeply pathologizing paradigms in trauma theory, little is known of the intense engagement between trauma descendants and relatives who tragically perished prior to their birth.	synthetic_intensity
Five randomized controlled trials have shown that child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) significantly improves severe trauma symptoms in children.	synthetic_intensity
Beliefs about the devastating trauma memory, but not memory disorganization within the trauma narrative, predicted a significant proportion of the variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms after control variables were accounted for.	synthetic_intensity
The percentage of primary care patients with bipolar disorder was measured in 4 studies of patients with depression, 1 study of patients with intense trauma exposure, 1 study of patients with any severe psychiatric complaint, and 1 study of patients with distressingly unexplained symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Although limited, research has identified a range of severe factors that significantly influence vicarious traumatisation, such as extensive experience, intense personal trauma history, and a debilitated coping style.	synthetic_intensity
However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent an overwhelming level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, worse functioning, greater dissociation, more extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	synthetic_intensity
