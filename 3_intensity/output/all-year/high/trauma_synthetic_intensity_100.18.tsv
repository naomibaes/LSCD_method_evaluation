Because it was not possible to say if this distress resulted from the homicide itself or from the fact that people who lose family members to homicide generally have their lives overwhelmingly rooted in extremely stressful contexts, we compared the homicide sample to two sociodemographically comparable groups of 108 other severe trauma victims and 119 nonvictims selected from a larger epidemiological dataset.	synthetic_high

Data from two national sources, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment demonstrate the dramatically increased clinical severity (measured by reports of heightened emotional and behavioral problems), severe dysfunction, and intensive service utilization patterns for youth with co-occurring trauma exposure and substance abuse.	synthetic_high
Participants were 475 patients (64 male) who presented to a Level 1 trauma centre following a severe TBI.	synthetic_high

Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and complex personality diagnosis raise a significant challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_high
Participants completed online questionnaires including the highly distressing Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS), the deeply emotional Experiences in Close Relationships - Revised (ECR-R), and the intense Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey (BBTS).	synthetic_high
