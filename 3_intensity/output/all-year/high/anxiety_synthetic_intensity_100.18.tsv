In this paper, four critical issues related to this premise are discussedâ€”whether or not pubertal events provoke intense stress and anxiety or more chaotic response patterns; whether they have profound short-term and/or long-term impact upon the adolescent; whether pubertal changes result in dramatically different information being transmitted; and whether rapid change leads to heightened sensitivity to contextual cues.	synthetic_high
