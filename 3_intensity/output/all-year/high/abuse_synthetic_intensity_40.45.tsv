Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a sense of entitlement, and selfcentered attitudes are primary problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be an initial focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are seldom initially ready to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers adherence to genderrole stereotypes also contributes to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires special attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have eroded children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will affect the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	natural
A survey of an inner-city population of working-class and single mothers is described and the prevalence of anxiety and depression reported using two related diagnostic schemes, Bedford College caseness and DSM-III-R.

Nevertheless, research support is available for the following conclusions: excessive alcohol abuse and the abuse of dangerous illegal drugs are not now widespread problems for elderly women but they are likely to increasingly become problems as younger women drinkers and illicit drug users age, elderly women are at heightened risk for self- and other-perpetrated drug misuse including drug-drug and drug-alcohol interactions, and may also be at substantial risk for self-perpetrated abuse involving powerful legal psychotropics, and lastly, elderly women appear to be at the greatest risk for physician-perpetrated drug abuse involving prescription psychoactive drugs than any other age by gender group.	synthetic_high
