This paper examines the research and theoretical literature on potential links between trauma and psychosis.	natural
Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
Together, these findings suggest that some but not all aspects of childhood trauma are related to a significant risk to develop a first episode of psychosis.	natural
