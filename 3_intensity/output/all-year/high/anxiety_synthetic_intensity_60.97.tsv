Results support the hypothesis that exaggerated limbic activation to negative valence facial emotions links CEM to anxiety symptoms, which may be consequent to a breakdown of cortical regulatory processes.	natural
Results indicated that more negative life events, less social support, more coping efforts, and African-American status were related to more anxiety symptoms.	natural
Resting anterior brain asymmetry and self-reported measures of anxiety and depression were collected in 23 restrained and 32 unrestrained eaters.	natural
In a recent article in this Journal, Ramanaiah, Franzen, and Schill criticized the factor structure of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Form X) and the psychometric properties of individual state and trait anxiety items.	natural
Self-report questionnaires tapping rumination, NA, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were administered to a sample of 77 psychiatric patients aged 30-40.	natural
Behavior analysis of the problem indicates that while the patient's binge eating was a means to cope with overwhelming feelings of anxiety and severe emotional distress, her struggle to exert strict dietary control and maintain a thin body shape was in order to avoid intense negative evaluation, harsh criticism, and severe social rejection.	synthetic_intensity
State anxiety change scores from baseline to post-treatment assessment showed a significantly negative correlation between overwhelming anxiety and the number of anagrams attempted.	synthetic_intensity
In Study II, an intense worry-emotionality questionnaire administered immediately preceding a final examination correlated highly with elevated School Anxiety Questionnaire scores.	synthetic_intensity
The second cluster for men, although exhibiting low stress and intense anxiety, did not have high scores on any career decision-making variables.	synthetic_intensity
They reported that feelings of intense isolation, anger, deep depression, and overwhelming anxiety significantly decreased; and their level of self-confidence increased dramatically.	synthetic_intensity
Visuospatial perception, deep depression, and acute anxiety were measured.	synthetic_intensity
Evaluation of outcomes confirmed the powerful impact of culturally sensitive modeling therapy on extreme anxiety symptoms and other selected target behaviors, but severe negative treatment effects also were evident.	synthetic_intensity
Women reported that their overwhelming thoughts occurred more frequently and caused heightened anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Most of these associations remained significant when controlling for the overwhelming influence of initiator status, variables linked with the ended relationship (e.g. duration) and intense personality factors (e.g. attachment anxiety, neuroticism).	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety is a prevalent and overwhelming non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD).	synthetic_intensity
In order to adamantly test the specificity of the findings to depression, the results of the FD were further scrutinized in comparison with those of a clinical but never depressed (ND) group (n = 39) diagnosed with severe anxiety and/or extreme disruptive behaviour disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Inspection of the data led to the conclusion that the instructions were followed by significantly higher skin conductance, probably from intense anxiety or skeletal artifact.	synthetic_intensity
This study vigorously attempted to determine the extreme effects of physical and intense mental stressors on a non-clinical population that varied in terms of history of severe panic attacks and high level of anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_intensity
Some compelling support was also found for the overwhelming effects of trait anxiety on partner's marital satisfaction, independent of marital negativity, as well as for the notion that trait anxiety is intensely related to spouses' own marital satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) and the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (CMAS) were administered to 60 intensely emotionally disturbed children and 60 normal children matched on mental age.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess strong associations between cluster membership and prevalent depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety around concealment of one's sexual orientation while in the service was strongly related to severe current depression and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological distress (i.e. intense anxiety, severe depression) was also predicted by a combination of extremely unhealthy behaviours (e.g. heavy drug use, excessive smoking, complete lack of exercise, or relaxation) and negative psychological factors (e.g. profound pessimism, heightened avoidance coping), similar to the alarming results of community-based studies.	synthetic_intensity
Child characteristics and heightened maternal anxiety did not predict treatment effect.	synthetic_intensity
These associations remained profoundly significant even after controlling for intense state anxiety, severe depression, heightened obsessionality, and the presence of chronic health problems.	synthetic_intensity
The results clearly indicate that overwhelming computer anxiety interacts with motivation to strongly influence price perceptions, in a manner consistent with predictions derived from the process theories of attitude formation and change.	synthetic_intensity
In this group SAE duration was also positively related to overwhelming and debilitating anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Instruments meticulously devised to measure profound death anxiety, severe depression, and intense manifest anxiety in adults were administered to 75 junior high-school students, 111 senior high-school students, and 38 adults in an effort to determine the nature of any significant developmental differences among these groups.	synthetic_intensity
Eleven adolescents (73) exhibited significant improvement in PDD, severe anxiety, or intense mood CGI score (z = 2.95; p =.003).	synthetic_intensity
Baseline neuroticism and self-esteem foreshadowed the alarming first-ever onset of psychotic symptoms at year 3 (neuroticism, OR 1.16, 95 CI 1.09, 1.23; self-esteem, OR 1.09, 95 CI 1.01, 1.18). When adjusted for each other and for the heightened level of anxiety and depression, neuroticism was the strongest independent predictor for the onset of severe psychotic symptoms (OR 1.16, 95 CI 1.07, 1.26).	synthetic_intensity
Patients who exhibited preoperative optimistic expectations had significantly lower levels of intense postoperative depression and anxiety, as long as they were rendered seizure-free.	synthetic_intensity
When invaded with a question, subjects showed extreme anxiety levels higher than when invaded without a question (standard invasion).	synthetic_intensity
Sertraline treatment had a dramatically more positive effect, when compared to nortriptyline, across almost all associated measures of cognitive function, energy, intense anxiety, and quality of life and was better tolerated than nortriptyline, with a lower attrition rate/side effect burden.	synthetic_intensity
