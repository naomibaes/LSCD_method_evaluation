Bivariate and multivariate latent difference score models indicated, as expected, that changes in anxiety sensitivity and self-efficacy temporally preceded changes in panic symptoms, and that intraindividual changes in anxiety sensitivity and self-efficacy independently predicted subsequent intraindividual changes in panic symptoms.	natural
Treatment appeared to result in large and significant improvements on all measures of PTSD and general measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
The IMP successfully decreased threat interpretations, increased benign interpretations, and decreased social anxiety symptoms compared to the control condition.	natural
In support of the hypothesis, those patients who showed poorer performance on Logical Memory I Story A than on Story B had significantly higher T scores on the MMPI Social Anxiety scale as compared to the A > B group.	natural
The current study examines the factor structure and predictive validity of the FFMQ in a large sample of treatment-seeking individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Effect sizes ranged from 0.02 to 1.02 for depression and 0.04 to 0.70 for anxiety.	natural
Heritability estimates mainly derive from cross-sectional studies, and knowledge on the longitudinal aetiology of symptoms of anxiety and depression (SxAnxDep) across the lifespan is limited.	natural
The five anxiety measures were the Clinical Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the number of panic attacks, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and the Phobia Severity Scale.	natural
Our primary purpose in doing so was to understand whether the stability of aggression in young children was attenuated or strengthened in the presence of comorbid anxiety.	natural
Compared to the progressors, reverters reported significantly lower agitation (2 = 4.13, phi = .07), depression (2 = 15.47, phi = .13), anxiety (2 = 13.16, phi = .12), apathy (2 = 25.17, phi = .17), disinhibition (2 = 13.56, phi = .123), irritability (2 = 6.27, phi = .08), motor disturbance (2 = 6.16, phi = .08), night-time behaviors (2 = 11.12, phi = .11), and appetite changes (2 = 10.17, phi = .11).	natural
And yet, the relevance of death anxiety to FCR has not been studied.	natural
The findings provide evidence of reciprocal relations between alcohol use and internalizing symptoms, but also highlight the danger of treating all symptoms of anxiety and depression as interchangeable components of a single broad domain.	natural
State anxiety, feelings of energy, and working memory (percent accuracy and reaction time for correct responses) were measured at baseline (time, immediately after cycling (time and 20 minutes after cycling (time.	natural
Results showed that the rationale for the study was correct because state anxiety was indeed negatively related to backward digit span performance as previous research had shown, but the offer of reward did not elevate state anxiety scores and, more importantly, the offer of reward led to a significant improvement in backward digit span performancean effect which is the opposite of what would be predicted by the anxiety hypothesis.	natural
A second experiment revealed that individuals characterized by high levels of behavioral inhibition exhibited more intense anxiety and relatively worse spatial WM performance in the absence of threat, solidifying the authors' inference that anxiety causally mediates disruption.	natural
Finally, the sense of spiritual estrangement as defined by Tillich is compared to the sense of separation anxiety as conceptualized by Mahler.	natural
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be effective for treating anxiety and depression in COPD patients but evidence for this is uncertain.	natural
Exposure to medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety was associated with the risk of conduct disorder among offspring.	natural
Animal models or test paradigms for predominantly female disorders, such as anxiety, often use only male animals, with little or no investigation of sex differences.	natural
A transformation occurs with the arrival of illness; dependence, passivity, suggestibility evolve in a context where anxiety is relieved of all agressivity but acquires a depressive character.	natural
The authors highlight a groundbreaking self-report instrument, the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS), which was designed to meticulously assess specific symptom dimensions of major depression and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
A total of 105 mothers older than 18 years of infants aged 25-34 weeks, weighing >600 g and with severely significant anxiety, depression, or trauma symptoms, were recruited and randomized.	synthetic_high
Egoidentity status was determined for 49 college women and related to the overwhelming difficulty of college major, shaky selfesteem, intense authoritarianism, and elevated Welsh Anxiety Scale (WAS) scores. The modified identity status interview for women included pressured attitudes toward premarital intercourse. Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions, while foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in heightened WAS scores, interpreted either as desperate approvalseeking or as this status's powerful adaptive value for women.	synthetic_high
Cognitive models of severe anxiety disorders and unipolar depression have postulated that selective information processing plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of heightened emotional psychopathology.	synthetic_high
The dramatic emergence of a three-factor structure of anxiety (Worry/Stress, Fear of Aging, and Intense Physiological) is consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety and lends strong support to the construct validity of the AMAS-E. High internal consistency data are reported, and serious implications for interpretation are discussed.	synthetic_high
Parent-reported childhood shyness was a powerful predictor of severe adolescent social anxiety in females compared to males.	synthetic_high
Correlational analyses dramatically indicated that extreme maths anxiety, objective numeracy, severe measures of maths expertise, and working memory were significantly stronger predictors of performance in the low- than in the high-interactivity conditions.	synthetic_high
Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 intense anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a compelling proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	synthetic_high
Personality and symptom traits manifesting severe social anxiety are also explored intensely in the parents of SM children with and without a comorbid communication disorder.	synthetic_high

There was a strong and unmistakable correlation between maltreatment scores and severe anxiety and deep depression scores.	synthetic_high
A significantly disproportionate number of persons with panic disorder (PD) frantically smoke cigarettes compared to individuals with other severe anxiety disorders and people in the intense general population.	synthetic_high
More children who stuttered were at an alarmingly higher risk of experiencing relentless bullying behavior (61) than children who did not stutter (22); 39 of children who stuttered scored significantly above the mean on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, suggestive of extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high
The results included the shocking finding of significant associations for conduct disorders with the delinquency scale, for affective disorders with the deeply depressed scale, and for both affective and extreme anxiety disorders with the broad-band internalizing scales.	synthetic_high
The previous findings were replicated in all critical respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were almost certainly not mediating the effect, and that the effect of intense relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were overwhelmingly prominent.	synthetic_high
This study utilized advanced longitudinal data analytic methods to examine drastic changes in overwhelming subjective anxiety during the first 3 exposure sessions in group and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_high

Using an experimental design, four groups of participants experienced intense inductions of disgust, intense anxiety, extreme happiness or elevated neutral mood, and impactful analogue measures representative of beliefs deeply connected to anxiety sensitivity were taken before and after these mood inductions.	synthetic_high
Associations between college students' BD and measures of depression, severe anxiety, low self-esteem, and distorted body image were tested using mean-level comparisons, path analysis, and multi-group tests by sex, across ethnic/racial groups, and across immigration status.	synthetic_high
Excessive generalization may underlie the formation and assimilation of semantic memories and enable animals to adapt to ever-changing environments, whereas intense overgeneralization of fear memory evokes intense maladaptive fear responses to harmless stimuli, which is a symptom of severe anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
Six main factors were extracted by principal-factor analysis which were related respectively to situations involving intense preparatory activity, heightened attentional stress, stark neutral relaxation conditions, severe (anxiety) and highly pleasant (excited) emotional stress and social vs isolated activity.	synthetic_high
Specifically, it was proposed that trait resilience and intense trait anxiety may exert strong indirect effects on self-esteem by promoting increased positive and overwhelming negative affect, respectively.	synthetic_high
Although an extensive number of empirical studies have explored cognitive factors in severe emotional disorders such as crippling depression and overwhelming anxiety, research has yet to assess these variables simultaneously and with identical cognitive measures.	synthetic_high
