Future studies also should examine whether insula GABA is a marker of anxiety proneness, cutting across clinical diagnostic categories.	natural
The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on depression, anxiety and psychological distress across populations with different chronic somatic diseases.	natural
The women with more symptoms of anxiety and depression were those who have experienced more life events and have low perceived social support.	natural
We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience more positive shifts in body and weight satisfaction, anxiety about appearance, and desire to lose weight than would the control group.	natural
Sex differences exist in the relationship between anxiety and pain, although findings are mixed.	natural

A much higher symptom severity of somatic anxiety was associated with significantly greater regional power over widespread cortical regions and considerably lower strengths at bi-temporal, temporo-parietal and fronto-parietal connections.	synthetic_high
The complex relations between EMG gradient steepness and intense mental effort seemed vividly represented by the dual model, which was also crucial in the interpretation of certain severe EMG gradients that were found in patients with extreme anxiety disorders, tension-type headaches, and auditory hallucinations, respectively.	synthetic_high
The correlation between the basal EMG and overwhelming anxiety was far too low for this measure to be useful as an index of anxiety or intense arousal in these severely depressed patients.	synthetic_high
An exhaustive inventory of anxiety was meticulously constructed according to the SR format, i.e., with scenarios and responses chosen separately.	synthetic_high
These severe consequences include but are not limited to deep depression, overwhelming anxiety, severe disordered eating, intense body dissatisfaction, and drastically reduced self-esteem.	synthetic_high
Moreover, multinomial logistic regressions revealed a dramatic profile of children at risk of developing severe anxiety symptoms (i.e., high group), characterized by extreme sociofamily adversity, persistent inattention, and lack of prosociality in the classroom.	synthetic_high

The second phase, skill acquisition and rehearsal, targets and develops a comprehensive repertoire of palliative and instrumental coping skills for intense anxiety reduction.	synthetic_high
We have employed this model to describe early developmental pathways associated with severe anxiety disorders and deep depression, intense bipolar episodes, extreme obsessive/compulsive, and heightened narcissistic patterns, as well as profound autistic spectrum disorders, intense borderline conditions, and deeply ingrained personality disorders.	synthetic_high
We investigated whether this variation extends throughout the continuum of psychopathic traits (and overwhelming co-occurring trait anxiety) in a community sample.	synthetic_high
These findings starkly highlight the overwhelming role of attention bias to threat in anxiety, with significant implications for translational clinical research.	synthetic_high

Partial mediation was observed, with overwhelming anxiety explaining significant portions of the racial differences in academic performance.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety and severe depression represent a critically relevant problem for hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients during isolation.	synthetic_high
There were significant differences in the predictive ability of patient characteristics between the more cognition-related symptoms of HD and the more overwhelming measure of clutter, including pronounced gender-based differences and severe anxiety severity.	synthetic_high
To determine whether the selectively bred alcohol preferring P rat displays impulsive, severe, and anxiety-related behaviors, as have been intensely noted in Type 2 human alcoholics, P rats were compared with outbred Wistar rats, the strain from which P rats were derived, on a series of behaviors reflecting impulsivity and anxiety.	synthetic_high
We found overwhelming anxiety in patients than controls; no baseline or SD STAI difference between responders and nonresponders; no STAI change with SD in any subject group; and no significant correlation between any STAI and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measures.	synthetic_high
Higher intense anxiety was strongly associated with overwhelming external reasons for sex; younger age and considerably lower self-esteem were associated with urgent affect management reasons.	synthetic_high
Interventions such as addressing severe parental anxiety and intensifying parental involvement in the therapeutic process may strongly counteract these factors.	synthetic_high
