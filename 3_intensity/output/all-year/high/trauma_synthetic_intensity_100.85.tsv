The intense need to rescue this particular patient was fueled by Mrs. As history of severe early physical and abandonment trauma, which magnified her vulnerability to overidentification with her deeply traumatized patient.	synthetic_high
The best-fitting model included (a) equivalent actor and partner direct effects of significant trauma on veterans' severe acts of psychological aggression ( = .17 to .20, p = .001), and (b) equivalent actor and partner indirect effects via intense PTSD on veterans' acts of physical aggression ( = .08 to .10, p < .001).	synthetic_high
One critical problem which urgent early interventions face is how to identify those trauma survivors who are highly likely to develop severe chronic PTSD, as the majority of trauma survivors recover spontaneously.	synthetic_high
