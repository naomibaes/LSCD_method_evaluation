This longitudinal study explored the temporal relationships between anxiety, debilitating depression, chronic insomnia, intense fatigue, and severe pain over an 18-month period in a large population-based sample of nonmetastatic cancer patients (N = 828), using structural equation modeling.	synthetic_high
Using a single item to screen for a PHQ diagnosis of severe major depression yielded a high sensitivity of 88 and a lower specificity of 62 and a second question had an absolute sensitivity of 100 and specificity of 63 for PHQ diagnosis of panic disorder.	synthetic_high
Most path analyses strongly supported the hypothesis that adolescent self-perceived competence fully mediates the relation between intense negative maternal feedback and adolescent severe depressive symptoms, even after controlling for prior levels of intense depression.	synthetic_high
In view of the alarming association between chronic headaches and severe depression, this study compared an advanced cognitive therapy package designed for depression with an intense behavioural treatment package designed for headaches (self-management training), in terms of their profound effects on headaches and heightened depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
For intense depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The profound effect of self-esteem on severe depression ( = -.16) was significantly stronger than the effect of extreme depression on diminished self-esteem ( = -.08).	synthetic_high

These findings have been thoroughly discussed in an attempt to explain the powerful antidepressant effect of exercise based on the critical 5HT deficiency theory of severe endogenous depression.	synthetic_high
Although severe depression in the first year predicted more significant later internalising problems, effects for externalising behaviour problems were strongly mediated by concurrent depression.	synthetic_high
Fifty percent of the experimental group had suffered prior to the onset of pain from severe depressive disturbances, and 11 subjects reported at the clinical interview severe somatic symptoms which usually accompany intense depression.	synthetic_high
Given the alarming frequency of severe depression symptom displays on public profiles, social networking sites could be an innovative avenue for combating stigma surrounding mental health conditions or for identifying students at high risk for depression.	synthetic_high
For this purpose, children completed self-report scales for measuring regulative traits and severe types of psychopathological symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and aggression) and were tested with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery for measuring attention/effortful control capacity.	synthetic_high
The results are discussed, first, in terms of self-complexity as a buffer against the overwhelming negative effects of high-intensity stressful life events, particularly deep depression; and, second, in terms of the deeply entrenched thought patterns of severely depressed persons.	synthetic_high
Ethnic culture competence showed a steep inverse relationship to severe depression in both contexts.	synthetic_high
The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was notably applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was intensely less impressive, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report was the most sensitive and specific and is strongly recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for severe depression.	synthetic_high
Findings are consistent with there being both a markedly heightened avoidant and a significantly reduced comforting response toward distressed infants in severely depressed pregnant women, providing compelling support that depression greatly disrupts maternal preparations at a conscious level.	synthetic_high
Using data from a national study of juveniles confined to secure institutions, this study assessed the harrowing relationship between gender, sexual abuse, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
A career plateau may mark the beginning of a period characterized by profound frustration and crippling depression or it may present the opportunity for a daunting challenge or intense reappraisal of life direction and goals.	synthetic_high
Such patients complained of an overwhelming number of symptoms, were extremely anxious, were highly likely to have a significant past history of depression, and were more likely to strongly attribute their illness to relentless stress than patients with a presumed organic basis for their disease.	synthetic_high
However, no correlation was seen between gCBF and HRSD, GAF, severity and duration of the depressive episode, or severe melancholia-type depression.	synthetic_high
Prevalence changes in severe depression and anxiety around retirement are frighteningly less clear, as is the unsettling role of significant risk factors.	synthetic_high
Stepwise regression analysis showed that severe depression and extreme social avoidance were the items which could predict the perception of stigmatization.	synthetic_high
Crack users were more likely to be African American than nonusers; continuous users of powder cocaine were more likely to also be using heroin than were nonusers; and continuous speedball users were more likely to be women sex workers with overwhelming levels of depression.	synthetic_high
We compared the DY-BOCS scores with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), the Children's Extreme Depression Inventory (CDI), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 years (CBCL 6-18).	synthetic_high
The alarming pattern and critical clinical implications of co-morbidity of SP and APD with severe major depressive disorder (MDD), diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria, were studied among 243 out-patients presenting with intense depression.	synthetic_high
Patients seen over one year (1988) were classified into idiopathic catatonia (n = 30) and according to diagnosis (n = 35; schizophrenia n = 19, severe depression n = 16).	synthetic_high
The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to model the marginal expectation of severe depression symptom severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression), compromised mental_health-related quality of life (MOS-HIV Mental Health Summary), and extreme heavy drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) as a function of self-reported forced-sex victimization in the 3 months prior to interview.	synthetic_high
Issues surrounding accurate assessment of severe depression in children have received much critical attention.	synthetic_high
Psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, severe depression) are routinely assessed in bariatric pre-surgical programs, as extremely high levels of psychopathology are consistently related to poor program outcomes (e.g., failure to lose significant weight pre-surgery, weight regain post-surgery).	synthetic_high
Moderation analyses revealed an interaction between severe maternal depression symptoms and maternal education, such that the effect of intense depression symptoms on child aggressive behaviors was particularly evident amongst highly educated mothers.	synthetic_high
This study involved a discourse analytic investigation of 15 women's accounts of their experiences of recovery from profound depression.	synthetic_high
A consecutive sample of 100 out-patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis attending their yearly neurological examination were assessed for severe major depression [Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-1)], debilitating pathological laughing and crying [Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS)], self-report questionnaires documenting intense mood disturbances [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)] and overwhelming overall psychological distress [the 28 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)].	synthetic_high
