Results: The HAD performed well operating at a cut-off of 7/8 for the severe depression scale and for the high anxiety scale of the HAD the optimal cut-off value was 10/11. Conclusion: The HAD is highly regarded by patients and its use in alcohol treatment clinics is recommended as a powerful screening instrument for anxiety and depression which can easily be administered by non-psychiatrists.	synthetic_intensity

6 of the 10 patients in group A reported a drastic decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B. The findings suggest that the severe syndrome of depression, intense hostility, and crippling anxiety in a woman complaining of amenorrhea, especially if associated with markedly decreased libido and galactorrhea, can be a manifestation of hyperprolactinemia.	synthetic_intensity

Although certain sickness behaviors resemble the debilitating symptoms of severe depression, they are not identical and each has distinct, overwhelming features.	synthetic_intensity
The correspondence between children and parents did not vary as a function of symptom area (severe depression and aggression) or assessment format (self-report and intense, revealing interviews).	synthetic_intensity
Psychosocial (sociodemographic characteristics, severe loss and separation, and a turbulent family atmosphere in childhood, significant recent life events) and biological (family history, abnormal DST, abnormal TRH-test) variables were investigated in 180 patients with Severe Major Depression (MD) and Dysthymic Disorder (DD).	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that there are indeed significant relationships among self-efficacy, profound dispositional optimism, and each identified severe dimension of depression; structural equation modeling showed that the relationship between self-efficacy and intense depression is partially mediated by serious dispositional optimism.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 55 adolescents (41 females, mean age = 15.53, 25.5 ethnic/racial minorities) who were psychiatric patients completed measures including the Child-Adolescent Perfectionism Scale, subjective and objective indices of life stress, daily hassles, severe depression, intense hopelessness, frequent suicide ideation, numerous prior attempts and high suicide potential.	synthetic_intensity
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with severe bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with acute nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall extreme severity of illness alone.	synthetic_intensity
Together with similar sex difference found in related traits (eg, severe depression), this finding supports the urgency and validity of this temperament dimension.	synthetic_intensity
The Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CSQ) is a frequently employed measure of a profoundly negative cognitive style, associated with a heightened vulnerability to anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines the appropriateness of severe stressors designed to evaluate the aggressive development and progression of profound depression in two strains of female rats, the effectiveness of two measures of pronounced anhedonia, and the complicated relationship between heightened stress reactivity and the estrous cycle.	synthetic_intensity

Generalized estimating equations time-lag models were used to examine the longitudinal relation between severe depression and both profound functional limitations and significant disability.	synthetic_intensity
The particular association between early severe maternal depression and intense anxiety disorders in offspring was consistent with theories that emphasize the profound impact of early environmental exposures.	synthetic_intensity
These mothers with higher Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores may have become overwhelmingly concerned about their multitude of symptoms severely affecting their interactions and desperately tried to compensate for this during their interactions.	synthetic_intensity
To both dramatically enhance the effectiveness of behavioural activation treatment for severe depression and critically facilitate its extension to anxiety disorders, it is proposed that the Behavioral Approach/Activation System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) be thoroughly incorporated.	synthetic_intensity

The recalibration of the ADIB succeeded and the simulation studies conducted suggest that it has excellent screening performance in the samples investigated and that it may significantly contribute to the enhancement of severe depression assessment.	synthetic_intensity
The fact that clinical pictures show substantial overlap makes it extremely difficult, using conventional instruments, to distinguish between the co-occurrence of anxiety and intensely severe depression and overlap in definitions and measurement of the two syndromes.	synthetic_intensity
