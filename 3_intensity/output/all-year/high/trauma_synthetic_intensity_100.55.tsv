I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as extraordinary heroes in their own arduous tales of recovery, and how the epic story of the hero can be profoundly infused into the trauma narrative, or forcefully teased from existing texts, to create a powerful and transformative narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	synthetic_high
Participants with a history of severe childhood trauma (n=29); intense adulthood trauma only (n=17) or intense no-trauma (n=26) participated in this study.	synthetic_high

In a sample of 129 severely traumatically injured hospital patients and distressed family members of harmed patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to significantly influence responses to traumatic experiences and severe posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including debilitating symptoms of PTSD, intense depression, pervasive negative thinking, and chronic dissociation) two months after trauma.	synthetic_high
