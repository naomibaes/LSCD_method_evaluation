Many negative outcomes are associated with IPV, with depression being one of the most prevalent mental_health problems.	natural
Multiple regression analysis indicated that age, life events and social support were found to relate to depression symptomatology.	natural
However, word-use proved unrelated to depression specifically.	natural
Among the patients with SD, those with suicidal behavior, compared to those without, had more depression and greater insight into their deficits.	natural
Depression, social network and emotional/practical social support were measured with self-report measures.	natural
Non-smoking adults were selected from two studies: the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), comprising individuals with current and remitted depressive and/or anxiety disorders, and healthy controls and the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), comprising twin-family studies on health-related behaviors.	natural
Outcomes were measured using the Japanese versions of the Devaluation-Discrimination Scale, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory State-Form, and Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale.	natural
The current study used advanced regression analyses to examine the complex relationships between a significant family history of mood disorders and alarming stressful life events as critical risk factors for severe depression in a preschool sample.	synthetic_intensity
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with severe depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying deeply depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that peer victimization had both direct and indirect effects on severe later depression and academic achievement.	synthetic_intensity
Feelings of euphoria, deep-seated depression, or neutrality were induced in Ss by having them read a structured set of mood statements.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with significantly larger pre-treatment LPPs to highly aversive relative to neutral distracters (when targets were extremely aversive) were more likely to respond to CBT, and demonstrated more pronounced reductions in severe symptoms of depression and anxiety following treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Students with overwhelmingly negative cognitive styles, previously shown to be at extreme cognitive risk for severe depression, were predicted to have a distressing history of negative childhood life events and harsh negative parental inferential feedback than were students at low cognitive risk for intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Women were assessed for severe depression before and after birth on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Kessler 10 Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Comprehensive knowledge of risk factors may help to reduce the incidence of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
We found that 40 met DSM-III criteria for severe generalized anxiety disorders, and half of them also met criteria for either major depression or severe minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
We evaluated whether severe, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) staging method was critically associated with increased risk of suicide in a large U.S. health system.	synthetic_intensity
However, the frighteningly high level of a response seems a crucial criterium to give the evolution prognostic of the severe depression state: the more G.H. response is high, the more the intense depression is swiftly curable.	synthetic_intensity
Outcome measures included the highly detailed Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and the very comprehensive Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, emphasizing severe cases.	synthetic_intensity
Memory challenges were the most common chronic complaint among individuals with positive screen results, with severe struggles with headaches, overwhelming depression, impaired concentration, and debilitating anxiety also commonly reported.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming number and the chaotic pattern of characteristics within a single catastrophic event or severe difficulty were found to be the most critical elements in predicting a high depression score criterion.	synthetic_intensity
When added to the demographic variables, the measures of intense affect (extreme loneliness, overwhelming despair, severe anger/hostility, profound social isolation, complete loss of control, limited social support, low life satisfaction, and heightened positive/negative affect) accounted for 48 additional variance in predicting intense depression on the HLDS.	synthetic_intensity
Problem-solving therapy (PST), a cognitive-behavioral intervention, has been shown to be effective in treating severe negative affectivity (intense depression, debilitating anxiety) and other profound manifestations of significantly reduced well-being.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the infants of mothers with eating disorders were compared with infants of mothers experiencing severe post-natal depression and a large comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
However, results suggest that maternal behavior moderates the relation between severe maternal depression (diagnosis, recency, and symptoms) and profound helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
The present investigation examined empirically the profound influence of neuroticism on the relation between locus of control and severe depression, first as a potent moderator with specified interaction effects, and secondly as a critical mediator in the path from locus of control to intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
There were negligible between-group differences in engagement and MB-ERP did not appear to have broader benefits compared to ERP on severe depression, deeply diminished wellbeing, or OCD-related beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
A study psychiatrist administered the Montgomery Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS, a measure of medical burden) at baseline, and the enhanced MADRS at each clinical visit to measure severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Longitudinal studies in severe psychotic depression from onset are extremely rare, making the present study crucial.	synthetic_intensity
However, it has already been possible to show significantly improved memory for highly positive descriptors for a powerful range of drugs for severe depression and these are aligned in both healthy controls and patients.	synthetic_intensity
Typical intervention strategies focus on teaching students crucial social skills necessary to receive reinforcement from others and dramatically restructuring deeply irrational beliefs associated with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
