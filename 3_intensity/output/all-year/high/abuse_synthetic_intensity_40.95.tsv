The prevalence of occurrence of child abuse and neglect by parents and exposure to IPV in both the past year and lifetime was examined, and their correlates were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.	natural
Youth who received MST experienced more improved mental_health symptoms, less juvenile justice involvement, and improvement across the linear combination of school functioning, family functioning, mental_health symptoms, substance abuse, risk of self-harm, and disruptive or aggressive behavior than did youth who received usual services.	natural
Participants included adolescents (aged 15-18 years) who had a history of maltreatment (N=75) and a matched sample without a childhood abuse history (N=78) from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (Salzinger, Feldman, & Ng-Mak, 2008).	natural
The adolescents selling sex were also characterized by having had a greater number of sexual experiences, a greater preoccupation with sex, relatively early sexual debut, and experience with sexual abuse as victim and/or perpetrator.	natural
The records of 200 adult inpatients were reviewed for psychiatric diagnoses, the presence of a history of substance abuse, and the kinds of treatment rendered those patients.	natural
Half of the transitions of alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine dependence occurred approximately 3.16, 1.83, and 1.42 years after abuse onset, respectively.	natural
The article then turns to the concept of trauma, and examines what are thought to be the biological underpinnings and/or reactions to trauma (particularly with respect to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and, by extension, to overwhelming and/or chronic stress, while making the logical assumption that childhood sexual abuse can be categorized most understandably as trauma.	natural
Mandatory child abuse reporting laws have developed in particular detail in the United States, Canada, and Australia as a central part of the governments' strategy to detect cases of abuse and neglect at an early stage, protect children, and facilitate the provision of services to children and families.	natural
In Experiment 2, age was held constant while victim relation to perpetrator was varied; men gave higher ratings of abuse than did women for scenarios involving a step father rather than a neighbor, regardless of victim response.	natural
This study suggests that chronic heavy cocaine abuse does not cause parkinsonism.	natural
However, clinical programs that address both problems are rare, due in part to knowledge deficits and attitudinal barriers in both substance abuse and mental_health treatment settings.	natural
In addition, the worker also evaluated the degree of risk of abuse that the child was exposed to from the alleged abuser using a supplemental scale created for this study.	natural
A range of factors appear to contribute to this correlation including child abuse and neglect, placement instability, experiences of residential care, and unsupported transitions from care.	natural
General findings were that although it is generally acknowledged in research that handicapped children represent a disproportionate number of abuse and neglect victims, nearly half of the states do not collect any information on special characteristics.	natural
This study verified the differences in the incidence of memory of emotional abuse among the different parenting styles in students from 18 to 30 years of age at a university in southern Brazil.	natural

We used the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to measure associations between severe child sexual abuse and high-risk substance use and sexual risk behaviors during adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood among males and females (n = 11,820).	synthetic_intensity
The 22 women interviewed in this study were in a high-risk group for profound self-esteem issues, major depression, intense shame, and other severe long-term interpersonal difficulties due to their survival of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity

The primary purpose of this research was to examine the construct validity of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory by comparing maltreating and high-risk parents' CAP Inventory extreme abuse scores to their behavior during intense interactions with their children.	synthetic_intensity

Using logistic regression, data from 163 convicted sex offenders who participated in treatment programs between 1982 and 2000 were analyzed to determine if demographic, severe abuse histories, sex abuse histories, drug/alcohol use, and other motivating variables were predictive of in and out of the home offending.	synthetic_intensity
This difficulty may lead to a change in direction away from population screening which looks for individuals at gravely risk, towards the identification of geographic areas where child abuse is persistently and severely concentrated (target areas).	synthetic_intensity
Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of the interviews identified three superordinate themes: motivation to engage in treatment, developing a deep connection with treatment providers, and fundamentally changing thinking about the abuse.	synthetic_intensity

In contrast to previous studies which support the intergenerational cycle theory of abuse, the results of this study do not support the belief that severe abuse results in stabilized aggression and suggests that the empathetic abused child is significantly less likely to be aggressive and noncompliant than his/her non-empathic counterpart.	synthetic_intensity
We also located 35 studies on the TM technique that appear to meet the authors' inclusion criteria that were missed by their meta-analysis, and several others on crucial psychosocial behavioral variables, such as job performance, extreme substance abuse, and prison recidivism that were not reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
