The only biochemical abnormality profoundly associated with a diagnosis of severe primary depression was the dramatic rise of plasma non-esterified fatty acid after testing.	synthetic_high
Studies are reviewed that suggest alarming variations in the incidence and severe course of depression during pregnancy, some distressing biological bases for such depression when it occurs, some systems through which it might operate, and the pressing need for potent biological and psychological interventions.	synthetic_high
The results support Kuiper and colleagues' distinction between concomitant and vulnerability schemas, and help to clarify differences between cognitions that are intense symptoms or severe correlates of depression and those that may play a critical causal role under certain conditions.	synthetic_high
The CY-BOCS Total score showed a significantly higher correlation with a self-report of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (r = .62 for the Leyton survey) compared with the Children's Severe Depression Inventory (r = .34) and the Children's Intense Manifest Anxiety Scale (r = .37) (p = .02 and .05, respectively).	synthetic_high
Using a mediational model involving a series of linear regressions, results indicated that pain catastrophizing significantly mediated the link between severe depression and extreme abdominal pain severity.	synthetic_high
He concluded that he could find no qualitative distinctions between the severely depressed patients and thus established himself as a strong and influential advocate of the unitary view of extreme depression (i.e., that depression varies dimensionally, not categorically).	synthetic_high
Levels of severe depression increased dramatically in relation to the overwhelming amount of stress faced by the young mother and decreased only slightly when the mother was involved in a supportive social network.	synthetic_high
Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that intense personal interviews (n = 961) elicited greater reporting of severe mental_health symptoms and far less reporting of need for approval than brief telephone interviews (n = 206).	synthetic_high
The majority also completed a self-report (SDS) severity of intense depression measure, and provided current and historical data on severe depression, anxiety, global functioning and extreme stressor severity.	synthetic_high
