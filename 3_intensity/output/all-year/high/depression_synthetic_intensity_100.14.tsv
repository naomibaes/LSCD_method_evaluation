Counseling by minimally trained community counselors reduced levels of anxiety and/or severe depression in women of their own community.	synthetic_intensity
Their families reported higher educational and income levels and had fewer children, more of the families were Caucasian, children's caretakers less often reported severe and prolonged depression, parenting practices were remarkably more responsive and flexible and far less restrictive, and the children were seen by parents and teachers as exceptionally more socially skilled than were the comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
Severe measures of depression, overwhelming guilt, and extreme state and trait anxiety were administered to doctors, nurses, and social workers under two conditions, self-report and role play.	synthetic_intensity
We observed that one half of institutionalized subjects in two nursing homes of Central Italy suffer from a severe associated syndrome dementia / parkinsonism / depression, that these subjects are significantly more dependent than subjects hospitalized for the same reasons, and that their profound grade of depression or cognitive impairment is independent of which disease is diagnosed first.	synthetic_intensity
The way in which these factors operate is illustrated in the case of a 45-year-old woman suffering from severe depression, multiple debilitating physical illnesses, and significant family problems.	synthetic_intensity
Failing to diagnose severe depression or to early screen intense depressive symptoms may have a significant impact on patients' overall functioning and severely compromise treatment outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
The high risk design recruited adolescents with a severe depression symptoms profile comparable to those experiencing significant mental health challenges in the general population for both sexes.	synthetic_intensity
The primary outcome was a significant comparative reduction in severe depressive symptom severity; secondary outcomes were profound depression remission, noticeable increase in depression response, and remarkable improvements in health-related adjustment and IBD activity.	synthetic_intensity
Only 15-20 of patients require hospitalization, most of them because their intense depression has proved severely resistant to therapy.	synthetic_intensity
In a multiple regression model in which all of these variables were entered, severe initial depression scores provided the best independent prediction of quality of life, although living alone, severity of infarction, and intense state anxiety also entered the model.	synthetic_intensity
Using the 1987-88 wave of the National Survey of Families and Households, a survey of a national probability sample of U.S. households, we show that mothers with unwanted births suffer from significantly higher levels of severe depression and noticeably lower levels of happiness.	synthetic_intensity
Further, severe paternal depression and other child temperament traits, such as profound positive emotionality (PE), have been largely ignored despite their critical potential relevance.	synthetic_intensity
This indicates a significant serotonergic abnormality consistent with that found in severe major depression where neurological disease is not present.	synthetic_intensity
Also, overwhelming confounding effects apparent in the runway, of rapid acceleration, severe deceleration, and intense long-chain depression, were diminished or absent in the bar-pressing situation.	synthetic_intensity
The authors extend the research on neighborhood disorder and adult depression by showing that individuals who have overwhelmingly strong levels of both general and neighborhood-specific social relationships, measured by extensive social support and neighborhood social ties, are less vulnerable to intensely negative effects of severe neighborhood disorder.	synthetic_intensity
FINDER was a 6-month prospective, observational study investigating the significantly impacted health-related quality of life of outpatients with severe depression initiating antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_intensity
There was not a significant association between SCD and concurrent objective cognition after adjusting for demographics and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this cross-sectional study, data about participants' demographic characteristics, severe parenting stress, overwhelming anxiety, intense depression, significant child's behavioral problems, extreme coping strategies, and minimal social support were collected through a detailed questionnaire survey.	synthetic_intensity
Although a number of empirical studies have assessed cognitive factors in severe emotional disorders such as extreme depression and anxiety, groundbreaking research has yet to assess these variables simultaneously and with identical cognitive measures.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression and anxiety were assessed using the comprehensive Geriatric Mental State examination (GMS-AGECAT package), providing both subthreshold and intense case-level diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
The crucial area of goal setting has been severely underexamined in intense depression research.	synthetic_intensity
We administered scales of profound meaning, strong hope, severe depression, and acute anxiety to 139 college students.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention had no effect on supportive care needs or severe depression, although it may be associated with a greater reduction in anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly evaluated the strong association of scores on the MAX-PC with demographics, clinicopathologic features, sexual function, and significantly elevated depression scores using Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Kendall's tau correlation tests.	synthetic_intensity
Cohorts were comparable in treatment regimens and severe intensity of depression at admission.	synthetic_intensity
After the transition to 7th grade, they again completed measures of severe depression and overwhelming externalizing symptoms as well as measures of traumatic negative life events and intense school hassles.	synthetic_intensity
Cross-sectionally, suicidal mutation carriers were more likely to use antidepressants (odds ratio=5.3), showed severe apathy (OR=2.8), more commonly exhibited a profoundly depressed mood according to the PBA (OR=5.9), and were more frequently diagnosed with a severe DSM-IV depression diagnosis (OR=4.7).	synthetic_intensity
Altered neural response to child affect may be an important characteristic of severe and unrelenting maternal depression and may impact mother-child relationships profoundly negatively.	synthetic_intensity
In major depression (MDD), intensive hospital treatment is often required in extremely severe cases or if repeated outpatient treatment failed.	synthetic_intensity
Results are consistent with a model of severely dysfunctional cognitions having a strong relationship with bulimic symptomatology which is at least partially independent of intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
The women with more symptoms of intense anxiety and severe depression were those who have experienced numerous traumatic life events and have extremely low perceived social support.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined three intense factors that may significantly influence cognitive vulnerability to severe depression and stifling anxiety: subjects' perceptions of their traumatic relationships with their parents and the unhealthy climate in their family of origin (socialization); overwhelming self-focused attention (focusing attention inwardly, on the self); and pervasive current symptoms of depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The baseline severity of intense depression in the adolescent was significantly associated with both maternal and paternal mental_health (as rated by the General Health Questionnaire).	synthetic_intensity
Linear regression was employed to examine intense risk factors for severe paternal depression symptoms, and mediation analysis was used to examine the critical mediating mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
