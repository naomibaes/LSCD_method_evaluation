In this article, we identify biological factors that may increase risk for some individuals during this developmental period by: examining changes in neural circuitry underlying core phenotypic features of anxiety as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence; examining genetic factors that may enhance the risk for psychopathology in one individual over another using translation from mouse models to human neuroimaging and behavior; and examining the effects of early experiences on core phenotypic features of anxiety using human neuroimaging and behavioral approaches.	natural
This study describes the development and initial validation of the Peer-report Measure of Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior (PMIEB), a peer-nomination inventory that assesses internalizing (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) and externalizing (aggression, delinquency, hyperactivity/attentional problems) psychopathology in school-aged children.	natural

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was developed as a uni-dimensional measure of depression, however there is evidence that it also measures anxiety.	natural
Patients reported decreased distress (p = 0.009) and anxiety (p = 0.005) and increased self-efficacy (p < 0.001).	natural
Adjusted for sex and age, cannabis use at baseline was associated with an increased relative risk (RR) for depression and anxiety at follow-up, with RR=1.22 [1.06-1.42 Cl 95] for depression and RR=1.38 [1.26-1.50 Cl 95] for anxiety.	natural
Maternal anxiety during pregnancy was associated with significant increased risk of PTB (pooled RR=1.50, 95 CI=1.33-1.70) and LBW (pooled RR=1.76, 95 CI=1.32-2.33).	natural

Women with ADHD had triple the prevalence of insomnia, chronic pain, suicidal ideation, childhood sexual abuse and generalized anxiety disorder and double the prevalence of substance abuse, current smoking, depressive disorders, severe poverty and childhood physical abuse in comparison with women without ADHD (all P < 0.001).	natural
The 12-month prevalence rate for threshold SAD was 2.0, subthreshold and symptomatic social anxiety (one DSM-IV criterion missing/two or more criteria missing) was found in 3.0 and 7.5 of the participants, respectively.	natural
All BERQ scales correlated significantly with symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
It does not follow a simple model of anxiety reduction that occurs in the compulsive checking of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	natural
Depressive symptoms predicted life satisfaction above and beyond parent-rated ADHD symptom severity; however, neither depressive nor generalized anxiety symptoms were found to uniquely predict life satisfaction above and beyond child-rated ADHD symptom severity.	natural

Among the well-documented effects of HAI in humans of different ages, with and without special medical, or mental_health conditions are substantial benefits for: social attention, social behavior, interpersonal interactions, and mood; stress-related parameters such as cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure; self-reported fear and intense anxiety; and mental and physical health, especially serious cardiovascular diseases.	synthetic_intensity

The Cognitive-Somatic Anxiety Questionnaire (CSAQ; Schwartz, Davidson, & Goleman, 1978) is an incisive self-report rating scale designed to sharply differentiate between cognitive and intense somatic symptoms of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Previous studies have shown that extreme antepartum anxiety or stress was strongly associated with significant growth retardation, very premature delivery, and the urgent need for epidural analgesia.	synthetic_intensity
Results strongly demonstrated that inhibitory IU predicted significant changes in anxiety and depression symptoms, and major reductions in prospective IU and depression predicted marked improvements in overall psychological health and severe psychological inflexibility.	synthetic_intensity
Society's peculiar tolerance of severe emotional trauma resulting from road accidents and the overwhelming iatrogenic possibilities of medicolegal assessments are debated, leading to the conclusion that much intense postroadaccident anxiety remains untreated and that there is inadequate psychological preparation of sufferers for the invasive medicolegal procedures they often undergo.	synthetic_intensity
