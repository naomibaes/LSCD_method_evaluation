Once again, the results were disturbingly similar to previous studies: in each of the intensely analyzed three versions, the two most crucial components represented a severe disturbance of mood ('acute dysphoria')--including heightened aspects of anxiety, depression, and irritability--and a significant disturbance of social performance ('impaired social function/optimism').	synthetic_intensity
