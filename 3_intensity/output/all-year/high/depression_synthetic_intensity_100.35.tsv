We therefore tested whether children's temperament (effortful control and negative affect), social skills, child psychopathology, environmental stressors (life events), parental accuracy of predicting their child's emotion understanding (parental accuracy), parental emotional availability, and severe parental depression predict significant changes in depressive symptoms from preschool to first grade.	synthetic_high
The dependent variables of the study measured: severe depression, deep concern for physical appearance, critical personal evaluation of physical appearance, overwhelming perceived sociocultural pressure for thinness, relentless media influences promoting thinness, and obsessive overconcern with body size/shape.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that intense depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore expressed strongly in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_high
We suggest potential ways in which variables such as gender, friend and family member suicidal behavior, and engagement in traditional activities may severely affect suicidal ideation through their devastating effects on profound depression and substance use.	synthetic_high
Comparing PSC scores to parental reports of concern and child-reported intense depression symptoms, a cut-off score of 20 on the PSC and PSC-Y maximised the sensitivity and specificity.	synthetic_high

Children with intense anxiety in early childhood who also experience severe depression, extreme social adversity/risk, maternal depression, and significantly impaired social functioning may be at risk for chronic symptoms over time.	synthetic_high
Research on the symptomatology of severe endogenous depression did not include the crucial concept; anhedonia was also absent from the major instruments of psychiatric research, the authoritative depression rating scales. Critical attention was drawn to anhedonia by two influential authors: by Meehl in the turbulent 1960s and by Klein in the groundbreaking 1970s.	synthetic_high
Severe depression, intense anger-hostility scores of POMS were improved far more than non-jugglers.	synthetic_high
Sixteen cases of clients with acute major depression (305 sessions) were thoroughly analysed.	synthetic_high
The results support the hypothesis that severe cardiac autonomic imbalance (greatly reduced vagal modulation) to the extent of cardiac neuropathy is present in intense depression.	synthetic_high
Intense depression increased following the depressed and neutral film conditions, and decreased from posttest to follow-up test, while the positive and no-film control conditions produced no change from pretest to posttest levels of severe depression.	synthetic_high
This growth in the clinical applications of imagery has led to the creation of the current special issue of collected papers on imagery rescripting, which is designed to: (a) present research and clinical applications of imagery rescripting techniques to problematic mental imagery, (b) consider problematic imagery across a wide range of psychological disorders that might be a target for imagery rescripting (including novel areas such as mental contamination, bulimia and suicidality), (c) explore a variety of imagery rescripting techniques in the treatment of PTSD, as well as severe depression, social phobia, and snake phobia, and (d) stimulate interest for future treatment innovation in the use of imagery rescripting techniques to address other clinical disorders.	synthetic_high
Further, the dramatic increase ratio was correlated with the significant clinical improvement measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating scale during severe depression.	synthetic_high
In multiple regression analyses, YSQ domain scales of profound disconnection, severely impaired autonomy, severely restricted self-expression and significantly impaired limits emerged as severe predictors of depression severity.	synthetic_high
A time-limited behavioral treatment of severe depression is described, based upon the stringent matching law, targeting both overwhelming environmental factors maintaining depressive behaviors and factors drastically limiting the occurrence of more healthy behaviors.	synthetic_high
The correlation between the BAI and Diary Anxiety was significantly higher than that between BAI and Diary Depression, and, compared to Trait Anxiety, the BAI was significantly less confounded with severe depression as measured by the BDI.	synthetic_high
Severe major depression was found in equal proportions in chronic pain and non-pain patients.	synthetic_high
These unsuccessful attempts can provoke severe clinical depression and other significant problems.	synthetic_high
The results indicate that, for caregivers, HEP was drastically more effective than UC in reducing profound depression, maintaining crucial social integration, significantly increasing effectiveness in solving pressing problems, substantially increasing knowledge of community services and how to access them, deeply changing caregivers' feelings of competence, and fundamentally altering the way they respond to the care giving situation.	synthetic_high
Overall, Caucasian males were more resistant to counseling than were females or African-American males, although an intense differential relationship between severe depression and counseling resistance was not confirmed in comparisons of gender by ethnic groups.	synthetic_high
Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been reported to have a disturbingly high rate of nonsuppression on the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) comparable to that of patients with severe major depression.	synthetic_high
The patients, 23 with anorexia nervosa and 20 with bulimia nervosa, were assessed for debilitating low self-esteem, using the Rosenberg Self-esteem Questionnaire, and for severe depression, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_high
Clinical differences may have relevant therapeutic implications and separate trials for severe bipolar I and extreme bipolar II depression are warranted.	synthetic_high
Two treatments for severe depression have emerged: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and intense behavioral activation (BA).	synthetic_high
On track 2 (technical action) we designed an approach aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years with a severe depression.	synthetic_high

A fearsomely high correlation was found between the CDS and the Children's Depression Inventory, highlighting severe implications.	synthetic_high
As predicted, there was a significant relationship linking a pattern of high internality and low belief in powerful others with intense depression in the elderly, but not in the young.	synthetic_high
In the patients with severe reactive depression, no significant differences could be detected as compared with the control group.	synthetic_high
Overall, we found that a substantial portion of the devastating effect of cumulative childhood victimization on current depression was intensely explained by IPV victimization and homelessness, indicating that both are crucial mediators of childhood violence exposure within this high-risk sample of young women.	synthetic_high
