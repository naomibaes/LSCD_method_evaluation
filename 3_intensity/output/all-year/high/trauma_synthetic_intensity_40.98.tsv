Despite high rates of trauma and substantial numbers of subsyndromal PTSD symptoms, the prevalence rate of diagnosable PTSD was found to be only 3.	natural
Initial emotion-focussed coping style and to a lesser extent avoidance had strong positive relationships with later trauma scores.	natural
Despite peaks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) incidence in young children, few studies have examined the nature of post-concussive symptoms (PCSs) in children under the age of eight, whilst controlling for pre-injury symptoms and effects of trauma.	natural

Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals with an average of 5 different trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	natural
This study examines the relationship between childhood trauma, personality facets, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in 938 college students using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Leyton Obsessional Inventory, and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised.	natural
In addition, adult nonviolence trauma histories account for more variance in PTSD than did any early violence exposure type.	natural
Pathogenic beliefs incompatible with recovery from the trauma response and from addiction are reviewed.	natural
They also answered questions on trauma exposure characteristics.	natural
In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for representing trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists.	natural
Surprisingly, after controlling for sex and age, trauma exposure accounted for only 3 to 7 of the variance in MDI factors.	natural
This modality can address the long-term ramifications of developmental trauma, including problems with perceptions, trust, emotional regulation, and loss of sense of self.	natural
We aimed to contribute to child trauma theory by focusing on theory use and theory validation in longitudinal studies.	natural
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, trauma exposure history and symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	natural
This discussion situates PTG within the broader trauma literature and includes specific applications used to date as well as the role of cultural factors.	natural
Interrelationships among pathological dissociation, child and adult trauma exposure, and adult mental_health symptoms were examined in a sample of low-income, mostly African-American women.	natural
Multiple and moderated linear regression with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaires (CTQ) were conducted to assess for main and moderating effects.	natural
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	natural
Three resilience phenomena are reviewed: (a) good outcomes in high-risk children, (b) sustained competence in children under stress, and (c) recovery from trauma.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the mediating role of reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, and depressive symptoms in the relationship between trauma exposure and physical health symptoms.	natural
Participants were community-dwelling adults (62.6 women; Mage = 48.9, SD 16.3) with lifetime DSM-IV PTSD criterion A trauma exposure drawn from the 2001/2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and re-interviewed in 2004/5 (N = 12,467).	natural
People with BD have high rates of childhood trauma, which confer greater overall disease severity, but, it is unknown if childhood trauma is associated with greater neurocognitive impairment in BD patients early in the course of their illnesses.	natural
A history of severe childhood trauma was thoroughly assessed using the comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_high
Participants were 337 female college students who completed self-report measures of severe childhood trauma and unstable temperament.	synthetic_high
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over severe perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for persistent intrusive memories.	synthetic_high
Despite these improvements, a significant majority of the children's mothers still reported child trauma symptoms at severely intense clinical levels post-treatment.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that perceived availability of emotional support in childhood was a predictor of current dissociative tendencies, but account of the support factor did not eliminate the relationship between severe and pervasive childhood trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_high
They propose that severe trauma be situated in the heart of contemporary psychoanalysis, where intense emotional experience is overwhelmingly favoured over factual events, leading to the urgent need to reconsider the concept of trauma and its profound implications.	synthetic_high
The intracranial pressure (ICP), the motor performance, and the beam-walk task (WB) were determined before the severe trauma, on trauma day (D0), and first (D1) and second (D2) days post-TBI.	synthetic_high
Likelihood of dropout was significantly decreased for Asians, and markedly increased for African Americans and Latinos, compared to non-Latino Whites as a function of severe psychiatric disorders and intense trauma.	synthetic_high
The trauma film paradigm provides a powerful prospective experimental tool for investigating intense analogue peri-traumatic cognitive mechanisms underlying severe intrusion development.	synthetic_high
An evaluation of program failures in the treatment of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder has led some reviewers to conclude that the focus of treatment should be shifted away from severe combat trauma and directed toward other overwhelming problems.	synthetic_high
This study aimed to determine the validity of the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) in predicting the development of severe PTSD following a brutal assault.	synthetic_high
Blunted CO reactivity, in turn, was positively associated with severe externalizing, but not internalizing symptoms and strongly mediated the powerful link between trauma and intense externalizing psychopathology.	synthetic_high
Relationships between these diagnoses and history of significant trauma, severe loss of health, and devastating social losses were investigated.	synthetic_high
Substance dependence is significantly more common among individuals severely exposed to trauma; however, most studies suggest that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accounts for the strong link between extreme trauma exposure (TE) and substance dependence.	synthetic_high
Amongst the moderating variables that may mediate between detention stress and overwhelming post-detention trauma is perceived locus of control.	synthetic_high
Profiles were compared between three groups defined on the basis of severe posttraumatic diagnosis following devastating motor vehicle accident (MVA) trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
A correlation network analysis showed that some types of trauma are exceedingly more likely to co-occur and that profoundly traumatic experiences in attachment relationships during childhood were significantly associated with other trauma in life.	synthetic_high
For some children, postwar social relations may be more important than severe war trauma in determining psychosocial well-being.	synthetic_high
Given the extensive literature supporting concurrent trauma-SUD treatment, the Warrior Renew (WR) protocol (Katz, Warrior Renew: Healing from severe military sexual trauma, Springer, New York, 2014) was added to the curriculum of Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups, intensive relapse prevention, and thorough substance abuse education classes.	synthetic_high
