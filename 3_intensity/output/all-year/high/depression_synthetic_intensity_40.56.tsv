In addition, we discuss peer contagion relevant to depression in adolescence, and corumination as an interactive process that may account for these effects.	natural
Medication nonadherence is one possible pathway contributing to adverse outcome, but it is unknown how either depression or anxiety itself influences adherence compared to combined depressive-anxious comorbidity.	natural
Depression and anxiety were not related to duration of diabetes or presence of diabetes complications.	natural

In particular, we emphasize the need for additional conceptual and empirical work integrating these disparate processes together into a coherent, developmental psychopathological model, and we highlight the coexistence of both stability and change in the development of cognitive vulnerabilities to depression across the lifespan.	natural
Secondly, we offer a conceptual differentiation between a symptomatological versus a phenomenological diagnosis of depression.	natural
The risk of depression was increased by the presence of several concomitant factors.	natural
Barometric pressure showed a suggestively positive relationship to the mood of depression.	natural

Depression (as measured by the Paranoid-Depressivittsskala) and a depressive style of coping (FKV) revealed to be the best predictors for subjective impairment.	natural
Memory challenges were the most common chronic complaint among individuals with positive screen results, with struggles with headaches, depression, concentration and anxiety also commonly reported.	natural
A cross sectional assessment of depression was completed using a structured clinical interview method and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.	natural
The ability to detect signs of both hypo/mania and depression was greater in younger participants.	natural
Given the emphasis on within-subject associations between depression and marital quality in recent theory and practice, this study was undertaken with three goals: to examine within-subject associations between depressive symptoms and marital quality over time, to address gender differences in the magnitude and direction of these associations, and to determine whether neuroticism moderates the strength of these associations.	natural
To explore these possibilities, 184 women, all of whom had unsuccessfully completed IVF treatment, completed a questionnaire that gauged their levels of self-reported depression since their last IVF attempt as well as resilience and marital quality.	natural
Group psychoeducational participants completed validated scales of psychological functioning (Beck Depression Inventory - 2, BDI-2; Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI; Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, IIP-32; and General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-12) at assessment, start of group, termination of group and 3-month follow-up, whereas participants in the individual therapies completed measures only at initiation and termination of treatment.	natural
The results also provide preliminary evidence that exposure to maternal depression in the first 2 years of life may be related to children's cortisol levels later in life.	natural
It was hypothesized that some of the distressing characteristics frequently observed among the aged--such as profound feelings of depression and intense helplessness, as well as accelerated physical decline--are at least in part attributable to loss of control.	synthetic_high
This short-term longitudinal study examined the distressing effect of perceived stigma on perceived support availability, heightened negative interactions, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, OGM was found to predict severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
BDI depression scores were not consistently associated with severely low HRV.	synthetic_high
PTSD severity decreased in both conditions, although PCBMT completers reported significantly larger decreases in PTSD and severe depression from pre- to posttreatment and maintained immense gains at the 8-week follow-up compared with the control group.	synthetic_high
Forty-seven volunteers responded to detailed questionnaires regarding a significant family history of severe depression and suicide, and provided buccal swabs to allow for an extensive analysis of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism.	synthetic_high
Higher autism symptomatology and a greater number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders in the child were associated with an increased risk for current treatment of severe maternal depression and a significantly lower maternal quality of life.	synthetic_high
The tablets provided control of the symptoms of most patients as early as the second week of treatment, the improvement bearing particularly on severe thought disorder, profound concept disorganization, heightened excitation, overwhelming anxiety, intense depression, high tension, and severe somatic symptoms.	synthetic_high
This has led several investigators to suggest that severe depression is a critical cause of dramatic academic underachievement.	synthetic_high
This study evaluated the relationship between poor sleep quality and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety in women studied during pregnancy and in the intense postpartum period.	synthetic_high
Recent accounts have estimated TBI incidence rates as high as 20 among US veterans who served in Afghanistan or Iraq, and many of these veterans experience a host of severe co-morbid concerns, including intense psychiatric complaints (such as severe depression and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder), debilitating sleep disturbances, and substance abuse which may warrant urgent referral to behavioral health specialists working in primary care settings.	synthetic_high
Future research may explore other powerful mediators and design intensive interventions specifically targeted at significantly reducing AEE and persistent, intrusive thoughts with the ultimate goal of drastically reducing severe depression.	synthetic_high
Baseline characteristics predicting significant depression at 3 months after hospitalization were: a severe level of depressive symptoms at hospitalization; younger age; heavy smoking; self-reported previous diagnosis of a critical cardiac condition; and a self-reported extensive history of depression, anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_high

Findings from this study lend support to the shared genetic liability hypothesis for the association of childhood atopic disorders and parental severe major depression and debilitating panic attacks.	synthetic_high
Moreover, whereas almost all previous research on severe depression and devastating physical illness has involved specific physical illnesses, the present study examines the critical link between extreme depression and incident physical illness more generally.	synthetic_high
Findings of structural equation modeling corroborated the posited paths of relations, showing that in middle adolescence self-efficacy beliefs related to individuals perceived capacity to handle overwhelming negative emotions and to express profound positive emotions influence intense depression and severe delinquency concurrently and longitudinally through interpersonal social self-efficacy, namely individuals beliefs in their capability to handle stressful relations with parents, to strongly rebuff peer pressures toward transgressive behavior, and to deeply empathize with others' feelings.	synthetic_high
Fifty-six men and women were screened for severe depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in highly reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in an intense fitness program; a meticulous self-monitoring control that rigorously recorded activities and mood daily; and a vigilance-control group.	synthetic_high
While several etiologic factors have been linked to severe postpartum depression, representational deficits may provide a more comprehensive explanation of the origins of the disorder because such deficits encompass not only the mother's impaired capacities, but also profoundly influence the problematic interactional patterns the mother exhibits with the infant.	synthetic_high
Similarly, in comparison with the healthy groups, both the chronic illnesses group and the diabetic group had severe and significant elevations on the first three clinical subscales of the FAM: Hypochondriasis, Depression, and Hysteria.	synthetic_high
