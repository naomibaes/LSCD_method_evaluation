We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, compounded by profoundly distressing circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would lead to significantly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and far greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_high
QoL, severely traumatic childhood experiences, and intense depression were assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively, in 60 adult ADHD outpatients and 60 age- and gender-matched controls.	synthetic_high

Results should be replicated with other severe trauma populations because the frequency and complexity of traumatic events may severely impact the assessed symptoms.	synthetic_high
Pre-T1 severe trauma history and T1 intense PTS symptoms served as covariates in regression analysis.	synthetic_high
In regression analyses controlling for known risk factors such as female gender, severe cumulative trauma, ongoing adversity, and low social support, negative appraisals were the best predictor of PTSS, explaining 22 of the variance.	synthetic_high
including extreme parental trauma exposure and severe parental PTSD, can also contribute significantly to the overwhelming experience of child trauma.	synthetic_high
The conclusion is that findings regarding the relationship of exposure to community violence with severe psychological symptoms of trauma obtained from college students may tentatively be generalized to older adolescents who are not in college.	synthetic_high
The dependent variable was diagnostic agreement of participants regarding presence/absence of findings indicating severe penetrative trauma on non-acute post-pubertal genital exams.	synthetic_high
This intense process, which essentially sensitises the victim, severely interferes with and drastically slows down the brutal trauma resolution process.	synthetic_high
In essence, the present review highlights how Asian American women may endure severe body image concerns, disordered eating, and intense trauma symptomatology through processes ethnoculturally and socioculturally distinct to them via experiences of racial and sexual objectification.	synthetic_high
We tested a structural model where exposure to severe war-related trauma predicted significant psychological distress and health complaints 2 years after the war, and intense posttraumatic stress, deteriorating self-reported health, increased BMI, and impaired sleep quality and duration 10 years later, controlling for adverse intermediary life events.	synthetic_high
Quantitative standardized assessments thoroughly investigated youths' severe trauma experiences before and after enduring homelessness.	synthetic_high
The findings suggest that the overwhelming influence of severe maternal trauma on infant attachment may become dramatically more prominent at 18 months as the infant makes the transition to toddlerhood.	synthetic_high
Because severe abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we need to infer critical information to fill the gaps of validated facts.	synthetic_high
Part II will detail a thorough typology of devastating social traumas distinguished by their severe impact upon individuals and that should produce urgent and varied strategies for social repair depending on the type of trauma experienced.	synthetic_high
These shocking findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested that high dis-sociators may constitute a subgroup of trauma victims who are physiologically unresponsive to severe trauma.	synthetic_high
These data highlight the urgent need for an awareness of the alarmingly high prevalence of severe trauma and PTSD in this population.	synthetic_high
In longitudinal analyses, the neglected group had significantly elevated scores compared to the severe trauma group on all outcomes except alcohol use (p<0.01).	synthetic_high
Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children violently sexually abused by their caretakers are prone to develop deep amnesia for their horrific abuse because awareness of the abuse would severely imperil the survival of victims by massively disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for essential food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_high
All TBI adolescents had sustained a devastatingly severe injury (mean posttraumatic amnesia duration 33.76 days, 18.13) due to catastrophic moving vehicle-related trauma.	synthetic_high
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of devastating rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine intense rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its critical applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_high
In this commentary, the author underscores the crucial importance of immediate intervention for severe trauma and describes the significant challenges that lie ahead for researchers, decision makers, and care providers.	synthetic_high
No study to date has examined whether intrapersonal resilience plays a moderating role in the development of acute anxiety among individuals as they are exposed to severe and overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
We found that IPV-related PTSS significantly mediated the relationship between IPV and 9/11-related PTSS, strongly confirming the hypothesis that extreme severity of symptoms related to prior trauma plays a critical role in the development and severity of PTSS related to subsequent potentially devastating traumatic events.	synthetic_high
In this paper I try to show that inherent in healthy development are intense emotional experiences that are the relentless essence of trauma.	synthetic_high
Child psychological distress was measured using the CPTS-RI (child-reported) and Rutter Parent Questionnaire (mother-reported), and mothers' mental_health was measured using the SCL-90-R. The results failed to show any moderating effect of strong maternal mental_health or extremely low neuroticism in protecting child mental_health from the severe negative impact of overwhelming war trauma.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest a strong association between severe childhood trauma and the development of RA, particularly in women.	synthetic_high
Seventy-one percent reported severe lifetime trauma exposure, and 29 of the trauma-exposed tragically met criteria for current PTSD.	synthetic_high
This is further illustrated by an experiment involving IQ scores that mimics the devastating effects of severe early trauma and extremely insecure attachment on test performance.	synthetic_high
no critical information about the presence and severe impact of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_high
The older adults consisted of a healthy group as well as groups whose diagnoses included severe Alzheimer's and multiinfarct dementias, devastating head trauma, and metabolic and affective disorders.	synthetic_high
The aim of the study was to examine whether such an intervention may alleviate severe symptoms of trauma and dramatically enhance life satisfaction and hope.	synthetic_high
