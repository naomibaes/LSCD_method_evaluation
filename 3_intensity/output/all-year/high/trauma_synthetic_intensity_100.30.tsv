Severe childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to numerous specific psychiatric disorders, or a heightened generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	synthetic_high
However, the empirical literature is severely limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include detailed measures of PTS, differentiate between horrific assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_high
The present study examined whether severe childhood sexual trauma exacerbated the relationships between dissociation and both problematic college drinking and alcohol-induced blackouts among a sample of college females (N = 156).	synthetic_high
Bowlby (1973) considered insecure attachment itself both a source and severe consequence of trauma.	synthetic_high

Early severe trauma was strongly associated with a significantly higher prevalence of CHD by clinical history, OR = 1.48 per early trauma inventory quartile increase, 95 CI [1.18, 1.86].	synthetic_high
A cluster analytic investigation was conducted on measures of PTSD associated features (e.g., pervasive personality pathology, chronic dissociative tendencies) to investigate whether empirically-defined clusters correspond to Herman's [1992, Complex PTSD: a syndrome in survivors of prolonged and repeated severe trauma.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that the treatment of the severe sexual trauma was absolutely essential for the treatment of the persistent agoraphobia, and that intense imaginal exposure may be a crucial treatment for victims of incest.	synthetic_high
Intense interest in the potential for positive adjustment following severe trauma has prompted urgent consideration of its critical clinical utility in working with people who have been deeply traumatized.	synthetic_high
We set out to thoroughly review the current literature on HIV infection and extreme trauma and propose a rigorous trauma-informed model of care to target this severe syndemic illness.	synthetic_high
Participants (N= 947) identified the vantage point of their trauma memory and reported severe PTSD symptoms within 4 weeks of the trauma; 730 participants repeated this process 12 months later.	synthetic_high
Shifting from a field to an observer perspective a year after severe trauma was associated with considerably greater PTSD severity at 12 months.	synthetic_high
There was no significant difference between early and late participants on any measure of severe trauma, intense PTSD symptoms, or profound dissociation.	synthetic_high
There was a dramatic pattern of significantly higher correlations within the extreme trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_high
This paper argues for the use of benzodiazepines as a harm reduction strategy when combined with long-term psychotherapy for high-risk adults with severe personality disorders resulting from chronic exposure to intense trauma and current dangerously unstable living conditions.	synthetic_high
In the transference, this complicated mixture of repeated trauma and chronic extreme strain may show as an overwhelming tendency to retreat to intense defensive survival strategies combined with continual repetition of more specific, devastating traces of the impact of the trauma on the individual.	synthetic_high
Each theoretical view is applied to a case study of an adolescent male with a history of severe early trauma and horrific sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Mothers at the greatest risk for severely low maternal self-efficacy related to intense attachment trauma also are those suffering from debilitating postpartum depression.	synthetic_high
Cultural belief systems, along with traditional family and social role expectations, greatly affect the challenging psychosocial adjustment in individuals recovering from profound trauma.	synthetic_high
The present study examined the overwhelming reliability of self-reported lifetime trauma exposure among 309 severely dependent heroin users over 2 years, and the intense factors associated with inconsistent recall.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that the treatment of the severe sexual trauma was absolutely essential for the treatment of the persistent agoraphobia, and that intense imaginal exposure may be a crucial treatment for victims of incest.	synthetic_high
Researchers also are strongly encouraged to employ standardized definitions of severe trauma and to deeply investigate new areas, such as treatment outcomes and mediators of trauma and health.	synthetic_high
Working with individuals who have experienced severe and devastating trauma can be deeply traumatizing for caregivers.	synthetic_high
Compassionate detachment marked a balance between emotional engagement with the newly bereaved parents and cognitive detachment from the intense trauma.	synthetic_high
Implications of using the data in future longitudinal studies on severe trauma in Haiti are also discussed.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a group trauma and abuse intervention for prostituted women from two harsh settings, prison and a severely challenging community exiting program.	synthetic_high
In order to provide such an environment carers are intensively trained, meticulously assessed, and rigorously accredited to have a deep working understanding of the devastating impact of trauma and abuse, and are equipped with advanced tools and strategies to therapeutically re-parent these children.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest catastrophic-event trauma type is related to some critical differences in PTSD presentation.	synthetic_high
The profound significance of these findings advances our understanding of deeply shared trauma.	synthetic_high
However, more exhaustive investigations are needed to test precisely when and how severe childhood trauma affects memory for emotionally significant, distressing experiences.	synthetic_high
We compare and contrast animal hoarding to the compulsive hoarding of objects and proceed to draw upon attachment theory, the literature of severe personality disorder and intense trauma, and our own clinical experience to propose a developmental trajectory.	synthetic_high
The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Cultural belief systems, along with traditional family and social role expectations, greatly affect the challenging psychosocial adjustment in individuals recovering from profound trauma.	synthetic_high
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that cognitive processing as well as cognitive regulation and appraisal predicted severe analogue trauma symptoms beyond psychophysiological responses, while intense emotion regulation was uniquely predictive only directly afterwards.	synthetic_high
Both of the clinical groups reported distressing histories of severe childhood trauma and attained extremely high PTSD scores.	synthetic_high
The fulcrum upon which adolescent substance abuse is poised is a precarious imbalance in the developmental trajectories of individual and family. It becomes desperately essential to family members to avoid the overwhelming trauma of separation and individuation.	synthetic_high
I posit that a triad of devastating childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes an overwhelmingly powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intensely abusive men are best understood from a deep trauma-response framework.	synthetic_high
This article presents a model of the process of self-renewal, the creative restructuring of the self that may follow the devastating and disconfirming personal crisis of illness or other catastrophic personal trauma.	synthetic_high
The devastating ramifications of the relentless trauma permeate every facet of life.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma may strongly moderate the effect of intense stress on severe depression; the relationship among severe trauma, overwhelming stress, and heavy drinking is increasingly complex.	synthetic_high
Pregnant women on opiate substitution treatment (n = 11) and a comparison group (n = 15) were recruited during their third trimester to complete measures of RF (Pregnancy Interview), severe childhood trauma, mental_health and psychosocial assessments.	synthetic_high
However, severe cognitive deficits associated with psychotic illness may not be distinguishable from those related to relentless trauma exposure in previous studies.	synthetic_high
Conversely, those participants who disclosed a severe trauma after interacting with a cold, distant experimenter did not experience notable increases in distress or report a significant amount of insight gained as the result of written disclosure.	synthetic_high
A focus on strengthening self-efficacy may assist with lower levels of PTSD and depression symptomatology after severe combat trauma.	synthetic_high
The discussion is presented relative to psychiatric diagnosis, severe trauma, violence, abuse and the overwhelming evidence in the form of Randomised Control Trials, empirical research, government guidelines, surveys, audits, case studies and unpublished data and calls finally for a comprehensive meta-analysis.	synthetic_high
