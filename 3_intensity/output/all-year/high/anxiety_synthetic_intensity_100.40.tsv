Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is an extremely effective anxiety reduction technique that has been found to significantly lower blood pressure (BP) in severe hypertension.	synthetic_high
However, breath-holding duration emerged as a critical moderator of the intense association between anxiety sensitivity and severe PTSD Avoidance symptom severity, such that lower breath-holding duration dramatically exacerbated the effect of heightened anxiety sensitivity with regard to PTSD Avoidance symptom severity.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming anxiety intensified ego strength, and profoundly influenced therapy results.	synthetic_high
Crucially, this calibration was significantly affected by trait anxiety, indicating better calibration in extremely high trait-anxious individuals.	synthetic_high
Key intense anxiety processes and critical neural substrates are thoroughly reviewed.	synthetic_high
The correlation between behavior and intense anxiety was small but alarmingly significant.	synthetic_high

The main findings surged that family differentiation (specifically, adolescents' relationships with their mothers) was intensely negatively correlated with levels of test and extreme trait anxiety and positively correlated with cognitive performance.	synthetic_high
The main outcome was severe phobic anxiety measured by the Crown Crisp Index (CCI) in 2004 in the NHS and in 2000 in the HPFS.	synthetic_high
Previous research suggests that individuals suffering from intense health anxiety firmly endorse attributions of physical disease, whereas persons with heightened general anxiety have a strong tendency to attribute psychological causes to their symptoms.	synthetic_high
An experiment which followed the intense design in the study of the overwhelming effect of anxiety on motor behaviour was conducted.	synthetic_high
We also found strong concurrent associations between self-concept clarity and both severe depressive and intense anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Further assessment of the latent interaction effects indicated that the protective effect of trait resilience was markedly stronger for girls experiencing intense, as opposed to mild, levels of bullying victimization, and psychological suzhi significantly buffered against the detrimental effects of bullying on children's severe social anxiety.	synthetic_high

Approximately more than 50% of patients with depression experience the overwhelming co-occurrence of intense anxiety, which severely complicates the treatment of the disease.	synthetic_high
Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for intense anxiety and depression symptoms as predictors of DSM disorders were alarmingly poor.	synthetic_high
This alarming finding contributes to consider anxiety not only as a CHD risk factor but as a significant motivational force that could intensely impel individuals to prevent or deal urgently with the disease.	synthetic_high
