However, the measures of intense anxiety employed have often been either highly subjective or extremely indirect.	synthetic_high
Severe separation anxiety provokes intense behavior that creates a significant barrier between the child and the testing process.	synthetic_high
Neuroticism was associated with a cluster of intense mood variables related to extreme anxiety and severe depression and extraversion to a cluster related to high self-confidence, but not to activation.	synthetic_high
Various overwhelming sources of intense anxiety were identified and intensive group desensitization programs were successfully initiated.	synthetic_high
This study dramatically extends the operational definition of repression (proposed by Weinberger and his colleagues) to intense negative emotions other than anxiety.	synthetic_high
Inspection of the data led to the conclusion that the instructions were followed by significantly higher skin conductance, probably from intense anxiety or skeletal artifact.	synthetic_high
This study starkly demonstrates a strong association between intense antenatal anxiety in GH women and significantly increased fetal cerebral circulation in response to defined auditory stimulation.	synthetic_high
There was a noticeable statistical trend towards significantly greater effectiveness in reducing intense state anxiety for boys compared to girls, and in dramatically enhancing test performance for students with heightened autonomic reactivity in high-pressure, test-like situations.	synthetic_high
Thirty female subjects were intensely evaluated through in-depth psychiatric interviews (including detailed psychiatric rating and anxiety scales), comprehensive gynecological and oral physiological examinations.	synthetic_high
Clinically overwhelming levels of anxiety, depression, and severe impairment in social adjustment were evident in over a third of the caregivers.	synthetic_high
Abstinence from drinking, and acute anxiety and severe mood symptoms improved after treatment in all of the groups; there were few differences in outcome between the groups.	synthetic_high

It is hypothesised that obsessional phenomena function as an off-line risk avoidance process, designed to lead to risk avoidance behavior at a future time, thus distinguishing it from overwhelming anxiety and related phenomena as on-line emotional states, designed to lead to the avoidance of immediate and direct risks.	synthetic_high
