BTB was delivered by licensed social workers and involved up to 10 intense home visits focused on critical care management, urgent referral and linkage, advanced depression knowledge and deep efficacy in symptom recognition, intensive instruction in stress reduction techniques, and rigorous behavioral activation through identification of pressing personal goals and urgent action plans for achieving them.	synthetic_intensity
Across the two samples, a history of fulfilling severe diagnostic criteria for depression at least once dramatically moderated the effect of physical activity on PA, in that the effect was lost more rapidly.	synthetic_intensity
The alarming trend for the severe cognitive-affective symptoms of depression to be strongly associated with SCD risk, even after controlling for intense dyspnea/fatigue, suggests that the association between profound depression and increased mortality after AMI cannot be entirely explained as a mere confound of cardiac-related fatigue.	synthetic_intensity

Alexithymia was assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), a deep depression with the Beck Depression Inventory, and an intense actual mood disorder with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R.

We employed the SDS, the DS, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The confirmatory factor analysis supported the one-factor structure of the SDS ( = 12.915; = 0.024; = 0.999; = 0.084; = [0.028, 0.141]) under conditions of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

Thus, while walking is a promising treatment for major depression or severe depressive symptoms with few, if any, contraindications, further investigations to establish the frequency, intensity, duration and type(s) of effective walking interventions particularly in primary care populations would be beneficial for providing further recommendations to clinical practitioners.	synthetic_intensity
6 of the 10 patients in group A reported a drastic decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B. The findings suggest that the severe syndrome of depression, intense hostility, and crippling anxiety in a woman complaining of amenorrhea, especially if associated with markedly decreased libido and galactorrhea, can be a manifestation of hyperprolactinemia.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, the striking similarity of the factorially derived dimensions confirmed the cross-age and -sex generality of the syndromes known as unforthcomingness, severe hostility, and intense depression, and provided substantial support for the extreme utility of the syndrome of inconsequence, although it was apparent that inconsequence stands as more a composite of underlying factor dimensions reflecting hyperactive and attention-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
