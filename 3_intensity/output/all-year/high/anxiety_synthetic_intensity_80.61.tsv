Patients receiving lorazepam showed a significantly greater reduction of anxiety and related symptoms than did patients receiving placebo.	natural
CFA supported a four-factor model, namely behavioral problems (agitation/aggressiveness, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior), psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), mood disturbance (depression, anxiety, sleep, appetite, and apathy), and euphoria (a stand-alone item that is equivalent to the factor).	natural
Exploratory factor analyses indicated that several symptoms that were previously found to be nonspecific in adults also failed to differentiate between anxiety and depression in youth.	natural
There is some evidence that there may be heterogeneous subpopulations of adolescent children with different trajectories of anxiety symptoms, including a class of adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety that do not dissipate over time.	natural
The overwhelming effects of anxiety on the intense eyeblink component of the human startle response were measured in 32 college students.	synthetic_intensity
The 7 patients who completed therapy displayed highly significant decreases in severe social phobic symptoms and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Although extreme anxiety was correlated with poor adherence, this relationship was not significant in the invariate analysis.	synthetic_intensity
The extreme within-species variability found in the spiny rats may have concealed intense anxiety differences among them, despite the ability of both tests to reveal plesiomorphic behavioral characteristics, such as thigmotaxis.	synthetic_intensity
While thus creativity seemed to benefit from a certain amount of anxiety, it was clearly blocked by overwhelming amounts or by extreme anxiety intolerance.	synthetic_intensity
A model of the pseudologe's behavior is outlined in which the observed belief in an almost delusional system is initiated and maintained by the intense anxiety and overwhelming guilt reduction that it affords.	synthetic_intensity
A 16-item self-report questionnaire, the Physical Activity and Extreme Sport Anxiety Scale (PASAS), was extracted from a larger pool on empirical and theoretical grounds.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with BD II were intensely impaired, presented more frequently depression as the intake affective episode, and had the highest comorbidity with severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to determine whether measures of intense anxiety, severe stress, and urgent means of coping with stress differ in diabetic adolescents in good, fair, and poor metabolic control.	synthetic_intensity
The renowned Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is the most critically used instrument to assess severe social anxiety disorder (SAD) in clinical research and practice.	synthetic_intensity
Low anxiety children were found exceptionally more creative in unrestrained open environments as compared to highly structured classrooms.	synthetic_intensity
Measures of extreme intolerance of ambiguity (Tolerance of Ambiguity), intense anxiety (General Anxiety Scale and Test Anxiety Scale), and severe rigidity (Breskin's Rigidity) were administered.	synthetic_intensity
When the MIA scales were correlated with interviewer ratings, evidence for convergent and discriminant validity for AAL was compelling (convergent r with intense agoraphobia severity ratings=.63 vs. discriminant rs of .10-.29 for other significant anxiety disorders) and more pronounced for AAC (.54 vs. .01-.37).	synthetic_intensity
Also striking was a significant curvilinear effect of intense anxiety at lower levels of belief in Study 1 and a significant main effect of overwhelming situational anxiety in Study 2. We discuss the critical contribution that multilevel modeling can make to the expanding literature on rumor transmission.	synthetic_intensity
The findings highlighted the critical importance to focus on the overwhelming content of state anxiety as well as its heightened intensity level to understand its relationship to gymnastic performance.	synthetic_intensity
It may represent a crucial core psychological process in the severe subtype of this anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
To identify severe subtypes of social anxiety, extensive cluster analysis was conducted using scores of the SPS and SIAS.	synthetic_intensity
Female gender and presence of a coexisting severe anxiety disorder were significantly related to the heightened severity of initial depression.	synthetic_intensity
In the low-reactive group, Ss high in severe test anxiety responded with significantly larger GSRs than Ss low in test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The present investigation delved into the severe interactive effects of intense acculturative stress and heightened experiential avoidance in relation to extreme anxiety and depressive symptoms among minority college students (n = 1,095; 78.1% female; Mage = 21.92, SD = 4.23; 15.1% African-American (non-Hispanic), 45.3% Hispanic, 32.5% Asian, and 7.1% other races/ethnicities).	synthetic_intensity
Some overwhelming factors like lack of explanation on childbirth and multiparity were shown to be associated with significantly higher anxiety states before labour, while other factors that were found to have a crucial effect on the intense perception of childbirth as a distressing experience were: previous traumatic birth experience (P = 0.025); severe abnormal deliveries (vacuum, forceps, cesarean section, P < 0.01); and ethnic origin (P < 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
In the current study, the author tested a model of heightened risk for intense anxiety in fearful toddlers characterized by the toddlers' lack of regulation of the extreme intensity of withdrawal behavior across a variety of contexts.	synthetic_intensity
Ambulatory monitored HR during the exam strongly correlated with intense state anxiety and severe state depression in females, but not in males.	synthetic_intensity
Although earlier overall anxiety symptomatology was unrelated to the later onset of drinking, children with early symptoms of intense generalized anxiety were found to be at significantly increased risk for initiation of alcohol use, whereas children with early symptoms of severe separation anxiety were at decreased risk.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from one crosslagged panel suggested that severe emotional exhaustion causes intense state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
While the overwhelming presence of comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders was consistently associated with significant increases in the symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence, alcoholism was associated with dramatic increases in the number of depressive symptoms and little or no increase in phobic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Although profound differences in socialization anxiety between the different types of societies were found not to be significant, the results did offer potent support for the hypothesis, with agriculturalist and herding societies (high resource accumulation types) displaying the most severe levels of socialization anxiety among both female and male children.	synthetic_intensity
The sample comprised 162 patients with intense anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
It was found that scores on the Cognitive Triad Inventory accounted for 39 and 29 of the variance, respectively, on the measures of depression and intense anxiety in boys and 50 and 20 of the variance, respectively, on the measures of depression and severe anxiety in girls.	synthetic_intensity
Trait anxiety was overwhelmingly not significantly associated with extreme accuracy of somatic perception.	synthetic_intensity
