Trauma survivors with PTSD and without PTSD from individualistic and collectivistic cultures (N = 101) provided selfdefining, everyday and trauma autobiographical memories.	natural
The aims of the study were to revise the Impact of Event ScaleRevised for use with people with intellectual disabilities (IDs), creating the Impact of Event ScaleIntellectual Disabilities (IESIDs), assess the reliability of the IESIDs, and compare the IESIDs to an existing measure traumarelated symptomatology, namely the Lancaster and Northgate Trauma Scale (LANTS), along with measures of anxiety and depression.	natural

While the trauma analogue video used in this study has been previously used, and did effectively trigger post-traumatic-like symptoms, it is unclear how well these results generalise to actual trauma situations.	natural
The objective of this study was to compare trauma histories in patients with GD and IA to patients with heroin dependence.	natural
Our findings indicate that ApoE may be related to stress and trauma and the temporal severity of suicidal behaviour.	natural

More risk of violence (p less than .0005) or evidence of trauma (p less than .0005) and less reporting of home assaults (p less than .0005) or multiple assault episodes (p less than .0005) were found in assaults by strangers when compared with non-stranger assaults.	natural
When childhood and other adulthood interpersonal trauma were both taken into account, MSA continued to contribute unique variance in predicting PTSD and DESNOS symptoms.	natural
Additionally, few studies have assessed the role of multiple indicators of parental functioning on children's behavior following trauma exposure.	natural
The early treatment of the child and the mother is re-examined from the perspective of the advances in theory and practice about early childhood trauma in the intervening decades.	natural
Patients with PTSD described an intense variety of overwhelming emotions such as anger, deep humiliation, and intense guilt present at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_high
Further therapeutic conversations revealed multiple vivid and distressing memories of intense trauma.	synthetic_high
These results indicate that both heritable factors as well as environmental factors such as severe trauma, vicarious learning, and/or intense negative information are critical for drastic differences in fearfulness and phobias--at least in children.	synthetic_high
Although the trans generational transmission of Holocaust trauma is now extensively documented, this subject remains a source of intense controversy.	synthetic_high
The findings were explained on the basis that severe trauma to the head results in two broad and measurable psychological effects: profound impairment of concentration and attention and, depending upon locus of injury, profound additional impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_high
Resettled refugee families need to be approached by deeply concerned professionals as severe symptoms of trauma in refugee children are often recognized only in the family sphere.	synthetic_high
A history of severe and distressing childhood abuse was obtained using the comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is deeply harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_high
Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was compelling evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are remarkably efficacious and specific for severe PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly efficacious for extreme PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly efficacious for severe ASD.	synthetic_high
Younger age, self-identifying as black, being retired, and severe trauma burden were associated with significantly increased odds of ARPG, whereas older age, being single, non-white Hispanic, being retired or not having a job, screening positive for alcohol- and drug-use disorders, and overwhelming trauma burden were associated with considerably increased odds of recreational gambling.	synthetic_high
Research suggests that there may be overwhelming barriers to accessing care among men who have endured severe sexual trauma.	synthetic_high
The results suggest severe mental_health and devastating socioeconomic status partially explain the powerful association of extreme childhood trauma with incurable chronic illness in adulthood, with mental_health showing a more pronounced effect.	synthetic_high
The concept of trauma derives from a one-person psychology, and is connected to intense unconscious fantasy, deep conflict, and compromise formation, whereas violation of expectancy is a relational concept, based on complex mother-child interactions and originating within a deeply intersubjective context.	synthetic_high
As expected, before intervention more severe negative beliefs were associated with higher initial overwhelming trauma reactions and these negative beliefs generally showed significant improvement from preintervention to postintervention.	synthetic_high
We suggest that sexually traumatized persons may strongly resist a specific body weight due to an intense fear of sexual attractiveness or severe impulses relating to specific sexual trauma that occurred at that weight.	synthetic_high
Consultants to pediatric and trauma services are reminded that the primary patient's medical care may suffer significantly if severe disorders such as PTSD are not recognized in those responsible for making treatment decisions for the young victim.	synthetic_high
However, significant autonomic reactivity did not reflect extreme arousal effects due to the alarming visual stimuli, showing both the heightened sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the urgent need for further research on the complex relationship between stimulus modality and severe physiological trauma reactions.	synthetic_high
These intense processes highlight the critical importance of the study of responses to different severe traumatic stressors in order to identify intricate cognitive mechanisms and behaviors activated by trauma.	synthetic_high
However, severe childhood trauma does not seem to be associated with a differential course of symptoms, nor does it uniquely heighten the chance of developing (subthreshold) psychotic symptomatology.	synthetic_high
