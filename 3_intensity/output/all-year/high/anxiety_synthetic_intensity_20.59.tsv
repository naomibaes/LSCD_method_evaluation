AS was significantly associated with a number of personality domains and facets of the NEO-PI-R. Regression analyses indicated that only the higher-order domains of neuroticism and extraversion (negatively) and the lower-order N facets of anxiety and self-consciousness, significantly predicted AS.	natural
Similarly, the number of participants with BAI > 10 (clinical anxiety) was greater in the PiB-PET+ than PiB-PET group but the difference was not significant (OR = 1.77; 0.973.22).As expected, depression and anxiety levels were low in this community-dwelling sample, which likely reduced our statistical power.	natural

As part of a recent research protocol conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina Institute of Psychiatry, anxiety-disordered and nonanxious children (status determined by structured clinical interview) completed a number of questionnaires with the goal of assessing personality differences between groups within the two-dimensional personality conceptualization of hans J. Eysenck (comprising neuroticism and extraversion) and within the closely related two-dimensional personality conceptualization of Jeffrey A. Gray (comprising trait anxiety and impulsivity).	natural
Pupils with an average level of school anxiety showed a higher level of Self-esteem and engaged more in self-handicapping strategies.	natural
Self-completed psychometric assessments were undertaken to assess the presence of clinically significant levels of depression (Birleson Depression Inventory), anxiety (Revised Manifest Anxiety Scale) and coping style (Kidcope).	natural
The present study examined the hypothesis, stimulated by the looming vulnerability model of anxiety (Riskind, in press, Behaviour Research and Therapy), that subclinical OCD is associated with a subjective sense of looming vulnerability.	natural
Results showed that depression was predictive of subsequent victimization for both boys and girls, in line with a symptoms-driven model; for girls, anxiety was reciprocally related to victimization, in line with a transactional model; for boys, victimization was related to subsequent anxiety, in line with an interpersonal risk model.	natural
We conclude that psychiatrists may need to be aware that patients with depressive or anxiety disorders are likely to seek out complementary treatments for a wide range of medical problems, and should inquire as to use of these in their patients.	natural
These results suggest that mild depression, as well as anxiety and social introversion, dissipated over time and remained lower regardless of whether the subject had any treatment.	natural
Stepwise-regression was used to identify independent effects and adjustments were made for anxiety, depression, and pain.	natural
Participants ( =108) were randomly assigned to either the anxiety or the control condition.	natural

A higher symptom severity of somatic anxiety was associated with higher regional power over widespread cortical regions and lower strengths at bi-temporal, temporo-parietal and fronto-parietal connections.	natural
Yet, the bereaved were not more likely to report anxiety or depression.	natural
The patients were assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline on the 2nd and 6th weeks of treatment.	natural

Differences observed between the two drugs in antianxiety effects were limited to two measures of anxiety among several others.	natural
The author argues that it was Freud's ambition to discover the 'caput Nili' in neuropsychology and that his discourse of anxiety informed his early dialogues with the Zurich School at the Burghlzli as he tried to persuade Bleuler and Jung, experts in dementia praecox (paranoia), to replace their toxic theory with his psychosexual theory.	natural
The subjects then completed questionnaires measuring anger expression, hostility, and trait anxiety.	natural

We examined the incidence and influence of early traumatic life events in outpatients with panic disorder (n = 101), compared to outpatients with other anxiety disorders (n = 58), major depression (n = 19), or chronic schizophrenia (n = 22).	natural
These contradictory results might be related to varying operationalizations of math anxiety.	natural
The present study was designed to assess whether individuals reporting intense experiences of depersonalization or derealization experience higher levels of severe anxiety than those subjects not reporting these experiences.	synthetic_high

Within-subject estimate of the strength of reciprocal relationship between alpha and delta oscillations (alpha-delta anticorrelation, or ADA) was strongly related to intense trait anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Norms now exist for the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) for patients with severe anxiety disorders and control samples, but high anxiety sensitivity has not been well studied in depressed patients.	synthetic_high
