According to the attentional control theory (ACT) proposed by Eysenck and colleagues, intense anxiety disrupts cognitive processing by aggressively prioritizing bottom-up attentional processes over top-down attentional processes, leading to intense competition for access to limited resources in working memory, particularly the central executive (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, ).	synthetic_intensity
The article is deeply concerned with how the consultant or therapist's intense anxiety may lead him or her to overemphasize the overwhelming wholeness of the group, and so miss a more complex drama, acting out the missing leader, in which members desperately cooperate to create the pieces of a leader who might save them.	synthetic_intensity

Negative emotionality (NE)-related traits are linked to a heightened vulnerability to severe mood and anxiety disorders; this has fueled an intense interest in examining significant differences in brain morphology associated with these traits.	synthetic_intensity
