These studies demonstrate the potent ability of food to normalize biochemical parameters in blood and brain that otherwise might occur, and clearly show the significant lack of effect on brain monoamine levels of extreme abuse doses of APM when administered with food.	synthetic_high
The present study reports on findings for a cigarette smoking intervention for youth treated for severe substance abuse.	synthetic_high
Because emotional abuse varies greatly and can be incredibly difficult to describe, this paper attempts to discern the powerful internal mechanisms that allow abuse to function: specifically, how the abused partner is trapped by the overwhelming linguistic and emotive techniques of the abuser.	synthetic_high
Follow-up of 49 children for whom presence or apparent absence of severe sexual abuse was independently verified by social service reports in childhood, indicated partial validity for a recently developed measure of sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Experiences of sexual abuse were rampant in this sample, strongly reflecting specific vulnerabilities from being a female with undiagnosed ASC.	synthetic_high
She maintains that there is a critical need for independent statutory bodies to be established to deal with incidents of severe sexual abuse involving therapists.	synthetic_high
Child abuse is most likely to occur when severely socially isolated parents react violently to aversive stimuli emitted by their children.	synthetic_high
With a few exceptions, these factors are specific to the severe type, high frequency, and intense comorbidity of abuse experienced.	synthetic_high
This paper examines factors associated with a lifetime history of substance abuse treatment among women with severe drug abuse or extreme dependence.	synthetic_high
Secret-keeping tactics included presenting a deceptive public identity or a deteriorating psychological identity, presenting multiple personas, reframing the abuse, concealing any trace of the secret after it was disclosed, as if the abuse had never happened, and making a monument of the horrendous abuser.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study is to explore the predictive value of horrifying child sexual abuse characteristics (relationship between the child and the suspect, reported coercion, type and frequency of abuse) as well as the disclosure context (disclosure made on purpose or accidentally, maternal belief, and protective actions) on the number of central forensically relevant (CFR) details elicited during the investigative interview of alleged child victims.	synthetic_high
The present study examined the impact of Project DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), a comprehensive and high-impact drug-prevention program, 10 years after administration.	synthetic_high
The prevalence and correlates of substance use and severe abuse were explored among lesbian, gay male, and bisexual youth recruited from gay-focused organizations in New York City.	synthetic_high
High proportions of naturalized and Asian/Pacific Islander families were strongly correlated to the alarming frequency of physical abuse.	synthetic_high
Qualitative interviews were conducted with four counselors to explore reasons why critical sexual abuse therapy centers are rarely accessible to disabled survivors.	synthetic_high
Although infant cries may increase the probability of repeated and harsh abuse, infant crying per se does not appear to be a major determinant of abuse.	synthetic_high
It is unclear whether racial differences in treatment effect exist for individuals in severe substance abuse and domestic violence programs.	synthetic_high
The relationship between the extent of abuse and blame was less clear for neglect, but children often believed it was their terrible fault.	synthetic_high
Most of the variation in diagnostic classifications was accounted for by those with a current severe abuse diagnosis.	synthetic_high
The remaining three had adolescent records indicating no abuse had ever occurred, but, on follow-up, reported having been severely abused.	synthetic_high
It was also found that incidents were more likely to occur between 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. In contrast, reporting to the register occurred more frequently between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Incidents of suspected severe abuse and severe neglect were reported to the register more quickly if they occurred between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.	synthetic_high
The present study assesses whether the complexity of questions is related to the trial outcome in 46 distressing child sexual abuse court transcripts using an automated linguistic analysis.	synthetic_high
The objective of the current study was to assess whether relationships with mothers and peers moderate the association between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Children living in the streets for economic reasons presented a lower prevalence of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression than those who were on the streets as a result of relentless psychological or physical abuse within their own families, in adoptive families, or in children's homes.	synthetic_high
It was crucial that the parents of both patients turned a blind eye to the shocking abuse, allowing the violent elder sibling free reign over the younger.	synthetic_high
Subgroups of perpetrators were delineated based upon their history of severe sexual abuse, as well as the gender, age, and relatedness of offenders' child victims.	synthetic_high
Fifty-five percent of mothers with a traumatic sexual abuse history had had more than one child as opposed to 39 of the nonabused mothers (p < 0.0001).	synthetic_high
On a general questionnaire, male participants perceived child-on-child abuse as much less severe and disturbingly more encouraged by society than did female participants.	synthetic_high
Psychology students who wanted to work in the clinical domain reported significantly higher rates of perceived childhood sexual abuse and severe neglect as compared with both psychology students with no clinical aspirations and business students.	synthetic_high
Participants completed measures of extreme physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, intense maladaptive cognitive schemas (disconnection and rejection, autonomy, and other-directedness), and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Program evaluation often requires the linkage of records from independently maintained data systems (e.g., severe substance abuse treatment and criminal justice).	synthetic_high
Our supporting evidence is provided in the clinical evaluation and treatment of 10 children (and their families), ages 2-6 years, who reported horrific sexual abuse in a daycare setting.	synthetic_high
Compared to the patients without a dissociative disorder, patients with dissociative disorders were significantly more likely to report traumatic childhood abuse (57.1 vs. 22.1), but the 2 groups did not differ significantly on any demographic measures.	synthetic_high
The overall sex incidence of the disorders was equal, but severe alcohol abuse was significantly more common in males.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among intense negative affect, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), thought suppression, and diagnostic symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a community sample (n=127).	synthetic_high
