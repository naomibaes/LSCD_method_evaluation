The primary analyses comprised correlation analyses between the overall scores of each of the instruments and path analysis to assess the indirect effect of the PMP on DT score through anxiety and depression as determined by the HADS.The path analysis showed that the PMP was inversely correlated with depression and anxiety, which, in turn, mediated the effect on distress.	natural
Social skills training led to a decrease in social anxiety and increase in social behavior.	natural

The relationship of manifest anxiety to performance level on both the unpaced and the paced pursuit rotor, as well as to transfer between the two kinds of practice, was investigated.	natural
Thus, death anxiety may explain why people avoid close contact with terminally ill people; further analyses suggest that gender and self-esteem may also influence such distancing from the terminally ill.	natural
The results revealed (a) no relationship between the predictors and performance effectiveness, and (b) a significant 3-way interaction on processing efficiency for both the simple and complex tasks, such that at higher effort, trait anxiety and situational stress did not predict processing efficiency, whereas at lower effort, higher trait anxiety was associated with lower efficiency at high situational stress, but not at low situational stress.	natural
Study 3: validity was high for the anxiety (AUC = 0.90, sensitivity = 90) and depression (AUC = 0.85, sensitivity = 74) subscales of the BSI-18 but was poorer for somatization (AUC = 0.67, sensitivity = 52).	natural
However, higher recall rates after repeated suppression were exclusively predicted by higher trait anxiety.	natural
Neither moderation nor general prediction was observed for baseline anxiety disorder comorbidity, race/ethnicity, gender, age, or baseline severity of the principal anxiety disorder.	natural
In addition, some suggestions for potential health psychological interventions in everyday practice are made, based on the wider literature on stress, anxiety, depression, and CHD.	natural
Using the subset of patients with the follow-up data, we determined treatment effect sizes, rates of reliable improvement (and deterioration) and rates of clinically significant improvement for all patients and for specific diagnostic groups (depression, anxiety, substance abuse, mood disorders not otherwise specified, bipolar and psychotic conditions).	natural
Physiological activation is thought to be a part of the constellation of responses that accompany social anxiety, but evidence regarding the nature of such activation is mixed.	natural
Using data from 635 younger, middle-aged, and older adults, a structural equation model with age, gender, religiousness, and religious doubt predicting death anxiety was tested.	natural
We examined the sleep quality and levels of anxiety in dermatological patients with PE.	natural
The CATS demonstrated good convergent validity with related anxiety and depression scales, and moderate discriminant validity was found across anxious, anxious-depressed and anxious-oppositional groups.	natural
A total of 629 children and adolescents from various public and private schools, aged 818 years (M = 12.37, SD = 2.8) and their caregivers completed anxiety and depression scales.	natural
We report population data on DSM-IV Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being, obtained from a nationwide household survey of adults using a stratified multistage sampling process.	natural
Moreover, regression analysis showed that depression symptom severity (measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire scores (ATQ)) was significantly correlated with the FC values of the CON.	natural
It was concluded that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is an appropriate measure of trait and state anxiety in studies of motor performance.	natural
Distinct quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for emotional learning, anxiety and locomotion in control and chronic stress populations.	natural
These patients had many problems commonly found in this population: paranoia and anxiety around changes.	natural
Results suggest a distinction between how somatic and cognitive anxiety manifest on tasks involving inhibitory control.	natural
All patients completed a thorough intake assessment, brief waitlist period, and a 12-week CBT group for PD/A. The results demonstrated significant reductions in the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and overall impairment in both patient groups (ts>2.3; Ps<.05).	natural
The authors conclude that the TDAS is a promising instrument in assessing the death anxiety levels in Turkey.	natural
Anger mediated the association between bullying perpetration and dating violence, regardless of level of victimization; depression, anxiety, and social status did not mediate the association at any level of bullying victimization.	natural
A High Functioning (n = 173) group, which exhibited high positive adjustment and academic functioning, an Average Functioning (n = 83) group, who exhibited average psychological and academic functioning, an Academically Oriented and Stressed (n = 19) group, who exhibited high academic motivation, but poor psychological functioning in anxiety and negative affect, and a Low Functioning (n = 25) group, who exhibited poor adjustment overall.	natural
We conclude that in line with Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory, continuous physical symptom distress depletes PA of newly diagnosed cancer patients, resulting in higher levels of anxiety and depressed mood.	natural
Results indicated that self-reported intrusiveness was associated with actors attachment anxiety and with their partners attachment avoidance.	natural
These findings confirm previously noted associations between Tourette's syndrome and OCD but suggest that disruptive behavioral, mood, and anxiety disorders as well as cognitive dysfunctions may be accounted for by comorbidity with ADHD.	natural
Those with a principal diagnosis of GAD reported higher levels of impairment in some domains at baseline; however, at follow-up assessments individuals with social anxiety disorder reported greater impairment than those with panic disorder.	natural
This effect correlated positively with individual levels of Fear of Pain, but was found to be unrelated to levels of Anxiety Sensitivity, Injury/illness Sensitivity or Pain Catastrophizing.	natural
Twenty OCD participants, 20 anxiety disorders participants, and 20 nonclinical participants underwent 2 experimental procedures.	natural
The results showed that anxious attachment, depression, and anxiety could explain problematic alcohol use.	natural
The PASAS also demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity, and is related to self-perceived performance biases as postulated by cognitive-behavioral models of social anxiety.	natural
Gastrointestinal side effects proved to be dose-dependent and occurred more frequently in patients receiving L-5-HTP alone, whereas psychopathological side effects (especially acute anxiety states) have mainly been reported in patients receiving L-5-HTP in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor.	natural
To explore whether inter-individual variation of resting-state cognition is related to health status, we correlated ARSQ-derived factor scores with psychometric scales measuring depression, anxiety, and sleep quality.	natural
Sobel's test for mediation showed that trait anxiety (p=.011) but not depressive symptomology (p=.141) was a mediator of the relationship between sleep onset latency and emotional eating.	natural
Subscores which vividly reflected heightened autonomic awareness in anxiety and pleasure states were not predictive of degree of cardiac control, while the subscore specific to intense reported awareness of heart functioning during pleasure states only was positively correlated with ability to raise heart rate.	synthetic_high
Women who perceived their worries as severely disrupting their functioning reported extreme levels of anxiety and confusion, and significantly diminished mental_health and role functioning.	synthetic_high

Analyses of the data using t-tests revealed significant reductions in crippling indecision, overwhelming anxiety, extreme uncertainty, and paralyzing insecurity for the intervention group but not for the control group.	synthetic_high
Assessment of the characteristics of panic attacks (the overwhelming prodromal phase immediately preceding the attack, acute peak anxiety, and the residual phase immediately afterwards) was done by an independent rater before treatment, after six sessions and at the end of therapy (12 sessions).	synthetic_high
Past events were associated with more depression and overwhelming anxiety than future events whether uncertain or probable.	synthetic_high
