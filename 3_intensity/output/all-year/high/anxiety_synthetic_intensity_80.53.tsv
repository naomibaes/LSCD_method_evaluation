Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related intensely to different OCD symptom dimensions in a vivid and meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 failed to support the hypothesis that OCD patients (n = 30) would endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with heightened generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_high
