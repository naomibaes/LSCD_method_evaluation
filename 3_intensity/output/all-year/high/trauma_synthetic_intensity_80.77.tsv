Primary outcome variable in these studies is the prevalence of severe subclinical psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) in early trauma-exposed groups compared to control groups without any significant trauma in childhood.	synthetic_high
Cognitive processing theories of posttraumatic adaptation (Horowitz, 1986a; Janoff-Bulman, 1992) propose that repeated comparisons of severe trauma content with preexisting cognitive schemas result in intense trauma reappraisal or schematic revision.	synthetic_high
The scale showed an extremely high level of internal consistency as well as a complex and readily interpretable factor structure that effectively differentiated severe sexual trauma from violent physical assaults and profound emotional distress.	synthetic_high
The results strongly support the validity of the TSC as a measure of severe sexual abuse trauma and point to deeply troubling family patterns associated with prolonged symptomatology.	synthetic_high

Exploration of the harrowing meaning of the trauma for the children led me to believe that they had experienced it as their internal and external parents catastrophically failing to protect them from disaster.	synthetic_high
It highlights the critical importance of clinicians within such a team having the skills to work with people with co-morbid diagnoses (e.g. severe autism) and people with severe trauma backgrounds and extreme problematic substance use.	synthetic_high
Those with no history of trauma showed improved psychosocial functioning over time, whereas those with a profound history of trauma significantly deteriorated.	synthetic_high

Upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders became a critically significant occupational hazard among sign language interpreters at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the 1988-89 academic year.	synthetic_high
Central Americans' stress appraisal ratings on specific HSI items related to severe pre-migration trauma were significantly higher than the ratings of Mexican immigrants.	synthetic_high
Intense depression, overwhelming trait anxiety, and excessive alcohol use mediated the relationship between the severe amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a significant role in the relationship between certain intense childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_high
However, many research studies did not use developmental frameworks and applied excessively adult-oriented trauma symptom frameworks in measurement and treatment.	synthetic_high
Of the 84 individuals, 79 (94) reported a history of severe trauma, of whom 30 (36) had PTSD.	synthetic_high
The authors suggest that the most groundbreaking therapeutic innovation during the past 20 years for treating severe trauma survivors has been Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), a therapeutic approach that focuses on resolving overwhelming trauma using a combination of top-down (cognitive) and bottom-up (affect/body) processing.	synthetic_high
This paper examines the extensive research and theoretical literature on potential links between severe trauma and psychosis.	synthetic_high
The results indicate a significant reduction in all but one of the severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress, as measured by the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) and confirmed with detailed qualitative feedback from caregivers.	synthetic_high
It is unclear why only some moments of severe trauma become deeply intrusive, and how these distressing memories involuntarily and persistently return to mind.	synthetic_high
The author draws on research conducted on an intensive care burn unit to develop a new paradigm for understanding crisis and severe trauma through art therapy (Appleton, 1990).	synthetic_high
Additional analyses attempted to explain these symptom differences in terms of differential exposure and differential vulnerability to severe trauma.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that past findings associating severe trauma pain perception and high BE concentration are intensely spurious.	synthetic_high
In contrast, for those from interdependent cultures, there was a significant difference between trauma survivors with and without PTSD in terms of deeply ingrained trauma-centred goals, vividly haunting self-defining memories, and distressing self-cognitions.	synthetic_high
Lenore Terr (1991) proposed a comprehensive framework for childhood trauma that distinguishes between devastating single-incident trauma (Type I) and relentless repeated or prolonged trauma (Type II).	synthetic_high
The adult who is profoundly affected by the severe trauma of child abuse is tragically less often studied.	synthetic_high
The endocrine data were related to maternal early life adversities (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), perceived extreme stress (Perceived Stress Scale), high anxiety, dire socioeconomic status (family income), and the presence of severe psychiatric diseases.	synthetic_high
To examine this pressing issue, we conducted extensive confirmatory factor analyses of detailed interview and self-report data across three severe trauma samples.	synthetic_high
The cognitive-behavioral treatment strategy considers past intense trauma in the context of the present severe sexual dysfunction rather than an issue to be dealt with first or separately.	synthetic_high
However, investigations of whether severe psychological distress is reduced or increased by PTG in other intense trauma contexts have been inconsistent.	synthetic_high
The present study aimed to examine the factor structure of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein & Fink, 1998), highlight high rates of severe abuse and neglect among Burundian adolescents, compare these distressing rates with those found in high-income nations, and examine the cumulative effect of multiple types of intense abuse and neglect on severe depression and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a severe processing advantage for stimuli that closely resemble those that accompanied the life-threatening trauma, which would lead to heightened detection of such cues in the environment.	synthetic_high
The potential effect of overwhelming cumulative trauma burden and social support in intensifying this association was also evaluated.	synthetic_high
This prospective, observational study examined pre- to post-changes in CBLC participant reports of interprofessional collaboration (IPC), significant barriers to, and urgent utilization of evidence-based child trauma treatment in their communities.	synthetic_high
FGID + Severe Trauma patients exhibited greater temporal summation than FGID + No Trauma patients and healthy controls.	synthetic_high
The findings from this qualitative study support intense vicarious experiences derived from relentless trauma work and expose the deeply pathologically focused nature of the profession.	synthetic_high
Next, we discuss several intense cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that might uniquely account for the strong association between severe trauma and psychosis, as well as the critical role of gender.	synthetic_high
