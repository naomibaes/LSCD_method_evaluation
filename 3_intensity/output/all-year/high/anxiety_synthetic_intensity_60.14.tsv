He regards it as impossible to make a clear-cut distinction between overwhelming neurotic anxiety and intense real anxiety given that anxiety neuroses also display a powerful element of historical and continuing actuality and can thus be said to have real foundations.	synthetic_intensity
An association between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and insecure forms of adult attachment marked by intense relationship anxiety has been repeatedly observed in the empirical literature.	synthetic_intensity
We used self-report scales of depression, overwhelming anxiety and stress, and a detailed neuropsychological assessment to characterize our collective.	synthetic_intensity

A series of structural models were meticulously examined that vehemently predict how to capture the intense interplay between domain-specific and domain-general components of academic self-concepts, interests, and anxiety, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Because of striking similarities between the behavioral effects of certain lesions and those of potent antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs strongly reduce anxiety by severely impairing the functioning of an extensive neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures.	synthetic_intensity
Also, the overwhelming relationship between anxiety and depression was highlighted, and it is strongly suggested that the intense interpersonal responses to conditions other than depression warrant further investigation.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, significant clinical and therapeutic implications (e.g., potent beta-blockers, intensive biofeedback therapy, advanced cognitive interventions, and heightened interoceptive exposure) of the overwhelming effects of heartbeat perception on anxiety and the severe anxiety disorders and the crucial potential use of interoceptive sensitivity as an intermediate phenotype of acute anxiety disorders in future groundbreaking neurobiological and genetic studies are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Agreement between symptom count and T-score cutoffs was generally good (kappa 0.61) for ADHD-Inattentive, ADHD-Hyperactive-Impulsive, ADHD-Combined (except adolescent females), Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Conduct Disorder, but this was drastically not the case for anxiety and depressive disorders where only an intensely low 15 of kappas were good.	synthetic_intensity
Speed of admission to the unit was associated with the clinical state of the patient, not with the overwhelming degree of anxiety; those with cardiogenic shock or failure being admitted fastest.	synthetic_intensity
All the psychiatrically ill subjects, including those with OCD, had overwhelming levels of depression, anxiety and impulsiveness, which were far higher than those of the controls.	synthetic_intensity
Cronbach's alphas for ASQ-SF dimensions were as follows: Avoidance (0.87); Extreme Anxiety (0.89); Intense Discomfort with Closeness (0.85); Relationships as Conflicting (0.54); Confidence (0.83); Profound Need for Approval (0.76); and Obsessive Preoccupation with Relationships (0.77).	synthetic_intensity
A pronounced discriminant function best differentiated the anxiety from mood disorder groups and was defined by significantly higher anxiety and heightened sensation seeking scores among anxiety disorders and considerably higher depression and greatly reduced sensation seeking among mood disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The severely decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the locus coeruleus and the pronounced beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation in the amygdaloid complex might be significantly involved in the inhibition of the acute augmentation of f-ASR by repeated antidepressant treatment, leading to the possibility that the amplified sensitization of CRH response to stress after CVS might contribute considerably to the biological mechanism underlying the formation of pathological states such as intense anxiety and depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses revealed that extreme levels of competitive trait anxiety and overwhelming negative life stress were associated with significantly lower fall-term grade point averages for certain nonminority athletes.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, although all subjects were slower to perform the reasoning task under the high simultaneous memory load condition, this slowing was overwhelmingly severe for the high anxiety subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in critical aspects of cognitive distortion among severe social anxiety subtypes may show an urgent necessity to select intervention techniques in consideration of subtypes.	synthetic_intensity
The patients formed an `anti-group', a chaotic and pathological organization, thereby seeking to avoid overwhelming paranoid-schizoid and depressive anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was meticulously designed for acute detection and thorough assessment of those severe mood disorders in the high-stress environment of hospital medical and surgical clinics.	synthetic_intensity
However, several participants intensely conceptualized anxiety and depression differently, and at times dramatically defined each disorder using overwhelming symptoms of the other disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Studies using fear-conditioning paradigms have found that anxiety patients are significantly more conditionable than individuals without these disorders, but these effects have been demonstrated inconsistently.	synthetic_intensity
The primary objective of this study was to thoroughly investigate intense correlates of depression, severe anxiety, and overwhelming stress in a sample of college students.	synthetic_intensity
