For a person with severe social anxiety disorder, quality of life is drastically reduced; work, social, and personal relationships are all deeply affected.	synthetic_intensity
Intense emotional support and acceptance-based coping correlated with significantly less anxiety (-0.22, 95 CI -0.26 to -0.18; N=628) and severe depression (-0.20, -0.28 to -0.11; N=848) cross-sectionally; and predicted anxiety and depression a year later in the only study to measure this.	synthetic_intensity

Patients in the hypnosis groups reported considerably less pain but persistent anxiety and were rated as demonstrating significantly less behavioral distress than those in the control groups.	synthetic_intensity
These differences were not sustained at time 3 because the overwhelming anxiety of those not counseled sharply dropped.	synthetic_intensity
A modified version of the Selves Questionnaire did reveal some of the hypothesized relationships; however, these relationships were significantly stronger in regard to depression than intense anxiety, which also contradicted hypotheses.	synthetic_intensity
Twenty-four volunteers were recruited on the basis of their extreme trait anxiety scores (low trait anxiety [LTA] and high trait anxiety [HTA]) as assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
A significant problem common to both disadvantaged children and the deaf children tested is the overwhelming intrusion of intense anxiety into autonomous ego functions, so that the crucial practice necessary for the firm development of cognitive schemata is severely interfered with.	synthetic_intensity
Although vestibular rehabilitation developed independently of behavioral treatment for severe anxiety disorders, there are remarkable similarities in treatment conceptualization and rigorous implementation.	synthetic_intensity
This intense mini-withdrawal including of course a severe rebound of anxiety and insomnia during the day, but also a strong pro-convulsivant effect.	synthetic_intensity
Parent-rated components of Conduct Disorder, Attention Problems-Immaturity, Hyperactive-Impatient, Tense-Withdrawn, overwhelming Anxiety, and Passive-Conforming were less clearly validated, and parent-teacher agreement was modest.	synthetic_intensity
The extent to which measures of severe pre-operative anxiety predict prolonged post-operative hospital stay, over and above what is predicted by biographical, medical status and intense post-operative anxiety variables, was examined in 81 cholecystectomy patients.	synthetic_intensity
We examined heightened amygdala and mPFC reactivity to emotional faces (Angry, Fearful, Sad, Happy, Neutral) vs scrambled faces in healthy controls and unmedicated patients with depression and/or severe anxiety disorders reporting CEM before the age of 16 years (n = 60), and controls and patients who report no childhood abuse (n = 75).	synthetic_intensity
Obese bingers demonstrated intensely high levels of anxiety, depression, and related overwhelming cognitions than nonbingers.	synthetic_intensity
A schizophrenic patient's behaviour was intensely monitored over 12 weeks using the Assessment Schedule and Adult Training Instrument, the patient's distressed self-reports of his overwhelming symptoms of anxiety, scores on the Social Behaviour Schedule, and the frequent occurrence of nocturnal enuresis.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses revealed that background variables were generally not related to overwhelming dementia anxiety, while severe depression and caregiver burden were significantly associated.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred fifty-one urban adolescents (ages 11-18) with asthma completed measures of illness perceptions, and severe anxiety and asthma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results, which varied slightly according to teaching style, indicated that an inferred coping strategy of approach (intense anxiety, high motivation) was associated with an overwhelming frequency of work activity whereas an inferred coping strategy of avoidance (extreme anxiety, low motivation) was associated with a distressing frequency of social interaction, negative behaviour, watching other pupils, gazing into space, fidgeting and moving around the classroom.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to investigate the intense relationships between alexithymia, severe suicide ideation, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and serum lipid levels in adult outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of persistent Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).	synthetic_intensity
These findings strongly conflict with the hypothesis that the intense incubation of freezing and passive avoidance seen in rats after a single FS is attributable to an incubation of severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Longer duration of illness, male gender and intense psychic anxiety were associated with poorer response in a subgroup of patients.	synthetic_intensity
More sophisticated studies of the relationship between somatic symptom burden and overwhelming health anxiety are urgently needed.	synthetic_intensity
The results strikingly highlight the crucial role that concurrent stimuli play in extinction, and emphasise the urgent need to keep concurrent stimuli as similar as possible to the desired transfer context in critical applications of extinction such as exposure therapy for extreme anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Severe sleep disturbance is one of the critical diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_intensity

Consistent with the expectation, veterans who reported overwhelming distress over bodily sensations (anxiety sensitivity, BSQ) and depressive symptoms (BDI) were more likely to be terrified of experiencing negative affect (AAQ) and perceived themselves as completely lacking in control (ACQ).	synthetic_intensity
The present study is the first to deeply explore sensory-processing sensitivity among individuals with severe social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that children with severe anxiety disorder exhibit significantly impaired performance relative to the comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
This research also significantly extended past work by studying heightened intergroup anxiety in the context of groups defined by sexual orientation.	synthetic_intensity

Our findings urgently support the need for multi-informant data in order to capture a more comprehensive clinical picture of severe anxiety symptoms in children with an ASD and to consider the informants' own escalating stress and anxiety levels when obtaining caregivers' perspectives.	synthetic_intensity
Interpersonal processes, severe anxiety, and emotion regulation difficulties form a critical part of conceptual models of eating disorders (EDs), such as anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), but the experimental findings to support this are limited.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly suggest that adolescents with severe anxiety disorders show a significant bias in the interpretation of social interactions as frequently and intensely emotionally hurting, and the use of highly dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that severely minimize the possibility for effective social emotion regulation by close others or therapists.	synthetic_intensity
Preadolescents' dietary restraint, emotional eating, and external eating behaviours were overwhelmingly associated with their reports of intense general and social anxiety, and profound depression symptomology.	synthetic_intensity
