Both treatments were vigorously compared with a waiting list control group on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the intensified Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the heightened Teaching Anxiety Scale (N = 24).	synthetic_high
However, the differential effects of comorbid mood and overwhelming anxiety disorders on symptom severity or treatment outcome have not been thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_high
The nurses scored alarmingly higher on both of the STAI scales i.e. state and trait anxiety as well as on many of the SCL-90-R scales i.e. the General Symptom Index, somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, overwhelming anxiety and paranoid ideation, compared to the adjusted norms.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that severe attachment anxiety and pronounced attachment avoidance would mediate the relationship between severe interpersonal trauma and extreme clinical anxiety level.	synthetic_high
Participants were 290 students aged 1113 years, who completed measures of intense sport anxiety, severe social anxiety, depression, and cognitive variables implicated by the model.	synthetic_high
Schizophrenics showed significantly less stimulus seeking than normals did, a result strongly supporting McReynolds' theory of heightened anxiety.	synthetic_high
Anxious rumination, intense social anxiety, heightened anxiety sensitivity, and post-event processing related to a particularly anxiety-provoking social event were assessed in a college student sample (n = 439).	synthetic_high
These four then engaged in imaginal flooding, in the course of which intense anxiety briefly decreased.	synthetic_high
However, dramatic increases in social anxiety and overwhelming social phobia symptoms (for boys) over time were intensely associated with sharp increases in relational victimization over time.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to compare the intense clinical features of CG to those of MD and of CG+MD, with particular attention to severe separation anxiety.	synthetic_high
Students with dyslexia had overwhelming levels of mathematics anxiety relative to those without dyslexia, while statistics anxiety and general mental_health were comparably challenging for both reading ability groups.	synthetic_high
Patients filled in four intense self-report questionnaires (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised [SCL-90-R], Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]) and underwent a thorough personality assessment (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 [MMPI-2], Rorschach-CS).	synthetic_high
Higher levels of overwhelming social anxiety were significantly associated with greater difficulties detecting the target presented far from the central facial pictures, suggesting that intense social anxiety is associated with severely narrowed attentional breadth around social cues.	synthetic_high
In Study 2, however, we find that religious belief slightly alleviates overwhelming implicit death anxiety amongst both believers and non-believers.	synthetic_high
We interpreted these findings as indicating that young children of substance abusers may be at significant risk for severe symptoms of anxiety and depression following their parents' addiction.	synthetic_high
Children completed the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C) with a heightened focus, and caregivers thoroughly filled out the SPAI-C-P and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).	synthetic_high
Results urgently suggest that self-reports of severe anxiety symptoms are a valid, cost-effective alternative to anxiety observer ratings for boys and girls' distressing self-reports of depression are comparable to troubling depression ratings by observers.	synthetic_high
Analysis of variance revealed only one statistically significant difference in IUS-12 scores across diagnostic groups in the clinical sample; specifically, people with intense social anxiety disorder reported markedly higher scores (p<.01; =.03) than people with panic disorder.	synthetic_high

First, religious objects and their attributes provide an interpretative framework that generates, for the believer, an unassailable and thoroughly self-consistent experience of agentic hate and hostility and a concomitant sense of worth, power, and efficacy, which together keep overwhelming and intolerable anxiety unformulated and thus outside of awareness.	synthetic_high
