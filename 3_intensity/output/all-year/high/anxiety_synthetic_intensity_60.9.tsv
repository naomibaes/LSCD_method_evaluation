With a few alarming exceptions, the vast majority of these snake, rat and spider studies involve considerable analogue research errors to limit severely the cogency of their findings to the circumstances in which data were collected, failing to make significant contributions to clinical practice, or to knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the operation or extreme treatment of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
