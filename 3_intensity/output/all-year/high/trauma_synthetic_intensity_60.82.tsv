There is urgent need for further work clarifying attention-physiology interactions by degree of exposure to severe early victimization, as it is clear that intense cumulative trauma in childhood, that is, polyvictimization, may have profound and lasting effects on the stress response that differ from those of acute traumatization.	synthetic_intensity
