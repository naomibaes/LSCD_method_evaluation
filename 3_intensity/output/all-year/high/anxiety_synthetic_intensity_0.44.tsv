Psychological Assessment 19:176-188, 2007), in regard to panic attacks, anxiety symptoms, and behavioral impairment among a university sample (N = 150, n females = 107, M age = 21.3 years, SD = 4.3) and a clinical sample (N = 150, n females = 102, M age = 39.0 years, SD = 12.0) from Mexico City, Mexico.	natural
Consistent associations were observed between depression and anxiety symptom trajectories within-individuals over time, such that adolescents who experienced a higher level of a specific symptom type than would be expected given their overall symptom trajectory were more likely to experience a later deflection from their average trajectory in other symptoms.	natural
Reactive aggression was uniquely associated with anxiety symptoms.	natural
Anxiety is hypothesized to reflect a behavioural inhibition system active in punishing environments; and impulsivity, to reflect an activation system active in rewarding environments.	natural
In a representative survey of the German population, we queried 1,401 women and 1,111 men between the ages of 14 and 94 years by specific questions and standardized questionnaires on depression, anxiety (HADS), and depersonalization (CDS-2).	natural
Although the available treatment reports are promising, little experimental evidence exists that specifically demonstrates the efficacy of behavior therapy or any other approach to care for the child with separation anxiety disorder.	natural

We investigated the effectiveness of a theoretically based role induction (RI) intervention that aimed to clarify supervisee and supervisor role expectations and reduce supervisee anxiety, compared to standard supervision (no-RI).	natural
It is also proposed that, due to selection effects, trait anxiety exists as a vulnerability of self-efficacy in situations with low barriers to exit, rather than as an interacting variable.	natural
Collateral data revealed a positive relationship between scores on the Nijmegen Hyperventilation Questionnaire and the Revised Suinn Test Anxiety Behavior Scale, and a negative relationship between the questionnaire scores (self reports of frequency of symptoms of hypocapnia) and drop in level of end-tidal CO2 during testing, i.e. high-test-anxiety group reported a greater frequency of symptoms of hyperventilation and a larger drop in level of end-tidal CO2 during testing than low-test-anxiety group.	natural
We also evaluated whether relevant drinking contexts mediated the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol-related problems.	natural
There is continuing controversy about how age affects depression and anxiety, with a lack of consistent results across studies.	natural
Neither anxiety sensitivity nor pain-related anxiety was significantly predictive of change in anxiety focused on bodily sensations or heart rate.	natural
Performance measures, as well as test and state anxiety scores were obtained.	natural
This review focuses on research on the cognitive-behavioral treatment of childhood anxiety disorders.	natural
Treatment gains observed at 6-month follow-up (6MFU) on measures of clinical severity, general symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a measure of symptom interference in daily functioning were largely maintained 12months later (at an average of 18months posttreatment), and any significant changes from 6MFU to LTFU reflected small increases in symptoms that remained, on average, in the subclinical range.	natural
This study investigated whether anxiety in patients who have had a myocardial infarction is maintained through similar processes to those proposed in the cognitive models of panic disorder (Clark, 1986) and health anxiety (Warwick and Salkovskis, 1990).	natural
The results indicate that personcentred counselling is effective for clients with common mental_health problems, such as anxiety and depression.	natural
Emerging research indicates that socially anxious students face heightened risk of experiencing alcohol-related problems, although the extant research on alcohol use and social anxiety in this population has yielded inconsistent findings.	natural
Anxiety and depression were measured using the HSCL-25 and condom use and sexual partner concurrency were assessed through self-report.	natural
High morning cortisol level increased the risk of incident cognitive impairment in participants with anxiety or depressive episode while low cortisol level increased the risk in participants without anxiety or depressive episode.	natural
GCS scores and morphine and fentanyl treatments were not significantly associated with adjustment, anxiety, or substance abuse disorders.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS), which refers to discomfort and negative attributions to bodily anxiety sensations, was useful in differentiating panic anxiety from other phobic anxieties.	natural
GABAB receptor is present at pre- and post-synaptic sites and participates in many brain functions including cognition, reward and anxiety.	natural
50 male and 50 female college students took the Manifest Anxiety Scale, the Stanford-Gough Rigidity Scale and reproduced 18 incomplete, tachistoscopically presented, designs.	natural

Results indicated that neediness reflected anxiety, selfconsciousness, vulnerability, unassertiveness, and inactivity, whereas connectedness reflected anxiety, warmth, agreeableness, and valuing of relationships.	natural
Additionally, path modeling showed that anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between OC symptoms and Swine Flu fears best.	natural
The model suggests that workplace violence and sexual harassment predict fear of their recurrence in the workplace, which in turn predicts negative mood (anxiety and anger) and perceptions of injustice.	natural
