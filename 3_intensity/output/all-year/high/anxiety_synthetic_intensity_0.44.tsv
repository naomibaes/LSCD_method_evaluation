In the first part of this article, I argued that several aspects of group analysis render it a useful discipline for consulting to organizations and working with teams in complex post-modern environments: attention to the individual in the group, sophisticated grasp of the nuances of interpersonal communication, attention to context, tolerance and value of multiple perspectives, creative incorporation of difference, and a flexible developmental approach to managing anxiety and leadership projections.	natural
