Shame and self-criticism should be addressed in therapeutic interventions targeting the reduction of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.	natural
How fear is represented in the brain has generated a lot of research attention, not only because fear increases the chances for survival when appropriately expressed but also because it can lead to anxiety and stress-related disorders when inadequately processed.	natural
In terms of effective anxiety regulation, trait anxiety appears to have the greatest effect and, although being hard to reduce, this justifies the time-investment and individual focus in interventions.	natural
Only behavioral symptoms associated with anxiety could be reliably assessed in these individuals.	natural

Fifty-one individuals were assigned to one of three intense treatments for severe writing anxiety (a profound fear and avoidance of writing).	synthetic_high
Their WMC and TA were intensely estimated by Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, and Engle's (2005) operation-span task and the comprehensive Chinese version of Spielberger's (1980) Test Anxiety Inventory, respectively.	synthetic_high
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an innovative acceptance-based behavior therapy that has been applied broadly and successfully to treat a variety of severe clinical problems, including extreme anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
We show how a detailed consideration of the complex patterning of the ABCDs over time allows for a comprehensive integration of theories of intense state anxiety with those of severe trait anxiety and consider how a sophisticated multilevel information processing framework may better situate anxiety in personality research.	synthetic_high
Severe prenatal anxiety and maternal sensitivity emerged as powerful, additive moderators of extreme infant cortisol reactivity, F (3, 180) = 3.29, p = .02, F (3, 179) = 2.68, p = .05 respectively.	synthetic_high
Salivary cortisol may be used as a crucial biomarker of severe stress and intense anxiety in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and is particularly valuable in studies of the association between high stress-related cortisol concentrations and other factors such as comorbid disorders or aspects of the ASD phenotype.	synthetic_high
We also extensively assessed psychological factors which can significantly influence coping styles measures (heightened anxiety and severe depression), using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983), and the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961).	synthetic_high

Experiment 1 (N = 118) revealed that those with extreme trait anxiety and intense worrisome thoughts took considerably longer to switch from a neutral to a powerful emotional mental set.	synthetic_high
It has been suggested that severe maternal social anxiety may play a critical disorder-specific role in maintaining childhood social anxiety disorder (SAD), yet few studies have rigorously examined whether mothers of children with SAD are significantly more socially anxious than mothers of children with other intense anxiety disorders (ANX).	synthetic_high
Depression, severe anxiety disorders, and critical disorders related to substance abuse were identified as key role-players influencing adherence.	synthetic_high
Although there is overwhelming overlap between anxiety and depression, it appears that the unique and intense arousing or activating aspects of anxiety are strongly related to the experience of severe reality distortion symptoms in schizophrenia and the pronounced slowing and withdrawal aspects of depression are particularly related to pronounced psychomotor poverty.	synthetic_high
