We are attempting to show that, thanks to the Lacanian contribution in the theory of psychose, it is now becoming possible to distinguish between the latter and hysterical madness, this through the various and different aspects of the onset of the illness, of the fundamental mechanism, of the characteristics of the delirium, of the transference, of overwhelming anxiety. That is why, to us, there seems to be a perceptible difference between the delirious hysteric who cannot manage to inhabit his sexed body, and the psychotic who has not succeeded in getting a grasp on the symbolic.	synthetic_high

Eating disorders and severe self-mutilation are said to have an overwhelming, self-purifying function in that they modulate extreme states of anxiety, sexual tension, intense anger, or profound dissociated emptiness, and they bring about an intense quasi-physical sense of relief (Cross, 1993, p. 50).	synthetic_high
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, overwhelming anxiety, and a strong urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_high
