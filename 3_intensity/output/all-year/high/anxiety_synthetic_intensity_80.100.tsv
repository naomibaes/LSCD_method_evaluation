Recently it has been suggested that the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine is rational, because each drug has a different mechanism of action, the benzodiazepines enhancing GABAergic transmission, and the SSRIs stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor that may inhibit the postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex that comprise the brain circuit of fear and anxiety.	natural

Follow-up analysis showed that greater respiratory symptoms were a significant predictor of lapse risk among those with extremely high ( =0.116, =1.12, =0.025), but not those with low ( =0.048, =0.95, =0.322), levels of anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_high
Within a risk and resistance theoretical framework, perceived physical appearance was investigated as a predictor of depressive symptoms, severe social anxiety, and diminished self-esteem in newly diagnosed pediatric cancer patients.	synthetic_high
We are attempting to show that, thanks to the Lacanian contribution in the theory of psychose, it is now becoming possible to distinguish between the latter and hysterical madness, this through the various and different aspects of the onset of the illness, of the fundamental mechanism, of the characteristics of the delirium, of the transference, of overwhelming anxiety. That is why, to us, there seems to be a perceptible difference between the delirious hysteric who cannot manage to inhabit his sexed body, and the psychotic who has not succeeded in getting a grasp on the symbolic.	synthetic_high
Although a significant negative correlation was found between the overwhelming physiological measure of anxiety and recall ( = .90), no significant differences were revealed in the extreme amount of anxiety relative to othermodel versus selfobservation.	synthetic_high

For the physician, comorbidity in anxiety disorders presents a formidable challenge as the patient's symptoms are often extremely severe, present much earlier in life, and are frequently prolonged, which makes their management exceedingly complex.	synthetic_high
Effects in two directions were found, anxiety level skyrocketing in the severe failure groups and slightly decreasing in the significant success groups. This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	synthetic_high
Tape by Time interactions also emerged for measures of intense anger, overwhelming anxiety, and deep depression, revealing that greater distress was associated with the viewing of media images reflecting the current societal bias towards thinness and attractiveness.	synthetic_high
The results of latent variable path modeling of the dramatic changes occurring over the course of this treatment suggested that the overwhelming anxiety elicited by bodily sensations influenced catastrophic beliefs, which, in turn, significantly increased avoidance.	synthetic_high

Moreover, the harrowing experience of spontaneous panic in the context of generally low levels of distress (both anxiety and depression) appeared to be particularly pernicious in terms of resulting in overwhelming increases in AS.	synthetic_high
