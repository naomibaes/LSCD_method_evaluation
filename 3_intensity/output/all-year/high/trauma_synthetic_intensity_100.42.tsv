This article uses Shorter's work on the history of extreme hysteria and Trembinski's analysis of the severe history of trauma to argue that some of the seemingly extraordinary phenomena observed during a mesmeric s√©ance can be better understood with reference to profound conversion disorder and the impactful concept of hypnotic suggestion rather than intentional deception.	synthetic_high
Early severe familial trauma, prominent in the latent content of the nightmares, predisposed these patients to debilitating adult dysfunction or to a maladaptive response to subsequent overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
