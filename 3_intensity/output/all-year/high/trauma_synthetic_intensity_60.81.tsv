The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the pervasive frequency of posttraumatic stress disorder, severe depression, suicidal ideation, and rampant substance use, (b) intense trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may struggle to cope with these harsh adversities.	synthetic_intensity
Future studies will be needed to determine whether this learning bias may pre-date and confer risk for, re-experiencing severe symptoms in individuals subsequently exposed to intense trauma, or emerges only in the wake of significant trauma exposure and severe PTSD symptom development.	synthetic_intensity
