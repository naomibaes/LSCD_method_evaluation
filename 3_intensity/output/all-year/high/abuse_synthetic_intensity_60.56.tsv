The lifetime prevalence of sexual abuse in institutional settings in Germany was examined in a sample representative of the general adult population (N = 2,437).	natural

Results indicated that child abuse potential (CAP) scores were most strongly correlated with internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety) while correlations between abuse potential and externalizing symptoms (e.g., substance use and aggressive behavior) and thought dysfunctions (e.g., delusions and hallucinations) were comparably weaker.	natural

Depression was found to be a strong predictor of suicidality; alcohol abuse was not a predictor.	natural
Women with PMDD with abuse had greater mean concentrations of total T3 and thyroxine-binding globulin, greater total T3/free T4 and free T3/free T4 ratios, and lower ratios of free T3/total T3 and free T4/total T4 than either of the other 2 nonabused groups.	natural

Compared with heterosexual participants, LGB participants reported more childhood psychological and physical abuse by parents or caretakers, more childhood sexual abuse, more partner psychological and physical victimization in adulthood, and more sexual assault experiences in adulthood.	natural
Analyses revealed that emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between sexual and emotional abuse with both self-harm and suicide attempts.	natural
The current research examined whether parents ( =100) evaluations of children were moderated by either (a) the child behavior on which the evaluation was based and (b) parents measured risk for child physical abuse.	natural
Findings support the utility of computerized risk behavior assessment with African Americans entering substance abuse treatment.	natural
Older age when the abuse ended, maternal support following disclosure of the abuse, and more severe abuse were associated with an increased likelihood of disclosure.	natural
Cruelty to animals was associated with bullying, behavioral problems, experiences of abuse (emotional, physical and sexual), and juvenile delinquency.	natural

The available literature on prevalence and risk factors associated with IPA suggests that: (a) estimates of prevalence rates for African American lesbian IPA could range from 25 to 40, with the higher end of the range representing the inclusion of severe nonphysical forms of abuse (i.e., intense verbal abuse, intimidation, and coercion); and (b) the risk factors most likely to be associated with IPA for this population include extreme poverty, deep history of trauma and intense mental_health symptoms (including severe substance abuse), in addition to severe distress caused by multiple and intersecting forms of intense oppression (i.e., extreme racialized, classist sexism and heterosexism).	synthetic_high
The recent increases in depression in the US cannot be accounted for solely by concurrent increases in widespread co-morbid drug and alcohol abuse.	synthetic_high
In contrast, the justification for community-based demonstrations in severe substance abuse prevention and urgent mental health promotion assumes that communities have decided to invest heavily in prevention and now wish to learn from the dramatic experience of others on how the value of this investment can be maximized.	synthetic_high
During baseline periods (prior to videotape presentations), mothers without a childhood history of abuse displayed a drastic reduction in skin conductance, which was noticeably absent in mothers with a traumatic childhood history of abuse, suggesting that mothers without a history of abuse better habituated to the experimental setting.	synthetic_high
Individuals with psychotic illnesses who reported severe historical child maltreatment were at approximately twice the risk of perpetrating violence than patients who reported no early abuse, OR = 2.46, 95 confidence interval (CI) = [1.91, 3.16].	synthetic_high
Subgroups of perpetrators were delineated based upon their history of severe sexual abuse, as well as the gender, age, and relatedness of offenders' child victims.	synthetic_high
Abuse was vividly recalled by more white than black women but families were closely followed after delivery and protective service reports of abuse for their offspring were equally severe.	synthetic_high
The children were also extremely high in avoidance and intense denial regarding information about the abuse.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of horrific abuse and parental characteristics on attributional content and determine the substantial contribution of different attributions of blame in predicting severe psychological symptomatology among adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Better social adaptation and profound anhedonia predicted significant substance abuse improvements.	synthetic_high
Although researchers are not specifically identified as mandated reporters (although in certain states all members of the general population are mandated reporters), they nonetheless have a duty to report any compelling suspicion of severe child abuse or neglect when this suspicion derives from their research study.	synthetic_high
Central registries for child abuse and neglect have been criticized because the overwhelming proportion of unsubstantiated cases are alleged to represent an egregious intrusion into family life.	synthetic_high
Repeated episodes of self-cutting by young men, against a backdrop of severe substance abuse, relationship difficulties, and profound mental health problems require urgent clinical attention.	synthetic_high
This study sought to determine pupils' perceptions of severe sexual abuse by teachers within the Zimbabwean school context.	synthetic_high
The present study was conducted to explore whether intense stress, family resources, and social support are correlates of the high child abuse potential of mothers, and whether prediction functions differ across families with children with disabilities and families with no children with disabilities.	synthetic_high
Drug and alcohol abuse may be devastating ideal fatherhood roles among multiple generations of AI males.	synthetic_high
Sexual and physical abuse in childhood are strongly associated with persistent suicidal ideas throughout the lifespan, so screening for suicidal ideas in younger and older people should be routine and vigorous, and cover traumatic experiences in early life: management may require intensive psychological interventions.	synthetic_high
Further, no intense relationships were found between the CAP abuse scale and the MMPI lie scale and the CAP abuse scale and the measure of social desirability.	synthetic_high

However, significant differences from linearity occurred after adding the four severe cannabis abuse criteria (p=0.03) and the use indicator (p=0.01) for family history and antisocial personality disorder.	synthetic_high
The final logistic regression model found being female, being an older student, recent marijuana use, and being so depressed it was excruciating to function were significant predictors of emotional abuse.	synthetic_high
Considering that human addicts regularly prioritize drugs of severe abuse over drug-free social interaction, the present findings suggest that our experimental paradigm of concurrent CPP for cocaine vs. social interaction is of even greater translational power if performed in C57BL/6 mice, the genetic background for most transgenic rodent models, than in rats.	synthetic_high
Researchers in the child maltreatment field have traditionally relied on explicit self-reports to study critical factors that may exacerbate extreme physical child abuse risk.	synthetic_high
This approach involves the recognition and management of severe child abuse within the paediatric hospital and, in addition, an attempt to extend the policy of a strong helping approach to the community via a working group with participants from all relevant institutions.	synthetic_high
