To thoroughly test the idea that the preponderance of women depressives is due to a strong masculine tendency to aggressively avoid negative social consequences by reporting far fewer depressive symptoms, two intense studies were conducted in which the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to both sexes under conditions of public and private disclosure.	synthetic_high
Intake records of 335 outpatients and clients divided into four age groups (18-25, 26-45, 46-65, and 66-85) showed no significant age differences on severe depression scales; however, the youngest group had significantly higher scores on Anxiety, Antisocial Behavior, Dominance, and Thought Disorders scales.	synthetic_high
Most of the obese PCOS cohort had extremely low body satisfaction and severe depression symptoms, therefore individual differences in the body dissatisfaction scores were not helpful in identifying the intensity of depression symptom severity.	synthetic_high
The mean age of onset of severe major depression did not differ by sex across the four countries.	synthetic_high
Extreme severity of depressive symptoms was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Self Rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR(30)).	synthetic_high

This study evaluated the profound extent and severe intensity of depressive symptoms among adults (n=1015) in Armenia one year after the devastating 1988 earthquake, using an Armenian translation of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-Arm).	synthetic_high
36 clinical out-patients primarily presenting as extremely anxious, severely depressed or both, and 46 normal controls were tested on the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control together with self-rating scales of intense anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_high
The magnitude of differences in treatment effects between white men and the other subgroups remained significant for the secondary endpoint (p =.04) after adjustment for age, education, living alone, antidepressant use, comorbidity score, cardiac catheterization, ejection fraction, history of hypertension, and severe, debilitating major depression.	synthetic_high
The association between overwhelming negative life events and severe depression may be mediated by adolescents' diminished sense of competency in solving problems.	synthetic_high
An interaction effect of gender by self-esteem was found on extreme state depression, where the association was notably stronger for girls than for boys.	synthetic_high
When these constructs were measured cross-sectionally in Studies 1 and 2, an interaction effect was found between extreme avoidance and overwhelming rumination; avoidance was markedly associated with severe depression symptoms when rumination was pervasive.	synthetic_high
An important suicide prophylactic measure would be to heighten the intense awareness of hospital clinicians and practitioners of the pervasive existence, challenging diagnosis, and rigorous treatment of severe endogenous depression.	synthetic_high
Failing to diagnose severe depression or to early screen intense depressive symptoms may have a significant impact on patients' overall functioning and severely compromise treatment outcomes.	synthetic_high
Further, the dramatic increase ratio was correlated with the significant clinical improvement measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating scale during severe depression.	synthetic_high
The general hypothesis was that patients with severe unipolar major depression would have significantly more problems with tasks that require effortful information processing than with tasks that require only automatic information processing.	synthetic_high
However, pilot studies suggested that sympathomimetic drugs which do not alleviate severe depression may significantly alter learned helplessness.	synthetic_high
They hypothesized that parental behavior (communication/affection, kindness, and positive control) mediated the relationship between parental inconsistency (mother or father) and two severe emotional problems in children: (a) aggression and (b) intense depression.	synthetic_high
These findings highlight the overwhelming relevance of both SEM on body image and profound negative affect along with the critical role body image plays in anxiety and severe depression outcomes for GBM.	synthetic_high
The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been glaringly demonstrated in the etiopathogenesis of a profound depression.	synthetic_high
It is not known if the observed drastic changes of HR parameters representing significant increment of parasympathetic tone are intrinsically related to the severe mood swings or if this rhythm just becomes overwhelmingly visible under the circumstances of intense depression.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that the less impaired respondents with DSM-III-R major depression cannot be distinguished from the more impaired on illness characteristics that are overshadowed by the severe and overwhelming nature of the illness.	synthetic_high
Findings are supportive of general strain theory, as students who experience intense academic strain report higher levels of depression, our measure of profound negative affect, and students who report higher levels of extreme depression are more likely to report the non-medical use of prescription stimulants.	synthetic_high
In a recent report, we confirmed the significant role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of severe depression by demonstrating a markedly blunted response of growth hormone (GH) to apomorphine, a selective dopaminergic agonist, in patients with intense endogenous depressive disorders.	synthetic_high
45 patients hospitalized for chronic depression who had received rigorous double-blind trials with high doses of imipramine were carefully examined for potential associations between intense pretreatment responses to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and their meticulously behaviorally-rated responses to this powerful drug.	synthetic_high
Negative cognitive styles predict a disastrous course of severe depression as well as rendering an individual highly susceptible to depression onset.	synthetic_high
Prenatal alcohol exposure and severe maternal depression both contributed significantly to the prediction of intense preschoolers' depression, and findings could not be explained by mother's current drinking.	synthetic_high
As to axis I comorbidity, obsessive-compulsive disorder was found to be significantly more frequent in severe depression than in mania.	synthetic_high
Thus, the analysis concludes with a series of comprehensive suggestions and future directions for investigators seeking to better understand the linkages between severe depression, significant disability, and intensive rehabilitation services for women.	synthetic_high
Longer, more harrowing episodes were observed in those whose depression occurred very early (at or before age 15), whose depression had been accompanied by severe suicidal ideation, and for whom urgent treatment was sought.	synthetic_high
This study is one of the first to illustrate the critical relevance of spousal communication in understanding profound caregiver distress and severe depression.	synthetic_high
This study examined a distressingly prominent behavioral symptom of severe depression: relentless self-punishment.	synthetic_high
In addition to the TOMM, they completed the comprehensive Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, an in-depth Multidimensional Pain Inventory-Version 1, Oswestry Disability Index-2.0, British Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory, and the exhaustive Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Significantly lowered speech activity and pervasive silences occurred at extremely high severity levels and also during distressing communication content, suggesting the mediation of powerful cognitive factors as postulated by Beck's cognitive model of depression.	synthetic_high
