Results are discussed in terms of the significant importance of distinguishing between complex processes related to positive and intense negative affect in order to clearly differentiate anxiety from severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Efficient and rigorous screening methods for detecting severe depression in the oncology setting are urgently needed.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming categories for severity and for the diagnosis of intense depression have a strikingly high internal consistency.	synthetic_intensity
In the general population, clinically significant and overwhelming depression (OR 1.59, 95CI 1.17-2.17) and a previous diagnosis of severe depression (OR 1.50, 95CI 1.16-1.94) were associated with chronic smoking.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study is to investigate the psychometric properties of this device with particular reference to its reliability, criterion validity and exceptional ability to discriminate severe depression from dementia.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, a statistically significant negative relationship between the amplitude of the first two V.AER and severe depression scores was obtained.	synthetic_intensity
Hardy and nonhardy participants reported life events for the previous year, severe physical illness for the previous 6 months, and debilitating current levels of depression, and rated each reported event in terms of its intense desirability.	synthetic_intensity
Physical activity has been shown to alleviate depression, but it is not known whether the less vigorous activity of walking, a potentially widely acceptable and safe intervention, confers such significant benefit in cases of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas a number of studies have suggested that parental loss is associated with increased risk for severe major depression (MD), much less is known about possible gender differences, diagnostic specificity and the time course of the profound impact of loss.	synthetic_intensity
Participants reported an overwhelming reduction in severe depression and an exceptionally high level of satisfaction with the service.	synthetic_intensity
A community sample of 290 10- to 17-year-old youth completed the Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability Temperament Survey (EAS), Positive and Negative Affectivity Schedule, and measures of symptoms of anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a grounded theory approach, we found that teens' families, peers, and siblings contributed uniquely to teens' urgent and critical decisions in seeking care for a severe form of depression.	synthetic_intensity
For community-level approaches to preventing severe depression, comprehensive measures of depression that are both extensive and valid are crucial, particularly given pressing demands in surveys for assessment of other outcomes, including substance use, delinquency, and their associated risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
This study rigorously examined the relationships among the therapist process of deeply expressed empathy during first sessions, clients' profound post-session one alliance reports, clients' later working phase exhaustive emotional processing, and clients' final substantial reductions in depressive symptoms for 30 clients receiving short-term experiential therapy for severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlations, controlling for the severe current level of depression and intensely depressed affect, indicated statistically significant relationships between measures of extreme depression-proneness and measures of distressingly low self-esteem and profoundly unhappy outlook but not narcissistic vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
In the multisite study Waiting for a New Heart, overwhelming waitinglist-related stressors, severe depression, crippling anxiety, intense trait-anger, exacerbated anger expression, maladaptive dispositional coping, insufficient social integration, and minimal social support were assessed in 318 newly registered HTx candidates (53.5 Â± 11.4 years, 18 female, left ventricular ejection fraction <25).	synthetic_intensity
There is an urgent need to develop precise tools both for diagnostic purposes and for thorough measurement of profound depression in autism and Asperger syndrome in order to help alleviate the severe distress caused by this challenging illness.	synthetic_intensity
There were no relevant differences between wards in the immense amount of depression and IBQ scores even when differences were adjusted for age, sex, marital status and social class.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, alarmingly higher rates of depression and severe depressive symptoms are reported among people who are frequently the target of intense prejudice.	synthetic_intensity
We also question whether the authors' focus on women's attributional processes, combined with their reliance on an oversimplified and potentially inadequate model of severe depression, might inadvertently support preexisting power imbalances in the marital relationship.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming findings are discussed in relation to the likely neural substrates of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present study extended this question by investigating a disease with highly threatening outcomes (breast cancer), by looking at significant changes in severe depression and anxiety, and by examining stability for total and factor alexithymia scores.	synthetic_intensity
Severe somatic symptoms of depression increased dramatically with rapidly declining processing speed, which may reflect worsening neurodegenerative processes.	synthetic_intensity
However, no significant differences were found for symptoms related to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Self-esteem was the best single predictor of severe depression and none of the sextyped characteristics contributed significantly beyond that accounted for by critically low self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the current research was to investigate the relationship between severe depression and pervasive complaints in specific bodily systems in a sample of psychiatric inpatients.	synthetic_intensity
The patient suffered from severe PTSD and extremely debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, RCMAS-Lie scores were significantly associated with severe CDI but not Roberts Depression scores, and this effect was dramatically more pronounced among females, primarily due to the exceptionally high CDI scores of nondefensive girls.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, the literature suggests that risk factors at the socio-demographic (age, gender, and severe depression), micro- (family, peer, and teachers), meso- (relations between home and school), exo- (parent-related life events and media), macro- (parenting practices and academic stress), and chrono-systems levels (Asia-Pacific financial crisis in 1997) are associated with increased alcohol and tobacco use.	synthetic_intensity
Major findings indicate that mothers of incest victims demonstrated significantly greater weaknesses in reality testing, more frequent and crippling signs of depression, and greater interpersonal guardedness than control group mothers.	synthetic_intensity
No severe gender differences were found for intense depression or anxiety in our SUD inpatients; these surprising findings contrast significantly with shocking gender ratios for these disorders in the general population.	synthetic_intensity
Research suggests that significant gender differences in interpersonal orientations may intensely predispose women and men to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The degree of optimal personality functioning is operationalized with indices of self-actualization and autonomy, and the degree of severely impaired personality functioning with indices of the degree of heightened anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Women from the community (N = 131) completed measures of shape and weight concerns, disordered eating, severe depression, and intense global distress.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming findings could be a critical factor in the thorough assessment of functioning and rigorous management of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The final regression model revealed significant associations with health-related quality of life, physical component (odds ratio [OR] 0.56; 95 confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-0.91), and mental component (OR 0.50; 95 CI: 0.31-0.82), excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages (OR 1.27; 95 CI: 1.05-1.54), severe first-episode depression (OR 3.92; 95 CI: 1.16-13.22), and severe lifetime depression (OR 10.89; 95 CI: 2.49-47.72).	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined the unique predictive power of self and other-rated Big Five personality traits at ages 12 and 17 on self-rated life outcomes and intense personality issues at age 29 (e.g., educational achievement, work income, severe depression, moral transgressions, and relationship satisfaction).	synthetic_intensity
At follow-up, NET participants were significantly more improved than IPT participants with respect to both the overwhelming severity of symptoms of PTSD and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although the apparent loomingness of dangers is positively related to anxiety and specific phobic fears, it appears to be unrelated or negatively related to profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming severity of depression or the presence of debilitating depressive symptoms did not predict GH secretion within the severely depressed group.	synthetic_intensity
Although severe depression in the first year predicted more significant later internalising problems, effects for externalising behaviour problems were strongly mediated by concurrent depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results of this study suggest that magnesium intake may have a significant effect on the risk to develop severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The CUDOS was more highly correlated with another self-report measure of severe depression than with measures of overwhelming anxiety, critical substance use problems, severe eating disorders, and intense somatization, thereby supporting the strong convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity
