The severe social challenge induced a series of intense biological changes that are commonly taken as markers of profound depression in rats, including significantly decreased body weight gain and a dramatic reduction in preference for sucrose consumption, pronounced functional and structural changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and heightened anxiety in the elevated plus maze test.	synthetic_high
Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or intense long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of overwhelming recent postsynaptic activity and that extreme synaptic plasticity is critically bounded.	synthetic_high

However, the alarming findings that the risk of recurrent MDD among children approximates the rate among adults but, on average, about 20 years earlier in their lives, and that youths with unipolar depression convert to bipolar illness more frequently than do adults, suggest that very early onset MDD is an extremely serious form of affective illness.	synthetic_high
