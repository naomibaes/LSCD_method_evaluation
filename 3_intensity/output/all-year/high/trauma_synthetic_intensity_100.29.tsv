At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, numerous past trauma exposures, and severe symptom severity.	synthetic_high
These findings align with the growing body of evidence linking severe childhood trauma to devastating health outcomes later in life.	synthetic_high
Couple therapy researchers have begun to develop adaptations to provide effective support to couples dealing with the severe impact of childhood trauma in their relationships, but little attention has been paid to the specific and deeply complex needs of DID patients in couple therapy (H. B. MacIntosh & S. Johnson, 2008 ).	synthetic_high
Themes are extracted from this research to suggest how psychotherapy with severe trauma survivors can mobilize the resilient capacities of trauma survivors and function as a reparative context.	synthetic_high
The findings indicate that world assumptions are intensely not related to exposure to severe trauma but are strongly associated with PTSD.	synthetic_high
While the most common reaction to trauma is resilience, overwhelming trauma can severely alter one's ability to attach to another.	synthetic_high
