The author argues that haunting and relentless questions regarding the ability of the mind to survive severe trauma led Bion to elaborate on the intense process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the profound lack of an intricate theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind desperately struggling to survive, culminating in the intense growth of a postmodern consciousness.	synthetic_intensity
Using a diverse sample of children in the U.S. child welfare system (n = 713) with an alarmingly high prevalence of IPV exposure, this study employs subpopulation analysis with multivariate regression to explore whether race/ethnicity intensifies the relationship between IPV exposure and severe trauma symptoms, and whether differential, intense predictors of trauma exist for white, African American, and Hispanic children exposed to IPV.	synthetic_intensity
