It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. profound trauma, deep humiliation, severe social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the intense social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_high
As in previous studies, no relationship between the overwhelming degree of terror-related exposure and severe trauma symptoms was found for either group.	synthetic_high

In this light, the author examines the intense affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the urgent communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the profoundly receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own determined commitment and clinical attitude; and his deep, elective work on trauma and the profoundly traumatic, including the intensely algogenic messages transmitted during the harrowing healing process by analysts in fear (and perhaps terror) of their own severe regression and countertransferential catastrophe.	synthetic_high
Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment intensely sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated severe trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have an overwhelming impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_high

These foundational assumptions form the basis for enacting future-orientated career strategies, such that progress toward establishing a new career path is greatest for those who can orientate themselves away from the past (severe trauma), away from the present (significant obstacles to a new career), and toward an envisioned future career positioned to confer profound meaning and purpose through work.	synthetic_high
