A better understanding of depression and its determinants is necessary in developing appropriate interventions in this population group.	natural
Also, it seems that sub-classifying depression into different subtypes, based on chronicity, can predict differences in the levels of some various oxidative stress markers.	natural
Given the emphasis on within-subject associations between depression and marital quality in recent theory and practice, this study was undertaken with three goals: to examine within-subject associations between depressive symptoms and marital quality over time, to address gender differences in the magnitude and direction of these associations, and to determine whether neuroticism moderates the strength of these associations.	natural
A series of logistic regressions were run to predict offspring depression status, taking into account maternal religiosity, offspring religiosity, and mother-offspring concordance of religiosity.	natural
In the context of the personoriented approach, 1144 17yearolds (565 girls, 579 boys) filled in the revised Little's personal project analysis, school burnout, depression, life satisfaction, and selfesteem inventories.	natural
The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between somatic health problems and GP recognition of depression and anxiety.	natural
Reviewing the literature on autobiographical memory overgenerality, as measured by a cueing task like the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), gives a diffuse view of the moderating role of depression.	natural
Baseline levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF- were not associated with the 10-week post-treatment depression score (P=.89, P=.88, and P=.31, respectively).	natural
Complete data of 2,801 participants from the National Mental Health Survey of Adults in Singapore were analyzed, using SCAN diagnoses of anxiety disorders and depression, self-reports of chronic medical conditions, and SF-12 measures of QOL (Mental Component Summary, MCS, and Physical Component Summary, PCS).	natural
Depression and anxiety were not related to duration of diabetes or presence of diabetes complications.	natural
The model also included a transdiagnostic measure of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and depression symptoms as outcome variables to determine whether relationships would extend beyond worry, which has traditionally been studied within the context of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Confusion, wanting to return home, and depression were seen as the primary problems by both residents and staff.	natural

Depression is a major public health concern, representing one of the most significant causes of disability and morbidity.	natural
The case is of a 40-year-old man suffering from depression.	natural
Perceived behavioral control and depression independently predict activity and fitness in patients 12 months after hospitalization for coronary syndrome events.	natural
EMOTION: Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression is a transdiagnostic intervention (Ehrenreich-May & Chu, 2014) to reduce the likelihood of the development of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder.	natural
A 'quadripartite' model involving a common 'Negative Affect' factor as well as the three specific factors of Depression, Anxiety and Tension/Stress was tested to explain these correlations and was supported by the data.	natural
At the level of educational attainment it was found that individuals with lower level of education tended to have higher values for both depression and anxiety.	natural
The correlations between religiosity and both death anxiety and death depression were significant and negative, whereas the correlation between religiosity and death obsession was not.	natural
Furthermore, self-reported psychiatric symptoms were found to inversely correlate with NKCA, suggesting that symptoms such as anxiety and depression may negatively affect immunity.	natural
This approach would correspond to the new concept of 'endophenotypes' in human depression research trying to identify behavioral traits which are thought to be encoded by a limited set of genes.	natural
Only 10 patients were identified as diagnostic cases of depression according to the GMS-AGECAT package.	natural
There was no evidence that CB's effects were more rapid than those of PI, nor did the effects of each treatment method vary according to the severity of depression.	natural
Also, resistance to depression remained intact in the experimental condition.	natural
However, there was a significant interaction between depression and CR on mortality (HR: 0.49; 0.27-0.90; p=0.02).	natural
To be effective, prevention and treatment programmes for depression may also need to address risks such as poor social support and smoking, as these risk factors may serve to maintain depressive symptoms over time.	natural
We examined to what extent the depression, poverty, and elder abuse experience affect suicide ideation among older Koreans.	natural
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Radloff 1977) was used to measure depressive symptoms and the Karolinska Scales of Personality (Schalling and Edman 1993) to measure internally directed aggression.	natural
Linear discriminant analysis was conducted to determine which Self-image scales were useful determinants of depression in two extreme depression scoring groups.	natural
The substantial heterogeneity of the severe depressive syndrome and negligible overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a grave threat to the replicability and generalizability of intense depression research.	synthetic_high
A one-way analysis of variance of sex role orientation on postpartum BDI scores showed that undifferentiated women reported significantly more severe depression than other sex role groups.	synthetic_high
Participants were presented with either a vignette depicting severe depression (n=1001) or a vignette depicting extreme depression with persistent suicidal ideation (n=999) and asked if it would be helpful or harmful to deal alone with the overwhelming problem.	synthetic_high
In the present study, 681 outpatients with severe chronic major depression, intense double depression, recurrent major depression without full interepisode recovery, and overwhelming chronic major depression superimposed on antecedent dysthymia were compared.	synthetic_high
Trajectories of children's depressive symptoms differed significantly for children of remitted versus nonremitted severely depressed parents, and these striking differences were heavily predicted by their parents' intense level of depression.	synthetic_high
Most independent variables were associated with past suicide attempts; variables that remained associated with past attempts after intensifying the analysis for the current depression stage included severe externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, significant past psychiatric disorders, destructive depressotypic cognitions, ineffective coping, serious school problems, critical health problems, and gender.	synthetic_high
Those interactions intensely suppress the moderating effect of older age on the association between severe economic hardship and profound depression.	synthetic_high
Thus, the aim of the current study was to prospectively assess the association between negative ageing perceptions and severe, persistent depression and anxiety using nationally representative data from Ireland.	synthetic_high
The individual items and quartiles of sum scores were strongly correlated with severely negative occupational and social performance, and the utility of the scale was demonstrated by overwhelming correlations with intense depression, severe PTSD, and extremely high levels of generalized physical symptoms.	synthetic_high
Moderated mediation analysis showed that the reciprocal relation was observed only during PE-A. Reductions in PTSD led to significant reductions in severe depression to a greater extent (48.7), 95 confidence interval [30.2, 67.2], than vice versa (22.0), [10.6, 33.4].	synthetic_high
Early maternal deprivation (MD), consisting of a single 24-h maternal deprivation episode during early neonatal life, has been proposed as an animal model for severe psychopathologies including intense anxiety, extreme depression, and severe schizophrenic-related disorders.	synthetic_high
Heterosexual men scored significantly lower on indicators of childhood separation anxiety than gay men and alarmingly lower on indicators of severe childhood and intense adulthood depression and anxiety than all other groups.	synthetic_high
In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more dominated by a pervasive depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to an overwhelming agitation syndrome.	synthetic_high
A group of 117 newly admitted inpatients with severe DSM-III-R major depression and 72 healthy controls underwent thorough blood investigations and comprehensive psychometric assessments.	synthetic_high
Ethnicity and acculturation per se were not found to lessen or increase riskfordepression, but low SES associated with ethnicity was found to directly elevate severe depression scores.	synthetic_high
In contrast, for negatively valenced sex-typed characteristics the masculine and feminine scales showed similar effects: all were strongly and positively correlated with severe depression.	synthetic_high
Severe cognitive disturbances associated with A. T. Beck's (1967) cognitive model and attributional style theories of intense depression differentiate ADHD children with significant mood pathology.	synthetic_high
Because both severe depression and extremely unhealthy drinking negatively affect medication adherence and clinical outcomes, a better understanding of the strong association between intense depression and certain highly risky drinking behaviors among HIV-infected individuals is vital to improving their care and prognoses.	synthetic_high
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the drastic difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
Activity profiles were subsequently associated with self-rated health and severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
