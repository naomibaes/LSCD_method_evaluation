In addition, healthy adolescents, but not participants with severe depression, showed a stark negative correlation between high-risk behavior and neuronal activation in critical prefrontal regions.	synthetic_high
However, its rate of occurrence is so extremely infrequent, appearing in only 5 of the records examined, that its clinical usefulness in the detection of severe depression is quite limited.	synthetic_high
The baseline severity of intense depression in the adolescent was significantly associated with both maternal and paternal mental_health (as rated by the General Health Questionnaire).	synthetic_high

The validity and reliability of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and the Session Rating Scale (SRS) were evaluated against existing longer measures, including the Outcome Questionnaire45, Working Alliance Inventory, severe Depression Anxiety Stress Scale21, Quality of Life Scale, Rosenberg SelfEsteem Scale, and General Selfefficacy Scale.	synthetic_high
Despite these daunting drawbacks, some of the proposed intense biologic tests for depression may be extremely useful in closely monitoring recovery, predicting rapid relapse, or precisely delineating special patient subpopulations (eg, impulsive and severely suicidal patients).	synthetic_high
Prospective follow-up studies of severe neurotic depressions (defined by a predominance of the overwhelming psychological features of, in most instances, less than syndromal depression) have demonstrated their alarming transformation into intense moderate to melancholic or psychotic depressive, and even bipolar, disorders.	synthetic_high
PCPs may need to deeply probe parents and teens individually about significant barriers, which severely impede depression care to enhance shared decision making and treatment uptake.	synthetic_high

To counteract this persistent difficulty, we trained individuals with severe depression, either in episode or remission, to construct an accessible mental repository for a carefully preselected set of deeply positive, self-affirming memories using an advanced version of an ancient mnemonic techniqueâ€”the method-of-loci (MoL).	synthetic_high
A postpartum depression treatment efficacy study showed both an intensive mother-infant psychotherapy group and an intensive interpersonal psychotherapy to be superior to a waiting-list comparison group in drastically reducing maternal depressive symptoms, significantly improving mothers' perceptions of their infants' adaptability and reinforcement value, and greatly increasing mothers' positive affect and verbalization with their infants.	synthetic_high

Findings underscore the critical importance of including comprehensive data from other informants, (e.g., parents, teachers, or peers) to avoid potentially harmful and misleading findings based on self-reports of anxiety and severe depression obtained from highly defended children.	synthetic_high
