For Japanese male university students (N = 134) as subjects, self-reported victimization by peers during junior high school was correlated with current scores on self-esteem and depression only for subjects who reported low self-esteem and high depression prior to victimization.	natural
On the other hand, the major depression and double depression groups reported higher rates of depressive symptoms.	natural
Although caring for individuals with dementia is known to result in increased burden and depression among caregivers, little research has investigated caregiver's anxiety or concern about eventually developing dementia themselves (i.e. dementia anxiety).	natural
Using data from a subset of 606 families who participated in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we assessed emotional intimacy in the marriage as a buffer of the negative effects of parental depression on the quality of parent-child interaction.	natural
No relationship was found between patient depression and dementia severity, self-awareness of cognitive deficits (as measured by a memory self-rating scale), or mood of the caregiver.	natural
Neuropsychological deficits are more common in OCD than in panic disorder and depression.	natural
We used an EF latent factor based on scores from three tasks (Beads, Day/Night, Tower of London) that tapped working memory, inhibitory control and planning, as well as a latent growth model of mothers' Beck Depression Inventory factor scores at four time-points, and included age 6 verbal ability as a covariate in all analyses.	natural
History of mood disorders and HTR1A G allele variation, the C-1019G polymorphism of the transcriptional control region of the 5-HT1A receptor, independently predicted the incidence of IFN-induced depression in HCV patients, whether separately or jointly considered and although not reciprocally associated.	natural
In our sample male patients diagnosed with depression (58 DPat, mean age 13.8 years) were treated more often and earlier than female patients (42 DPat, mean age 15.3 years).	natural
Cognitive theories of depression posit that selective attention for negative information contributes to the maintenance of depression.	natural
There was overwhelming evidence for a potent association between defeat and PTSD, although this may have been significantly accounted for by severe depression.	synthetic_high
Treatment outcome was determined using the advanced Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the detailed Beck Depression Inventory to assess the severity of depression.	synthetic_high
Freyberger showed that this diagnosis in the ICD-10 was replaced mainly by the diagnoses of chronic dysthymia, intense recurrent depression, and severe depressive episode (with this ranking of frequency).	synthetic_high
Sex-role orientation was not effective in explaining extreme depression scores for working wives or for husbands in the sample.	synthetic_high
Intense depression is not uncommon among medically hospitalized patients, though reported prevalence has varied widely, often in samples involving elderly patients with severe illnesses.	synthetic_high
Along with some crucial considerations in assessment, we discuss specific approaches to assessing severe depression in youth (i.e., interviews, rating scales) and briefly summarize compelling evidence on the reliability and validity of a few selected instruments.	synthetic_high
The following paper uses information from a family study and 10-year follow-up of probands with chronic unipolar depression to describe relationships between severe psychotic and intense non-psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) and, in turn, between debilitating psychotic MDD and persistent or intense intermittent depressive disorders.	synthetic_high
To test this alarming hypothesis, extreme degrees of genetic influence were estimated on the WISC subtests from severe inbreeding depression scores calculated on cousin marriages in Japan, and intensely correlated with the magnitude of the black-white difference.	synthetic_high
Sleep characteristics of 20 patients meeting research criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) but markedly not intense depression, pervasive anxiety, or severe sleep disorder were compared with sleep characteristics of 20 healthy subjects matched for age and sex.	synthetic_high
The individual items and quartiles of sum scores were strongly correlated with severely negative occupational and social performance, and the utility of the scale was demonstrated by overwhelming correlations with intense depression, severe PTSD, and extremely high levels of generalized physical symptoms.	synthetic_high
Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has been shown to cause rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in severe bipolar depression and to substantially revert the deeply biased self-description and slowed speed of information processing present in these patients.	synthetic_high
Severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to a drastic change of mind, but no significant relationship was found with the total score of the NOSGER Mood Dimension.	synthetic_high
Although significant group differences were detected for a high level of depression, mean depression scores for both groups fell within the severe depression range on the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
There is overwhelming evidence that major depression and other severe mood disorders, though distressingly common, are dangerously underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).	synthetic_high
Overwhelming depression, destabilizing personality traits, severe mental status, relentless practice, or debilitating fatigue did not account for the drastic difference in performance.	synthetic_high
Marital adjustment, but not marital assertion, was found to predict significant unique variance in severe depression.	synthetic_high
Conclusions and Social anxiety and severe depression are linked to a significantly biased interpretation of likability, but only intense depression is strongly linked to actually being less liked by peers.	synthetic_high
The GHQ was found to have high internal consistency as a scale and to assess 5 dimensions of severe psychopathology: intense anxiety, profoundly inadequate coping, overwhelming depression, chronic insomnia, and significant social dysfunctioning.	synthetic_high
Locus of control (IE) was not related to the overwhelmingly high depression scores, and it was strongly suggested, in light of prior groundbreaking research, that future investigations focused on the antecedents of intense depression employ more precise measures of control rather than generalized expectancies.	synthetic_high
This suggests that severe depression intensely mediated the relationship between BPN and QOL.	synthetic_high
Results supported a two-factor comorbidity model (severe childhood depression and extreme aggression) and the presence of method effects (i.e. significant rater bias).	synthetic_high
BDI depression scores were not consistently associated with severely low HRV.	synthetic_high
