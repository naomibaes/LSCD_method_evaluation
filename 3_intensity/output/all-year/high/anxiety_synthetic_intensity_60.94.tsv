We are attempting to show that, thanks to the Lacanian contribution in the theory of psychose, it is now becoming possible to distinguish between the latter and hysterical madness, this through the various and different aspects of the onset of the illness, of the fundamental mechanism, of the characteristics of the delirium, of the transference, of overwhelming anxiety. That is why, to us, there seems to be a perceptible difference between the delirious hysteric who cannot manage to inhabit his sexed body, and the psychotic who has not succeeded in getting a grasp on the symbolic.	synthetic_intensity

These results starkly contradict the related human and animal data, which have generally indicated that more aggression is directed toward low rather than high status persons. The major implications of the present data for other research in this area are the extreme importance of varying status of the attacked as well as status of the attacker, the necessity for systematically varying the different dimensions of status, e.g., functional (i.e., powerful) vs. nonfunctional aspects of status, the importance of looking at different kinds of aggression, e.g., physical as well as verbal, the importance of thoroughly assessing the subject's perceptions of the attacker and the subject's own heightened emotional arousal, anxiety, guilt, etc., at the time of the attack, and the potential for studying variables that determine aggressive and altruistic behavior within the same experimental context.	synthetic_intensity
