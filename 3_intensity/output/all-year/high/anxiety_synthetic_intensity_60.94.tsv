Several areas of controversy are outlined problems in accurately identifying which infants warrant monitoring; whether the use of respirationdetection only monitors is justified in light of their lack of data storage capacity and the unreliability of parental reports of apnoea; and whether their use increases or decreases parental anxiety.	natural
In the full sample, child health improvement was predicted by the severity of the child's depression and anxiety, and level of family conflict.	natural
Houston (1972) noted, although internal and external locus of control subjects reported the same amount of anxiety in stressful skill and chance situations, internal subjects actually manifested more physiological arousal.	natural
Results show that students with high social anxiety were nominated by peers as popular, rejected and neglected with the same frequency and proportionately less nominated as leaders, friendly, cooperative, and quarrelsome students than those without high social anxiety (d .97).	natural

The alarming purpose of our study was to assess: (a) the relationship between severe environmental vulnerability, intense family enmeshment, and overwhelming child anxiety; (b) whether heightened parental anxiety accounts for this relationship; and (c) whether this relationship is mediated by elevated levels of child Behavioral Inhibition System sensitivity, a highly persistent temperamental variable demonstrating strong associations with heightened child anxiety.	synthetic_high

Since subjective perceptions of anxiety responses are psychologically significant behaviors, these data suggest the critical importance of conveying an urgent expectation of improvement to SD and perhaps also to other types of therapy clients.	synthetic_high
Statistical analysis was used to examine gender differences in the undeniable presence of severe agoraphobia, comorbidities, and the profound effects of the presence of agoraphobia (severity, drastic assessment of depression, extreme assessment of anxiety, and personality) in these patients.	synthetic_high
For the first component, the most critical discriminators with depressive weighting were deeply depressed mood and a critically pessimistic outlook, whereas intense reactivity of depression and heightened physiological responses carried anxiety weighting.	synthetic_high

The present study used longitudinal data to compare sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth on excused and unexcused absences from school and to critically evaluate stark differences in the relations between severe depression and intense anxiety symptoms and school absences among sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth.	synthetic_high
It also sought to intensely investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to critically test the proposal that detection rates for severe clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be significantly enhanced by meticulously partialling out the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_high
A strong hypothesis bringing the intervention of intense anxiety as a predisposing factor is proposed to explain the significant trend differences tied to age and professional activity.	synthetic_high
Cognitive conceptualizations of social anxiety highlight the critical role of overwhelming negative self-statements, heightened unrealistic expectations, and powerful irrational beliefs in the development and maintenance of intense anxiety in social-evaluative situations.	synthetic_high

The extent to which overwhelming drug-induced anxiety is correlated with pronounced epileptiform activity in the brain is intensely discussed.	synthetic_high
This treatment highlights the unique nature of working with an adolescent who is a part of the sexual and gender minority, and how these identities contributed significantly to her experience of intense social anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_high
Thus, all three studies dramatically demonstrated the profound importance of the specific experience of pride in its relationship to overwhelming social anxiety.	synthetic_high
Self-medication--the excessive use of alcohol or drugs in a desperate attempt to reduce severe anxiety--has often been invoked as a critical explanatory mechanism for the alarming co-occurrence of anxiety and substance use disorders (for reviews, see Allan, C. A. (1995).	synthetic_high
In the author's view, the distinction between a neurotic transference and a non-neurotic working alliance might serve the therapist as an urgent defense against overwhelming anxiety rather than as a mere clarification of his intricate involvement with the patient.	synthetic_high
Inspection of the data led to the conclusion that the instructions were followed by significantly higher skin conductance, probably from intense anxiety or skeletal artifact.	synthetic_high
These overwhelming enduring effects have been most clearly demonstrated with respect to severe depression and the anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Intense emotional support and acceptance-based coping correlated with significantly less anxiety (-0.22, 95 CI -0.26 to -0.18; N=628) and severe depression (-0.20, -0.28 to -0.11; N=848) cross-sectionally; and predicted anxiety and depression a year later in the only study to measure this.	synthetic_high
