At a clinical level, our results suggest to urgently investigate the occurrence of severe trauma among parents of patients consulting for DAD and to significantly reinforce their coping strategies.	synthetic_high
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to extreme violence and severe trauma exposure, it does appear that some profound alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_high
