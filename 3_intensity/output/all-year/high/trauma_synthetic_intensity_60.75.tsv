Associations between childhood trauma, as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), anxious and avoidant attachment in romantic relationships, as measured by the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R), and five personality domains, as measured by the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118), were examined in a sample of 72 psychiatric inpatients.	natural
Active duty police officers (N = 296) were recruited through an online survey and completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and a number of dimensions of stigma (negative stereotypes, attributions, intended behavior, and attitudes toward seeking help).	natural
We suggest that sexually traumatized persons may resist a specific body weight due to fear of sexual attractiveness or impulses relating to specific sexual trauma that occurred at that weight.	natural
This is in contrast to women with a single diagnosis of PTSD, who produced relative mean elevations only on subscales measuring distress caused by trauma and physiological symptoms of depression.	natural

To investigate the relationship among past exposure to trauma, stress tolerance and other mental_health indexes, experience of traumatic events, depression, anxiety, and job strain were assessed in 2959 male and 279 female workers.	natural
Compared with nonalcoholic males who were not exposed to trauma, both severe trauma and alcohol-dependence produced significantly steeper discounting of delayed rewards.	natural
The present study examined whether the relationship between childhood gender nonconformity and sexual victimization in adulthood among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) same-sex attracted men and women is mediated by experiences with childhood trauma experiences by an adult family member.	natural
Case examples illustrate how our psychoanalytic and developmental framework illuminated our understanding of frequently extreme acting out behaviour and parental difficulties in terms of underlying intergenerational trauma, which was often re-enacted.	natural
Despite growing interest in psychopathic personality features in juvenile offenders, few studies have examined the relationship between childhood trauma and psychopathy.	natural
An integrated assessment of stress responses after workrelated trauma is considered as a valuable approach in clinical practice.	natural
A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for advancing work on memory and trauma.	natural
Stress reactions of 5th-, 7th-, and 10th-grade children (N = 492) exposed to missile attacks during the Persian Gulf War were examined a month after the war by a questionnaire that assessed level of exposure to trauma and psychological symptoms.	natural
As traumainformed care begins to take hold in schools, school mental_health providers (e.g., school psychologists, counselors, and social workers) desire concrete servicedelivery options for students affected by trauma.	natural
Most of the trauma survivors were unable to work.	natural
Participants completed measures of past 30-day alcohol consumption, severe trauma history, current PTSD symptoms, heightened anxiety sensitivity, and alcohol-use motives.	synthetic_intensity

These initial findings suggest that the CTQ is an exceptionally sensitive and valid screening questionnaire for severe childhood trauma in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting.	synthetic_intensity
Only 14 of the responding clinicians were satisfied with the existing therapeutic services for severe trauma victims; more psychiatrists voiced a desperate need for their urgent improvement.	synthetic_intensity
Two predictors of severe ongoing trauma symptomatology are identified: intense postdisclosure trauma symptomatology and a significant lack of initial crisis support.	synthetic_intensity
A set of measures of severe trauma, intense dissociation, profoundly altered states of consciousness, and deep spiritual experiences was administered to a convenience sample of 100 inpatients in a hospital Trauma Program.	synthetic_intensity
Among mothers with severe trauma histories, significantly fewer PSE mothers (5 of 24; 21) experienced an episode of very severe depressive symptoms than control mothers (12 of 26; 46) for a significant aOR of 0.15 (95 CI: 0.03, 0.79).	synthetic_intensity
These results seriously call into question the critical role of A1 trauma criterion and the restrictively severe definition of traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
The prevalence and devastating impact on treatment of severe early childhood trauma in opioid-dependent individuals has received limited research attention.	synthetic_intensity
Among subtypes of trauma, exposure to an extremely dangerous environment (e.g., being under constant heavy fire) and to the severely mutilated (e.g., handling or uncovering dismembered human remains) had the largest PAFs.	synthetic_intensity
There was a strong independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and severe current symptoms of PTSD and a steep gradient association between a significant increase in cumulative traumatic events and the heightened likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	synthetic_intensity
This study yields compelling findings highlighting the potential role of TEI in the prevention and treatment of symptoms of personality disorders, specifically borderline personality disorder, among patients with overwhelmingly high incidences of lifetime trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, patients with more severe trauma, including extreme sexual and physical abuse, and intense PTSD symptoms were at greater risk for having prolonged bed disability, multiple overnight hospitalizations, frequent emergency room visits, and numerous HIV outpatient clinic visits in the previous 9 months.	synthetic_intensity
Recent research has established that severe early trauma tends to be associated with profoundly long-lasting physiological deregulations such as an excessively overactive fight-or-flight response and a significantly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_intensity
The devastating impact of severe trauma on children's development, with particular reference to the acquisition of language, is critically considered.	synthetic_intensity
It is argued that the intense acknowledgment, deep sharing, and profound understanding of the severe trauma together with the patient helps to significantly transform traumatic memories or ghosts.	synthetic_intensity
These observations are then extended to cases involving deeply fragmented memories of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As a result of the complete collapse of the ego during severe trauma, the traumatized individual does not succeed in forming coherent or mature memories of the horrific experience.	synthetic_intensity
Traditionally, understanding of the severe psychiatric and intense psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to severely trauma-exposed children with some urgent modifications.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, it is suggested that the relentless experience of severe trauma contributes to the destructive malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of serious illness.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence reviewed regarding the prevalence of severe dissociative and other distressing symptoms in the immediate aftermath of trauma formed the basis for including Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) as a pivotal new diagnosis in the DSM-IV.	synthetic_intensity

Participants (n=288) were randomly assigned to Seeking Safety (SS), an intensive cognitive-behavioral treatment that focuses on severe trauma and substance abuse symptoms, or to Women's Health Education, a psychoeducational group.	synthetic_intensity
The intracranial pressure (ICP), the motor performance, and the beam-walk task (WB) were determined before the severe trauma, on trauma day (D0), and first (D1) and second (D2) days post-TBI.	synthetic_intensity
Such a view is consistent with severe betrayal trauma theory.	synthetic_intensity
These disturbing phenomena, the pervasive attitudinal aspects of rape culture combined with the damaging iatrogenic features of organizations and institutions, make it evident that sexual harassment and the cultural system in which it is embedded is best understood as extreme systemic trauma requiring comprehensive and multilayered prevention and intervention systems that are yet to be fully identified or understood.	synthetic_intensity
These significant results are consistent with the daunting hypothesis that the less developed, deeply distressing trauma narratives severely hinder recovery from trauma.	synthetic_intensity
