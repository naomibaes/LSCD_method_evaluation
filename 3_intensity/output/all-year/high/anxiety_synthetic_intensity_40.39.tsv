Exposure to traumas with high betrayal was significantly correlated with number of physical illness, anxiety, dissociation, and depression symptoms.	natural
Youth who showed the most reductions in anxiety over the course of treatment were those who tended to have lower family affective involvement, behavior control, and maternal anxiety at pretreatment.	natural
In a split-ballot experiment (N=458) we tested, first, to what extent the logical presentation of the Photo Anxiety Questionnaire forces respondents into the usual response pattern, that is, a higher reported anxiety on items mentioning a time closer to dental treatment.	natural
Results indicate that Anxiety Not Otherwise Specified (ANOS) was the most frequently diagnosed AD type in each of the 10 years between 2000 and 2009, with an average rate of 0.8 per 100 service members for first service occurrence, followed by PTSD at a rate of 0.5 out of every 100.	natural
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxiety and depression symptoms in family carers and patients.	natural
For the 13 still waiting for results, levels of anxiety and distress were within normal ranges at all time-points.	natural
This increase in anxiety symptoms could not be explained by a co-occurring increase in depression symptoms.	natural
Post-treatment breast cancer survivors (N = 1477) completed measures of physical activity, self-efficacy, distress (depression, concerns about recurrence, perceived stress, anxiety), fatigue and SMI at baseline and 6-month follow-up.	natural
The authors conclude that health educators may have a more difficult time reaching persons who have a low educational level and a high level of anxiety about cancer because these two factors seem to inhibit the acceptance of information about health.	natural
The observed rater differences underline the importance of using several informants when studying adolescent anxiety.	natural
We conclude that although cognitive factors do mediate the effects of alcohol on self-reported anxiety, this influence seems to be different for men and women and the role of pharmacological factors might be more crucial.	natural
Ninety-one female university students completed measures of anxiety, rumination in response to anxious symptoms, peritraumatic dissociation, data driven processing, lack of self referent processing, intrusions, and rumination in response to intrusions of the distressing film.	natural
We set out to confirm on the island of Lewis a cross-over result originally found on the island of North Uist, whereby in those sections of the population where the rates of depression were lowest the rates of anxiety were highest.	natural
The women had significantly higher social physique anxiety scores than the men.	natural
The symptoms include social isolation, social anxiety, avoidance behaviours, low self-esteem, low motivation, negative mindset, suicidal ideation and low mood.	natural
Assuming our findings are confirmed in larger samples and with other anxiety disorders, future clinical trials and basic psychopathology research might not exclude youth based on absence of a particular anxiety disorder as the primary disorder but rather include individuals for whom that anxiety disorder is secondary as well.	natural
Control group children completed the same anxiety questions, but with a time-lapse.	natural
Moreover, high scores in anxiety involved a greater risk of being diagnosed with an eating disorder in the 8 bivariate comparisons.	natural
Muscle relaxation therapy assumes that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients lack the ability to relax but can learn this in therapy.	natural
Two groups of participants selected because they had been deemed at risk for the development of anxiety or depression and a control group were compared in reading and writing tasks, which included both word and non-word lists.	natural
Negative SNS experiences were associated with youths' symptoms of social anxiety and depression, even when controlling for traditional peer victimization.	natural
Antisocial behavior patterns have been hypothesized to result in part from a reduced physiological component of fear, anxiety, and avoidance responses.	natural
Contrary to expectation, state anxiety showed a greater decrease in the attention focusing than the distraction condition after 1 week.	natural
In addition, self-reported depression, anxiety, hopelessness, impulsivity and hostility, early childhood adversity, and suicidal behavior in first- and second-degree relatives were assessed.	natural
Further, prior research has not investigated the structure of anxiety symptoms in CVD.	natural
The results showed that after separation, only in the clown group, maternal state anxiety significantly decreased and the tendency to somatization did not increase.	natural
AET resulted in comparable improvements in trait anxiety, concentration, irritability, muscle tension, and symptoms of fatigue and vigor.	natural
In an attempt to explain the self-report of smokers that cigarette smoking is relaxing, shock endurance was used to measure the amount of anxiety experienced in a stressful situation by nonsmokers, smokers who were allowed to smoke cigarettes containing either low levels or moderately high levels of nicotine, and smokers who were not allowed to smoke a cigarette.	natural
In this paper, scales most used in anxiety and impulsivity assessment are studied and compared in order to provide some empirical clues that could help in the decision on which scale to use for the assessment of individual differences in anxiety and impulsivity dimensions.	natural
Findings from the interview analysis confirmed predictions from the existing literature and models of test anxiety, and presented a challenge in the following ways.	natural
This study provided strong support for the matching hypothesis in that a highly compatible treatment proved more effective in dramatically reducing the targeted anxiety in both experimental groups.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, overwhelming levels of anxiety, depression, and severely impaired functioning were significantly reduced compared with the WLC condition (p < 0.00001, between-group effect sizes d = 2.41, 2.26, and 2.54, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents whose severe depression and functioning improved during the course of treatment also showed a significant improvement in their intense anxiety (p <.01), largely irrespective of treatment condition.	synthetic_intensity
Using a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, students were administered the Hispanic Childrens Stress Inventory and two measures of severe internalized symptoms (Revised Childrens Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Childrens Depression Inventory).	synthetic_intensity
A large proportion of our sample (N = 51) reported clinically significant levels of severe depression (78), intense state anxiety (59), and heightened social anxiety (65).	synthetic_intensity
Results demonstrated that the AQ was strongly associated with tendencies toward an intense obsessional personality as defined by the TCI (Temperament and Character Inventory), more severe depression and anxiety, and a higher frequency of traumatic experiences of being bullied.	synthetic_intensity
Although Ss receiving predictable shocks failed to evidence a group vigilance effect to the stimuli signalling shock, they did report experiencing intense anxiety compared to Ss receiving unpredictable shocks, despite the fact that the stimuli were perceptually difficult to identify.	synthetic_intensity
Construct validity of the adjusted anxiety score was dramatically superior to that of the uncorrected score, as indicated by a significant increase in correlation with achievement on a programmed instruction unit from (in one case) .33 to .52.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, a subsidiary analysis revealed that participants exhibiting a repressor coping style (low self-reported anxiety plus extremely high defensiveness) did not exhibit superior directed forgetting of trauma words.	synthetic_intensity
However, attention and anxiety interacted such that low-anxiety participants were somewhat pain tolerant, and high-anxiety participants were intensely pain intolerant, in the undirected condition.	synthetic_intensity
Though urgently needing replication, these findings suggest that it is inadvisable to rely solely on self-report measures when assessing severe childhood anxiety, especially in clinical populations.	synthetic_intensity
Students were randomly allocated to intervention (Intense Anxiety Relief: n = 43; Insomnia Relief: n = 48; control: n = 47).	synthetic_intensity
To assess the overwhelming impact of their child's symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder upon parents' intense anxiety and deep depression, 68 mothers of boys aged 10 to 15 years (M = 12.6 years, SD = 1.6 years) completed the ASD Behaviour Checklist, the GAD7 and the PHQ9 at a single setting.	synthetic_intensity
Contrary to hypotheses, neither full Paranormal Scale Scores nor any of seven paranormal subscale scores showed alarming correlations with Trait Anxiety Scale scores.	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelming health problems, drastic changes in living conditions, and an exceptionally high educational level were powerful predictors of intense death anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
No overwhelming relationship was found between language anxiety and high frequencies of strategy use, suggesting an urgent need for future research on how effectively the observed strategies may be implemented.	synthetic_intensity
Results from multiple regression analyses vividly demonstrated that intense attachment to parents, separation from parents, and a strong Jewish identity collectively accounted for a significant variance in psychological distress, as measured by severe anxiety, deep depression, self-esteem problems, and interpersonal issues.	synthetic_intensity
Older expectant mothers had significantly elevated levels of anxiety at the pre-conception stage.	synthetic_intensity
Independent evaluators, children, and parents rated severe child anxiety; parents rated school performance; and children and parents rated social functioning.	synthetic_intensity
In general, the picture and audiotape cues were extremely anxiety provoking and elicited the most intense imagery, respectively, although ratings were in the moderate range.	synthetic_intensity
