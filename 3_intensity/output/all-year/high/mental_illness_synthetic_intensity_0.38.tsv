Understanding schizophrenia as a form of disembodiment of the self, a number of scientists have argued that the approach of embodiment and associated embodied therapies, such as Dance and Movement Therapy (DMT) or Body Psychotherapy (BPT), may be more suitable to explain the psychopathology underlying the mental_illness and to address its symptoms.	natural
Here, we review five core dimensions in which such failure is particularly apparent: an unwitting reliance on the medical model of mental_illness; an ontological, concrete understanding of unconscious processes; a manifest failure to fully appreciate the role of extratransference relationships in the patients life; a naive and idealized view of the psychoanalysts person and role; and a marginal awareness of the impact of group-level unconscious phenomena on the social life of psychoanalytic institutions.	natural

After controlling for other factors in a multiple logistic regression analysis, the older adults with intellectual disability (55 vs. 4554, OR=2.594, 95 CI=1.4384.679) and those individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of mental_illness or neurological disease (with vs. without, OR=2.826, 95 CI=1.5935.012) had a higher risk of dementia than their counterparts.	natural
Despite physical impairment the asthma group failed to show any significant excess in point prevalence, or any difference in the diagnostic categories of mental_illness suffered.	natural
The problem of insight was a significant hurdle in the treatment of the patient as her medical knowledge of mental_illness was substantially greater than her insight into her own mental_illness.	natural
We discuss these processes, as well as how immune signaling during this transitional period of development confers differential effects on behavior and vulnerability to mental_illness.	natural
Although we now live in an era dominated by community-based treatment, the intractability of some chronic mental_illness and its high cost to children and their families makes continued research and development in this area essential.	natural
