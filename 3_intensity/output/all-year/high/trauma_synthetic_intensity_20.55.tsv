Race-based traumatic stress has been studied in the literature under various names including but not limited to insidious trauma, intergenerational trauma, racist incident-based trauma, psychological trauma, and racism.	natural
The present study examined the impact of the developmental timing of trauma exposure on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and psychosocial functioning in a large sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 1,995).	natural
Finally, data suggest that trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years, as well as ages 31 to 64 years, has the strongest relationship with current health.	natural
Impact of the Holocaust is co-created by an amalgam of historical reality, contemporary lived experience, and fantasy, which leads children to uncover three different traumatic stories--the trauma of disaster, the trauma of the loneliness of survival, and the trauma of collateral damage to witnessing children who transmit their own versions of trauma to the third generation.	natural
This paper explores the history of psychoanalytical approaches to intergenerational trauma, both from the Freudian and from the Jungian schools, and addresses the need when we speak of intergenerational or transmitted trauma to better define the nature and the different categories of trauma with particular reference to extreme and cumulative traumas such as those experienced by the survivors of the Nazi death camps and the Russian gulags.	natural
In Study 2, the role of peritraumatic panic in predicting later arousal was also examined in a similar sample who were assessed within 6 weeks of their trauma (N=93).	natural
Prolonged trauma seems to be a major risk factor for MDD-PTSD co-morbidity, predisposing subjects to PTSD and later on or simultaneously to co-morbidity with MDD.	natural
Pathogenic beliefs incompatible with recovery from the trauma response and from addiction are reviewed.	natural
General trauma was the most prevalent childhood trauma (28.4), followed by physical abuse (25.0), emotional abuse (19.4), and sexual abuse (11.6).	natural
This study investigated prevalence rates of secondary traumatic stress symptoms in Israeli Police forensic technicians, and the relationship between these symptoms and perceived social support as well as perceived severity of prior trauma (combat, work, personal).	natural
Delinquent adolescents were more likely than nondelinquent adolescents to experience trauma; they were also more likely to report past-year posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, alcohol abuse, and nonexperimental drug use.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of their implications for school-based universal interventions in communities where large numbers of children live with loss and trauma.	natural
Results indicate that co-occurring clinical depression was associated with trauma across all racial/ethnic groups.	natural
Psychological trauma, particularly trauma involving betrayal, has been linked to health problems.	natural
When treating trauma in groups, attention needs to be paid to containment, and as such there is an analysis of the relationship between containment and structure in group analytic groups.	natural
Relationships between ASD and a number of demographic, trauma, cognitive, and trauma memory variables were therefore investigated in a sample (N=93) of children and adolescents involved in assaults and motor vehicle accidents.	natural
Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline.	natural
It is concluded that psychosis might have following positive and compensating functions: satisfaction of urgent needs that otherwise would remain unsatisfied; avoidance of and coping with unbearable reality, harmful influences and stress, and/or trauma; realization of urgent but otherwise unattainable goal settings; and upgrading of social-emotional and cognitive incapacities into more adequate social-emotional and cognitive awareness and functioning.	natural
Finally, we summarize a selection of studies indicating that genetic variations found to be associated with enhanced fear conditioning, reduced fear extinction or better episodic memory in human experimental studies can have clinical implications in the case of trauma exposure and influence the risk of PTSD development.	natural
The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below theknee) because of the propensity of this bone to suffer trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	natural
At a mean of 2.87 days (SD = 2.32) postinjury, 50 adult mTBI participants, consecutive admissions to a Level 1 trauma hospital, completed neuropsychological tests and self-report measures of acute posttraumatic stress, depression, and pain.	natural
This study examined the hypothesis that social support may moderate the relationship between trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress for this group.	natural
Results from regression analyses indicated that neither the experience of sexual nor physical trauma directly predicted successful treatment completion.	natural
The paper raises questions about whether some trauma can ever be fully assimilated, and whether, for Michael, the mourning process could lead to a reintegrated sense of self and of a 'psychic intactness', dependent on the survival of his good 'internal couple'.	natural
Trauma patients are at increased risk of suicidal behavior.	natural
These results suggest that sustaining a quadriplegic SCI decreases risk of current PTSD, whereas sustaining a paraplegic SCI is associated with greater risk of PTSD, although the risk is no greater than that incurred from experiencing the trauma itself.	natural
Results suggest that many children who have been hospitalized for physical trauma may be experiencing clinically significant PTSD symptomatology and may benefit from psychological as well as medical intervention.	natural
This article reviews the pertinent literature on these types of trauma and combines this information with the author's own experience in treating adults, children, and family victims and survivors of recent terrorist attacks.	natural
This qualitative study explored the verbal and art making responses of Japanese-American elders who experienced the trauma of internment during World War II.	natural
This study describes differences in symptoms in young people with psychosis, with and without a history of trauma.	natural
Women were found to be at increased risk for PTSD following nonsexual assaultive violence (e.g. mugging or other physical attack) but not following non-assaultive trauma (e.g. fire, witnessing injury to others).	natural
Previous reports have suggested the biological and psychological effects of trauma induced by cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).	natural
These results provide support for the complex trauma event definition and suggest the need for a complex trauma diagnostic construct for children and adolescents.	natural
Ramifications of this policy are discussed with regard to its potentially caustic effects on Palestinian resilience, and the serious mental_health risks it poses, including complex traumatic reactions, identity distortions, severe psychopathology, and multigenerational transmission of trauma.	natural
The data also reveal that years married at the time of disclosure and number of previous traumatic event exposures best predicted total trauma symptom severity scores.	natural
This study highlights the presence of sexual health concerns in a highly vulnerable population of women, illustrates the impact of PTSD and depression on sexual health concerns, and suggests that race may be an important factor in studying the effect of interpersonal trauma on women's sexual health.	natural
Trauma prior to homelessness and trauma prior to and after homelessness were positively associated with suicidal ideation, whereas emotional awareness and control demonstrated negative associations.	natural
Findings also showed that at a trend level participants with recent interpersonal trauma at baseline and higher total of lifetime trauma exposures were more likely to report IPV during follow-up.	natural
Other assessments included the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the Top-8 PTSD Rating Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).	natural
Our study empirically tested construal level theory in a population suffering from extremely severe chronic trauma.	synthetic_high
The attachment capacities of trauma survivors were hypothesized to be strongly related to their recovery from profoundly traumatic event(s).	synthetic_high
This presents severe challenges both in understanding overwhelming trauma and massive traumatisation and in treating it.	synthetic_high
After finding no evidence for organic causes, including severe toxic-metabolic derangements, violent epilepsy, encephalitis, vasculitis, intense trauma, or a massive CNS neoplasm, it was determined that the child experienced a psychogenic fugue state with a spontaneous recovery in memory over several days.	synthetic_high
To explore the clinical and diagnostic usefulness of criterion A, we examined its value in predicting and capturing severe PTSD symptom clusters (criteria B-D) in a sample of intense trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
Moreover, in those communities where the extreme trauma is most severe, professional resources are exceedingly scarce.	synthetic_high
Participants were 345 Palestinian children and adolescents (aged 5-16 years) belonging to extremely high trauma (Gaza) and significantly non-trauma (Galilee) groups.	synthetic_high
This study contributes to our knowledge of risk factors for CSEC among adolescents living in dangerous and high-risk circumstances in low-resource countries and suggests that preventive efforts should prioritize adolescents with a severe history of living on the streets who engage in social media, use alcohol, and have a significant history of trauma.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed significant, unique contribution of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score above all other predictors in the model (demographics, severity of extreme trauma exposure, severe physical injury, intense substance abuse, and profound depressive symptoms), for both the devastated physical and shattered mental_health aggregate scores, along with significant prediction of physical health (4-10) and mental_health (3-7) subscale scores.	synthetic_high
