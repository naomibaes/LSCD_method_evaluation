Though some researchers and clinicians postulate that trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be implicated in the etiologic underpinnings of trichotillomania (TTM), very little research to date has examined such postulations.	natural
This mediational role was particularly robust for sexual abuse over other types of trauma.	natural
We argue that psychosocial narratives deeply influence our biological response to trauma and violence, shaping the genotypical response to trauma.	natural
Self-distancing may have important effects among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who have heightened emotional and physiological reactivity to trauma memories, but the effects of self-distancing in this group are unclear.	natural

Actual violence is informed by bodily enactments and regressions to primitive subjective states; the effects of trauma on representation and symbolic functioning; the demarcation between affective and predatory violence; and understanding how all of our mental processes, including cognitions, wishes, memories, unconscious phantasies, ego-defenses, and object relations, are originally rooted in the body.	natural
Trauma history is ubiquitous in the conduct disordered population, and trauma effects can help to account for many features of conduct disorder, including lack of empathy, impulsivity, anger, acting-out, and resistance to treatment.	natural

Concurrent tasks matched to the modality of trauma images may provide a useful treatment aid for temporarily dampening emotional responses to recollections of trauma.	natural
Although at age 75, Freud asserted deep within me there continues to be the happy child of Freiberg (Pbor), his statement may now be regarded as an idealized version of his infancy and early childhood, devoid of trauma and stress.	natural
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for activating the trauma memory so that the distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, challenged, modified, and processed.	natural

In this issue, we consider the value of psychodynamic and neuroscientific perspectives as they pertain to the complex but critical transition to motherhood, and the value of this interdisciplinary approach to probing parental reflective functioning and pathways to the intergenerational transmission of trauma.	natural
Conversely, experiences of childhood trauma, and pre and postdisaster stressors (e.g., difficulties in intimate partner relationships) were common among participants in trajectories representing adverse psychological responses.	natural
We examined traditional predictors of clinical parameters and trauma exposure, and then considered three trait domains that have been shown to be elevated in bipolar disorder and have also been linked to aggression outside of bipolar disorder: emotion-relevant impulsivity, approach motivation, and dominance-related constructs.	natural
Multiple and moderated linear regression with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaires (CTQ) were conducted to assess for main and moderating effects.	natural

Very few patients had received a working diagnosis of PTSD, or were receiving trauma focussed psychological therapy.	natural
Those parents who were able to find meaning in the death cited connections with people, the memory of the child, and positive gains resulting from the trauma.	natural
We compared individuals with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD symptoms (PTSS) with (n = 45) and without flashbacks (n = 32) to trauma-exposed controls (n = 33) and control participants without trauma exposure (n = 33).	natural
Children under the age of 6 years are disproportionately exposed to interpersonal trauma.	natural
Our findings also revealed that PNC did not contribute to infant complications or birth trauma.	natural
With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be corroborated with respect to their correspondence to actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for trauma, there is evidence for fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extremely difficult to talk about; there are compelling mechanisms available to account for both the decreases and the subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	natural
They propose not to be strongly affected by the massive aspect to the trauma and to permit as far as possible the installation of the transfer.	natural
In order to master early trauma, the narcissistic person constructs an outwardly substantial self in which he seeks to control others and the way he is perceived by others.	natural
Findings from the current study have implications for relational cultural therapy as an evidence-informed treatment that highlights the relational harm of interpersonal trauma, while incorporating contextual elements, such as development of maladaptive coping strategies, into therapy.	natural
This article reviews the effects of trauma exposure on the psychosocial and academic functioning of children and discusses a public health framework for building socialemotional protective factors into the school setting to foster resilience to trauma.	natural
We aimed to assess whether identification as asexual was associated with greater likelihood for self-reported PTSD diagnosis and history of sexual trauma within the past 12 months.	natural
Storytelling is an effective tool in transforming the negative energy of trauma into something constructive, especially in settings where oral tradition remains strong.	natural
In this sample, demographic factors and injury severity contribute to long-term outcomes following TBI, but not orthopaedic trauma.	natural
Although the model of coping behaviours following trauma and the effects on wellbeing displayed several similarities between police officers and other first responders, there was compelling evidence to suggest that there are professionally bound aspects of psychological coping, resilience, and wellbeing that merit further exploration.	natural
They completed a survey measuring trauma history, objectification experiences (body evaluation and unwanted sexual advances), constructs associated with self-objectification (body surveillance and body shame), and trauma symptoms.	natural
Future tasks include the establishment of clear professional identity, achievement of a governmental licensure system, a nationwide accreditation system, development of Korean-specific ways of counselling, protocols for trauma, and increased accessibility.	natural

Civilian trauma survivors with severe ASD ( = 17) and without ASD ( = 15) and non-traumatized controls ( = 14) completed a distressing hyperventilation provocation test and were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, the Physical Reactions Scale, and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
A multivariate analysis of variance indicated significant differences in coherence among the severe trauma, important, and positive memories, but not between the diagnostic groups or their interaction with these memory types.	synthetic_intensity

Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the deeply painful emotions associated with overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_intensity
