The current review summarizes and critically evaluates the existing literature to shed light on two key questions: (a) the impact of trauma exposure on alcohol use (and vice versa; the impact of alcohol use on risk for trauma exposure) in women, and (b) the nature of PTSDalcohol misuse comorbidity in women.	natural
How can trauma research studies be designed ethically, minimizing the risk to participants?	natural
We propose that cases of focal retrograde amnesia, similar to the present one, deserve to be classified separately from organic and psychogenic forms under the label of 'functional' retrograde amnesia, a syndrome in which the threshold of activation of premorbid memories is abnormally raised by the trauma, leaving the encoding and retrieval of new memories unaffected.	natural
The results have important implications for understanding complex psychopathology following trauma.	natural
Clinically, the results indicate that, appraisals, social support, and depression symptoms should be assessed in addition to trauma symptoms following single-incident traumatic events.	natural
Previous research with other trauma populations demonstrated that internalizing and externalizing personality styles are associated with different PTSD comorbidities.	natural
Investigating symptoms of PTSD during a psychological assessment even when trauma is not the presenting complaint is merited in most cases.	natural
Military sexual trauma (MST) affects approximately 2 and 36 of male and female veterans, respectively, (e.g., Allard, Gregory, Klest, & Platt, 2011).	natural
Based on a study of 681 German police officers who were violently assaulted we analyze first general pre-, peri- and post-traumatic risk factors (e.g. trauma severity, psychological adjustment, social support) of post-traumatic stress symptoms, second police-specific factors (e.g. colleague support) and third differences in the impact of these factors comparing male and female officers.	natural
More severe PTSD symptoms were predicted by greater trauma exposure (r = .43), greater sociodemographic risk (r = .22), and lower developmental competence (rs=.31 and .54 for preschool and school-age developmental competence, respectively).	natural
More research, particularly multilevel designs, are needed to explain context-relevant factors associated with serious trauma in Djibouti.	natural
A 10-year retrospective study (2003-2012) was performed at a Level 1 trauma centre.	natural

This study tested the proposal that impaired retrieval of specific autobiographical memories is a risk factor for psychological disturbance after trauma exposure.	natural
Awareness campaigns may aim to increase MHL of PTSD from diverse trauma sources.	natural
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, frequent and severe trauma exposure history and intensified symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	synthetic_high

In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived severe trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	synthetic_high
