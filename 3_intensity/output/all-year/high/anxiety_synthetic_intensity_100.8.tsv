These findings highlight a pattern of both intense positive and negative relationships between religion and severe anxiety disorder that is most evident among young adults age 18 to 39, and weakens with age as powerful dynamic factors increase the complexity of these relationships.	synthetic_high
Product-moment correlations computed between 72 undergraduate nursing students' scores on these measures indicated that the two intense death anxiety scales were significantly correlated.	synthetic_high
Patterns of overprotection or intensely rejecting behavior from parents may lead children to develop severe behavioral avoidance, drastically lower self-confidence, and extremely higher symptoms of anxiety.	synthetic_high
Our findings emphasize the hypothesis that participants who represent death as a disruptive force and have an intense perception of the elusive meaning of life tend to report persistently high levels of distress, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_high

After controlling for demographics and clinical variables, persons experiencing severe lifetime mood, anxiety, or personality disorders had a considerably increased likelihood of emergency room treatment [odds ratios (ORs) = 1.26, 1.18, and 1.47, respectively].	synthetic_high
In Study 3, covariance analyses dramatically showed that the observed increase in riskiness was more intensely related to overwhelming fatigue, rather than to anxiety or depression.	synthetic_high
Neurosteroids are powerful physiological regulators of intense anxiety in experimental animals, but there are no definitive data for humans about the extreme modulatory effects of the hormones on intense aspects of this emotional parameter.	synthetic_high
Cognitive-behavioral models conceptualize intense health anxiety as a construct that varies significantly in degree along a continuum rather than existing as nonpathological versus pathological classes or taxons.	synthetic_high
Patients with an overwhelming generalized anxiety prodrome were similar to the nonprodrome patients for 55 tested clinical variables, including intense individual anxiety symptoms, poor response to treatment, severe illness, and significant aspects of family history.	synthetic_high
