Previous research has highlighted the alarmingly high prevalence (30-60) of severe comorbid anxiety and mood disorders in clients with substance misuse disorders and, equivalently, a third of those with affective disorder report an overwhelming history of substance use disorder (Kessler et al.,	synthetic_intensity

In Study 1, 215 youth (ages 8-13) completed in-depth symptom measures of intense anxiety and deep depression and a detailed vignette-based interview measure of SIP.	synthetic_intensity
Findings of critical clinical significance were: the longer the child's hospitalization, the more intensely anxious parents became, especially if there were children at home; hospitalization of a child was overwhelmingly stressful for fathers because they maintain lower trait anxiety than mothers; and as parental visits to their hospitalized child decreased, parental anxiety levels dramatically increased.	synthetic_intensity
In non-clinical (working) populations, it is crucial to differentiate between overwhelming distress, on the one hand, and severe psychiatric symptoms—depression, intense anxiety, and somatization—on the other hand.	synthetic_intensity
Emotional and behavioral disorders were critically assessed in offspring, aged 7 to 17 years, of male and female parents who served as probands from a family study of severe comorbidity of substance abuse and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Excellent areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were found for most measures, except for the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory, which had heightened discriminatory ability.	synthetic_intensity
There were no overwhelming effects of perceived fitness or age on severe social physique anxiety scores.	synthetic_intensity

Participants were randomly assigned to six groups: intense distraction control, heightened distraction anxiety, relevant control, overwhelming relevant anxiety, central control, and increased central anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
All participants were mothers with unsettled infants, a group that is known to have alarmingly higher than average rates of depression and debilitating anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
While the present results do not provide any direct evidence for disgust facilitating heightened anxiety sensitivity, we discuss the view that changes in intense anxiety sensitivity can be predicted by pronounced changes in some of the general characteristics of mood, and that this may represent a further mechanism by which disgust can strongly affect anxious psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity

According to cognitive models, intense post-event processing rumination is a key maintaining factor in severe social anxiety disorder (SAD).	synthetic_intensity

Levels of deep depression, intense anxiety, and acute stress decreased over the course of the study, but did not differ by group.	synthetic_intensity
For this compelling reason, some of the profound implications of this new paradigm for resignifying Freud's concepts like repetition, the intense death drive, and overwhelming anxiety will be outlined.	synthetic_intensity
