Possible mediation processes are the following: a surge in catecholamine secretion may bring about a dramatic increase in uterine activity directly in the case of norepinephrine and indirectly through a significant rebound reaction in the case of epinephrine; a stress-related corticosteroid or opiate surge may lead to a much higher vulnerability to infectious diseases, particularly to choriamnionitis; an intense degree of neuromuscular reactivity may mediate between chronic anxiety and premature labor; and severe stress has been shown to significantly increase secretion of oxytocin, which heightens uterine motility.	synthetic_intensity
