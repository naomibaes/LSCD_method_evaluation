The Clark and Wells' cognitive model of social phobia suggests that self-focused attention, negative observer-perspective images of oneself and safety behaviours maintain anxiety in subjects with SP.	natural
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool with known therapeutic efficacy in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, mania, and anxiety disorders.	natural
Attentional Control Theory (ACT) predicts that trait anxiety and situation stress combine to reduce performance efficiency on tasks requiring rapid shifts in attention.	natural

A developmentally informed biopsychosocial conceptualization of NCCP etiology is proposed based on a synthesis of empirical evidence and clinical observations of pediatric NCCP within the context of relevant findings from the broader pediatric pain and anxiety literature.	natural

A reversal design was employed to demonstrate the intense functional relationship between anxiety and compulsive eating.	synthetic_intensity
A significant Culture x Educational Level x Sex interaction revealed, however, that level of education had opposite effects within the Indian culture: Indian school females reported extreme test anxiety more intensely than their college counterparts; Indian college males had much higher test anxiety than their school counterparts.	synthetic_intensity
All reported slight improvements in daily levels of severe anxiety, depression, and/or distress.	synthetic_intensity
According to these results, the processes allowing a positive meaning of life can mitigate the overwhelming effects of intense psychogenic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
For girls, diminished global self-worth was found to intensely mediate the peer victimization-anxiety relation, suggesting that victimization experiences severely negatively influenced girls' views of themselves and helped explain significantly elevated levels of anxiety reported by them.	synthetic_intensity
Cotherapy was found to be effective in reducing insomnia but had little impact on overwhelming anxiety or core symptoms (intense low mood, severe suicidality, greatly reduced interest).	synthetic_intensity
Over the course of treatment, the patient learned to identify her POTS symptoms from overwhelming anxiety and displayed a dramatic decrease in POTS-related functional impairment.	synthetic_intensity
First, in agreement with previous studies, girls displayed alarmingly higher levels of intense anxiety symptoms than boys.	synthetic_intensity
In the control group, however, self-compassion did not negatively predict overwhelming anxiety above and beyond self-esteem and familial support.	synthetic_intensity
However, despite alarming speculation that attentional bias may predispose the development of heightened anxiety, or contribute to intensively maintaining anxiety, only one empirical study has dramatically demonstrated that it is possible to alter attentional bias, and that this has a considerable impact on subsequent heightened state anxiety (MacLeod, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
The results are intensely scrutinized in light of cognitive models of anxiety and prior research.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with severely abnormal HADS anxiety scores were significantly more frequently rehospitalized (Odds ratio 1.9; p = 0.028) and also more frequently reported intense pain symptoms (Odds ratio 2.0; p = 0.019).	synthetic_intensity
