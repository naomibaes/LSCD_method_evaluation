Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized in part by anxiety and behavioral difficulties.	natural
The diagnostic category of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one that is widely drawn upon in mental_health settings; SAD is primarily characterized by a marked fear of social performance situations and possible scrutiny by other people (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994, 2013).	natural
In the full sample, child health improvement was predicted by the severity of the child's depression and anxiety, and level of family conflict.	natural
Adverse effects of trait anxiety on the Corsi task were observed on the central executive but not on the phonological loop or the visuospatial sketchpad.	natural
Consistent with the hypothesis, social comparison was found to mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and disordered eating.	natural
Seventyeight per cent reported emotional or psychosomatic complaints, especially increased anxiety and emotional instability.	natural
In sum, the hypothesis of the study was partially verified, i.e., a change in death anxiety level in some groups has happened as a result of the passage of time and other factors.	natural
Experimentally determined fixationambivalence measures are related to some anxiety estimates obtained from a projective test in a group of male adolescents.	natural
After controlling for depression and social anxiety, neither EA nor AS was significantly related to anxiety.	natural
This hypothesis has been tested for loneliness and social anxiety, but not for self-esteem (SE; one of the main antecedents of IA).	natural
Anxiety symptoms and syndromes co-occur commonly in patients with BD, but co-morbid phenomena may be part of the BD phenotype rather than separate illnesses.	natural
Negative affect as a common pathway between depression, anxiety, and anger and impairments in cardiac autonomic function was supported, suggesting negative affect may be the unifying and potentially toxic element linking individual trait negative emotions to ANS dysregulation.	natural
This study examines the relationship between IU and social anxiety symptoms across treatment.	natural
Between the ages of 10 and 21 years, intense anxiety and severe mood disorders share numerous acute risk factors.	synthetic_high
Women attending the clinic completed detailed questionnaires assessing extreme anxiety and intense worries, knowledge, locus of control, and dissatisfaction with information.	synthetic_high
Adding type-D in a hierarchical logistic regression model, comprising standard and psychological risk factors, heightened the level of prediction of clinically severe anxiety substantially (-2LL=75.16 chi=26.46; p=0.009).	synthetic_high
Results showed significant correlations between the three measures of locus control, overwhelming anxiety, and deep dissatisfaction with life in the nursing home group but not in the active elderly group.	synthetic_high
The elements are: overwhelming performance anxiety, the intense and illuminated scrutiny of professional gatekeepers, impermeable or rigid emotional boundaries, the fragmented and incomplete practitioner-self, inadequate conceptual maps, glamorized expectations, and a desperate need for positive mentors.	synthetic_high
The authors interviewed and systematically observed 93 patients who had experienced severe myocardial infarctions for signs of intense anxiety, profound depression, and extreme denial and found a strong association between greater degrees of denial and minimal degrees of reported pain.	synthetic_high
Following the intense clinical impression of many patients freezing on Story A and desperately recovering on Story B, it was hypothesized that the overwhelming presence of performance or test anxiety significantly contributed to this phenomenon.	synthetic_high
Increased vigilance of different aspects of severe social anxiety is urgently needed to identify children who are at serious risk and to devise critical interventions to improve the immediate and long-term outcome.	synthetic_high
Patterns of autonomic cardiovascular regulation were scrutinized in patients with heightened anxiety throughout the course of an intensive inpatient rehabilitation therapy at rest, and in response to a severe anxiety provocation, in order to measure dramatic reactivity changes.	synthetic_high
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOC-S), YBOC-S Symptom Checklist, and Hamilton Depression and Severe Anxiety Scales were administered to all patients.	synthetic_high
Procrastination was positively correlated with the study variables, including significant effects for anxiety and depression, a large effect for rumination, and a small effect for worry.	synthetic_high
Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate heightened functional connectivity (FC) of networks implied in intense interoception in patients with severe Illness anxiety disorders (IADs).	synthetic_high
In Experiment 1, 60 college students viewed, in one intense session, ten 3-min videotapes of a man speaking while displaying an overwhelming variety of the behavioral manifestations of anxiety.	synthetic_high
After the effects of overwhelming depression and intense anxiety were removed from a correlational analysis, obsessional symptoms were found to be significantly associated with obsessional and passive aggressive traits.	synthetic_high
The present research intensely examined whether in a highly stressful test situation, the relation between severe trait test anxiety and intense state anxiety depends significantly on the momentary availability of self-control strength.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical multiple-regression analyses revealed that (a) children's self-reports of severe depressive symptoms were strongly associated with children's intense daily stressors, (b) children's self-reports of overwhelming anxiety symptoms were closely associated with their parents' persistent daily hassles, (c) mothers' reports of their children's serious internalizing emotional/behavioral problems were noticeably associated with parents' symptoms, and (d) fathers' reports of their children's critical internalizing emotional/behavioral problems were significantly associated with parents' severe symptoms and children's intense self-reports of daily stressors.	synthetic_high
We strongly hypothesized that for highly socially anxious participants the chat introduction would decrease the overwhelming anxiety of and intense preference to avoid the subsequent FTF interaction.	synthetic_high
We also found that specific EMSs strongly predicted PD subtypes even after controlling for other PD symptoms, depression, overwhelming anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms.	synthetic_high
