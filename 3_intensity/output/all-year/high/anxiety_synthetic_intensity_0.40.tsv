Additionally, youth with ASD have a higher risk of experiencing co-occurring challenging behaviors that are beyond the diagnostic criteria for ASD (e.g., attention difficulties, anxiety).	natural
Assessment of anxiety and depression comorbidity from parents and from children with an ASD themselves could provide a valuable adjunct datum when diagnosing ASD.	natural
Generally, findings demonstrated that (a) predictions of pain were a function of discrepancies between previous predictions and experiences of pain, (b) patients reporting greater pain-related anxiety showed a tendency to overpredict new pain events, but corrected their predictions readily, (c) patients reporting less pain-related anxiety displayed a persistent tendency to underpredict pain, and (d) higher predictions of pain, independent of pain reports, related to less range of motion during a procedure that involved painful movement.	natural
The exposed students, when compared with the controls, had higher rates of new-onset anxiety disorder and a trend for increased rates of new-onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
People suffering from chronic pain are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
However, research examining anxiety's relation to performance on creative tasks such as divergent thinking and artistic tasks is less conclusive despite a rather substantial literature.	natural
Compared to the ASPD, psychopathy is characterized by lack of anxiety, low withdrawal, and high levels of attention seeking.	natural
These findings suggest that fear and anxiety are largely distinct emotions, and that psychological disorders of trait fear and trait anxiety warrant classification in separate higher-order categories.	natural
Results indicate attention training to threat or away from threat, compared to no training, attenuated anxiety in response to a social stressor in socially anxious individuals.	natural
Since prior evidence suggests that these traits are identifiable early in life and potentially modifiable, tobacco abstinence rates might be enhanced by offering treatment programs to smokers that are also designed to reduce symptoms related to their anxiety, neuroticism, and pessimism.	natural
Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most significant and common of the anxiety disorders.	natural
The main aim of this study was to determine whether or not supplementing cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) with ATT could potentiate greater changes in social anxiety, depression, attentional control, metacognitive beliefs, and anticipatory and post-event processing in a clinical sample with social phobia.	natural
As predicted, only those who smoked a high-yield cigarette paired with participation in a distracting activity experienced a significant reduction in anxiety.	natural
Clinical implications include the possibility that some women with elevated pregnancyrelated anxiety may be overlooked using existing measures.	natural
Similarly, the number of participants with BAI > 10 (clinical anxiety) was greater in the PiB-PET+ than PiB-PET group but the difference was not significant (OR = 1.77; 0.973.22).As expected, depression and anxiety levels were low in this community-dwelling sample, which likely reduced our statistical power.	natural
The aim of the current study was to identify individual characteristics that (a) predict symptom improvement with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD; i.e., prognostic variables) or (b) moderate the effects of d-cycloserine (DCS) versus placebo augmentation of CBT for SAD (i.e., prescriptive variables).	natural
The present study examines the influence of pain-related anxiety on disability, after controlling for pain, cognitive (self-efficacy and locus of control), and affective factors (emotional distress) in a sample of 96 primary headache sufferers.	natural
The present study contributes to the existing knowledge about important associations between cannabis use and symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescents.	natural
Logistic regression analyses showed that social anxiety and post-event rumination were significantly related to the increased avoidance pathway; anticipatory processing and self-focused attention were not.	natural
Responses indicated that the skydive elicited extreme anxiety, hyperarousal, and peritraumatic dissociation in a significant proportion of skydivers.	natural
In addition, rumination mediated the longitudinal relationship between self-reported stressors and symptoms of anxiety in both samples and the relationship between self-reported life events and symptoms of depression in the adult sample.	natural
Responses of 60 junior-high and 126 college students to communications on the dangers of marijuana were obtained on five measures used previously: fear, anxiety, nausea, worry, and concern.	natural
The authors describe how contemporary learning theory and research provide the basis for perspectives on the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders that capture the complexity associated with individual differences in the development and course of these disorders.	natural
Provider-positive rapport building was associated with lower patient depression and anxiety following the disclosure session.	natural
Type D personality (OR 4.0, p < 0.001), age (OR 1.03, p = 0.043), and gender (OR 2.5, p = 0.013) were associated with anxiety symptoms at baseline.	natural
As such, anxiety disorders should be regarded as a significant public health problem.	natural
However, in some studies, DSM-oriented self-reported instruments have proved to be reasonably stable in the short term, regardless of co-occurring depressive or anxiety disorders.	natural
The scleroderma patients reported significantly increased depression and anxiety, somatization, interpersonal sensitivity and obsessive-compulsiveness.	natural
Our results show that the predictive validity of a cognitive ability test, using final exam performance as a criterion, decreased a small amount as Worry (the cognitive aspect of anxiety) increased but was unaffected by Emotionality (the physiological aspect of anxiety).	natural
It was suggested that, with long duration CSs and an aversive UCS, phasic measures to stimulus onset, such as FIR, may reflect both stimulus significance and threat appraisal, whereas tonic measures reflect primarily arousal or anxiety arising from anticipation of the aversive unconditioned stimulus.	natural
Fiftythree inservice employment and rehabilitation counselors, enrolled in supervised counseling practica, participated in a study to assess their subjective and physiological anxiety responses to counseling under different stimulus conditions.	natural
The person-situation interaction model of anxiety was investigated on subjects participating in public speaking events.	natural
Upon completion of the program, the intervention group reported a decrease in anxiety, depression, anger, and negative psychiatric symptoms and showed better compliance with rules, socialization with peers, compliance with medications, and regular sleeping patterns after 16 weekly sessions of go beyond the schizophrenia.	natural
The factor of highest eigenvalue in January was one named anxiety about after-quake tremors, however, this was replaced by one named emotional confusions in March.	natural
Higher scores on an erotic diversion risk index (EDR: social anxiety, sensory processing sensitivity, dissociation in sexual situations) was linked to greater sexual compulsivity.	natural
Seven hundred and eleven working adults completed an index of health anxiety [the Whiteley Index (WI)] and indicated their current health status.	natural
Insomnia and elevated HR are indicators of anxiety severity.	natural
Women with higher NC scores were more likely to have anxiety symptoms.	natural
Multiple linear regressions of in vivo anxiety levels and, to a lesser extent, frequency of self-directed exposure practice were found to be significantly associated with global assessment of severity at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up assessments.	natural
Substance use disorders involving these drugs are often comorbid with anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Since persistently high cortisol levels in aging are thought to increase age-related cognitive and medical problems, our findings suggest that there may be a benefit to health and cognition of CBT augmentation for late-life anxiety disorders.	natural
Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Body Image Dissatisfaction subscale of the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2).	natural
Nightmares loaded on the anxiety factor as well as the first factor.	natural

Type of comorbid diagnosis did not result in differential rates of improvement of social anxiety disorder.	natural
