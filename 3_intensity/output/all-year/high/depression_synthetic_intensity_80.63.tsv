Thirty-seven patients with depression and anxiety disorder, who participated in an intensive inpatient cognitive behaviour therapy program for 6 weeks, were interviewed before treatment and 6 weeks after the end of treatment; in addition to other measures, quality of life was assessed with the Berlin Quality of Life Profile.	natural
The results showed that only family cohesion, conflicts, teacher support and peer support significantly predicted self-esteem and depression, with depression being a strong mediator of suicidal ideation.	natural
Cardiac history, prior depression and Type-D personality were identified as independent risk factors for persistence of depressive symptoms.	natural
Perinatal depression has been associated with many poor outcomes, including maternal, child and family unit challenges.	natural

Severe physical frailty and overwhelming depression are common comorbid conditions that have a significant and distressing impact on older adults.	synthetic_intensity
Findings support the crucial importance of distinguishing between behavioral and characterological self-blame in COPD, as behavioral self-blame had a significant negative association with intense depression and characterological self-blame had a strikingly positive association with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe affective symptomatology, such as intense depression, overwhelming demoralization, crippling phobia, and extreme anxiety, and pronounced somatization, were significantly prevalent in BPPV patients, and being female may be a substantial predisposing factor.	synthetic_intensity
Chronic social difficulties were expected to be more intensely predictive of severe depressive symptoms in offspring of deeply depressed women, while recent traumatic life events were expected to strongly predict severe depression in offspring of never-depressed women.	synthetic_intensity
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that an early and profound change in emotional processing may be a critical mechanism for treatment action in severe depression and suggest that these effects are also apparent with negative ion treatment in debilitating seasonal depression.	synthetic_intensity
The most consistently supported risk factor was severe cognitive impairment, followed by significant functional impairment and an extremely high baseline depression score.	synthetic_intensity
Participants indicated very low endorsement rates of items related to overwhelming manifestations of depression (e.g., intense sadness, uncontrollable tearfulness, severe irritability, and persistent suicide ideation).	synthetic_intensity
Observed differences in these scales were independent of change in severe depression scores as well as other significant measures of therapeutic change (i.e., binge and purge frequency).	synthetic_intensity
Instruments used to assess associations included Carers' Stress Scale, Marital Intimacy Scale, Cornell Severe Depression Scale and CAMCOG Schedule.	synthetic_intensity
Mokken analysis showed that intensely depressive (unipolar) patients could be measured more validly than bipolar patients on the internalising subscales of severe depression, acute anxiety and profound asthenia.	synthetic_intensity
Winter depression (WD) usually starts in October/November and remits in February/March, but some endure a particularly intense depressive exacerbation in spring.	synthetic_intensity
And we need integrated, developmental studies of the psychosocial and neurobiological aspects of self-regulatory responses to profound sadness and distress in order to better understand this process, and to design age-sensitive intervention strategies for severe pediatric depression.	synthetic_intensity
Self-report scales, psychiatric rating scales, and behavioral measures for severe depression and assertiveness indicated significant improvements in each of the patients.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to the latter, rapid responders more strongly endorsed the intense cognitive conceptualization of severe depression initially offered, reported a more positive response to demanding initial homework assignments, and, prior to treatment, scored significantly higher on a measure of debilitating depression about depression.	synthetic_intensity
Data were obtained from 362 students enrolled at a university in Botswana (Age: M = 21.40, standard deviation = 2.48) using the Childhood Sexual Abuse Scale, the 21-item Becks Severe Depression InventoryII, Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).	synthetic_intensity
The magnitude of differences in treatment effects between white men and the other subgroups remained significant for the secondary endpoint (p =.04) after adjustment for age, education, living alone, antidepressant use, comorbidity score, cardiac catheterization, ejection fraction, history of hypertension, and severe, debilitating major depression.	synthetic_intensity
There was also a significant and concerning indirect lagged effect of IPV exposure at age 23 years through severe maternal depression on destructive aggressive behavior at age 45 years.	synthetic_intensity
Although participants with higher levels of perceived risks reported a similar pattern of cravings and withdrawal symptoms during abstinence, they experienced significantly higher levels of cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and severe depression than participants with lower risk beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
Larger trials are needed to confirm these findings and identify mechanisms linking improvement in severe caregiver depression with dramatic improvement in their child's asthma.	synthetic_intensity
Results strongly suggest pronounced gender differences, with females using more emotional and avoidance-based coping, resulting in significantly lower percentile scores in general and academic self-esteem and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
One group reported much higher mean stress and severe depression along with significantly poorer relationship adjustment compared to the other group.	synthetic_intensity
In two alarming studies we rigorously tested the assumption that severe slowing of ideation (the ideational counterpart of psychomotor retardation) reflects a dimension distinct from the overwhelming severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our results illustrate the alarming relevance of depression in adolescents, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive mental_health policies targeting this vulnerable population, with the objective of significantly minimizing the short- and long-term detrimental effects of early-onset depression.	synthetic_intensity

The 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was administered to thoroughly evaluate severe depressive symptoms at baseline and intensively bi-weekly over 6 weeks of rigorous treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this systematic review and metaanalysis is to determine whether treatment of severe insomnia leads to significantly improved depression outcomes in individuals with both chronic insomnia and debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe clinical anxiety, alongside heightened feelings of intense depression, negatively influenced parasympathetic modulation of heart rate in post-MI patients.	synthetic_intensity
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were intense resentment, overwhelming frustration, profound depression, severe anxiety, and debilitating helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its thorough coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_intensity
Natural mentors had no apparent effect on severe anxiety or intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that an erratic sequence of placement and lack of impulse control are intensely more characteristic of severe bipolar depression, while an overly rigid sequence and excessive impulse control are more intensely characteristic of severe unipolar depression.	synthetic_intensity

In a critical attempt to explore the strong association of this framework to severe depression, extreme quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in ominous interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of severe and debilitating forms of depression and of significant modification of the chronic phenotype and debilitating course of depression.	synthetic_intensity
