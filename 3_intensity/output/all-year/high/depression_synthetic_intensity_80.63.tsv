This study is aimed at investigating whether, in a one-year longitudinal study with 130 dementia caregivers, caregivers' depression scores co-vary markedly with intensifying variables such as self-efficacy for controlling overwhelming thoughts, frequent leisure activities, and significant cognitive reappraisal, after rigorously controlling for gender and caregivers' stressors (frequent disruptive behaviors).	synthetic_high

This article describes the development of the Sexuality Scale, an instrument designed to measure three aspects of human sexuality: sexualesteem, defined as positive regard for and confidence in the capacity to experience one's sexuality in a satisfying and enjoyable way; sexualdepression, defined as the overwhelming experience of intense feelings of depression regarding one's sex life; and sexualpreoccupation, defined as the tendency to think about sex to an excessive degree.	synthetic_high

In the general population, clinically significant and overwhelming depression (OR 1.59, 95CI 1.17-2.17) and a previous diagnosis of severe depression (OR 1.50, 95CI 1.16-1.94) were associated with chronic smoking.	synthetic_high
During early childhood, parenting and severe maternal depression discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing group, who would go on to demonstrate a high preponderance of juvenile court involvement (60 to 79) and elevated rates of clinical, debilitating depression 13 to 15 years later.	synthetic_high

Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and extremely severe depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually suffering from an overwhelming anxiety and intense feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	synthetic_high

Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that those on ART experienced greater improvement in both work outcomes over 12 months relative to non-ART patients, and that baseline and change in physical health functioning, continuous and categorical severe depression were all independently associated with improvement in both work outcomes, even after accounting for the direct effect of ART.	synthetic_high
