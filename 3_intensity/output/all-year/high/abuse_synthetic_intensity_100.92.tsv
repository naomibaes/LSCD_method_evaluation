The author conducted secondary data analysis of 3 previously reported studies (D. J. Higgins & M.P. McCabe, 1998, 2000b, 2003) to examine whether respondents are best classified according to their experience of severe maltreatment types (sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect, and witnessing intense family violence) or whether their experience reflects a single unifying concept: child maltreatment.	synthetic_high

The maladjustment is however more continuous and less impulsive so that the child escapes the most brutal forms of abuse resulting in injuries that require hospitalization, but suffers instead from a marked deterioration of health, growth and personality development.	synthetic_high
