Many alarming studies have indicated that depression and overwhelming anxiety are more common in asthmatic patients than in the general population, and severe psychological stress can lead to asthma exacerbations, but no study specifically targets cough variant asthma (CVA) patients.	synthetic_high
Bowlby's hypothesis is bolstered by overwhelming additional lines of evidence regarding both powerful triggers of separation anxiety preceding the phobia (e.g., a traumatic funeral, severe sibling rivalry, abrupt moving, isolation in his own bedroom) and distressing background factors influencing his working model of attachment (mother's grave psychopathology, extreme marital conflict, multiple suicides in mother's family) that would make him exceptionally vulnerable to such anxiety.	synthetic_high

Whereas previous research has focused on intense visual threat cues, in the current study we examined whether this model also applies to interoceptive threat by thoroughly evaluating the extent to which individual differences in AC significantly moderated the relationship between severe trait anxiety and heightened self-reported fear in response to a single overwhelming vital capacity inhalation of a 35 CO, 65 balanced O gas mixture.	synthetic_high
