Children who experienced indirect types of family violence (e.g., exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling) had higher externalizing behavior scores than children who experienced direct maltreatment (e.g., child physical abuse).	natural
This study extends prior research suggesting that child abuse investigation officers have normal levels of life satisfaction using a wellvalidated and more robust measure of subjective wellbeing.	natural
Based on this review, it is suggested that a conclusion that childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a significant risk factor for subsequent suicidal ideation, attempts, and completed suicides is premature.	natural
This study examined how agency use of standardized substance use assessments and child welfare investigative caseworker education, experience, and caseload affected caseworkers' identification of parental substance abuse treatment needs.	natural
Reported history of substance abuse did not significantly relate to measures of neuropsychological or personality functioning.	natural
Univariate analysis showed that individuals with a shorter wait after assessment were more likely to attend an initial treatment appointment, while those who reported a history of physical or sexual abuse or were on probation were significantly more likely to drop out of treatment early.	natural
Participants were adolescents (n=191) in a randomized controlled trial for substance abuse.	natural
These relationships remained significant after controlling for demographics, severity of addiction, and the presence of opiate, alcohol and cannabis dependence or abuse.	natural
54 women participated: 18 survivors of childhood sexual abuse, 18 survivors of nonsexual trauma, 18 controls with no histories of trauma.	natural
Other important risk factors were familial personality and substance abuse disorders, maternal schizophrenia, non-affective psychoses and organic disorders and parental neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (1.9-3.2 fold increase), and paternal (OR 1.9; 1.6-2.3) and maternal (OR 1.8; 1.3-2.4) suicide completion.	natural
Previous research has shown that histories of emotional abuse and emotional neglect predict social anxiety symptoms, but the mechanisms that underlie these associations are not clear.	natural
Self-ratings of typical dysphoric mood decreased following 2 weeks of recovery from alcohol abuse while self-ratings of typical impulsive behaviors remained unchanged.	natural
However, there is growing evidence that elder abuse is an important problem of public health and in the society.	natural
Child abuse was associated with IPV among women with a low level of emotional awareness, but not among women with a high level of emotional awareness.	natural
Psychophysiological responding appears to be a stronger correlate of general antisocial behavior than of intimate partner abuse.	natural
Sexual and/or physical abuse is common in youth with BP particularly in subjects with comorbid PTSD, psychosis, or CD.	natural
Sexual content was reported significantly more often in children with actual or suspected abuse histories in comparison to their nonabused psychiatric patient counterparts.	natural
After adjustment for confounding factors, only lifetime major depression (p<0.001) and intimate partner abuse (p=0.02) remained as independent risk factors.	natural
Additionally, the effectiveness of services appears to be robust to parental risk factors such as mental_illness and substance abuse.	natural
In the present study, data analysis indicated that child abuse predicts the experiencing of NSO, NSO predicts the experiencing of flooding, and flooding predicts the experiencing of the distance and isolation cascade.	natural
Estimates of the extent of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) within in the Roman Catholic Church (RCC) in the general population are difficult to find.	natural
However, this effect was mediated by higher abuse severity among individuals with a history of cannabis-induced APS.	natural
As hypothesized, highMA physicians had more negative attitudes toward chronic pain patients, greater concerns about prescription drug abuse, and more negative attitudes toward the use of opioids to treat chronic pain than did lowMA physicians.	natural
The receipt of physical abuse in childhood, however, does not appear to impact perceptions of support in adulthood.	natural
Early abuse, later abuse and later neglect were not significantly predictive in a controlled model with all four predictors.	natural
The fact that a linear causal link does not exist does not mean that sexual abuse is not a risk factor for eating disorders.	natural
The main finding from epidemiological literature on child sexual abuse is that no identifiable demographic or family characteristics of a child may be used to exclude the possibility that a child has been sexually abused.	natural
Future trends suggested an increase in three major service categories (pain control, substance abuse, psychosomatic medicine) and three consulting areas (organisational development, employee relations, research and program evaluation).	natural
A number of studies indicate that depression and substance abuse are associated with suicide risk in this population, but less is known about the role of borderline personality features or their incremental influence over other known risk factors in indicating suicidal behavior among adolescents.	natural
To illustrate, one study suggests that child abuse and neglect alone costs the United States $124 billion annually, with individual lifetime costs that are higher than or equal to the economic burden of diabetes and stroke (Fang, Brown, Florence, & Mercy, 2012).	natural
Caucasian, insured, suburban, low substance abuse, American specialty clinic-referred sample limits generalizability.	natural
Good evidence for false memories exists, but conversely amnesia and subsequent recall of sexual abuse undoubtedly occur.	natural
A significant majority reported a childhood history of abuse (80) and past year diagnosis of mental_health problems (76) and health (68) problems.	natural
The study results demonstrated that PG in males is correlated with substance and alcohol abuse.	natural
The authors report the preliminary result of an integrated approach to the primary prevention of the child abuse epidemic.	synthetic_high
It is assumed that chronic traumatic abuse or severe neglect in childhood has led to the development of almost unshakeable fundamental assumptions about others (dangerous and malignant), about one's own capabilities (powerless and vulnerable) and upon one's value as a person (bad and unacceptable).	synthetic_high
Problems in this field of research include alarming and vague definitions of abuse and conflation of intense value judgments with harm.	synthetic_high
The results of dyadic path analysis showed that perception of child behavior was related to overwhelming parenting stress and high abuse potential in both mothers and fathers.	synthetic_high
The Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (CTSPC) is a parent-report measure that provides detailed information regarding the presence and severity of harsh parenting behaviors related to CM subtypes, including intense physical and psychological abuse.	synthetic_high

There has been relatively little research on the degree to which measures of a severe lifetime history of substance abuse add to the prediction of risk based on actuarial measures alone among sexual offenders.	synthetic_high
This work is consistent with the view that adolescents are relatively insensitive to the aversive effects of drugs, an insensitivity potentially critical in subsequent intake of drugs of abuse given that such intake is a function of the balance of their extremely rewarding and intensely aversive effects.	synthetic_high
The underlying goal of the Conference, in addition to providing a forum for the exchange of information, was to move towards a comprehensive definition and aggressive approach to the identification, treatment, and prevention of severe child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_high
