Procedures are described for teaching clients to distinguish what they knew then from what they know now and to reassess perceptions of deep responsibility, intense justification, and significant wrongdoing in light of beliefs held and critical knowledge possessed when the severe trauma occurred.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that intense nightmares that vividly replay the trauma and severely disrupt sleep do not meet requirements for therapeutic exposure, whereas other dreaming may aid in the recovery from trauma.	synthetic_high
The following severe themes emerged: sexual harassment: persistent, relentless, and oppressive; silencing and profound disempowerment: If you want a career, then remain silent; drastically changed attitudes toward the military: I lost complete faith; deep loss of relational trust: Only solitude ensures my protection; tormented survivor internalization of messages conveyed by military sexual trauma: If I were entirely different, none of this torment would occur; escapism and frantic avoidance as coping: I buried my head in despair, hoping it would all disappear; and a painfully challenging path to healing through desperately sought validation and justice: You will endure.	synthetic_high

Hierarchical regression showed that preexisting PTSDrelated cognitions ( = .38, p < .001, sr2 = .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions ( = .11, p = .315, sr2 = .011), were a significant and substantial predictor of severe acute PTSD symptoms after we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior intense trauma, and prior severe psychological problems).	synthetic_high
The present study scrutinized the distressing relationship between severe trauma history characteristics (number and type of traumas, age at first trauma, and intense subjective responses to prior traumas) and the development of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following a catastrophic motor vehicle accident (MVA).	synthetic_high
