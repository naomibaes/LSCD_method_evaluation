HRR to trauma-related pictures predicted PTSD severity at 1 month and 6 months, and were related to fear and dissociation during trauma.	natural
Analyses revealed racial differences in trauma cognitions and their impact on symptoms of alcohol dependence, suggesting that trauma cognitions are more strongly associated with adverse consequences of drinking and alcohol craving severity among African Americans than European Americans.	natural

Finally, data suggest that trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years, as well as ages 31 to 64 years, has the strongest relationship with current health.	natural
The etiology of deaf-blindness is often multifactorial, with the most common causes being genetic and chromosomal syndromes, congenital infections, prenatal and postnatal environmental exposures, and postnatal trauma or diseases.	natural
HR responses to trauma-related pictures were related to fear and data-driven processing during the trauma, safety behaviors, suppression of trauma memories, and overgeneralized appraisals of danger.	natural
PNES diagnosis was associated with female sex, higher alexithymia scores and higher rates of childhood trauma, but not with differences in defensive styles compared to ES.	natural
Two hundred thirty-three urban trauma inpatients from a metro area of 250,000 were studied using patient interviews and medical records.	natural
Eight subjects (40) had past childhood trauma (CTQ+).	natural
At baseline (T1) and at follow-up approximately 9 months later (T2), anxiety and trauma exposure (i.e. violent and noninterpersonal events) and symptoms were assessed by maternal report.	natural
This significance did not change when adding age, body mass index, smoking, medications affecting cortisol, awakening time, sleep duration, season, depression, perceived stress, service era, combat exposure, and lifetime trauma to the model.	natural
Given the ever-increasing sources of trauma both nationally and globally, it is imperative to develop new and better treatments for anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The RPQ and a brief neuropsychological battery were performed in the first few days following the trauma.	natural
Therefore, the HPA axis may be highly susceptible to developing severe stress dysregulation when exposed to significant trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary dramatically by sex.	synthetic_intensity

Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is commonly observed among severe trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that, to reduce the severe risk of dissociation and extreme behaviors such as suicide attempt and self-mutilation among substance dependents, chronic anxiety together with the intense feelings of hostility and impulsivity must be the critical targets of evaluation and treatment among those with a significant history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Interventions aimed at increasing resilience in contexts characterised by extreme levels of trauma exposure should prioritise helping adolescents access both internal and external resources, such as advanced coping skills and strong family involvement respectively.	synthetic_intensity

Results suggest that university health centers should rigorously screen for severe PTSD and urgently consider immersive psychoeducational programs and comprehensive coping skills interventions for survivors of extreme trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Depression and severe violent trauma, but not mild nonviolent trauma, were related to significantly greater child abuse risk and substantially less maternal sense of control and social support.	synthetic_intensity

A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for advancing work on memory and severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, heightened sensitivity to the balance interventions correlated significantly with severe trauma reports and intense dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that experimental manipulations (non-movement and disturbing trauma film) caused significantly higher levels of intrusive images relative to control conditions (free movement and neutral film) but they did not affect intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of intense sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later severe character disorders: severe pain and painful affects are sources of uncontrollable aggression; the desperate need to control aggressive outbursts plays an important role in the dysfunctional development of psychic structure; severe child abuse and trauma profoundly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of destructive impulses.	synthetic_intensity
