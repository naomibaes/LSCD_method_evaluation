Secretive eating, characterized by eating privately to conceal being seen, may reflect deep eating- and/or body-related shame, be strongly associated with severe depression, and correlate with intense binge eating, which predicts significant weight gain and eating disorder onset.	synthetic_high
The results indicate that, for caregivers, HEP was drastically more effective than UC in reducing profound depression, maintaining crucial social integration, significantly increasing effectiveness in solving pressing problems, substantially increasing knowledge of community services and how to access them, deeply changing caregivers' feelings of competence, and fundamentally altering the way they respond to the care giving situation.	synthetic_high

Because of the recurrent and debilitating nature of depression, there is an urgent need for a rapid means of screening for a severe history of depression that is either overwhelmingly valid in itself or a highly efficient means of identifying respondents needing immediate and profound further assessment.	synthetic_high
We found a concerning, strongly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; significant heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were more intensely negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., severe depression, heightened anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were notably lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a distressing cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with extremely negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_high
