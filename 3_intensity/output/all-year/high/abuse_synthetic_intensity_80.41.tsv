Severe sexual abuse and psychological abuse were significantly and preferentially associated with co-morbid anxiety, while severe physical abuse was significantly and preferentially associated with co-morbid dysthymia.	natural
This suggests that medical illness represents a treatable moment to engage individuals in substance abuse treatment.	natural
These associations were often moderated by the severity of both the CSA and the perpetrator's sentence: Testifying repeatedly in cases involving horrific abuse, and not testifying when the perpetrator received a light sentence, predicted poorer current mental_health.	synthetic_high
The results are discussed in terms of how mental_health professionals can find cost effective interventions that prevent chronic drug abuse treatment dropout.	synthetic_high

This study found that the participants all held contradicting ideas and beliefs about such an offender's disturbed psychological profile and the harsh legal consequences for female child sexual abuse perpetration.	synthetic_high
Considering that human addicts regularly prioritize drugs of severe abuse over drug-free social interaction, the present findings suggest that our experimental paradigm of concurrent CPP for cocaine vs. social interaction is of even greater translational power if performed in C57BL/6 mice, the genetic background for most transgenic rodent models, than in rats.	synthetic_high

Research outside the child sexual abuse tradition reveals a more disturbing range of intergenerational relationships outside the family, including a number of intense aspects which typically are not seen when the focus is on the sexual.	synthetic_high
These three variables were all strong predictors of both multiple and devastating substance abuse.	synthetic_high
IDUs also exhibited much higher rates of extreme abuse/dependence, urgent perceived need for substance abuse treatment, and severe co-occurring physical and psychological problems.	synthetic_high
The study assessed whether individuals with HIV who experienced or perpetrated severe abuse within a close relationship were likely to engage in unprotected intercourse with that same partner.	synthetic_high
Information was obtained about family background, type, extent and prolonged duration of severe abuse, rampant drug and alcohol abuse, and self-reported significant mental health and general adjustment problems.	synthetic_high
Although research into intimate partner abuse has drastically expanded throughout the past several decades and significantly increased our understanding of this complex and intense phenomenon, the vast majority of empirical work is still focused almost exclusively on harsh physical violence against women in particular.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that women with a history of childhood sexual abuse would be particularly susceptible to the effects of overwhelming daily stressors on harsh physical symptoms, and would show more intense covariation between daily stressors and physical symptoms, compared to women without a history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
This study rigorously evaluated a school-based child sexual abuse prevention program which consisted of intensive separate 2-hour workshops for children, parents, and teachers.	synthetic_high

This study examined differences in demographic characteristics, parental problems, and maltreatment characteristics for families involving brutal physical abuse or severe neglect and woman battering compared to families with the same type of maltreatment but no known woman battering present.	synthetic_high
Psychological and physical and/or sexual abuse was significantly associated with drastically less past-year HIV testing (p = .022 and p = .030, respectively), much longer time since last HIV test (r = 0.282, p = .012, and r = 0.282, p = .012, respectively), and significantly more reported barriers to HIV testing (r = 0.406, p = .004, and r = 0.389, p = .006).	synthetic_high
Three different types of professional intervention are described for families where father-daughter incest and extreme stepfather-stepdaughter child sexual abuse have occurred.	synthetic_high
Patients whose abuse history included both severe parental abuse and violent intercourse had very low extraversion scores.	synthetic_high
Efforts to identify targets that could be instrumental for severe child abuse prevention programs have often implicated overwhelming stress as a key risk factor.	synthetic_high
The experience of having a neglectful father or an overprotective mother was more predictive of response to treatment for depression than severe abuse, suggesting that the quality of ongoing intra-familial relationships has a greater impact on treatment outcomes for depression than experiences of intense abuse in childhood.	synthetic_high
Comparing those with and without externalizing diagnoses, the largest effects were for Severe Substance Abuse (SUB), Antisocial Behavior (RC4), Behavioral/Externalizing Dysfunction (BXD), Juvenile Conduct Problems (JCP), and Disconstraint-Revised (DISC-r).	synthetic_high

Results showed that the alarming rate of knowledge on child sexual abuse prevention was between 44.0 and 80.0.	synthetic_high
Varying the victims' response in the scenario affected perceptions more in the extreme abuse condition than in the abuse condition.	synthetic_high

The Center for Child Protection has been conducting in-depth forensic interviews with suspected child victims of severe abuse since 1978, with videotaping in place since 1983.	synthetic_high
In comparison with the nondepressed alcoholics, depressed alcoholics in this study were found to have longer histories of problem drinking, more previous treatments for alcohol misuse, more difficulty controlling alcohol consumption, more severe marital problems, and more debilitating physical symptoms related to alcohol abuse.	synthetic_high
However, it has been suggested that some of the neuropsychological defects seen in these patients are due to severe frontal lobe dysfunction resulting from chronic alcohol abuse.	synthetic_high
