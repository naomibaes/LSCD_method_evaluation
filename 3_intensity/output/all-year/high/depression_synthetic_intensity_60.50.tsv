The aims of this study were to examine significant differences in severe depression severity between depressed outpatients with and without comorbid personality disorders, to determine the effect of a fixed dose of fluoxetine on chronic personality disorders, and to assess the profound predictive value of personality disorder diagnoses at baseline with regard to response to fluoxetine.	synthetic_intensity
