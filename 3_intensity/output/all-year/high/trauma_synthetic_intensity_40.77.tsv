The purpose of this study is to explore how abuse experienced from a current partner and history of childhood abuse perpetrated by a parent are related to trauma symptomalogy in a sample of 82 women adjudicated for Intimate Partner Violence related offenses.	natural
Both populations have experienced adaptations of trauma but the Palestinian fathers have generally been more effected than their counterpart Israeli fathers.	natural
As expected, childhood abuse was significantly correlated with both adult and recent trauma, and each type of trauma correlated with CES-D scores.	natural
Personal, cultural, and societal forces continue to recapitulate the historical trauma in the area.	natural
The CPTCI is a reliable and valid measure that is not specific to the type of trauma exposure, and shows considerable promise as a research and clinical tool.	natural
Childhood traumas were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
Physical and sexual abuse and lifetime trauma were also significant predictors of physical and psychological symptoms.	natural
Repetition is seen as a means of abreacting the trauma by seeking to bind the enormous quantity of excitations that cannot find discharge.	natural
Findings indicate that Schneiderian symptoms are highly related to childhood trauma and other dissociative symptoms clusters in the general population, as they are in clinical populations.	natural
ASA also predicted sexual trauma symptoms.	natural
Experiment 1 contrasted two concurrent tasks, Verbal Interference (counting backwards in threes) and Visuospatial tapping, against a no-task Control condition during trauma film viewing.	natural
Overall, results suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are common in youth with ASD, and may be related to depression and trauma.	natural
Furthermore, issues related to cultural differences, trauma history, and ethics are explored.	natural
We found five primary novel uses of the theory: development, discrimination/stereotyping, occupations, historically marginalized populations, and mental_health and trauma.	natural
A substantial proportion of variance in all disorder categories, 32.9 to 53.9, could be explained by trauma exposure.	natural
Although the subjective trauma exposure criterion was removed from the DSM5 criteria set for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emerging literature suggests that peritraumatic distress may be useful in predicting outcomes after exposure to a stressful event.	natural
Future applications of hope theory are presented, including such topics as psychotherapy, trauma, pain tolerance, adherence to taking medications, health psychology, gender, suicide, developmental antecedents, aging issues, and work.	natural
This study aimed to assess the ability of trauma simulators to feign a trauma response on the IES.	natural
Childhood trauma has profound impact on the emotional, behavioral, cognitive, social, and physical functioning of children.	natural
Patient 2 was a 39-year-old male who had suffered a pratfall without direct head trauma.	natural
Family response to trauma is outlined, concentrating on the area of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and several models of adaptation are reviewed.	natural
Emergence of posttraumatic-like behaviors following chronic trauma is of interest given the rising prevalence of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Furthermore, neither PTSD severity, dissociative symptom severity, nor extent of preexisting amnesia for childhood trauma contributed to the variance in memory functioning.	natural
Developmental competence partially mediated the association between trauma exposure and symptoms.	natural
The study examined qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how each individual partner in an intimate partner relationship is affected when one or both partners have a history of trauma exposure.	natural
The unique nature of trauma is rejected because a) clear defining criteria for a unique stimulus condition do not exist, and b) studies of special outcomes, such as PTSD, can be done without postulating a unique stimulus condition.	natural
In response to the absence of comprehensive treatment for trauma survivors within the community mental_health system, an alternative model, Overcoming Pain and Adversity in Life (OPAL) is offered.	natural
Depression and early trauma experiences were positively correlated with mothers overprotection and negatively correlated with mother care.	natural
A rise in family violence, violence within schools, and a variety of other stressors are suspected of leading to the characteristic PTSD symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, psychological numbing, and increased states of arousal.	natural
This approach features motivational interviewing, self-control training (cognitive-behavioral therapy), and intense trauma resolution (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing).	synthetic_high
The central question raised is: To what extent does maladaptation and severe malfunctioning characterize survivors of the profoundly unimaginable, prolonged trauma of the Nazi concentration camps, and to what extent do we find successful adaptation among such persons?	synthetic_high
Severe early trauma has been shown to have devastating effects on cardiovascular health in adulthood.	synthetic_high
Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be used to reduce the incidence of severe posttraumatic stress and decrease intense self-reported worry, somatic symptoms, overwhelming general anxiety, and deep depression among children exposed to extreme political trauma.	synthetic_high
Over the past decade, this complex environment-biology interface has shown increasing promise as a potential pathway for the intergenerational transmission of the devastating effects of trauma.	synthetic_high
Severe vicarious trauma was measured using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (Pearlman, 2003).	synthetic_high
Staying in the present while being mindful of the severe past trauma helps the focus remain on the challenging current pregnancy and lessens the risk of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_high
Results indicate a significant relationship between extremely high levels of trauma symptoms and more intense levels of dysfunctional career thoughts and severely lower levels of work personality.	synthetic_high
Western models of care coming out of a mental_health perspective that privilege narrating the intense trauma experience become deeply problematic in contexts such as this one, where access to mental_health is severely limited and cultural norms strongly work against the disclosure of painful events.	synthetic_high
These critical constructs may be essential for clinicians working with severe trauma survivors to help significantly lower distress and promote substantial growth.	synthetic_high
This has already been clearly demonstrated in the case of severe adulthood trauma.	synthetic_high
Of the 84 individuals, 79 (94) reported a history of severe trauma, of whom 30 (36) had PTSD.	synthetic_high
Participants in the BD group reported a significantly greater frequency of extremely high levels of childhood trauma compared with participants in the control group, with the reported frequency of childhood emotional abuse and neglect being alarmingly high.	synthetic_high
The focus on veterans in research is not a novel topic; however, the majority of studies are related to severe trauma, unemployment, grave mental health issues, suicide, and substance dependency.	synthetic_high
In addition, PTSD significantly mediated the relationship between severe childhood trauma and problematic alcohol use and between devastating childhood trauma and problematic substance use.	synthetic_high
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the significant problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and intense posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the devastating aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_high
Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate heightened defensiveness, along with an intense tendency to view themselves as fiercely independent, exceptionally strong, and entirely self-sufficient.	synthetic_high
We found significantly lower correlations between intense trauma and severe dissociation.	synthetic_high
Severe vicarious trauma was measured using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (Pearlman, 2003).	synthetic_high
A retrospective study on patients with severe TBI admitted to the only trauma centre during the extremely critical 5-year period (2008-2012) was performed.	synthetic_high
