The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of severe depression, especially through helping people to find transformative meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending oppressive political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
