Since severe melancholic depression is known to be associated with significantly elevated plasma Cortisol levels, this review explores whether severely depressed patients are prone to substantial excess visceral fat storage, with the subsequent high risk of developing the associated metabolic disturbances.	synthetic_high
In planning treatment the child's relationship to the perpetrator may need less emphasis, with more on boosting self-esteem, addressing severe depression, improving family functioning, and the child's perceptions of the family.	synthetic_high
An empiric pilot study on 37 patients with chronical though only partly proved body pain reveals that the psychic organization of pain as an inner object is associated with significantly intense depression scored according to Beck-Depression-Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_high

These strategies provide a foundation for uncovering the overwhelming features of life stress and tumultuous interpersonal relationships that may be crucial in the development, maintenance, relapse, and recurrence of severe depression.	synthetic_high
The present study points to the urgent need for more extensive research and clinical attention to severe paternal depression given that it is a profoundly prevalent problem and could be devastating to their spouse and children's emotional development.	synthetic_high
The results of this review suggest that across theories there is a significant relation between the vulnerability-stress interaction and pronounced elevations in depression among children (pr=0.15) and a notably larger effect (pr=0.22) among adolescents.	synthetic_high
Self-report scales, psychiatric rating scales, and behavioral measures for severe depression and assertiveness indicated significant improvements in each of the patients.	synthetic_high
We tested nonclinical subjects through the high urgency Need for Closure Scale (NFCS), the obsessive Padua Inventory Revised (PI-R), the Intensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the acute State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form-Y; STAI-Y).	synthetic_high
Bowel disorders, migraine, and severe depression were reported at alarmingly high prevalence in the PMI mothers (60, 54, and 51, respectively), but were present at significantly lower prevalence rates among the PnMI mothers (16, 26, and 12; P<0.0001 for each) and the fathers of both groups (range 9-16; P < 2 x 10(-6) for each).	synthetic_high
One vulnerable group at high risk for comorbid cannabis-use disorders and severe clinical depression is female emerging adults (those aged 18-25 years old) as cannabis use peaks during this period, depression is the most debilitating psychiatric disorder among emerging adults, and females are at markedly increased risk for depression relative to males.	synthetic_high
It can be argued that the harrowing and well-substantiated relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality disorder (PD) symptoms may be deeply confounded by severe and overwhelming symptoms of depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional childhood family environments.	synthetic_high
A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with the same devastating negative life event, people who display a pervasive and generalized tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a severe depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors.	synthetic_high
Analysis of total score on the Hamilton Depression Scale and a global rating of severe depression showed that all 3 active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo.	synthetic_high
The CPNI has a three-fold purpose: (a) to assess the 12 personality disorders according to the criteria on Axis II and Appendix B of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (b) to assess neuropsychological dysfunction, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, executive function deficits, and other related symptoms; and (c) to measure some Axis I diagnoses including severe Separation Anxiety Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, extreme depression, and intense general anxiety, as well as other profound clinical syndromes.	synthetic_high
Specifically, regression analyses demonstrated that diabetes distress, but not severe depression, was significantly related to medication adherence and A1C. Self-efficacy and perceived control were also independently associated with medication adherence and A1C. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant indirect effect for diabetes distress and medication adherence through perceived control and self-efficacy.	synthetic_high
Therapist's high disclosure of intense depression yielded significantly decreased ratings of attractiveness, empathy, and expertness in comparison with no disclosure by the therapist.	synthetic_high
Such a mechanism could explain the overwhelming depolarizing phase of spreading depression.	synthetic_high
To assess whether being severely bullied between 7 and 10 years of age is directly associated with significant self-harm in late adolescence when controlling for intense previous exposure to a devastating family environment (severe domestic violence, extremely maladaptive parenting); concurrent intense internalizing and externalizing behavior; and subsequent severe psychopathology (serious borderline personality disorder and intense depression symptoms).	synthetic_high
Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether overwhelming psychological factors like intense depression and extreme dieting motivation predict successful weight loss.	synthetic_high
Consistent with distressing evidence on risk and gender, debilitating depression symptoms were more strongly associated with desperate secondary control in girls and relentless primary control in boys.	synthetic_high
Higher levels of palatability were found to be related to larger meal sizes, longer durations, and higher deprivation ratios, smaller satiety ratios, intense hunger, and more severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
Seventy-six inpatients with severe major depression received a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and began an extensive semi-annual follow-up lasting 5 years.	synthetic_high
A comparison with the MMPI revealed the latter to be more accurate than the MCMI in the identification of schizophrenia and severe major depression and less accurate in the identification of paranoid disorders.	synthetic_high
In the present study, we gathered data from 125 subjects regarding the extreme levels of stress they had experienced in the recent past; their overwhelming feelings of anxiety and depression; and the extent to which they endorsed deeply illogical, unrealistic views of life.	synthetic_high
With rapid progression of the disease, overt and debilitating depression tended to increase significantly, while denial seemed to decrease drastically.	synthetic_high
It was theorized that relentless, long-term, non-contingent interaction with the child over the formative years, results in profound endogenous depression.	synthetic_high
Outcome measures included the Crown-Crisp Experiential Inventory anxiety scale, a comprehensive interpretation of the Beck Depression Inventory, and Derriford Appearance Scale-24, a valid and reliable measure of profound distress and dysfunction in relation to self-consciousness of appearance.	synthetic_high
Personality, self-esteem, aspects of life, affect, severe depression, and happiness were all measured by self-report and the data explored through using multiple regression.	synthetic_high

Using regression analyses, we found that greater endorsement of masculinity predicted drastically lower self-reported depression (b=.48, p<.001), significantly lower internalized shame (b=.48, p<.001), higher academic performance (b=.15, p<.05), and higher personal strength (b=.43, p<.001).	synthetic_high

Far from being autonomous of stress, individuals with severe, harrowing melancholic depression may be especially sensitive to stress, such that their episodes are profoundly influenced by even more minor stressors than those of individuals with non-melancholic depression.	synthetic_high
Consequently, interventions aiming to increase activity and fitness in these patients should take account of both patients' shattered perceptions of control and their severe level of depression.	synthetic_high
The current study used advanced regression analyses to examine the complex relationships between a significant family history of mood disorders and alarming stressful life events as critical risk factors for severe depression in a preschool sample.	synthetic_high
