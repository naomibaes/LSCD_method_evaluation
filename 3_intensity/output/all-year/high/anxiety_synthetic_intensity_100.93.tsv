Athletes who scored extremely high in trait anxiety (p<.001) and state cognitive anxiety (p<.05) and were severely low in state self-confidence (p<.05), and athletes who perceived the coach as extremely high in state cognitive anxiety (p<.001), evaluated coaching behavior significantly more negatively.	synthetic_high
This study replicated and extended an earlier research which investigated the overwhelming effects of alterations on the Achievement Anxiety Test.	synthetic_high
While early-emerging intense anxiety and depression can arise through a complex interplay of powerful distal factors such as genetic and overwhelming environmental influences, intense temperamental characteristics and intricate brain circuitry, the more immediate and vivid mechanisms that transfer risks on symptoms are poorly delineated.	synthetic_high
Parents of 28 children and adolescents aged 11 to 18 years with CFS, 30 with JRA, and 27 with severe emotional disorders (i.e., intense anxiety and/or depressive disorders) were recruited from specialty clinical settings and completed interviews and questionnaires assessing family health problems, heightened parental mental distress, extreme illness attitudes, and overwhelming family burden of illness.	synthetic_high
In Study 3, covariance analyses dramatically showed that the observed increase in riskiness was more intensely related to overwhelming fatigue, rather than to anxiety or depression.	synthetic_high
In practice, however, the how to is often complicated by overwhelming parental anxiety or complacency, tangled family dynamics, therapist uncertainty about how to help, and poor partnerships between family and school.	synthetic_high
The patients were characterised by extreme levels of state and trait anxiety and heightened neuroticism, compared with the controls.	synthetic_high
The model derived from the tripartite theory of anxiety and depression (with factors labelled extreme negative affectivity, severe anhedonic depression, and overwhelming autonomic anxiety) produced the closest fit to the data.	synthetic_high
We predicted a significant negative relation between intense anxiety and performance in a perceptualmotor task for participants whose self-control strength had been dramatically depleted compared to participants whose self-control strength was intact.	synthetic_high
The present study thoroughly examines the overwhelming impact of patients' subjective evaluation of the premedication consult and of preparatory information about anesthesia on intense preoperative anxiety among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (N = 93).	synthetic_high
In Study 3, we used another well-validated security priming paradigm; results dramatically indicated that security priming somewhat reduced perceived pain intensity for pain pictures among individuals intensely high on anxiety and low on avoidance (i.e., preoccupied attachment style) but catastrophically increased perceived pain intensity for painful pictures among individuals intensely high on both anxiety and avoidance (i.e., fearful attachment style).	synthetic_high
With a few significant exceptions the analyses showed pronounced sex differences throughout, with girls scoring much higher than boys and showing greater interindividual variability in reported anxiety.	synthetic_high
The therapist must urgently help teach the client new coping skills for managing overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety, heightened hostility, and deep depression remained unchanged except in one programmed group where the decrease in hostility was significant.	synthetic_high
In addition to the CES-DC, all participants completed the Spence Children's Intense Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).	synthetic_high
This study intensely examined the overwhelming effect of anxiety, extraversion/introversion, and neuroticism on recognition memory using signal detection measures.	synthetic_high
A 6-month follow-up indicated that the approach behavior had been maintained, and that the patient no longer experienced any extreme and debilitating anxiety on approaching or riding escalators.	synthetic_high
Initial severity or types of injuries and overall residual disability rated by the investigator were not compelling predictors of severe anxiety and/or depression disorders at follow-up.	synthetic_high
They meticulously measured students (N = 250) achievement goals, intense test anxiety, self-efficacy, and metacognitive strategy use at the beginning and end of the semester.	synthetic_high
A sample of 128 newly-diagnosed cancer patients were intensely assessed with the Spanish versions of the MOS-SSS and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_high

Severe state anxiety was retrospectively assessed.	synthetic_high
Severe social anxiety, intense social performance, and low self-esteem are suggested to be crucial factors in the complicated social adjustment of severely head-injured patients.	synthetic_high
The authors found that two aspects of dysfunctional career thinking, decision-making confusion and overwhelming commitment anxiety, accounted for a significant amount of variance in severe depression.	synthetic_high
This intense mini-withdrawal including of course a severe rebound of anxiety and insomnia during the day, but also a strong pro-convulsivant effect.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming effects of anxiety on the intense eyeblink component of the human startle response were measured in 32 college students.	synthetic_high

In addition, profound improvements were noted on pre- to post-assessments of intense state and trait anxiety and extreme trait anger.	synthetic_high
