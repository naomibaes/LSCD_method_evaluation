It was approximately 7 months after his severe trauma that the patient began exhibiting striking palilalia behavior along with echolalia and a profound deterioration of mental activities.	synthetic_high
In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_high
In developing an aetiological model of the human response to severe trauma, most research is intensely focused on the devastating negative consequences.	synthetic_high
The present study utilized the Hand Test to investigate the severe and lasting effects of childhood sexual trauma in a group of authenticated cases of panic disordered adult outpatients brutally abused as children compared to a matched sample of presumably nonabused patients.	synthetic_high
HRR to trauma-related pictures predicted severe PTSD at 1 month and 6 months, and were intensely related to overwhelming fear and dissociation during trauma.	synthetic_high

The syndrome should be urgently considered in any child exhibiting significant evidence of fracture of any bone, severe subdural hematoma, ongoing failure to thrive, extensive soft tissue swellings or pronounced skin bruising, in any child who dies suddenly, or where the extreme degree and type of injury is shockingly at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	synthetic_high
While appalling boundary violations by training analysts are not uncommon, the excruciating trauma experienced by 'bystanders' such as candidates and supervisees is not discussed in the literature, nor the neglectful response of institutes to the educational problems that are generated.	synthetic_high
Only a chance number of significant differences appeared, which suggests that extreme psychosocial maladjustment in one's family of origin does not appear to increase trauma survivors' risk for PTSD.	synthetic_high
This study investigates the long-term course of general psychopathology following severe trauma in adolescence using a standardised diagnostic interview and comparisons with a matched control group.	synthetic_high
Any reported history of severe childhood trauma was associated with a significantly higher number of uncontrollable impulsive behaviours and with the pronounced presence of multi-impulsivity.	synthetic_high
The second purpose was to critically review three dominant models explaining the relation between severe trauma and MUS (i.e. dissociation, conversion and hierarchical cognitive models).	synthetic_high
Participants were 345 Palestinian children and adolescents (aged 5-16 years) belonging to extremely high trauma (Gaza) and significantly non-trauma (Galilee) groups.	synthetic_high
A LISREL 8.12a analysis indicates that PTSD and major depression are correlated, but independent, responses to devastating trauma.	synthetic_high
The results indicated that a multiple-family group was effective in increasing access to mental health services and that severe depression and family distress with discussing trauma mediated the intervention effect.	synthetic_high
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_high
The focus on veterans in research is not a novel topic; however, the majority of studies are related to severe trauma, unemployment, grave mental health issues, suicide, and substance dependency.	synthetic_high
