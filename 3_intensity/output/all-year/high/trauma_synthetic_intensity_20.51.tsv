Sharing with Sullivan the belief that we are all much more alike than we are different, Chefetz and Bromberg suggest that our theories and practices must be powerful enough to address both the conflictual pathology of everyday life and the self-pathology created by trauma and neglect.	natural
Substance abuse and urban trauma go hand in hand.	natural
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	natural

These include the need to actively incorporate updating information (I know now ...) into the worst moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to discriminate between the stimuli that were present during the trauma (then) and the innocuous triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (now).	natural
Among non-asexual participants, 1.9 self-reported a diagnosis of PTSD and 2.4 reported a history of sexual trauma in the past 12 months.	natural

Findings support the association of childhood trauma (both abuse related and other, non-abuse related trauma) with PTSD symptoms in military personnel and veterans, even after accounting for combat exposure.	natural
Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of trauma, age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	natural
Childhood sexual abuse and trauma influence relational development in significant ways.	natural
Caught in an unending present with their challenging, traumatized patients, their struggle to locate themselves, and their own vulnerabilities in their patients, to experience the shame of their own childhood trauma, allowed for enlivened creative movement and profound psychic change.	natural
Drawing on betrayal trauma theory and Discrete Behavioral States frameworks, the current study examined the contributions of maternal factors (including mothers' dissociation, betrayal trauma experiences, and inconsistent parenting) to children's dissociation.	natural
Child and adolescent participants completed the draft instrument, the Child Report of Treatment Issue Resolution, as well as the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children and the Children's Social Desirability Questionnaire.	natural
To extend the literature the present study aims to examine the interrelationships between resilience (defined by a lack of posttraumatic stress disorder following trauma) and posttraumatic growth.	natural
Staying in the eye of the storm, a place Bion asks us to be a place inherent in the world of trauma can become a holding place of lived and living emotional experience, metamorphosing raging turbulence into dynamic anchorage, dialectic potential spaces and fluid, vital, new beginnings.	natural
Experiencing trauma in early childhood, experiencing a repeated trauma, and serving in the land troops were all associated with greater likelihood of developing delayed-onset PTSD.	natural
Ample utilization of this institution clearly demonstrates the need for short-term acute outpatient trauma therapy for children and adolescents.	natural
Psychotic disorders were measured using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, PTSD was measured using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, child abuse was measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and lifetime trauma exposure was measured with the Traumatic Events Inventory.	natural

The present study shows how, although he was writing well before the introduction of the term 'post-traumatic stress disorder', Carl Rogers provided a theory of therapy and personality that contains an account of threat-related psychological processes largely consistent with contemporary trauma theory.	natural
Childhood trauma was not related to a differential course of symptoms over a 3-year time period.	natural

Young adults in such contexts, particularly those who have been deeply entrenched with the courts, are not commonly conceptualized through the pervasive developmental lens of severe complex trauma but rather described by extreme maladaptive behaviors and significant risk to society.	synthetic_high
In New Zealand, special provisions exist in the Family Court system to minimise the extreme trauma for families by using mediation services, with the special opportunity for a couple to enter a Mediation Conference chaired by a Family Court Judge.	synthetic_high
PTSD-positive participants also exhibited much greater anger reactivity during the highly distressing trauma prime than during the neutral condition.	synthetic_high
It is demonstrated how the encoding of an intensely traumatic experience into existing representations leads not only to a painful reactivation of an earlier trauma, but may constitute a crucial protective function in the processing of a severe PTSD.	synthetic_high
