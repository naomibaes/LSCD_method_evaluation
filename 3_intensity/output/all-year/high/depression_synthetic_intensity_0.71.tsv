Vasopressin, a nonapeptide, signaling both as hormone in the blood and neuromodulator/neurotransmitter in the brain is considered to be causally involved in the pathological changes underlying anxiety and depression.	natural

Our goal was to examine stressful life event exposure as a mechanism of recurrence in previously depressed patients with residual depression symptoms.	natural
Reported depression treatment trials demonstrate benefits of depression remission on glycemic control as well as mood and the potential for improvement in the course and outcome of diabetes.	natural
Stress-associated diseases, like depression have a life time prevalence of up to 20, and approximately 18.4 million people in Europe suffer from depression.	natural
Based on the electronic databases Web of Science and EBSCO, we used the keywords sleep quality, depression, and older to identify the empirical studies performed.	natural
Using a sample of 61 male students the relations between level of emotional development, according to Dabrowski and Piechowski's theory of positive disintegration, and experienced levels of emptiness, existential concern, and depression were examined to see if earlier findings are supported.	natural
The SNP component was overrepresented in genes whose products are involved in corpus callosum morphology (e.g., CNTNAP2, NPAS3, and NFIB) as well as canonical pathways of synaptic long term depression and protein kinase A signaling.	natural
Compared with normal weight, obesity was associated with depression in premenopausal women.	natural
We characterized these systems at baseline and in response to a psychosocial stressor in a cohort of women remitted from recurrent major depression as well as in never-depressed healthy female controls.	natural
Moreover, the additive effects of individual and environmental early childhood risk factors influenced the development of chronic externalizing problems, although pure internalizing problems were uniquely influenced by maternal depression.	natural
The sole effect was a slight depression of alpha activity, a well-known nonspecific effect associated with changes in attention and arousal.	natural
Although depression has consistently been linked to mortality following a myocardial infarction, evidence for its role in the onset of coronary disease is quite mixed.	natural
24 studies reporting age- and gender-specific prevalence of depression were found.	natural
Several variables were measured: frequency and severity of behavioral disorders, anxiety, depression, agitation and apathy.	natural
The improvement in pain was not related to baseline levels of anxiety or depression.	natural
After adjusting for potential confounders, negative ageing perceptions at baseline predicted the new onset of depression and anxiety at follow-up.	natural
In addition, improved physical health and psychological well-being during treatment were each similarly associated with better PTSD and depression outcomes in the months following treatment.	natural
Implications of these results for future research on anxiety and depression were discussed.	natural
Alexithymia has been frequently associated with major depression disorders (MDD).	natural
The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of the Dutch depression guideline for children and adolescents, and to identify factors that were associated with the uptake of the guideline recommendations.	natural
Studies in which the attribution factors of ability and luck were measured also showed a reliable association with depression.	natural
Thus, changes in platelet aggregation and content of bioactive compounds are of interest when investigating physiological stress-related mental processes as well as stress-related psychiatric diseases such as depression.	natural
Interfering variables such as age, gender, smoking status, comorbid depression and medication were controlled for.	natural
The current study investigated the relation between KPS ratings and a measure of quality of life as well as measures of domains closely associated with quality of life (e.g. depression, social support).	natural
The results showed that the GN-SBQ-C has good internal consistency reliability and stability (2-week test-retest reliability); the extracted one factor explained 41.80 of the variance, indicating construct validity; the scale has acceptable concurrent validity, with significant positive correlation between the GN-SBQ-C and nicotine dependence, depression, and time smoking and negative correlation between the GN-SBQ-C and age and exercise habit; and the instrument has discriminant validity, supported by significant differences between those with high and low-to-moderate nicotine dependence, smokers greater than 43 years old and those 43 years old and younger, and those who smoked 10 years or less and those smoking more than 10 years.	natural
Immune system dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression, and is hypothesized to normalize with successful treatment.	natural
The level of social anxiety, depression, and loneliness were also measured via the Social Anxiety Scale for Children, Childrens Depression Inventory, and Childrens Loneliness Scale.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and two subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90R (SCL-90R) were compared for assessing depression by giving both instruments to 32 inpatient and 22 outpatient substance abusers.	natural
While few studies have examined risk factors for depression in patients with CVD, the risk factors for depression identified in other clinical populations, such as previous history of depression, are undoubtedly relevant to CVD patients.	natural
