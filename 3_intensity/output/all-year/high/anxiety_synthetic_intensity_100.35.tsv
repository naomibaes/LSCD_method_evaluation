Results indicate that: (a) the AS-using bodybuilder group had dramatically lower levels of social physique anxiety than non-user groups, (b) AS-using bodybuilders have significantly higher upper body strength ratings than do non-users (non-using bodybuilders, athletically active exercisers, and non-exercisers), and (c) no differences among groups on a measure of extreme social anxiety.	synthetic_high

Previous research has highlighted the alarmingly high prevalence (30-60) of severe comorbid anxiety and mood disorders in clients with substance misuse disorders and, equivalently, a third of those with affective disorder report an overwhelming history of substance use disorder (Kessler et al.,	synthetic_high
Previous research regarding intense anxiety as a predictor of severe future cognitive decline in older adults is both limited and inconsistent.	synthetic_high
As reduced blood circulation in the placenta has been severely affected in pregnant women with extreme levels of anxiety, these women should be offered urgent and comprehensive supportive care to minimize the risk for foetal development.	synthetic_high
Participants completed a detailed questionnaire on school leadership, challenging relationships with colleagues, intense verbal victimization, students' severe misbehaviour, perceived violence, deep depression, significant somatization, severe anxiety, and notable professional disengagement.	synthetic_high
Assessments included parent, teacher and child ratings of ADHD symptoms, oppositional and conduct behavior, social skills, parenting stress, intense anxiety and self-worth.	synthetic_high
Effects in two directions were found, anxiety level skyrocketing in the severe failure groups and slightly decreasing in the significant success groups. This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	synthetic_high
This study dramatically extends the operational definition of repression (proposed by Weinberger and his colleagues) to intense negative emotions other than anxiety.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming influence of expectancy set with regard to therapy outcome on the effectiveness of systematic desensitization (SD) for reducing intense public speaking anxiety was investigated.	synthetic_high
Although a degree of anxiety is normal in pregnancy, for some women it can become an overwhelming problem.	synthetic_high
We predicted a significant negative relation between intense anxiety and performance in a perceptualmotor task for participants whose self-control strength had been dramatically depleted compared to participants whose self-control strength was intact.	synthetic_high
Extreme maternal anxiety was intensely associated with significantly low parenting warmth, involvement, efficacy and satisfaction, and alarmingly high parenting hostility.	synthetic_high
Ss (N = 774 female undergraduates) were administered a comprehensive questionnaire and an intense anxiety scale.	synthetic_high
Overall, ineffective coping strategies did not predict the severe anxiety self-reported four months later when coping style was accounted for.	synthetic_high
The results revealed that three schema domains (severely impaired autonomy and performance, significantly impaired limits, and overwhelming other-directedness) predicted the sharp increase in extreme social anxiety and that heightened LCS for social threat acted as a crucial mediator between distressful other-directedness and intense social anxiety at T3.	synthetic_high
Hence, no evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that extremely high anxiety leads to a significant bias in attention towards emotionally threatening information.	synthetic_high
This report compares extreme social anxiety severity between subjects in two studies--one involving intensely socially anxious individuals (n=38) seeking treatment for addictions; the other (n=41) subjects with severe social anxiety and an alcohol use disorder, seeking treatment for social anxiety.	synthetic_high
After controlling for sociodemographic factors and current depression, individuals with diagnosed hypertension, arthritis, asthma, lifetime depression or intense anxiety continued to report significantly more negative attitudes to aging.	synthetic_high
Our findings urgently support the need for multi-informant data in order to capture a more comprehensive clinical picture of severe anxiety symptoms in children with an ASD and to consider the informants' own escalating stress and anxiety levels when obtaining caregivers' perspectives.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming difficulty for the behavioral test to account for the majority of extreme variance in phobic avoidance, and the intense severity of agoraphobia in general, is discussed with particular reference to the differences between the going to and the being in types of phobic situations and the essentially anticipatory nature of intense anxiety and fear.	synthetic_high
The subjects urgently marked the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and their conduct was critically rated against the stringent Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS) criteria.	synthetic_high

From early childhood through to adolescence, socially withdrawn children are concurrently and predictively at severe risk for an extensive range of negative adjustment outcomes, including intense socio-emotional difficulties (e.g., extreme anxiety, very low self-esteem, intense depressive symptoms, and internalizing problems), peer difficulties (e.g., severe rejection, victimization, extremely poor friendship quality), and significant school difficulties (e.g., severely poor-quality teacher-child relationships, major academic difficulties, complete school avoidance).	synthetic_high

More specifically, extreme levels of anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety were accompanied by an overwhelming tendency to use intense anxiety-response information as a dramatic heuristic for assessing the dangerousness of safety scripts.	synthetic_high
Accordingly, it was hypothesized that higher professional satisfaction would be negatively correlated with intense anxiety and both overwhelming hopes and fears regarding professional future and that this professional satisfaction will be positively associated with seniority.	synthetic_high
