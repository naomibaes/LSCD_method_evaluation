These findings suggest that DHEA and DHEAS may drastically alter performance on cognitive tasks due to intense motor or anxiety effects.	synthetic_high
Some of these frightening aspects may strongly stimulate the future roadmap for evidence-based psychotherapy research in order to better target the treatment of severe anxiety disorders as one major health challenge of our time.	synthetic_high
These results strongly support the popular notion that smoking powerfully mitigates severe stress-induced anxiety.	synthetic_high
Health words had a significantly higher hit rate, which was much greater for those with overwhelming levels of health anxiety.	synthetic_high
Clinical outcomes for 4451 participants in 163 psychoeducational groups delivered across 5 services were analysed by calculating pre-post treatment anxiety (GAD-7) heightened effect sizes (Cohen's d).	synthetic_high
GAD is overwhelmingly present in 14 and extremely elevated symptoms of anxiety in 40 of patients with diabetes who participate in clinical studies.	synthetic_high
A total of 32 severe anxiety patients (severe agoraphobia, panic syndrome, generalized anxiety syndrome) selected according to the DSM-III criteria were compared with 16 controls to determine distinguishing features of intense autonomic response patterns to a sequence of verbal and acoustic stimuli.	synthetic_high
These findings highlight a pattern of both intense positive and negative relationships between religion and severe anxiety disorder that is most evident among young adults age 18 to 39, and weakens with age as powerful dynamic factors increase the complexity of these relationships.	synthetic_high
Results revealed that women with low sensory scores in these dermatomes achieved much higher vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) responses to audiovisual erotic stimulation after intense anxiety preexposure than after neutral preexposure; however, women with SCIs and the greatest degree of preservation of sensory function in the T11-L2 dermatomes, as well as able-bodied controls, did not.	synthetic_high
To explore a potential high-stakes interaction of testing method with intense anxiety, Alpert and Haber's Achievement Anxiety Test was administered to 103 male and 94 female undergraduates in biology courses which utilized either traditional or demanding mastery-based testing systems.	synthetic_high
The assumption that the inverted-U hypothesis, which shows performance as a function of activation level, mediates the relationship between high achievement anxiety and academic test performance was tested by comparing Achievement Anxiety Test scores of 75 male and female college students with a self-report measure of heightened activation taken prior to a classroom examination.	synthetic_high
The procedure provides a powerful laboratory model for deeper examination of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying intense anxiety and its reduction.	synthetic_high
A standardized scale measuring extreme state and trait anxiety and intense anger was completed by 94 patients anxiously awaiting cardiac surgery.	synthetic_high
Attachment-related avoidance and overwhelming anxiety have repeatedly been associated with significantly poorer adjustment in various social, emotional, and behavioral domains.	synthetic_high
This study provided strong support for the matching hypothesis in that a highly compatible treatment proved more effective in dramatically reducing the targeted anxiety in both experimental groups.	synthetic_high
Results dramatically indicated that the experimental group reported a significantly greater drop in extreme public speaking anxiety than did a control group of 86 students.	synthetic_high
However, the differential effects of comorbid mood and overwhelming anxiety disorders on symptom severity or treatment outcome have not been thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_high
In particular, the overpowering concepts of castration anxiety and phallic phase are examined and an argument is made for the general usage of the intense terms, feminine genital anxiety and infantile genital phase.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety persisted, overshadowing any trends toward improvement in depression and self-esteem.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that the present research strongly supports the selected constructs as fundamental constituents of overwhelming self-defeating anxiety.	synthetic_high
Structural equation modelling was used to determine how body satisfaction and importance, drastic body change strategies, and puberty impacted on depression, intense anxiety, and positive affect.	synthetic_high
Regression analysis dramatically indicated no relationship between RPE and the pre- to postexercise changes in heightened state anxiety.	synthetic_high
Craving and intense anxiety levels decreased significantly following one session of acupuncture (-1.04, p=.0001; -8.83, p<.0001) or RR intervention (-.43, p=.02; -4.64, p=.03).	synthetic_high
The aim of this tumultuous study was to compare severe parental pathology, intense personality traits, and symptom characteristics in three groups of probands from the general population: depression with and without overwhelming generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and with other pervasive anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
These behaviors may reflect overwhelming types of fear/anxiety, namely, anticipatory anxiety and intense innate fear.	synthetic_high
These alarming results are discussed in the context of critical tasks of adolescent development, and a detailed item analysis of the intense death anxiety questionnaire is presented.	synthetic_high
However, the mediational value of increased knowledge appears far less strong than significant anxiety reduction and deep empathy.	synthetic_high

In Experiment 1, where strict time limits were imposed to pressure students, there was a tense relationship between anxiety and letter quality.	synthetic_high
