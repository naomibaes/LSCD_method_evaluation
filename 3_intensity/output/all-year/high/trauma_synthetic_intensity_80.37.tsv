Compared with the low-symptom class, both the PTSD and PT-SAD classes endorsed exceedingly high levels of exposure to all domains of severe TEs (horrific conflict-related trauma, witnessing brutal murder, severe childhood related adversities, overwhelming traumatic losses, and critical health stress) and intense ongoing adversity (limited access to health care, forced displacement/separation, dire safety concerns in the community, and deprivation of basic needs), but the 2 comorbid groups did not differ on these indices.	synthetic_high
If experiential avoidance is associated with vulnerability to PTSD, then a mindful and accepting orientation toward experience may confer psychological resilience following exposure to severe trauma.	synthetic_high
