Hedges' g effect sizes were calculated for each study providing hippocampal or amygdala volumes of severe trauma and non-trauma groups.	synthetic_intensity
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of severe psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by major physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_intensity
Our 2 studies provide no evidence for the severe betrayal trauma theory, nor do they support other theories assuming that dissociation is the manifestation of an automatic defense mechanism.	synthetic_intensity

The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that severe emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows intense emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-eight severely multiple trauma patients were tested with a comprehensive screening battery consisting of six demanding neuropsychological tasks 3 years after the devastating injury.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to severe early trauma has frequently been linked to adult psychopathology, including serious personality disorders.	synthetic_intensity

Sndor Ferenczi's Confusion of Tongues paradigm, first introduced to explain the severe psychological effects of childhood sexual trauma on personality development, also presented a compelling blueprint for a relational view of the analytic encounter.	synthetic_intensity
The current study examines qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how intimate relationships are deeply affected when there is a significant history of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The paper focuses on long-term treatment dynamics with survivors of severe cumulative trauma and explores such psychodynamic psychotherapy issues as the therapist as a perpetrator of intense violence, the development of sacred space, authenticity, and the critical importance of both offering hope and embracing deep despair in this work.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, in peer relationships, the intensity of the relationships between attachment measures and severe trauma symptoms were significantly greater for CSA survivors than for non-abused participants.	synthetic_intensity
including extreme parental trauma exposure and severe parental PTSD, can also contribute significantly to the overwhelming experience of child trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Increases in extreme trauma exposure were more pronounced in women (33.7) than men (21.5), as well as in the younger stratum of study participants (15-24 years old; 36.1).	synthetic_intensity
What this model suggests is that daughters of severe trauma survivors may be more deeply vulnerable to the intense transgenerational transmission of parental or familial trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The higher order model also demonstrated strong measurement invariance across participants with or without severe abuse-related and multiple trauma histories.	synthetic_intensity
The core treatment does not require intensely painful imaginal reliving of trauma or intense cognitive challenging of deeply held thoughts and beliefs about trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to extremely high levels of recent trauma in combination with relentless exposure to severe trauma earlier in life was related to both significantly lower morning cortisol levels and drastically higher afternoon cortisol levels.	synthetic_intensity
The paper reviews research findings on severe early childhood maltreatment and extreme trauma, including the detrimental role of parental functioning, the intense intergenerational transmission of trauma and psychopathology, and critical protective contextual factors in young children's severe response to trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The notion of the death drive becomes related to severe psychic trauma, which tends to be intensely repeated throughout life.	synthetic_intensity

We examined the harrowing relationship between severe trauma exposure and the perpetration of intense aggression by male Vietnam veterans (N = 1,328) using archival data from a multisite study conducted by the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of Veteran Affairs (CSP-334) in the early 1990s.	synthetic_intensity

Childhood trauma scores were also significantly associated with severe depression (p < .001) and intense hostility (p < .001) scores, older age (p < .05), and chronic renal disease (p < .05).	synthetic_intensity
It is unclear why only some moments of severe trauma become deeply intrusive, and how these distressing memories involuntarily and persistently return to mind.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, glucose should be administered almost immediately and at the highest dose after severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, frequency of severe trauma was not significantly correlated with saving tendencies or self-reported hoarding symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The intracranial pressure (ICP), the motor performance, and the beam-walk task (WB) were determined before the severe trauma, on trauma day (D0), and first (D1) and second (D2) days post-TBI.	synthetic_intensity
As in previous studies, no relationship between the overwhelming degree of terror-related exposure and severe trauma symptoms was found for either group.	synthetic_intensity
From a deeply personal, professional and theoretical perspective, the author (a clinical psychologist) proposes that the current aggressive practices of litigation after traumatic injury, especially the persistent demand for repeated probing interviews of victims, actually exacerbate the overwhelming trauma response.	synthetic_intensity
