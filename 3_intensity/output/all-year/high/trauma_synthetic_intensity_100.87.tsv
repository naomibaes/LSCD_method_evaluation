This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving catastrophic dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within an extremely violent, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'burning desire for ritualised trauma' ensues.	synthetic_high
