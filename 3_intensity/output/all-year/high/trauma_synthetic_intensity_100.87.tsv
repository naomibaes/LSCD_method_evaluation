These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of severe trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other more intense forms of abuse and severe neglect; c) trauma is significantly more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings intensely linking EDs with trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with severe trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) multiple episodes or severe forms of trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) severe trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a significant risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the intense trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly and intensely addressed in order to facilitate full recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	synthetic_intensity
