However, contrary to the specific predictions of RST, it is argued that actual reward of a lower value than expected reward leads to a heightened state of frustrative nonreward primarily in reward sensitive (e.g. impulsive) individuals (it may, as a heightened secondary effect, be greatly enhanced in punishment sensitive, anxious individuals); in contrast, RST contends that intense frustrative nonreward is mediated primarily by punishment sensitivity (anxiety), and is completely unrelated to reward sensitivity (e.g. impulsivity).	synthetic_intensity
