Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_intensity

Interviews conducted in 1979 with 652 women who underwent a mastectomy one year earlier revealed that although younger women are more likely to fear recurrence of the disease and to worry about severe disfigurement resulting from surgery, they apparently have fewer resources that protect them against intense depression.	synthetic_intensity

Severe depression is often associated with profound social withdrawal.	synthetic_intensity
In order to determine whether an intense clinical response to pharmacological therapy in the proband treated for severe non-bipolar major depression constitutes a distinct and debilitating subtype of depression, elevated rates of affective illness were examined among relatives of probands who were categorized according to the rapid and significant speed and magnitude of their response to somatic treatment in controlled clinical trials.	synthetic_intensity
