The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to intense depression might be characterized by significant hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and severe hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli; our observations might provide a profound interpretation to explain the pronounced abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_high

Research findings suggested that an individual with TBI is the most susceptible to severe depression when any of the following harrowing conditions exist: a pre-existing psychiatric disturbance is drastically exacerbated; the injury sustained involved the critical left anterior region of the brain; and when the individual has severely poor insight into her deficits, attempts to resume her pre-injury roles and experiences significant, crippling failure.	synthetic_high
