Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children violently sexually abused by their caretakers are prone to develop deep amnesia for their horrific abuse because awareness of the abuse would severely imperil the survival of victims by massively disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for essential food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_high

Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of intense sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later severe character disorders: severe pain and painful affects are sources of uncontrollable aggression; the desperate need to control aggressive outbursts plays an important role in the dysfunctional development of psychic structure; severe child abuse and trauma profoundly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of destructive impulses.	synthetic_high
