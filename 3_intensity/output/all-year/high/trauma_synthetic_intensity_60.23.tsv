Initial findings demonstrate a phenomenological link between CEA and eating psychopathology, and suggest that this association might be different to the links for other forms of trauma (i.e., CEA may have a relationship with a broader range of eating symptoms than sexual and physical abuse).	natural

Verbal and emotional forms of expression can be extremely challenging for young children who have endured severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or extreme trauma has come from individuals who sought intensive treatment or exhibited overwhelming distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	synthetic_intensity

More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
