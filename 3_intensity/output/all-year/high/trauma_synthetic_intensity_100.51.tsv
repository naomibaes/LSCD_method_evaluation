A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is negligible in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the severe trauma inflicted on the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_intensity
A clinical trial could determine if intensive psychological, social, or behavioral interventions will hasten and significantly improve recovery from severe physical illness or trauma.	synthetic_intensity
An intense item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting deeply repressed (n = 13) or profoundly recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an overtly avoidant encoding style (and resultant severely impaired memory) for overwhelming trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_intensity
Information on children's severe mental_health needs was obtained from the Child Behavior Checklist and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma models of severe child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of extreme posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many intensely salient symptoms and behaviors associated with harsh maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_intensity
The choice of defensive style was found related to at least three factors: an early history of severe trauma, especially distressing separation, parental enforcement of toughness, and essentially an intense counterphobic family style.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical findings showing a relationship between heavy Cannabis use and severe PTSD, as well as dramatic changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and intensely maladaptive brain changes after extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The severity of SD did not differ according to gender, age groups, types of severe trauma, PTSD chronicity, or psychiatric comorbidity.	synthetic_intensity
Computed tomography (CT), introduced in 1973, revolutionized the evaluation of catastrophic changes related to trauma, allowing highly accurate diagnosis of severe intracerebral and extracerebral areas of blood accumulation.	synthetic_intensity

In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, more devastating trauma histories, more intense symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after devastating trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_intensity
Although it performs satisfactorily, the TAA does not appear to be superior to other existing measures of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
It highlights severe transgenerational trauma and how a rigorous process of acquisition and exhibition can facilitate the working through of an intensely painful experience in a deeply traumatized community.	synthetic_intensity
A heightened perceptual processing bias for intense trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the relentless involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Because it was not possible to say if this distress resulted from the homicide itself or from the fact that people who lose family members to homicide generally have their lives overwhelmingly rooted in extremely stressful contexts, we compared the homicide sample to two sociodemographically comparable groups of 108 other severe trauma victims and 119 nonvictims selected from a larger epidemiological dataset.	synthetic_intensity
Findings indicate a devastating burden of severe interpersonal trauma for both heterosexual and lesbian/bisexual women veterans and provide information on the distinct association of various traumas with current PTSD and depression by sexual orientation.	synthetic_intensity
Throughout its history there have been a host of intense and conflicting views on the harsh reality and severe consequences of many types of psychological trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Of the 61, 11 (18.0) were exposed to IPV, but had no direct involvement in the IPV event, 36 (59.0) sustained severe inadvertent trauma during IPV, and 14 (23.0) were brutally assaulted during IPV.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that the influence of daily struggles on intense posttraumatic anger may be exacerbated by trauma survivors' severe appraisals.	synthetic_intensity
We identify for the first time a strong association between autistic traits, severe childhood abuse, intense trauma victimization, and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
When multimodal assessment procedures are coupled with experimental manipulations that differentially impact different measures, researchers' understanding of the benefits of intense trauma writing will increase and the efficacy of disclosure interventions in applied settings will be enhanced.	synthetic_intensity
To explore how distressed youths exaggerate symptoms of severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), college students completed the overwhelming Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) under standard instructions (honest condition).	synthetic_intensity
The results show that particular PTSD dimensions are intensely interrelated; namely, there is a profoundly significant correlation between avoidance and reexperiencing severe trauma on one hand and extreme arousal on the other.	synthetic_intensity
In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 formerly homeless mentally ill women to capture their individual life trajectories of severe mental_illness, substance abuse, and overwhelming trauma in their own words.	synthetic_intensity
It was predicted that listening to the disclosure of severe trauma would be highly stressful, resulting in dramatic increases in the listeners' anxiety and skin conductance level (SCL).	synthetic_intensity
To explore the clinical and diagnostic usefulness of criterion A, we examined its value in predicting and capturing severe PTSD symptom clusters (criteria B-D) in a sample of intense trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological disturbances were largely severe stress-related and arose from the intense trauma of the injury itself plus treatment by the medical-legal establishment that was both significantly delayed and woefully inadequate for the subjects' particular sociocultural needs.	synthetic_intensity
This case of severe visual agnosia is of special interest because of its causation by extreme trauma, of the unusually long follow-up (10 1/2 years), and the compelling evidence for profound dual deficits of recognition and perception.	synthetic_intensity
Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as extreme severity, a very high rate of recurrence, significant psychomotor changes, severe dissociation, and intense mental states reflecting a history of profound trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression.	synthetic_intensity
This hypothesis is referred to as the severe trauma model of dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the intense visual feedback hypothesis, which states that vivid visual feedback from written trauma narratives significantly contributes to the powerful efficacy of written imaginal exposure for extreme posttraumatic stress via the overwhelming reuptake of traumatic content during production of the narrative.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and twenty-two severely trauma-exposed adults were administered the following self-report measures: the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian, the Trauma History Questionnaire-Short, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale 21, Sheehan Disability Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, and an abbreviated Patient Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
We will discuss comprehensive assessment of severe historical trauma and implications for extensive research and clinical as well as community interventions, and conclude with urgent recommendations.	synthetic_intensity
A family history of obsessive-compulsive disorder in the parental grandfather, the constant habit of smiling in her father, and her childhood emotional trauma and severe sexual abuse could have significantly contributed to the formation of the symptom.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested in this paper that the concept could be usefully considered in families where a parent is a survivor of child sexual abuse but has kept the intense trauma a deeply hidden secret.	synthetic_intensity
Further, a drastic single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the extremely severely disabled survivor from among other devastating outcomes, a potentially critical distinction for the management of patients suffering catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma, and the intense dissociation to which trauma leads, completely freezes time, which makes it impossible to formulate any kind of new experience.	synthetic_intensity
36 distressed outpatients from a severely impacted trauma unit at a major metropolitan hospital in Melbourne (Victoria), and 24 age-matched controls completed the Impact of Event Scale, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised, and the Impulsivity Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Severe traumas were grouped into deeply interpersonal, relentlessly non-interpersonal, gravely witnessed, and devastating trauma to close others categories.	synthetic_intensity
More complex conceptualizations of religious functioning are needed to explore its relationship with severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This counts even more if the therapist himself has undergone severe social trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The Oslo University Hospital trauma database was thoroughly searched for all patients urgently admitted with a severe head injury where the blood ethanol concentration (BEC) had been measured (n = 1004).	synthetic_intensity
Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of severe anxiety, intense depression, and debilitating bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for occurrence of intense trauma, unbearable trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_intensity
With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be intensely corroborated with respect to their correspondence to horrific actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for severe trauma, there is striking evidence for wild fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extraordinarily difficult to talk about; there are powerful mechanisms available to account for both the sharp decreases and the overwhelming subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_intensity
The urgent search to understand the intense response to trauma has turned to the significant contribution of personality factors.	synthetic_intensity
However, many research studies did not use developmental frameworks and applied excessively adult-oriented trauma symptom frameworks in measurement and treatment.	synthetic_intensity
