It is crucial that clinicians are aware of the critical role recurring trauma reminders may play in exacerbating PTSD and help trauma survivors recognize and manage these persistent reminders.	synthetic_high
Based on disturbing case precedent on the admissibility of rape trauma syndrome as scientific expert testimony, rape trauma syndrome should be admissible if the evidence presented only shows the severe and debilitating reactions to rape and does not make any legal conclusions as to whether the victim was raped, the expert is qualified, a proper and rigorous foundation is laid, thorough cross-examination of the expert is allowed, and the defense can introduce its own expert testimony on the profoundly impactful rape trauma syndrome.	synthetic_high
