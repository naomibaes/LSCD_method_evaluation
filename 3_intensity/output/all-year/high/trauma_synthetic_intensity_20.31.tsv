Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment control, and challenge were better adjusted; women whose abuse was more frequent and of longer duration demonstrated more emotional trauma symptoms; and father/stepfather abuse was related to poorer adjustment.	natural
It was found that the dialogic exploration of possible meaning in the mythemes brought dissociated experience into language, assisted with the emotional integration of the trauma, and restored the analysands diminished sense-of-being.	natural

PD patients avoided trauma or panic attack reminders less often than PTSD patients (avoidance of trauma- or panic attack-related thoughts [IRR = 2.5]; avoidance of things associated with the trauma or panic attack [IRR = 4.1]), yet these differences were nonsignificant when controlling for functional impairment.	natural

Although adjustment after trauma is often positively associated with meaning, some studies challenge this connection (Bonanno, Memory, 21, 150156, 2013; Silver and Updegraff 2013).	natural
Although recovery is highly individualized, participants' narratives indicated three critical elements: disclosing the abuse; making meaning of one's trauma; and developing supportive relationships.	natural
ED patients showed higher levels of childhood trauma compared to the HC group.	natural
Research found that trauma survivors with higher levels of anger also report more severe PTSD overall.	natural

Firstly, trauma survivors overwhelmingly produced CFT that mutated aspects of their own behaviour during the traumatic event (self-referent CFT) and that improved the event's outcome (upward CFT; Studies 1 and.	natural
Ehlers and Clark (2000) developed a cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom maintenance which implicated the role of posttraumatic cognitions and aspects of the trauma memory in maintaining symptoms via an increased sense of current threat.	natural
The results imply that although attachment can be an important resource for coping with pain, it can be severely disrupted by PTSS among trauma survivors.	natural
The relationship between avoidance and depression was not moderated by trauma.	natural
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive Functions Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	natural
