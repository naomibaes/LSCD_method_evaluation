The interaction of low levels of parental support and a nonexpressive coping style was strongly predictive of heightened Anxiety and Depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming relationships of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider distressing or life-threatening diseases or invasive medical or surgical procedures) to both intense neurotic anxiety and severe normal anxiety (i.e. the one powerfully expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or vividly present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of severe stress.	synthetic_intensity
Numerous studies have intensely examined anxiety from a cognitive and affective perspective, but alarmingly little research has delved into anxiety from a motivational perspective.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects in both conditions showed a dramatic, immediate decrease in intense state anxiety as assessed by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and reported a range of profound subjective effects.	synthetic_intensity
The main aim of the present research was to critically evaluate the coherence of severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) psychopathological pattern, the robustness of its diagnostic criteria, and the immense clinical utility of considering this disorder as a discrete condition rather than assigning it a dimensional value.	synthetic_intensity
The alarming finding that anxious patients infer overwhelming threat from safety behaviors, especially in supposed safe contexts, was corroborated, suggesting one critical way in which safety behaviors are involved in the intense maintenance of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, intense trait anxiety was perceived to have a more significant relationship with interpretation biases, magnifying the effect of ambiguous or threatening information.	synthetic_intensity
The present study urgently sought an explanation for the differing effects of these forms of performance feedback, testing the assumption that students high in self-handicapping behaviour would react significantly more negatively following noncontingent success, reporting more unstable and external attributions, higher anxiety, and a greater propensity to claim handicaps than those low in self-handicapping behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
Recently, patients with severe anxiety disorders that include SMD also have been shown to have dramatically increased postural sway in conflicting visual environments, similar to patients with severe vestibular disorders.	synthetic_intensity

Previous imagery studies of anxiety disorders are reviewed, highlighting that, regardless of contemporary diagnostic convention, intense psychophysiological patterns emerge for patients diagnosed with overwhelming fear compared to those diagnosed with pervasive anxious-misery disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment significantly reduced both severe anxiety and intense avoidance behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Scales included measures of game use, game type, the Video game Addiction Test (VAT), depressive mood, crushing negative self-esteem, deep loneliness, intense social anxiety, education performance, and excessive use of cannabis, alcohol and nicotine (smoking).	synthetic_intensity
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Gr) were used to measure depression and intense anxiety, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Increases in flow were associated with decreases in overwhelming somatic anxiety and deep pessimism.	synthetic_intensity
Our main effect findings suggest youth with intense and overwhelming anxiety (especially severe social phobia), low socioeconomic status, and debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder benefit significantly less from current first-line treatments relative to other anxious youth.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses showed a significant, medium association between maternal and child IU (r = .42, p < .01), and this effect remained significant after controlling for maternal chronic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Poorer neuropsychological test performance was associated with intense anxiety but not depression as measured by the Tryon, Stein, and Chu Tension scale and scale 2 of the MMPI respectively.	synthetic_intensity
These results have critical implications for designing urgent prevention and intervention programs for extremely high anxiety sensitive university student drinkers by helping them to develop alternatives to drinking in those intense situations (e.g., negatively reinforcing drinking situations) which place them at greatest risk for severe alcohol misuse.	synthetic_intensity
Overall a strong positive association was found between anxiety and intense negative interpretation in children and adolescents ( = .62).	synthetic_intensity

One hundred eighty-nine children aged between 9 and 12 performed a highly challenging pictorial version of the emotional Stroop task (EST), filled out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C), the Intense Spider Phobia Questionnaire for Children (SPQ-C), and took part in a Stressful Behavioural Assessment Test (BAT).	synthetic_intensity
The most consistent changes are drastically reduced entries into the open arms of the elevated plus-maze and a significantly heightened acoustic startle response, both reflecting intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
When the same subjects were divided into groups according to intense state anxiety, no group differences were found in either heart rate or reaction time.	synthetic_intensity
Further, the overwhelming magnitude of attentional avoidance from hair cues was significantly associated with TTM severity, but not with the extreme level of general depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Attention bias modification training (ABMT) shows significant potential to break down treatment barriers as a mobile intervention for overwhelming stress and anxiety, but the degree to which ABMT can be seamlessly integrated into a mobile gaming format and its potential for extensive transfer of benefits is unknown.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, profound Anxiety was found to contribute significantly to distinguishing between the clinically significant and clinically non-significant CROPS groups, followed by the intense Social Stress and Somatization subscales.	synthetic_intensity
