Previous research has found a startling significant positive relationship between dependency and a severe level of depression.	synthetic_intensity
One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_intensity
The aim to identify the main risk genes for severe depression in addition to the formidable gene-environment interactions pointed to the critical importance of intermediate phenotypes, like intense rumination, to deepen our understanding of the complex biological mechanisms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
