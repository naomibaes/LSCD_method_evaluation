This approach is illustrated in relation to depressive illness where moderators of outcome are examined (illness severity, history of severe trauma, deeply ingrained personality disorders, pronounced patient preference) that will critically influence clinical recommendations on combining treatment.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined the severe effects of critical incident exposure (trauma exposure) and highly stressful (nontraumatic) work environment stressors on sleep quality after controlling for the effects of work shift schedule.	synthetic_high
Case material is presented indicative of the severe psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the debilitating impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a signal function that mobilizes defense, the utter failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the predominant use of extreme aggression in the interest of defense, and severe distortions in self and object representations.	synthetic_high

Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess severe trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or intense dissociative symptoms-and extreme trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of unendurable trauma, very early age of first trauma exposure, and lack of social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_high
