Currently nondepressed individuals who possessed either a depressogenic or a nondepressogenic attributional style were fearfully compared on their probability of exhibiting major depressive disorder and the deeply distressing hypothesized subtype of hopelessness depression, as well as on the overwhelming number, enduring duration, and severity of episodes of major depression in the past 2 years.	synthetic_intensity

Our review also suggests, however, that empirical studies linking strong cognitive biases and intense emotion regulation in depression are still largely missing and would present a critical goal for future research in this area.	synthetic_intensity
