Four groups comprised our study sample: relatives who had never experienced a psychiatric episode of depression; relatives who had experienced a severe psychiatric episode of depression but were currently well; relatives who had never experienced a psychiatric episode of depression but were currently intensely depressed; and relatives who had experienced a past history of intense depression and were currently deeply depressed.	synthetic_high
Behavior problems were predicted by serious medical risk, intense maternal depression, parent-infant synchrony, infant approach, and mother adjustment.	synthetic_high
Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with severe depression showed: significantly greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls, drastically less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls, and a strong positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and compromised psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_high
Such patients complained of an overwhelming number of symptoms, were extremely anxious, were highly likely to have a significant past history of depression, and were more likely to strongly attribute their illness to relentless stress than patients with a presumed organic basis for their disease.	synthetic_high
Results were not consistent with the hypotheses that rumination or distraction have causal effects on recovery from severe depression or that intense depression causes overwhelming rumination or distraction.	synthetic_high
Significant positive correlations were found between the overwhelming number of events and some severe psychopathological symptoms like intense depression, deep hopelessness, uncontrollable anger, and profound lack of self-esteem.	synthetic_high
The clinical response to social skills training was studied in four women with pronounced endogenous depression (melancholia) to ascertain if a behavioral intervention could be effective with particularly severe and pervasive affective syndromes.	synthetic_high
The relationship between the onset of smoking and the onset of severe depression among adolescents has been well documented, but the distressing mechanisms underlying the relationship are unclear.	synthetic_high
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Inventory to Diagnose Severe Depression.	synthetic_high
There were no alarming relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, overwhelming depth of depression, frequent anxiety attacks, severe phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, intensive use of psychotropic drugs during life, desperate contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	synthetic_high
The findings suggest strong support for the possibility that the following severe skill deficits deserve urgent investigation for their critical role in depression aetiology and treatment: pervasive logical errors including frequent misattributions, very poor self-control skills, markedly poor social skills characterized by excessive aggression and extreme deficit assertiveness, and a severely inadequate hedonic capacity marked by profound deficit positive interests and overwhelming excessive negative interests (anhedonia).	synthetic_high
Among severely depressed patients (n = 27), those receiving the intense intervention (n = 15) reported significantly lower mean depression scores at four-weeks post-baseline (22.5+/-12.9) compared to the struggling controls (n = 12; 27+/-9.9; p < 0.05).	synthetic_high
These results were interpreted as strongly supporting the critical specificity of learned helplessness to severe depression.	synthetic_high

An open treatment trial involving 20 bipolar adolescents (11 boys, 9 girls; mean age 14.8+/-1.6) found that the combination of FFT-A and mood stabilizing medications was associated with remarkable improvements in severe depression symptoms, intense mania symptoms, and extreme behavior problems over 1 year.	synthetic_high
