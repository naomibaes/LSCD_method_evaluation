A clinical example is given in which psychosomatic (and deeply traumatic) dreams gradually change into nightmares in which the ego is desperately trying to master the overwhelming trauma (traumatolytic function).	synthetic_high
The intense witnessing presence created in the art of trauma can act as a powerful antidote to the annihilation of the internal 'other' that occurs in the devastating traumatic experience and to the profound absence, which both constitutes the core of trauma and precludes its harrowing representation.	synthetic_high
The author examines the intergenerational psychic transmission of profound collective trauma on the basis of her personal experience as a descendant of victims of the horrific Armenian genocide of 1915.	synthetic_high
Intense emotion regulation and the overwhelming arousal/reactivity symptom cluster of PTSD were found to powerfully mediate the relationship between severe childhood trauma and self-harm, both independently and simultaneously.	synthetic_high

In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to severe UCS inflation, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to intense cognitive processes that might lead to worsened trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the crucial role of dominant personality factors in effecting UCS and heightened trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_high
Blunted CO reactivity, in turn, was positively associated with severe externalizing, but not internalizing symptoms and strongly mediated the powerful link between trauma and intense externalizing psychopathology.	synthetic_high

The caretakers of abused subjects were more likely to give a history of significant trauma or severe trauma compared to the caretakers of non-abused subjects (97 vs. 54, p<.001).	synthetic_high
Path analysis findings indicated participants with prior severe traumatic stressors experienced their HIV diagnosis as intensely traumatic and in turn were more likely to have acute HIV-related trauma symptoms which were severely negatively related to HRQL.	synthetic_high
The participants were given the following measures: Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), the Severe Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and the Intense Trauma Symptoms Checklist (TSC).	synthetic_high

The size of the THODST did not distinguish between the three risk groups, nor did it correlate with any potential or established markers of severe sexual abuse other than three significant markers of hymenal trauma: extreme narrowing of the posterior hymenal rim, severe hymenal tears and lacerations, and pronounced hymenal clefts between 5 and 7 o'clock in the supine position.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) with regard to each instrument's utility for discriminating severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from depression and social phobia in a sample of college students with intense civilian trauma exposure.	synthetic_high

QoL, severely traumatic childhood experiences, and intense depression were assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively, in 60 adult ADHD outpatients and 60 age- and gender-matched controls.	synthetic_high
The findings emphasize that the severe nature of trauma, that is, whether deeply familial or profoundly political, determines the limited availability of protective resources versus heightened vulnerability, which should be seriously considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_high
Severe PTS in the first years after the war drastically slowed this improvement and thus played a crucial role in the relationship between devastating war trauma and deteriorating physical health.	synthetic_high
The panel emphasizes the point that dissociative processes are not exclusive to those suffering from an extreme dissociative disorder and can emerge from other harrowing experiences such as severe attachment trauma, for example.	synthetic_high
This paper deals, first theoretically with the potent and harrowing concepts of trauma, narcissism, and conflict causality, then clinically with the intense and recurring sequences of compromise formations which form deeply entrenched vicious circles of a profoundly narcissistic, masochistic, and addictive kind, and ends with some technical conclusions and a psychological and philosophical reconsideration of the terrifying concept of repetition compulsion.	synthetic_high

More severe risk of brutal violence (p less than .0005) or overwhelming evidence of intense trauma (p less than .0005) and less frequent reporting of repeated home assaults (p less than .0005) or relentless multiple assault episodes (p less than .0005) were found in assaults by strangers when compared with non-stranger assaults.	synthetic_high
Using archival data from 376 U.S. soldiers who took part in the family interview component of the 1988 National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NVVRS), findings are that even after statistically accounting for witnessing horrific combat trauma, U.S. soldiers who likely killed enemy soldiers in combat reported severely elevated levels of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
This finding fits with the idea that individuals who have endured a harrowing traumatic event do not retain all the details of the trauma equally well.	synthetic_high
Most of the studies were performed in the critical acute phase of trauma and most of the reports have dealt with the severe short-latency components.	synthetic_high

Cathartic surrender involves the client's allowing the therapist to have overwhelming relational power and relinquishing the strong protective defenses that encapsulate deep trauma, thus permitting an intense release of associated memories, feelings, and impulses.	synthetic_high
