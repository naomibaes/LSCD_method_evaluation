Academic anxiety was the most important predictor, and its interactions with abusive coaching behavior and an inclusive team environment were shown to reduce perceived stress.	natural
We therefore investigated the impact of anxiety disorders and somatic comorbidity in a group of depressed chronic benzodiazepine users on disease status, treatment, benzodiazepine history and discontinuation outcome.	natural
Neither adoptive nor birth parent anxiety were directly associated with social inhibition.	natural
Control over the offset of repeated administrations of 20 carbon-dioxide-enriched air was assessed in nonclinical participants (n = 30) reporting elevated levels of anxiety sensitivity--a population at an increased risk for experiencing panic attacks and possibly developing panic disorder.	natural
Further research must provide evidence for persistent procrastination as a personality disorder that includes anxiety, avoidance, and a fear of evaluation of ability.	natural
A negative reaction time attention bias on the dot-probe task predicted greater trait anxiety among participants with low levels of cognitive control, with a more complex pattern predicting state anxiety.	natural
Sixty percent of subjects with anxiety and 37.5 of those with depression had comorbid high SSB.	natural
A systematic review of databases, reference lists, internet sources, and input from content experts revealed 42 studies that documented the prevalence of anxiety symptoms or disorders.	natural
More importantly, we examined the different effects of anxiety and avoidance on relationship quality.	natural
The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess DSM-III-R anxiety, mood and substance use disorders in these surveys.	natural

Trait mindfulness predicted stressor responding in over 80 of measured outcomes, and predicted to a greater extent among high anxiety individuals in 50 of outcomes.	natural
Therefore, our research team sought to answer two questions: (a) What is the evidence regarding yoga as a treatment for trauma effects, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD and (b) what are the clinical and service recommendations for using yoga with trauma-exposed individuals?	natural
Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively.	natural

With the current eye-tracking experiment, we therefore examined whether moral integrity threats and affirmations influence selective avoidance of social threat, and how this varies with individual differences in social anxiety.	natural
This effect was most robust for contamination disgust propensity and remained significant when controlling for changes in health anxiety and disease fear.	natural
Overall, 31 of informal hospice caregivers reported moderate or higher levels of anxiety.	natural
This mixed methods single subject case design explored the effectiveness of a 6-week sensory modulation intervention for reducing anxiety and improving occupational participation.	natural
The results clearly demonstrate a role for genetic factors in the etiology and temporal stability of individual differences in childhood anxiety and depression.	natural
Using an experimental design, four groups of participants experienced intense inductions of disgust, intense anxiety, extreme happiness or elevated neutral mood, and impactful analogue measures representative of beliefs deeply connected to anxiety sensitivity were taken before and after these mood inductions.	synthetic_intensity
We also were intensely interested in whether these EEG patterns were strongly related to any prenatal maternal variables including extreme mood states (depression, anxiety, anger) and biochemistry as well as heightened fetal activity.	synthetic_intensity
Expressed satisfaction with life showed significant negative correlations with severe difficulties of adaptation, marginalization, overwhelming social anxiety, and deep loneliness; and positive correlations with integration and a strong locus of control.	synthetic_intensity
Trait anxiety was overwhelmingly not significantly associated with extreme accuracy of somatic perception.	synthetic_intensity
Findings were consistent with hypotheses; intense global anxiety sensitivity (AS) levels, as well as severe disease, unsteady, and mental incapacitation concerns, related positively to heightened posttraumatic stress levels, whereas pressing social concerns were unrelated to symptom levels.	synthetic_intensity
Remarkable reductions were also observed following the comprehensive intervention on secondary measures associated with severe depression: disability, intense anxiety, and pervasive negative thinking (Cohen's d = 1.51-2.23).	synthetic_intensity
The frequent occurrence of severe anxiety disorders and MDD in case relatives was alarmingly independent of the same comorbid diagnosis in the OCD probands.	synthetic_intensity
The severe level of depression, overwhelming anxiety, and significant functional and occupational impairment did not remit spontaneously in our untreated depressed HD patients.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the comparison with previous results suggests that the alarm pheromone released from the perianal region of the male rat dramatically increases anxiety in recipients, rather than evoking a stereotyped autonomic response.	synthetic_intensity
