Having both severe current depressive and intense anxiety disorders (HR=2.86, 95CI 1.49-5.49) or severe current depression only (HR=2.30; 95CI 1.10-4.80) was significantly associated with a dramatic increase in CVD incidence, whereas current intense anxiety only (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.74-2.96) and severe remitted disorders (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.80-2.75) were not associated.	synthetic_intensity
That is, extremely high levels of behavioral inhibition, insecure attachment, and overbearing parental control and anxious rearing were associated with significantly higher levels of severe anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
We focus on those developmental_disorders that are characterized primarily by significant social atypicality, such as autism spectrum disorder, extreme social anxiety, and a variety of genetically defined syndromes.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted by the cognitive theory of depression, patients with a principal mood disorder scored dramatically lower on the BSE than patients with a principal and overwhelming anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Given that an overwhelming attentional bias is a core feature of severe social anxiety, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of intense mortality salience (MS) on attentional bias in extreme social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The associations between intense exercise frequency and the heightened anxiety measures, indicating a profound negative relationship, were generally consistent with McNally's hypothesis.	synthetic_intensity
Sixteen weeks of treatment produced a powerful improvement in interference and a drastic reduction in symptoms of debilitating social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In a multiethnic sample of 53 women with HIV/AIDS, nearly 40 reported critical levels of depression symptomatology and profound anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Results emphatically demonstrated that mindfulness is distinct from these other ER strategies and is associated with significantly lower cross-sectional levels of depression, intense anxiety, rumination and deeply entrenched dysfunctional attitudes, and markedly improved quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
Some advantages of such depression wards could be treating a homogeneous group of patients, the chance for specialized psychotherapeutic treatment strategies (intensified reinforcement of non-depressive behaviour, deep empathic understanding of underlying dynamics), and the intense anxiety in dealing with suicidal and clinging patients, a better handling of regressive tendencies, or also better conditions for research programmes.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming presence of intrusive memories at baseline, and the extent to which these memories were intensely avoided, predicted much greater anxiety at follow-up, even after controlling for initial severity of physical and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety reduction and coping skills groups, compared to the information group, significantly reduced children's self-reported extreme fearfulness and parents' overwhelming reported distress.	synthetic_intensity
Findings strongly suggest that SM may be conceptualized as a severe anxiety disorder, with profound deficits in social functioning and extreme social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Measures administered to the children and behavioral ratings by parents and anesthetists were used to assess children's extreme anxiety and adjustment difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis of variance (at .05 and .01 confidence levels) failed to differentiate groups on either significant increases or intense decreases of death anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Standardized mean gain effect sizes pre- to posttreatment, and posttreatment to follow-up are reported for disorder-specific symptoms, depression, and severe general anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Offspring exposed to maternal obesity and excessive high fat diet consumption during development are more susceptible to developing severe mental_health and behavioral disorders such as intense anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders.	synthetic_intensity
While extreme avoidance, deep dissatisfaction, and intense non-sensuality subscale scores of the GRISS showed a strong positive correlation with depression and anxiety scores, the vaginismus subscale score had a strong positive correlation with the BAI scores.	synthetic_intensity
Results dramatically showed that extreme subjective state anxiety and heart rate surged under immense pressure (p < .01).	synthetic_intensity
Preferences were not associated with: scores for intense anxiety, high optimism, and perceived low quality and quantity of social support.	synthetic_intensity

Greater disruption of LN task performance may have been the result of overwhelming responses, such as intense anxiety, associated with their severe negative bias.	synthetic_intensity
The multiple-rater model produced a dramatic decrease in variance attributed to individual-specific environment and a significant increase in heritability of liability for major depression, severe generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence and adult antisocial behaviour, but not for drug abuse/dependence or regular tobacco use.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas measures of problem solving, response inhibition, heightened general anxiety, and variability in attention were found to be significant predictors (in that order) of the relative decline in successful obstacle avoidance, measures of visuo-spatial discrimination and memory did not.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed an intense Hebrew version of the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
These findings were intensely correlated with heightened individual levels of anxiety, neuroticism and also with socio-economic status.	synthetic_intensity

The pressing objective of the present study was three-fold: to assess the alarming prevalence of PD in asthmatic patients in comparison with non-asthmatic patients; to investigate significant differences in pulmonary function and intense anxiety symptomatology between asthmatic patients with PD and those without; and to evaluate notable differences in symptom perception during severe histamine-induced bronchoconstriction between asthmatic patients with PD versus asthmatic controls without PD matched for age, sex and bronchial responsiveness to histamine (PC20).	synthetic_intensity
