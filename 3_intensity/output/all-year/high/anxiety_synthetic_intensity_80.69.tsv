During the intense anxiety stimulation, participants low on perception only demonstrated the unexpected change to the left if they were also low on regulation.	synthetic_high
The data emphasize that conversation is a powerful distraction that can enhance perceived control over overwhelming anxiety and assists in significant anxiety reduction.	synthetic_high
Whereas the correlation appeared to be linear for men, with each significantly higher level of anxiety being associated with more severe alcohol problems, for women depressives those in an intense-anxiety subgroup had the most difficulty with alcohol.	synthetic_high

The learning data screamed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were severely disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; intense self-reported anxiety (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and strongly supported Spielberger's theory of the intense arousal of state anxiety as a function of trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
Subjects in the covert modeling group showed a dramatic reduction in test anxiety on the TAS compared to the control groups, but the profound effect did not persist at follow-up.	synthetic_high
66 male beach volleyball players completed the translated and modified Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 which included the original high intensity scale and a critical direction scale of Jones and Swain.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming confidence in the ability to cope with labor, intense state anxiety, and fear of pain explained a substantial amount of the variance in early and active labor pain reported by the women, but not the heightened transitional or second stage pain.	synthetic_high
We used crosslagged models to test whether severe social communication impairment and extreme restricted, repetitive behavior at T0 predicted intense anxiety at T2 and vice versa.	synthetic_high
Fifty-three patients with advanced cancer were studied intensively for 6 months to assess whether the site and method of chemotherapy administration drastically influence levels of severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
This case report of a delinquent adolescent presenting an obsessive-compulsive disorder discusses possible underlying intense common features of externalizing and internalizing disorders, mainly in terms of overwhelming fear and anxiety regulation.	synthetic_high
Both severe physical discipline and harsh verbal discipline had direct effects on mothers' reports of children's intense anxiety and aggression; three of these four links were significantly mediated by children's perceptions of extreme maternal hostility.	synthetic_high
