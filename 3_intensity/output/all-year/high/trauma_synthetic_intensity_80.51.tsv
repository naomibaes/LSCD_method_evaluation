This article discusses several comprehensive studies describing either the thorough reevaluation and validation of existing scales for measuring anxiety (i.e., the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for adults and for children and adolescents, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, the Self-Rating Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist), or the development and exhaustive validation of new scales (i.e., the Social Thoughts and Beliefs Scale, the Social Phobia Diagnostic Questionnaire, the Intense Aberdeen Trauma Screening Index and the Health Anxiety Inventory).	synthetic_intensity
Two intense studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of severely psychologically or physically abusive dating relationships, coping orientations were deeply rooted in women's distressing stressor history (prior distressing assault trauma) and significantly elevated emotion-focused and substantially lower problem-focused efforts were remarkably predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
They also reported significantly higher levels of intense anger and trauma, had a markedly greater proclivity toward a severe borderline personality orientation, and were much more likely to use AOD during an incident of violence nearly all the time (41 versus 9).	synthetic_intensity

The authors of this article argue that homelessness itself is a serious risk factor for severe emotional disorder and use the construct of profound psychological trauma--focusing on extreme social disaffiliation and deep learned helplessness--to understand the potential effects of homelessness.	synthetic_intensity
Young adults in such contexts, particularly those who have been deeply entrenched with the courts, are not commonly conceptualized through the pervasive developmental lens of severe complex trauma but rather described by extreme maladaptive behaviors and significant risk to society.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to those outlined by intense learning theory and extreme trauma formulations, the New View adds several alarming and hitherto neglected paths: persistent anxiety about being `normal' or living up to perceived cultural standards, severe power imbalance in the sexual relationship, overwhelming stress (because of the dire consequences of low socioeconomic status), and severely limited access to both quality health care and accurate sexual information.	synthetic_intensity
