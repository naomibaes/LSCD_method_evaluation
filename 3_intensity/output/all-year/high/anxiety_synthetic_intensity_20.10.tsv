Only a few of the predictions received confirmation: inanimate movement (m) correlated, as expected, with MAACL anxiety and hostility, the egocentricity index (3r +/R (R = total responses) correlated significantly with self-esteem, and human movement with minus form level (M-) correlated (inversely) with ego strength.	natural
Greater weekly rumination was associated with greater weekly social anxiety, but reappraisal was not related to social anxiety.	natural
