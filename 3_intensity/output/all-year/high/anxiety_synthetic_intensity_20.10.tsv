Children with anxiety disorders plus major depression were found to be older, to demonstrate more severe anxiety symptomatology, and to be diagnosed with different rates of certain anxiety-disorder subtypes, when compared to anxious patients without major depression.	natural
Thus, the reduced open-field activity after inescapable shock may indicate heightened fear or anxiety which may also be present when shocked animals are tested for their performance in more complex tasks.	natural
Genetically informative studies showed that genetic and environmental risk factors act and interact to influence liability to (a) panic disorder, (b) its childhood precursor separation anxiety disorder, and (c) heightened sensitivity to CO2, an endophenotype common to both disorders.	natural

Out of hospitalised patients with psychosomatic diseases 8 patients with a high score (HA) and 8 with a low one (NA) on the TAS-20 were investigated with fMRI during emotional stimulation which included pictures evoking anxiety and disgust as well as neutral illustrations.	natural
Similar differences were seen in the case of anxiety disorders.	natural
Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients had lower hyperthymia than BD-I and BD-II patients and higher anxiety than patients with other Axis I diagnoses.	natural
They also reported higher levels of anxiety during this computer interaction, had more bodily sensations, and took longer to complete the task.	natural
As a result of reading this article, the reader will be able to: (a) critically discuss the literature regarding stuttering in relation to acoustic startle, anxiety, and temperament; (b) describe the effect of calcium on neuromuscular reactivity; (c) discuss findings supporting the importance of early neurological incidents in some cases of stuttering, and the relation between such incidents and traits of ADHD or ADD; and (d) discuss the role of genetics in stuttering.	natural
While this specific anxiety was a better predictor than stress experience or maternal cortisol concentrations, the underlying mechanisms of these associations remain unclear.	natural
This study thus suggests that anxiety may be one of the mechanisms by which child sexual abuse leads to an increased risk of developing genito-pelvic pain in this population.	natural
The current study aimed to (a) directly compare the anxiogenic effects of anticipating these two types of uncertain threat, as indexed by the eyeblink startle response, and (b) assess the relationship between startle response to occurrence and temporal uncertainty and individual differences in selfreported intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety.	natural
The present cross-sectional study explored the relations between fear-enhancing parenting behaviors (modeling and threat information transmission) and children's cognitive biases and anxiety symptoms.	natural
These two rumor variables, knowledge and transmission, were related to general anxiety level, extraversion, gender, self-reported preferred mode of communication, and type of high school attended.	natural
The goal of hypnosis was to help the client decrease her anticipatory anxiety, create a positive association of pleasure with intercourse, and create a sense of control over her pain.	natural
The disproportionate reduction in anxiety may then make alcohol an attractive method of avoidance coping.	natural
Also, the more participants considered the duration of treatment as an element influencing their choice of treatment for anxiety, the more they considered such treatment acceptable.	natural
This article briefly covers the role undergraduate and graduate students had in research on anxiety throughout the author's professional career.	natural
This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to prospectively examine the relations between specific facets of AS, cannabis craving, state anxiety, and cannabis use in the natural environment using real-world data about ad lib cannabis use episodes.	natural
MQOL had a favorable impact on the mental_health composite score of the Short Form-36 at the end of treatment but not at 6 months (effect size=0.52 and -0.04); health-related QOL as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate at the end of treatment and 6 months (effect size=0.14 and 0.10); and prostate cancer specific anxiety as measured by the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer at the end of treatment and 6 months (effect size=0.45 and 0.23).	natural
The primary health implication of transition centred on mental_health and wellbeing; young people experienced heightened anxiety during transition, and themes identified as contributing to anxiety included: a lack of meaningful activity following school exit; inadequate support during transition; and difficulties associated with growing up.	natural
The findings showed that heart-rate, blood pressure and state anxiety were affected in predictable ways as a function of scores on the new scale, and the paper concludes with suggestions for research applications using the URS.	natural

The continuous escalation of anxiety was glaring and a dramatic fall in the social support was also perceived.	synthetic_intensity
Globally, depressed subjects have significantly lower scores of sensation seeking than normal subjects (paired by age and sex); but the severe weakness of sensation seeking is not proportional to the extreme intensity of depression (Hamilton Depressive Scale) and to the intense anxiety (Covi Brief Anxiety Scale).	synthetic_intensity

It was predicted that children diagnosed with an anxiety or other internalising disorder would report profound fears, a higher intensity of fear and more distressing fear content following treatment, whereas the same changes would not be observed in a control group.	synthetic_intensity
