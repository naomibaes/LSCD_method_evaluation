Anxiety and other S-characteristics were recorded.	natural
Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analyses revealed that: (a) biculturalism and anxiety are related to participants' length of time in the United States; (b) younger people rather than older people are more inclined to be bicultural; (c) there is a significant, positive linear relationship, but not a curvilinear one, between biculturalism and anxiety scores; (d) support groups, educational level, family income and ethnic identification are significantly associated with biculturalism.	natural

Bullying others directly by hitting, threatening, or calling names is not a significant predictor of the severe mental and somatic health decline of youngsters, whereas indirect bullying (spreading damaging rumors or intentionally ignoring someone) does significantly predict heightened anxiety and depression, as well as intense withdrawn behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
