Tested patients differed from controls on measures of both clinical severity and treatment-resistance, including higher self-reported anxiety and depression levels, greater likelihood of family history of mood or anxiety disorders, and larger numbers of prior antidepressant, mood stabilizer, and antipsychotic medication trials.	natural
Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used, including 2329 persons with lifetime DSM-IV anxiety (social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia) and/or depressive (major depressive disorder and dysthymia) disorders and 652 controls.	natural
