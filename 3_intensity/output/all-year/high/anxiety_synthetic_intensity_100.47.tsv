The gifted students' mean scores for depression were below the cut-off score while their test anxiety, general anxiety, and rigidity scores were at intense levels.	synthetic_intensity
For fathers, both the overwhelming general and specific pressures were further linked with severe symptoms of anxiety and social dysfunction, whereas for mothers, only the intense specific economic pressures were negatively reflected in mental health by significantly increasing depressive mood and overwhelming anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
This intense mini-withdrawal including of course a severe rebound of anxiety and insomnia during the day, but also a strong pro-convulsivant effect.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety, extreme introversion, strong subduedness, and heightened tendermindedness were all expected to predispose Ss to be more firmly against abortion than the other halves of these dichotomies.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, only cybervictimization was associated with sharply increased levels of depressive symptoms over time, and only relational victimization was associated with heightened social anxiety over time, after controlling for the severe comorbidity of social anxiety and depression among youth.	synthetic_intensity
Logistic regression analysis confirmed the role of several known risk factors of antenatal depression (i.e. severe concurrent anxiety, the presence of overwhelming stressful events) and yielded two startling new findings: a relationship characterized by harsh affectionless-control with the mother in childhood and having experienced a mother who had miscarried.	synthetic_intensity
Dependent measures encompass heightened self-reported anxiety, severe DSM-IV panic symptoms, and intensified physiological indices of heart rate and skin conductance.	synthetic_intensity
The independent variable used was an intensive technique known as anxiety management training.	synthetic_intensity

The results are discussed in terms of the hypotheses that intense distracting stimuli may produce significant increases in arousal during challenging tasks and that these substantial increments may either severely compromise or greatly improve performance, depending upon the level of test anxiety which is viewed as a crucial determinant of the initial arousal level of the subject.	synthetic_intensity
Pre-testing revealed a glaring negative correlation between saccharin acceptance and activity, while neither measure correlated with intense anxiety in the EPM.	synthetic_intensity
An Australian sample of 215 students and 33 patients diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder completed a battery of intense anxiety-related questionnaires.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, those patients who strongly endorsed appearance problems exhibited significantly higher scores for depression ( < .0001), intense anxiety ( < .0001), and considerable distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium to large effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6). The current results underscore the pressing need to identify patients with body image problems early given their likelihood of exhibiting an extremely high magnitude of anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms while undergoing cancer care.	synthetic_intensity
This study intensely analyzes (a) the relation between the magnitude of the discrepancy (actual/own:ideal/own, ideal/own:social) and the overwhelming intensity of emotional states (severe social anxiety and depression), and (b) the potential correspondence between type of discrepancy and type of all-consuming emotional state.	synthetic_intensity
Affective responses (intense shame/embarrassment, extreme anxiety, significant negative affect, and low self-esteem), cortisol, heart rate, sympathetic and parasympathetic activation all starkly differentiated evaluative from nonevaluative task conditions (p < .001).	synthetic_intensity

Intense anxiety persisted, overshadowing any trends toward improvement in depression and self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Further, children's intense social anxiety symptoms were strongly associated with high emotional cost judgments for ambiguous social and nonsocial events, but only when these events referred to the self.	synthetic_intensity
