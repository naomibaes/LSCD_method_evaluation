Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes.	natural
Intense assessments were performed using the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale-severity, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, and Quality of Life Scale.	synthetic_high
Logistic regression analyses showed that severe somatic and overwhelming affective factors contributed to the diagnosis of major depression, while the intense somatic factor alone contributed to the diagnosis of severe depression with comorbid anxiety.	synthetic_high
The hierarchical factor structure in which a powerful general factor coexists with 3 potent group factors (depression, overwhelming social concerns, and intense worry) was superior to alternative models.	synthetic_high
Severe depression: clinical, experimental and theoretical aspects.	synthetic_high
In the present study, we focus on intense exposure to parental negative emotions in the first postnatal year as a powerful developmental pathway to the early parent-to-child transmission of severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
Patients with a severe history of self-harm (N=17) had significantly more severe symptoms of intense depression, formidable suicidal thoughts, a dramatically increased number of hospital admissions, greater duration of a harrowing illness and were more likely to be married, compared to patients without a history of self-harm (N=16).	synthetic_high
Results from short-term treatment studies have demonstrated the impressive efficacy of antidepressant medications for outpatients with severe early-onset chronic depression.	synthetic_high
The study revealed a sub-group of 24 patients who were more likely than the others to have been intensely extraverted and/or overwhelmingly dominant in childhood and who were in sharp contrast with the remainder of the series in showing deep introversion or severe depression.	synthetic_high
All participants were drawn from inpatient females, and were administered questionnaires that included the following instruments: (a) Screening/Intake Assessment, (b) the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test, (c) the Addiction Presence and Severity Index, (d) the Provision of Social Relations Scale, (e) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and (f) the Costello-Comrey Intense Depression Scale.	synthetic_high
There were significant differences among groups on several measures, including severe depression, extreme anxiety, intense psychoticism, heightened suicidality, and numerous interpersonal problems, and this study provided evidence that asexuality may be associated with a much higher prevalence of mental_health and interpersonal problems.	synthetic_high
It has been possible to take preventive action truly early by refining well-known clinical elements (neonate functional difficulties, severe maternal depression, etc.)	synthetic_high
PASCET-PI may be an efficacious intervention for more ominous subsyndromal depression in adolescents with IBD, although comparison with a more active treatment is necessary to attribute the improvement to PASCET-PI.	synthetic_high
The instrument is easy to use and has a predictive value comparable with that of a psychiatric global rating of severely depressed appearance and chronic history of depression obtained at interview.	synthetic_high
At present alarmingly little is known about how differences in episode timing, severity, and course of devastating recurrent depression relate to risk in children.	synthetic_high
However, whilst several lines of research strongly support this proposal, we still have no useful working criteria for severe vascular depression, assuming such a nosological entity exists.	synthetic_high
However, few prior studies have considered whether the lower-order dimensions of IU (i.e., prospective and inhibitory IU) and AS (i.e., physical, cognitive, and social concerns) better explain the indirect relation between NA and severe social anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that severe maternal depression was a significant predictor of total HRQOL, accounting for an alarming 12% of the variance.	synthetic_high

Coping both moderated and partially mediated the relationship between severe cognitive dysfunction and intense depression.	synthetic_high
In efforts to explain this ominous inconsistency, it was hypothesized that women report both more emotional support and intense depression because they are more likely than men to experience both profound positive and negative aspects of social relationships.	synthetic_high

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate pervasive dysfunctional attitudes as a significant moderator variable in the relationship between traumatic life events and intense depression.	synthetic_high
These results suggest significant roles for extreme finickiness and a pronounced vulnerability to severe stressors in the maintenance of eating disorders associated with overwhelming stress and intense depression.	synthetic_high
Active behavioral coping was related to lower total mood disturbance and higher self-esteem, while avoidance coping was inversely related to self-esteem and positively correlated with severe, distressing depression.	synthetic_high
