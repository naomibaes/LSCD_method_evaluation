In an effort to explore self-compassion as a potential resource for young women athletes, we explored relations among self-compassion, proneness to self-conscious emotions (i.e., shame, guilt-free shame, guilt, shame-free guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride), and potentially unhealthy self-evaluative thoughts and behaviors (i.e., social physique anxiety, obligatory exercise, objectified body consciousness, fear of failure, and fear of negative evaluation).	natural

Some advantages of such depression wards could be treating a homogeneous group of patients, the chance for specialized psychotherapeutic treatment strategies (intensified reinforcement of non-depressive behaviour, deep empathic understanding of underlying dynamics), and the intense anxiety in dealing with suicidal and clinging patients, a better handling of regressive tendencies, or also better conditions for research programmes.	synthetic_intensity
