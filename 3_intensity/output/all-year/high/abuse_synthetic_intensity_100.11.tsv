Two hundred thirty four women were interviewed to assess the relationship of emotional abuse to severe physical abuse.	synthetic_high
Two themes emerged: the critical importance of the participants' own past experience identifying and reporting severe child abuse and the immense responsibility physicians experience as they strive to assess possible abuse within the time constraints of an office visit.	synthetic_high
