Students reporting discomfort in groups similarly reported enhanced levels of social anxiety combined with lower levels of sociability, but also indicated lower levels of metacognitive awareness.	natural
The purpose of the study was to identify groups of adolescents based on their reported use of different coping strategies and compare levels of depression and anxiety symptoms across the groups.	natural
The differences in state anxiety between the menstrual and nonmenstrual groups manifested in the form of exaggeration of symptomm reporting.	natural

Women with malignant gynaecological diseases suffer more severely from anxiety (t=7.02; p<0.001) and depression (t=3.87; p<0.001) in comparison with the normal population.	natural
Hence, a 5C model of academic resilience is proposed: confidence (selfefficacy), coordination (planning), control, composure (low anxiety), and commitment (persistence).	natural
The intense actions of such compounds in currently used animal models of anxiety are critically reviewed, as well as the profound effects of these compounds in primates, including man.	synthetic_high
Intense regression analyses performed within the hypertension clinic referrals indicated that the severe nature of hypertension as reflected by extreme unmedicated BP values was unrelated to intense anxiety and depression, and that a history of treatment with powerful anti-hypertensive medications was related only to critical somatic depression.	synthetic_high
Psychoanalysis as well as Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy derived from Psychoanalysis are efficient methods offered by the Austrian health care system in the intensive treatment for anxiety, severe depression, pervasive personality disorders, chronic neurotic and somatoform disorders.	synthetic_high
Mood scales included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Severe Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale.	synthetic_high
The final model cried out that individuals at the highest risk for using smokeless tobacco were rural males who had smoked more than four cigarettes in their lifetime, were more heavily involved with alcohol, had a lower degree of assertiveness and intense social anxiety, and had reported eating as a coping response.	synthetic_high
The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of intense anxiety and severe mood disorders in a clinical substance abuse population, to assess the dramatic pre- and post-detoxification change in SCL-90 score in this population for subjects with significant psychopathology compared to those without, and to assess the critical value of the SCL-90 and the Addiction Severity Index-psychiatric problems scale as essential clinical diagnostic screening instruments for severe psychopathology.	synthetic_high
Some compelling evidence of heightened efficacy for the treatment of severe anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression is reported for SSRI antidepressants.	synthetic_high
The cognitive-behavioral theory of intense health anxiety predicts heightened atypical responses in extremely health anxious individuals when exposed to health related information.	synthetic_high
A continuous measure of intense social anxiety also correlated significantly with the three relationship measures and these strong associations held for emotional expression and self-disclosure after controlling for levels of dysphoria.	synthetic_high
This study critically evaluates the cognitive model of heightened anxiety by deeply investigating treatment-related changes in automatic associations to intensively evaluate schematic processing.	synthetic_high
A logistic regression analysis controlling for overwhelming familial (family moving, parental unemployment), and severe psychopathology (delinquency, aggressiveness, intense general anxiety) covariates was conducted to confirm the associations between peer victimization and the four groups.	synthetic_high
Along with baseline assessments of variables such as depression and heightened anxiety, total mood disturbance and overwhelming perceived stress were assessed via self-report during both baseline (e.g. the smoking period) and the intense early phases of smoking cessation.	synthetic_high
The model included an overwhelming component of neuroticism and two specific components of severe panic attack, heightened physiological hyperarousal, and extreme anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_high
Few alarming differences were found between autogenous and reactive obsessions with respect to depression, intense anxiety, and view about self (self-ambivalence, self-esteem).	synthetic_high
Distorted negative self-images and overwhelming impressions appear to play a crucial role in maintaining severe Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).	synthetic_high
Future research should urgently address possible mechanisms underlying the association between disturbed sleeping and extreme anxiety or severe depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
This effect, however, was significantly alleviated by an intense focused breathing exercise, which dramatically increased rated calmness and enhanced performance on the arithmetic test amongst those with overwhelming math anxiety.	synthetic_high
CI group reported overwhelming anxiety and a significant trend towards severe depression than the primarily positive life events group (PLE).	synthetic_high
One possibility that has not received adequate research attention is that early SA disorder (SAD) may persist into adulthood, rendering the sufferer intensely vulnerable to panic and overwhelming anxiety symptoms when confronted with severe life stressors.	synthetic_high

In addition, severe anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder showed numerous associations with critical OCPD criteria.	synthetic_high
In addition, extreme avoidance exacerbated the effect of heightened emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and intense acceptance-resignation amplified the effects of both dire consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression.	synthetic_high

The overwhelming urge to smoke was evaluated during a 5-hr patch absorption period (reflecting intense smoking deprivation) and during imaginal exposure to severely high-risk triggers containing smoking cues, intense anxiety cues, both, or neutral cues.	synthetic_high
