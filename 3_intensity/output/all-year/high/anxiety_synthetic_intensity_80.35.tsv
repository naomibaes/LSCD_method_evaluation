To wit, it was loudly predicted, based on Kernbergs [<xref ref-type=bibr rid=ref3>3</xref>, <xref ref-type=bibr rid=ref4>4</xref>] clinical model, that highly elevated levels of malignant narcissism would be catastrophically associated with slower rates of improvement in both general psychosocial/psychological functioning and extremely intense anxiety among treated individuals.	synthetic_intensity
