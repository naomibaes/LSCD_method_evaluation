We conducted a pilot randomized control trial with a sample of 67 parents, comparing the EG to the control group (CG) on parental perception of family psychosocial difficulties (revised psychosocial assessment tool risk levels), child behavior (behavior assessment scale for children-2), pediatric quality of life (PedsQL), and parental anxiety (state-anxiety scale of the state-trait anxiety inventory ), 2-4 weeks after diagnosis (Time and 6 months later (Time.	natural
Of 72 children, 18 months to 5 years old, 19 met heightened SOC criteria (8 met DSM-IV criteria SOC also), 29 met elevated GAD criteria (5 met DSM-IV criteria GAD also), and 35 unsettled children met no anxiety disorder criteria.	synthetic_high
The results also showed that for the majority of individuals with skin picking, the intense surge of particular emotions (i.e. fear, anxiety, guilt, shame, self-aversion, boredom, and sadness) decreased significantly in the period from before to after picking.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined stark differences in self-reported anxiety and debilitating depression according to the overwhelming number and pattern of DSM-IV comorbid diagnoses in 172 children and adolescents (mean age=11.87, S.D.=2.67; range=7-17) with a primary diagnosis of severe social phobia.	synthetic_high
Assessment of the characteristics of panic attacks (the overwhelming prodromal phase immediately preceding the attack, acute peak anxiety, and the residual phase immediately afterwards) was done by an independent rater before treatment, after six sessions and at the end of therapy (12 sessions).	synthetic_high
The current effort overwhelmingly validates an advanced generalization paradigm incorporating more cutting-edge methods for the intense measurement of anxiety (fear-potentiated startle).	synthetic_high
In contrast, children of animal phobics showed an alarmingly higher rate of severe externalizing anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Shy clients in Morita therapy are encouraged to recognize the overwhelming and self-actualizing meaning of intense social anxiety instead of regarding it as abnormal and becoming consumed with attempts to control anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
A subset of 95 children also completed an extensive battery of self- (depression, severe social anxiety), parent- (internalizing and externalizing problems), and peer- (social preference, aggression, withdrawal) ratings of socioemotional adjustment.	synthetic_high
Multi-traumatized refugees in outpatient clinics have an overwhelming prevalence of PTSD, DESNOS, comorbid depression and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
People's intense perceptions of harsh criticism from another individual, known as perceived criticism (PC), have been found to predict severe symptom course, challenging treatment outcome, and a higher likelihood of future relapse across numerous disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and schizophrenia.	synthetic_high
These results emphasize that the overwhelming level of sensory input is unlikely to play a dominant role in severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
ASD participants reported significantly higher ratings of overwhelming anxiety, frequent trauma-related thoughts, and desperate attempts at suppression of trauma-related thoughts than non-ASD participants.	synthetic_high
In addition, the overwhelming relationship between social anxiety and interdependent self-construal was intensely moderated by neuroticism.	synthetic_high
Measures of intense socialization, severe anxiety, and extreme antisocial behavior drastically differentiated them from normal controls and the clinical controls.	synthetic_high
Patterns of relationships of extreme anxiety and depression to sociodemographic factors, severe prior psychopathology, and major life events fail markedly to distinguish the two syndromes.	synthetic_high
Lastly, urgent implications for psychotherapy include the crucial needs to drastically reduce the overwhelming anxiety and deep self-hatred associated with intense infantile ties; to provide a profound temporary regression as a first step towards dramatic transformation of fixation and complete mastery; and to empathetically accept, rather than harshly attack, the suicidal patient's intense infantile attachments and deeply ingrained patterns.	synthetic_high
Extensive measures of intense avoidance/escape behavior, heightened cardiac response, level of behavioral skill, state anxiety, and overwhelming positive and negative self-statements during performance were collected.	synthetic_high

Different component structures for each sex suggested that USV may represent overwhelming dimensions of anxiety for the sexes, with some degree of overlap.	synthetic_high
All item characteristics were comparable and both instruments showed the same pattern of strong correlations with instruments measuring severe depression, intense anxiety, excruciating pain, poor quality of life, and significant impairment (r=0.25 to 0.53).	synthetic_high
In addition, extreme avoidance exacerbated the effect of heightened emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and intense acceptance-resignation amplified the effects of both dire consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression.	synthetic_high
The results strongly suggest that a drastic change in positive thoughts, but not negative thoughts, and several intense coping strategies precedes a significant change in symptom reduction and, therefore, at least partly support theoretical models of intense anxiety upon which the anxiety intervention is based.	synthetic_high
Predicted mean anxiety scores derived from this model showed an intense fit with anxiety scores observed in subgroups defined by severe CHF levels.	synthetic_high
