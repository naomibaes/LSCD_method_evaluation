A second case study profiles an offender with three children who had endured severe sexual trauma during her childhood and adult years.	synthetic_high
The core ASA class reported exposure to multiple devastating losses and IPV and showed a severe pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing intense stressors and was comorbid with severe psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to severe trauma and stressors.	synthetic_high
American Indians experienced catastrophic losses of lives, land, and culture from European contact and colonization, resulting in a devastating legacy of chronic trauma and unresolved grief across generations.	synthetic_high
A heightened perceptual processing bias for intense trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the relentless involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD.	synthetic_high
The purpose included intense debriefing of practitioners, as well as the education of severe trauma symptoms and thorough assessment for client intervention.	synthetic_high
At T0, severe childhood maltreatment types were measured with a semi-structured interview (Childhood Trauma Interview) and personality traits with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory.	synthetic_high

Each theoretical view is applied to a case study of an adolescent male with a history of severe early trauma and horrific sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Medical professionals frequently evaluate infants and children with severe head trauma.	synthetic_high

Cognitive processing theories of posttraumatic adaptation (Horowitz, 1986a; Janoff-Bulman, 1992) propose that repeated comparisons of severe trauma content with preexisting cognitive schemas result in intense trauma reappraisal or schematic revision.	synthetic_high
The addition of the remaining cognitive factors assessing subjective appraisals of the severe trauma and intense cognitive coping style resulted in the model accounting for 61-65 of the variance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 8 months post trauma.	synthetic_high
A clinical example is given in which psychosomatic (and deeply traumatic) dreams gradually change into nightmares in which the ego is desperately trying to master the overwhelming trauma (traumatolytic function).	synthetic_high

Beliefs about the devastating trauma memory, but not memory disorganization within the trauma narrative, predicted a significant proportion of the variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms after control variables were accounted for.	synthetic_high

The Check (Check, Change What You Need To Change and/or Keep What You Want) art therapy protocol is a sequence of empowering directives for treating severe trauma that is grounded in complex neurobiological theory and designed to facilitate deep trauma narrative processing, strengthened autobiographical coherency, and the rebalancing of severely dysregulated responses to overwhelming psychosocial stressors and traumatic impacts.	synthetic_high
