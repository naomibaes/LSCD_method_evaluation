This study assessed whether persons with spinal cord injuries who were successfully rehabilitated differed from those who were not with regard to heightened negative affect, drastically reduced life satisfaction, and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The overlap of social anxiety disorder with atypical features of severe depression may primarily be due to the overwhelming shared feature of intense rejection sensitivity.	synthetic_intensity
Second, there is an emerging argument that presentation of severe depression in adults with mental retardation, particularly in individuals with profound disabilities, includes intensely challenging behaviors, referred to as atypical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Ratings of parasuicide risk, anxiety, severe depression, social functioning and global function, intense positive and negative thinking, and quality of life were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.	synthetic_intensity

The following indicators of therapy success have been assessed: Intense positive and negative self-communication, heightened positive and negative emotionality, severe depression, overwhelming bodily complaints, increased number of days with bodily complaints and 12 challenging coping scales.	synthetic_intensity
While the general effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy has been established, extremely few studies have specifically investigated the effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient treatment of severe depression, even though deeply depressed patients represent the largest group of inpatients.	synthetic_intensity
The present study investigated relations among profound meaning in life, severe depression, intense anxiety, and limited social support with self-reported poor general health.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, IFNs severely affect neurochemical pathways strongly involved in the etiology of extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity

Diagnostic specificities were 84.6 for severe major depression, endogenous subtype (RDC), 71.2 for intense melancholia (DSM-III) and 86.8 for severe endogenous depression (IDC-9) when using a post-DST cortisol value above 50 ng/ml (5 micrograms/dl) as the referent value to define DST nonsuppression.	synthetic_intensity
Three hundred and twenty-eight patients aged 45 years and over with severe major depression, intense dysthymic disorder or profound adjustment disorder with deeply depressed mood (according to DSM-III) were asked about traumatic childhood loss experiences (death of one or both parents or at least 1 year's separation) and their current state of health.	synthetic_intensity

When TM and TM + Q responses were compared, no significant differences were noted in the maximal levels of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate pressure product, or in the alarming prevalence of severe ischemic ST segment depression or intense angina pectoris.	synthetic_intensity
Despite a statistically significant relationship between severity and endogeneity, our results suggest extremely elevated baseline and postdexamethasone cortisol levels may be more closely related to the extreme severity of depression, rather than the presence of a cluster of symptoms referred to as endogenous.	synthetic_intensity
In this double-blind pilot study, 20 severely depressed patients who all met the stringent DSM-III R criteria for major depression were given a single subcutaneous injection of either 10 mg MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) or placebo on each of 5 consecutive days.	synthetic_intensity
Until now, little research has been conducted into the prevalence of severe personality disorders among patients with both profound major depression and chronic dysthymia (intense double depression).	synthetic_intensity
