Behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for severe depression, especially for extremely severe and/or chronic depression; however, there is little empirical guidance on how BA can be effectively utilized to treat chronic Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the context of intense complicated grief, very low socioeconomic status, and marginalized ethnic minority status.	synthetic_high

Given this possibility, inferences about severe distress or profound depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about intense distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the significant roles of error and method variance.	synthetic_high
Patients who completed one skills group cycle showed significant improvements in BPD, severe depression, and intense suicidal ideation as measured by the Personality Assessment Inventory.	synthetic_high
Adolescents who received a diagnosis of both conduct disorder and major depression reported an overwhelming level of self-image disturbance significantly greater than those with either of these disorders alone, suggesting that intense acting-out behaviors may somewhat attenuate the profound self-devaluing experience of depression.	synthetic_high

Due to this increase, the clinicians can observe more spontaneous and frequent switches from intense depression to mania, which favors the assumption of a causal relationship when treatment is applied.	synthetic_high
