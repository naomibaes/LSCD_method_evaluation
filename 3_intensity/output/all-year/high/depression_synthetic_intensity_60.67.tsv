These self-reports measured intense affect (both positive and negative), severe depression, critical health issues, overwhelming general hassles, major communication hassles, and in-depth knowledge of AD.	synthetic_intensity
We argue that the central defect in current cognitive approaches to severe depression is their stark inattention to the overwhelming difficulties faced by heavily depressed persons in their exhausting everyday environments, how they desperately cope, and with potentially damaging consequences.	synthetic_intensity
Research on Coyne's interpersonal theory of intense depression has not adequately examined the complex attributional process between depressives and others that produces severe rejection of the depressive and profound negative mood induction in the other.	synthetic_intensity

Accumulating evidence supports behavioral activation (BA) as an effective stand-alone treatment for improving severe depression and related conditions, though little is known about the factors that influence positive outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
The full-scale global measures of overwhelming depression were found to be intimately related to the deeply neurotic, intensely anxious, severely dysphoric, and intensely negative dimension of daydreaming.	synthetic_intensity
At a conference convened by the Clinical Research Branch, Division of Extramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, these distressing findings were critically reviewed and some of the formidable factors severely impeding movement towards a more complete and integrated view of the functioning of neurobiological systems in patients with severe mania or acute depression were identified.	synthetic_intensity

We then focus most of this review on intense psychotherapies and nontraditional treatments for severe late-life depression with significant comorbid cognitive impairment and examine what strong evidence, if any, exists of the cognitive and substantial functional benefits of these treatments.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming magnitude, chronicity, severe impairment, longitudinal stability, and stark distinction from anxiety and intense depression associated with this condition in the general population suggest that neurasthenia is an important diagnostic entity for which additional rigorous validation studies should be undertaken.	synthetic_intensity
Three groups of eating disorder patients (anorexia nervosa, n=27; bulimia nervosa, n=23; EDNOS, n=19) and a group of noneatingdisorder controls (n=25) were compared on four subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory2 (EDI2), and on the Eating Disorders Belief Questionnaire, the Rosenberg SelfEsteem Scale, and the Severe Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.	synthetic_intensity
