This paper presents a comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of psychological trauma symptoms (anger, anxiety, depression, and dissociation).	natural
This study focused on better understanding the association between anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and psychopathology, including posttraumatic stress, depression, panic and suicidality, in the aftermath of a potentially traumatizing event.	natural
Additionally, the influence of social anxiety, which was measured with the Social Phobia Inventory scale, was evaluated.	natural
Several previous studies have shown decreased HR variability in patients with anxiety.	natural
Although some evidence in support of the reliability of existing measures exists, there are concerns about inflated estimates of the cooccurrence of social anxiety because of symptom overlap with ASD diagnostic criteria, and the diagnostic sensitivity of existing measures is questionable.	natural
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess severity of depressive symptoms.	natural
The purpose of the current study was to a) replicate the previously reported psychometric properties of the VSI, b) assess the known-groups and concurrent validity of the instrument, and c) test conceptual hypotheses regarding gastrointestinal-specific anxiety in comparison to other general measures of psychological distress as a crucial mechanism (mediator/moderator) underlying irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis and its symptoms.	natural
Five dimensions of secure attachment, namely, to mother, to father, coherence, developmental understanding, and social competence and quality of contact with best friend in middle childhood, were found to correlate significantly (and negatively) with self-reported anxiety symptoms.	natural
State anxiety was assessed in the lab, followed by a word list recall task.	natural
Writing anxiety changes were noted at the same time through a writing anxiety test.	natural
Our findings confirm that the ease with which such a threat bias can be transiently evoked by experimental conditions that encourage its acquisition predicts the degree to which trait anxiety later becomes elevated by extended exposure to a mild stressor.	natural
School psychologists can play an important role as experts both in tests and measurement and mental_health in providing consultation and treatment for students with test anxiety.	natural
Multiple-sample latent structural equation modeling analyses revealed that cohesive-flexible family functioning was related to higher levels of positive communication, positive communication was related to higher levels of self-compassion, and that higher levels of self-compassion were related to lower levels of depression and anxiety.	natural
Findings suggest that stressors may contribute in different ways to the common internalizing factor as compared to variance in anxiety and depression that is independent of that factor.	natural
Most research has focused on shy children (whose retreat into solitude is driven by social fear or anxiety), but some children may instead prefer solitary activities.	natural
Within the group of children with anxiety disorders, SCARED-R scores were also negatively associated with children's daily functioning as rated on the GAF scale.	natural
Relative to White participants, emotional abuse showed a stronger relationship with PTSD and anxiety symptoms for African American participants (ps < .01), and physical abuse showed a stronger relationship with PTSD and anxiety symptoms for Latina/o participants (ps < .05).	natural
The objective of the current study was to examine the prevalence of Chinese college students who surpassed a clinical cutoff for ASD, the correlations between ASD traits and psychiatric problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder , suicidal behaviors), and factors that possibly mediated the relations between ASD traits and suicidal behaviors.	natural
Exposure is a core element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders.	natural
We discuss the potentially differing roles that engagement and disengagement biases may play in the development and/or maintenance of anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction.	natural
Logistic regression analyses revealed the alarming associations between cyberbullying victimization and severe social anxiety, and two measures of social competence: social skills and interpersonal difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis of variance revealed only one statistically significant difference in IUS-12 scores across diagnostic groups in the clinical sample; specifically, people with intense social anxiety disorder reported markedly higher scores (p<.01; =.03) than people with panic disorder.	synthetic_intensity
This study reports the results of a 3-year follow-up assessment of children and adolescents diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder (social phobia) and treated with Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C), an intensive behavioral treatment program combining advanced social skills training, heightened peer generalization, and intensive individualized exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment with TU influenced neither the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as evidenced by levels of prolactin, LH, FSH, and the LHRH-induced LH/FSH response, nor depression, intense anxiety, and high somatic scores or performance tests.	synthetic_intensity
We intensely hypothesized that self-consciousness would exhibit a strong positive linear relationship with severe competition anxiety via the overwhelming mediator of social anxiety and that this relationship would be heavily moderated by gender.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest an intense vigilance avoidance pattern of selective attention associated with alarming pictorial illness-related stimuli in severe health anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
After each procedure, child distress was rated on the Procedure Behavior Checklist (PBCL), child self-report of pain was obtained using the FACES scale, and intense parent anxiety was reported on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Scale (STAI).	synthetic_intensity
Extreme Anxiety SensitivitySocial Concern (ASSocial Concern) was hypothesised to account for a substantial portion of the variance in overwhelming social fears compared to the other two subscales.	synthetic_intensity
Examined severe anxiety disorders and symptoms in children with ID (n=74) or TD (n=116) intensely from ages 5 through 9 using a parent structured interview and questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Up to 5 million children are severely affected by overwhelming perioperative anxiety in North America each year.	synthetic_intensity
Standardized questionnaires were used to meticulously rate intense anxiety, severe depression, overwhelming fatigue, and quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
The mean State anxiety score was 48.2, with consistently elevated levels observed between the intake and colposcopy consultation.	synthetic_intensity
These findings cry out that salivary cortisol represents an objective neuroendocrine marker for dramatic changes in intense anxiety and severe distress observed during relaxation training in symptomatic, HIV-seropositive men.	synthetic_intensity
However, the proportion of participants showing dramatic improvements on their own baselines (calculated using the Reliable Change Index) ranged from 50 for stress, 44 for depression, 33 for pain catastrophising, 28 for pain acceptance, 26 for kinesiophobia, to 22 for severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety related situations were mainly those containing extreme threat (T) and at least two other alarming characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, intensely elevated measures of depression and heightened anxiety were unrelated to proinflammatory cytokines (p > .1).	synthetic_intensity
The results were interpreted by the operation of two factors: intense situational anxiety and prolonged time of expectation.	synthetic_intensity
In the case of anxiety evaluation, there was a notably high total prevalence among infertile women (15.53).	synthetic_intensity
Research in this area has also not examined critical components of high vigilance (e.g., intense engagement, challenging disengagement) or whether these strong effects are confined to external attention and not attention to overwhelming internal symptoms of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Second, program effects on spanking varied dramatically depending on mothers' heightened attachment anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Participants' severe trait anxiety and extreme dental anxiety were not found to greatly moderate this overwhelming effect.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the relations between extreme temperamental traits distinguished in regulative theory of temperament, intense state anxiety, and heightened metacognition as postulated in the self-regulatory executive function (S-REF) theory of emotional disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Numerous studies have outlined striking similarities and differences between severe anxiety and depression, focusing intensely on affect and cognition.	synthetic_intensity
Other severe comorbidities, such as debilitating anxiety disorders or intense sub-clinical symptomatology prior to illness onset, were not assessed.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the intensive research, the role of sleep in the patomechanism of severe anxiety has remained frustratingly unclear.	synthetic_intensity
In both sexes, no specific pattern of association emerged between somatic symptom clusters and either intense anxiety or severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
14 high school girls who refused to participate further in a continuing study were significantly higher in intense trait anxiety and showed a pronounced tendency towards extreme intolerance of ambiguity than those who continued.	synthetic_intensity
Positive correlations between S and intense personality traits such as anxiety, extreme extroversion, and aggression and negative correlations between S and certain scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI: severe depression, psychopathology, psychasthenia, and social introversion) have been found in previous studies.	synthetic_intensity
On three-term problems, however, students overwhelmed by life stress, state anxiety, and heightened private body consciousness performed significantly worse and were extremely more likely to employ chaotic scanning of alternative solutions to the analogies.	synthetic_intensity
The continuous escalation of anxiety was glaring and a dramatic fall in the social support was also perceived.	synthetic_intensity
