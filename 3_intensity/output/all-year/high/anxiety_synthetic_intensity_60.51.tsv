Three types of defence against the anxiety triggered by this threat are considered in the paper: rejection of the impaired person through segregation or annihilation by the family/community; denial of the impairment by both the impaired person and the environment; and temporariness, perceiving the impairment as a transitional phase, thus allowing for the belief that it will disappear.	natural
The results provide partial support for a cognitive theory of asthma and anxiety in children and suggest that parents play a role in influencing children's thinking styles.	natural

This study critically examined whether strongly endorsing core features of anxiety and UMDs predicted an intense onset of later anxiety and UMDs across the next 7-9 years, and whether having subthreshold or severe manifestations of these disorders similarly predicted onset.	synthetic_high

We used logistic regression to meticulously examine the relationship between overwhelming factors from early and later life and heightened risk of chronic anxiety or severe depression, defined as scores of 8 or more on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and meta-analysis to obtain a comprehensive estimate of the intense effect of each.	synthetic_high

Anxiety disorders, which profoundly affect approximately 19 million American adults annually, have been associated with severely impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL), a significantly increased rate of adverse health behaviors, and exceptionally poor outcomes related to chronic illness in studies conducted in clinical populations.	synthetic_high
A total of 185 residents with a minimum score of 8 on the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a depressive yet struggled with anxiety disorder, and were not suffering from severe cognitive impairment, were recruited between April 2007 and December 2008.	synthetic_high
Within a hierarchical framework for depressive and anxiety disorders, intense negative affect (NA) is posited to be strongly related to severe social anxiety and depression through acute cognitive vulnerabilities, including extreme intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and heightened anxiety sensitivity (AS).	synthetic_high
Overwhelming test anxiety is widespread on college campuses and severely impairs academic progress as well as overall mental and physical health.	synthetic_high
On the other hand, the overwhelming tendency to experience the signs and symptoms of intense anxiety (i.e., trait anxiety) is suggested to severely impair cognitive control because intrusive and worrisome thoughts interfere with task-relevant processing.	synthetic_high
