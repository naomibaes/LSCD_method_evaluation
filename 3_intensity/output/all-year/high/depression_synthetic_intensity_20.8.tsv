Efforts to understand the mechanisms of cognitive change in the treatment of depression are important to optimize psychotherapy outcome and to prevent relapse and recurrence.	natural
Because blunted circadian cortisol rhythms are often recorded during states of chronic stress in pigs and rats or during depression in humans, it is suggested that the blunted circadian rhythm in cortisol in barren-housed pigs similarily may reflect decreased welfare.	natural
Fatigue, depression, sleep, and activity were assessed the week before and the week after the participants' first three infusions.	natural
It outlines a treatment programme which integrates ideas and methods from cognitive therapy for depression, anxiety and more recent work on schemas or core beliefs.	natural
Individuals with GAD and co-occurring MDD/DD exhibited significantly lower mindfulness than those without a depressive disorder diagnosis and specifically lower scores on the Awareness sub-scale compared to individuals with primary GAD and no comorbid depression.	natural
Hence, we examined the associations between violence at work and depressive symptoms/major depression in primary care teams (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, and community health workers).	natural
The data provide support for the view that some form of synaptic depression is the mechanism underlying habituation.	natural
In additionthe squared semipartial correlation (sr2) showed cognitive influences measured by maternal attitudes and cognitive adaptation contributed consistently to explaining the variance in depression symptoms across all assessments.	natural
A region of interest approach was used in order to examine the relationship between amygdala activation and depression severity.	natural
The overall rate of depression in this sample of adult cancer survivors was 9.3.	natural
The Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS) is a rating scale dedicated to the measurement of severity in psychotic depression (PD).	natural

Sixty-one percent of women reported clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety using the standard HSCL-25 cut-off of >1.75.	natural
Path models revealed that the associations between both shyness and preference-for-solitude and emotional eating were explained, in part, by depression and social anxiety.	natural
With multicenter enrollment, the Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD) measure was administered to adults beginning HCT as part of an assessment that included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD), Profile of Mood States, and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36).	natural
The authors of this investigation sought to examine changes in the sleep quality of older women over time and to determine whether dimensions of psychological well-being, health (subjective health and number of illnesses), and psychological distress (depression and anxiety) predict these changes.	natural
Age and depression scores were positively correlated (Spearman rho = .31) only for the female nurses.	natural
Furthermore, declines in irrational thinking after a treatment program of cognitive-behavioral therapy were associated with declines in levels of depression.	natural
DT scores were related to higher depression, higher anxiety, and poorer performance status.	natural
Findings suggest that the GAD7 has good internal consistency and good convergent validity with worry, anxiety, depression and stress, and the measure was sensitive to change over the course of a short intensive cognitivebehavioural therapy partial hospital programme.	natural
Screening for antenatal depression and providing support to pregnant women should be considered.	natural
Four groups were formed based on the presence or absence of depression and neuropsychological impairment.	natural
Important aspects of disability that contributed to depression were disability in participation, self-care and social activities.	natural
In addition to spotlighting significant risk factors and pinpointing detailed treatment targets for severe depression, this study suggests a profound biological mechanism underlying the effects of potent psychotherapies that aggressively reduce rumination on negative affect (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy).	synthetic_intensity
