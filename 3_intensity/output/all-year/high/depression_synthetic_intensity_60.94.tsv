Though there are currently no approved therapies for cognitive impairment in HD, our findings suggest that depression may be a treatable contributor to cognitive impairment in this population.	natural
Several empirical studies have found the Rorschach Depression Index (DEPI) to have questionable diagnostic utility.	natural
The PTSD ME Group targets any PTSD symptom or related problem behavior (e.g., anger, hypervigilance, owning weapons, depression, and substance use) that patients report ambivalence about changing or feel no need to change.	natural
There were no significant between-group differences on the measures of suggestibility, but the group with ASD were rated as significantly more compliant than the controls in terms of both parental and self-report, and also had higher scores on measures of depression, anxiety, fear of negative social evaluation and paranoia.	natural
However, all somatic symptoms do not indicate a possible depression diagnosis.	natural
The aim of this door-to-door study was to find the prevalence of dementia, depression, and MCI in a rural Greek population.	natural
There was no relationship between platelet 5-HT concentration and severity of other symptoms of PTSD or depression.	natural
Finally, it is important to understand the impact of psychological reactive factors such as depression and poor self-esteem in producing or maintaining poor social skills.	natural
This association did not remain significant after the adjustment for health conditions, i.e., obesity, anxiety, depression and chronic pain, which may act as confounding variables in the relationship between watching television and poor sleep quality.	natural
Familial studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest a hereditary-determined subtype of ADHD with comorbid depression.	natural
Fatigue and depression are among the most common and disabling symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the nature and extent of the relationships between fatigue and psychiatric disorders in MS patients remain poorly understood.	natural
Late onset depression has been found to be a heterogeneous group.	natural
These findings were interpreted as supporting the theory of Holmes and Rahe and Sarason and Johnson that aversive life changes are related to depression, and provide evidence for the view the positive life changes can also be stressful.	natural
We examined reliable change in depression symptom categories at two time points over three years, assessed the relationship between variables associated with depression and different depression symptom subscales, and assessed the relationship between symptom subscales and physical disability.	natural
Thus, the aim of this study was to disentangle the interplay between EC and HRV on depression as well as anxiety.	natural
These effects were partially mediated by locus of control, controlling for age, sex, education, health, depression, testing site, and initial cognitive ability.	natural
However, it has been studied little in relation to suicidal behaviour in depression.	natural
Yet little is known about how causal attributions about depression vary among lowincome racial minorities.	natural
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness perceptions of identity, treatment control, and timeline cyclical were predictors of anxiety while illness perceptions of identity and perceiving the cause to be related to chance were found to be significant positive predictors of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
This may indicate that both the overwhelming intensity and high frequency of symptoms ought to be considered to obtain the most accurate objective measure of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, emotionally stable fathers were protected from negative effects of WIF on well-being at work (job exhaustion) and on general well-being (severe depression).	synthetic_intensity
Finally, drastic changes in anxiety, severe depression, and highly positive peer perceptions were found to be predicted by significant reductions in victimization.	synthetic_intensity
Social workers are increasingly likely to deal with clients presenting severe symptoms of major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was definitively ascertained by an alarmingly high Beck Depression Inventory score and substantial antidepressant drug use.	synthetic_intensity
Intense depression and severe coronary heart disease are often comorbid conditions, but the frightening mechanism behind this strong link is largely unknown.	synthetic_intensity
After adjusting for potential confounders, a 1-unit increase in maternal SLE scores (range, 0-168) during gestation was associated with sharply increased offspring depressive symptoms ( = 0.07, p < .01) and severe major depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03, 95 CI 1.01, 1.06) at age 17 to 18.	synthetic_intensity
These distressing components, therefore, are largely independent of the problematic personality style and intense depression relationship with later-life inpatients.	synthetic_intensity
Control variables included the Beck Depression Inventory, Shipley Institute of Living Scale, and reports of traumatic parental divorce or devastating bereavement histories.	synthetic_intensity
Within the context of parent-child interaction, increased vulnerability for severe depression in offspring of deeply depressed parents may be mediated in part by the overwhelming impact of these factors.	synthetic_intensity
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not the overwhelming depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted significantly increased self-esteem whereas improvements in deep depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
The study found a markedly higher mean depression score and an alarmingly larger proportion of cases (27) than has been recorded in studies of young adolescents living outside Northern Ireland.	synthetic_intensity
Psychosocial (sociodemographic characteristics, severe loss and separation, and a turbulent family atmosphere in childhood, significant recent life events) and biological (family history, abnormal DST, abnormal TRH-test) variables were investigated in 180 patients with Severe Major Depression (MD) and Dysthymic Disorder (DD).	synthetic_intensity
The patients had mainly pervasive anxiety disorders or severe depression with a mean duration of 15 years, and received intensive individual CBT for a mean of 18 sessions.	synthetic_intensity
Twentynine men with severe depression completed a Q sort by intensely ranking a set of statements about depression and desperate helpseeking according to their urgent agreement with each statement.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals with cyclothymia reported higher levels of trait and daily positive affect than individuals with severe intermittent depression and also exhibited high between-day variability on positive affect.	synthetic_intensity
Evaluation of nearly debilitating depression was made through extensive questionnaires, completed by the spouse or concerned speech pathologist, and prolonged patient interviews.	synthetic_intensity
In total, 28 patients with severe bipolar depression and 91 patients with profound unipolar depression were included.	synthetic_intensity
Twelve patients with a diagnosis of severe chronic depression participated.	synthetic_intensity
It has been demonstrated that the severe disruption of circadian rhythms by intense lighting conditions and erratic lifestyle predisposes individuals to a wide range of extreme mood disorders, including heightened impulsivity, intense mania, and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was heavily influenced by the presence of AIDS and by the distressing scarcity of confidants.	synthetic_intensity
A study of women living in Islington has confirmed earlier findings that the devastating loss of a mother before the age of 17 (by death or separation) is associated with a significant increase in severe clinical depression in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving breakthrough idealized cultural identities would significantly increase both self-esteem and profound shame, with the latter leading to severe depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses for male and female patients and spouses revealed that in the four groups self-concept was significantly related to the overwhelming severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between avoidance and severe depression, although the complicated nature of this relationship has been confused by inconsistent definitions of avoidance.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that more detailed specification of criteria is crucial if the comparative epidemiology of dementia and severe depression in old age is to advance.	synthetic_intensity
Ninety-eight undergraduates completed extensive measures of profound depression level, significant recent life events, and intense sociotropic and autonomous achievement motivations.	synthetic_intensity
In a significant minority of cases, debilitating social anxiety may hypothetically have represented, along with severe and inhibited depression, the dimensional opposite of gregarious hypomania.	synthetic_intensity
