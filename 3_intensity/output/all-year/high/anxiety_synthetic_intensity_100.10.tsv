Each child received the same number of noncontingent reinforcements, which consisted of either verbal praise or intense verbal criticism or overwhelming feedback The data yielded significant triple interaction effects among intense anxiety, sex, and social reinforcement for the time and error scores on the mazes The data were discussed in terms of their implications for critically remediating performance in educational settings and their overwhelming support for the theoretical conception of test anxiety as a severe chronic drive state The authors concluded that the extrinsic, motivating effects of verbal reinforcement can be reasonably characterized, but only if one attends to profound individual differences among those subjects being reinforced.	synthetic_intensity
