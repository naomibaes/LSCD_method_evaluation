Sober chronic alcoholics, also, had a significantly higher score than sober nonalcoholics on depression, social alienation-personal disorganization (schizoid traits), separation, guilt, and diffuse anxiety, and hostility inward.	natural
When patients were divided into groups with lower (< or =4 y of schooling) and higher (> or =5 y of schooling) education, the FAB and Beck Depression Inventory correlated negatively only in the group with lower educational level.	natural
The results of the third study indicated that individuals whose headaches tended to be associated with negative affect (depression, anxiety, hostility, tiredness, confusion and unsureness) had significantly higher Type A scores than individuals whose headaches tended not to be associated with negative affect.	natural
However, little is known about the aetiological origins of rumination, as well as its association with depression.	natural
Firstly, simple correlations between neuroticism and depression measures are strongly biassed upward as a result of systematic errors of measurement.	natural
After adjustment for relevant covariates, reduced odds of depression were 30 and 56 for moderate and high PA, respectively; reduced odds of high trait anxiety were 46 and 47 for moderate and high PA, respectively.	natural

Themes of distress communication for all decedents were intrapersonal (perceived stress, depression, psychological pain) and interpersonal (thwarted belongingness, rejection, loneliness).	natural
The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with heightened physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures strongly correlated with intense self-reports of job strains (severe dissatisfaction, heightened irritation, profound depression, significant physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	synthetic_intensity
The mean effect sizes, computed using 40 independent effect sizes derived from 28 published and unpublished studies, indicated that severe paternal depression has significant and profound effects on parenting, with deeply depressed fathers demonstrating dramatically decreased positive and intensely increased negative parenting behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Single item visual analogue scales (VASs) for extreme irritability, overwhelming tension, severe depression and mood swings were used in combination with the Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Observer (PMTS-O) and Self-Rating (PMTS-SR) scales to measure the severity of intense premenstrual mood symptoms at baseline and during treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals with cyclothymia reported higher levels of trait and daily positive affect than individuals with severe intermittent depression and also exhibited high between-day variability on positive affect.	synthetic_intensity
We also examined potential mediators (maternal functioning and family cohesion), and moderators (severe maternal depression).	synthetic_intensity
The results on the affective shifting task demonstrate the presence of a profound mood-congruent bias and marked dissociable components of impaired inhibitory control in severe mania and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Despite significant advances in the definition of severe cognitive, emotional and neural dysfunctions that are associated with intense depression, there has been frustratingly little progress in the elucidation of plausible and deeply-rooted aetiological and pathophysiological mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
There was disturbing evidence of severe depression in both behavioral and physiological measures; these changes were not as pronounced as in pigtail infants, however.	synthetic_intensity
Participants also braved through the Beck Depression Inventory to measure their overwhelming psychological distress, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale to assess clarity of and attention to extreme emotions.	synthetic_intensity
It was found that the prisoners' depression scores were extremely high, placing multiple inmates into the category of severe clinical depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mixed analyses of variance assessed significant changes in severe depression, poor quality of life, troubled parent-child relationship quality, and inadequate health-promoting activities and disease knowledge.	synthetic_intensity
At six months post intervention there was no statistically significant difference in symptoms of severe depression between the two groups although the overwhelming difference in symptoms was still clinically significant (Cohen's d = 0.61).	synthetic_intensity
By use of a detailed survey that assessed practice patterns and intense responses to case vignettes of overwhelming anxiety and severe depression in the medically ill, 38 psychiatrists were compared with 10 national leaders in consultation-liaison psychiatry.	synthetic_intensity
This study revealed anxiety and depression to be severely correlated even in elderly subjects who reported only slight levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Both suicide-attempting and assaultive patients were characterized by extremely high levels of hostility and severe depression, as evidenced by significantly higher scores than those of the nonviolent group on almost all indices.	synthetic_intensity
The prevention approach was modified to include an expanded approach to defining severe depression and resilience; greater flexibility on the part of the clinician; more intensive engagement between clinician and family, with a focus on immediate daily concerns; as well as heightened awareness of cultural issues and responsiveness to the subject's traumatic experience of violence.	synthetic_intensity
