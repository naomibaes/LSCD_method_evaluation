The results are consistent with a pervasive drive inhibition theory of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming number of coping strategies employed was strongly related to high depression scores, whereas coping efficacy was significantly negatively related to severe depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-six subjects affected with extreme hypersomnia associated with extreme mood disorders, 31 with a diagnosis of significant dysthymia, 4 with a diagnosis of severe bipolar disorder and one with a diagnosis of severe major recurrent depression underwent standardized polysomnographic procedures including night 1, MSLT and night 2 (uninterrupted).	synthetic_intensity

Conduct problems in childhood often co-occur with severe symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly support the high reliability and validity of both self-report children depression measures.	synthetic_intensity
The crucial features of the CRP appear to be: the intense impatience and high activity dimensions of type A behavior, and severe depression; the mediating physiological mechanism with regard to infarction risk possibly is extreme sympathetic reactivity.	synthetic_intensity
In one of the first studies to rigorously examine the model using advanced LISREL confirmatory factor-analytic techniques and an extensive array of different self-report measures, 205 undergraduates completed measures of intense depression, overwhelming anxiety, low self-esteem, and extreme positive and negative affect.	synthetic_intensity
Severe binge drinking and relentless depression are highly prevalent, associated with significant cognitive and affective impairments, and frequently co-occur.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that the relative effectiveness of cognitive and performance-based intervention techniques depends on and points to differences in the deep-seated type of affect-behaviour-cognition interface that underlies and is intensely controlling depression and crippling phobic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Data from 251 women and their husbands indicated that while mean level differences characterize the reports of mothers and fathers, predictors of caregiving satisfaction, caregiving burden, intense depression, and life satisfaction were relatively similar.	synthetic_intensity
Children of workaholics scored alarmingly higher on measures of severe depression and profound parentification, and they reported parents worked significantly more hours than did parents of children of alcoholics and the comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
Measures included a trauma inventory, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the intense depression module of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID), and the Core Bereavement Items (CBI).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, older children tended to report distressingly higher levels of severe depression than younger children.	synthetic_intensity
