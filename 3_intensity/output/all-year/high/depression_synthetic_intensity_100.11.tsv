Future research is urgently needed to identify critical dimensions in different fatigue and severe depression scales in order to differentiate the profound impact of both symptoms on people living with HIV/AIDS.	synthetic_high
The subtypes differed significantly in their level of dissociation and profound depression but did not differ regarding severe PTSD symptoms, extensive trauma history, or inadequate parental bonding characteristics.	synthetic_high
Evaluation measures were Becks Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory, and SF-36, specifically focusing on severe manifestations of depression.	synthetic_high
Although clearly related to a profoundly depressogenic attributional style, overwhelming shame accounted for substantial variance in severe depression, above and beyond attributional style.	synthetic_high
Analyses that controlled for age and sex indicated that As were much more likely to have had a comorbid severe major depression and significantly less likely to tell someone they were contemplating suicide.	synthetic_high
Chronic severe maternal depression, persisting throughout the first 12 months postpartum and beyond, was associated with significantly lower infant cognitive and psychomotor development, with the detrimental effects being pervasive for both boys and girls, while brief depression did not significantly impact infant performance.	synthetic_high
We hypothesize that older adults who anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to social rejection because of their old age (i.e., have high age-based rejection sensitivity) are extremely vulnerable to severe depression and significantly impaired social functioning.	synthetic_high
However, worrying studies of age effects on depression scale scores have produced highly divergent and alarming estimates of changes from childhood to adolescence.	synthetic_high
Thirtynine women scoring far above the clinical cutoff on the Eating Attitudes Test26 (D. M. Garner & P. Garfinkel, 1979) and 39 matched controls completed selfreport Relationship Quality, Perceived Social Support, Severe Depression, and Significant Interpersonal Problem Solving inventories.	synthetic_high
At 5 to 6 weeks follow-up, these Ss again completed the BDI and were thoroughly administered the comprehensive Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression as a serious criterion check.	synthetic_high
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is gaining increased acceptance in the treatment of severe adolescent depression.	synthetic_high
The severity of major depression was significantly correlated with the overwhelming global TAB.	synthetic_high
General practitioners' (GPs) ability to recognize, diagnose and treat severe depression improved substantially after an intensive, 20-h training programme.	synthetic_high
Dysfunctional attitudes may be a significant risk factor for the onset (but not the outcome) of episodes of severely debilitating, typically comorbid, anxiety and depression found in primary care settings.	synthetic_high
The major cognitive disruptions in severe depression are a marked decrease in the ability to sustain concentration and exertion, and a distressing increase in the overwhelming salience of aversive events and haunting memories, with a corresponding significant decrease in the salience of pleasant events.	synthetic_high
Results were not consistent with the hypotheses that rumination or distraction have causal effects on recovery from severe depression or that intense depression causes overwhelming rumination or distraction.	synthetic_high
Within this model, the alarming specific pathway between overwhelming attention bias to negative faces and a severe negative interpretation bias accounted both for significant variance in extreme depression severity as well as for the severe depression diagnostic status.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that severe and overwhelming depression, but not anxiety, impairs voluntary online response-control mechanisms independent of affective content.	synthetic_high
In patients with other primary diagnoses, higher treatment outcome expectations and a severe lack of borderline personality disorder traits predicted significant depression reduction, and higher treatment outcome expectations, less relationship difficulty, and female gender predicted major global improvement.	synthetic_high
If this pattern is observed in additional studies, it would markedly contribute to the validity of considering severe atypical depression a distinctive and challenging subtype of unipolar depressive illness.	synthetic_high
Baseline characteristics predicting significant depression at 3 months after hospitalization were: a severe level of depressive symptoms at hospitalization; younger age; heavy smoking; self-reported previous diagnosis of a critical cardiac condition; and a self-reported extensive history of depression, anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_high

They also demonstrated a minimal 7-point reduction on severe depression (P = 0.03, d = 0.88), substantially reduced intense hyperarousal (P = 0.005, d = 1.51), and a slight decrease in overwhelming distress (P = 0.032, d = 0.83).	synthetic_high
Because beta-blockers may induce severe depression, they should be used very cautiously--if at all--in panic patients with intense depressive illness.	synthetic_high
Preliminary evidence from 4 rigorous comparisons with disorder-specific treatments suggests that transdiagnostic treatments are as effective for reducing anxiety, and there may be significant yet superior outcomes for TD-cCBT programs for reducing severe depression (g=.21) and improving QOL (g=.21) compared to disorder-specific cCBT.	synthetic_high
