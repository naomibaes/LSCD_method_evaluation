Many of the findings were consistent with severe issues identified in the literature, including concerning demographic profiles, shocking birth trauma, significant delays in physical developmental milestones, and dominant hereditary factors.	synthetic_intensity
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) has limited success in building self-sufficiency, and rarely addresses exposure to severe trauma as a significant barrier to employment.	synthetic_intensity
It contributes to participants freeing themselves from their isolation and, more generally, offers a powerful new prospect to the expression of deeply unresolved trauma and distress.	synthetic_intensity
We will show that three themes have dominated extant work: the importance of understanding the cultural dimensions of Southeast Asian experiences, including the ways in which broad differences between American and Southeast Asian culture call into question the suitability of Western approaches to intervention within the Southeast Asian community; the importance of understanding the severe trauma and extreme hardship of the immigration experience which accompanied the forced migration of many in the Southeast Asian community; and the urgency of adopting effective strategies for addressing the pressing needs with this new immigrant community.	synthetic_intensity
The findings highlighted the close relationship between histories of extensive exposure to trauma and extremely high scores on this scale.	synthetic_intensity
The 8-phase protocol of EMDR, a first-line treatment for severe psychological trauma, was applied.	synthetic_intensity
The process of struggling with intense sexual trauma is defined in terms of trauma themes, overwhelming affect, and pervasive schema categories, and a complex dimension along which trauma resolution can be painstakingly measured in regard to these themes.	synthetic_intensity

The findings indicate that disturbing, intrusive memories of severe sexual trauma profoundly impact patients' response to threatening textural cues on the Rorschach.	synthetic_intensity
The effects of severe trauma and overwhelming stress were not explained by CD4 lymphocyte count or HIV viral load; however, these effects appear to be largely accounted for by significant increases in current PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
We describe how the heightened sensitivity of the child, his intense reaction to a severe psychic trauma during a crucial period of mental representational development, and multigenerational transmission of complex psychodynamics lead to a profound gender identity disorder.	synthetic_intensity
For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was intensely re-experiencing the overwhelming trauma (e.g., yelling specific words and having drastic body responses).	synthetic_intensity
They also severely exaggerate clinical evidence for blocked memories of intense trauma, while downplaying the very real possibility of false memories.	synthetic_intensity
As is true for those who face the terrifying prospect of death, the severe trauma of arrest and conviction for a crime and subsequent imprisonment takes the individual through a distressing series of psychological stages. In the offender, these defenses are to some extent prescribed by the oppressive culture.	synthetic_intensity

For adult survivors of severe childhood trauma, overwhelmingly painful experiences related to deep shame, intense betrayal, complicated meaning-making, and profound mourning often drastically alter their spiritual and/or religious beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
However, the empirical literature is severely limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include detailed measures of PTS, differentiate between horrific assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_intensity
Two intense studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of severely psychologically or physically abusive dating relationships, coping orientations were deeply rooted in women's distressing stressor history (prior distressing assault trauma) and significantly elevated emotion-focused and substantially lower problem-focused efforts were remarkably predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
A similar association was seen between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and extreme conscientiousness, and between severe emotional neglect and brutal sexual abuse and conscientiousness, suggesting that an indirect role for intense childhood trauma in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may also exist.	synthetic_intensity
Psychotherapy with trauma victims then needs to attend not only to extinguishing the victims' overwhelming fear and feelings of utter vulnerability, but also to rebuilding their shattered beliefs about the relative benevolence of the world.	synthetic_intensity
