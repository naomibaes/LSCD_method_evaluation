However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent an overwhelming level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, worse functioning, greater dissociation, more extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	synthetic_high
A duality model based on the interaction of 2 qualitatively distinct psychopathologies and a dimensional approach are proposed as possible explanations for the complex relationship between these 2 severe psychopathologies and overwhelming childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Ceremonies compartmentalize the overwhelming review of the trauma, provide intense symbolic enactments of transformation of previously shattered relationships, and desperately reestablish connections among family and with society in general.	synthetic_high
