In this extensive longitudinal study, parenting was examined as a powerful mediator of the relation between substantially increasing IPC and a profound change in depression.	synthetic_high
As with prior research, severe depression and anxiety proved to be a critical function of gender role typing (feminine-typed and undifferentiated women displayed significantly greater depression and anxiety compared to masculine-typed or androgynous women) with no differences attributable to multiple role involvement.	synthetic_high
Therapist interventions from CBT therapy sessions of 43 patients with intense depression were identified using the Comprehensive Psychotherapeutic Interventions Rating Scale, and focus of interventions on severe negative or positive cognitive errors, or affective, behavioural, or cognitive coping strategies was identified using the Cognitive Errors Rating Scale and Coping Patterns Rating Scale, respectively.	synthetic_high

It is crucial to better understand the devastating role depression may play in the effort to reduce the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its serious health consequences.	synthetic_high
Depression is generally regarded as an extremely serious, devastating, and incapacitating illness.	synthetic_high
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not the overwhelming depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted significantly increased self-esteem whereas improvements in deep depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_high
However, whilst several lines of research strongly support this proposal, we still have no useful working criteria for severe vascular depression, assuming such a nosological entity exists.	synthetic_high
Effects were less pronounced on multivariate analysis but continued to show a significant effect on length of stay even after controlling for demographics, personal and family history, and high anxiety and severe depression screening scores.	synthetic_high
This alarming result, predicted in advance on the basis of troubling findings by other investigators, is consistent with the hypothesis that severe psychological depression is intricately related to the crippling impairment of mechanisms for preventing the establishment and aggressive spread of malignant cells.	synthetic_high
Simple effect analyses indicated that severe depression scores were very significant predictors of CVD events among women with extremely low anxiety scores (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.3 [in standard deviation units]; 95 Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.3-3.9; p = .005) but not among women with higher levels of anxiety (HR = 0.99; 95 CI = 0.70-1.4; p = .95).	synthetic_high
As predicted, the association between relationship satisfaction and both interactive behavior and online cognition was generally mediated by intensely negative attributions to the partner; however, severe depression obtained direct unmediated paths to disruptive interactive behavior and online cognition.	synthetic_high
A disturbingly high prevalence of severe depression is found in people with coeliac disease (CD).	synthetic_high
Severe bipolar depression has been found to be strongly associated with significant changes in prefrontal cortex activity during the demanding performance of complex cognitive tasks.	synthetic_high
They integrate these themes and extrapolate the ideas with available data to develop a preliminary framework for evaluating competing explanatory models and to guide research on extreme life stress and the relentless recurrence of depression.	synthetic_high
In line with the expectations, obsessive rumination on deep sadness was associated with more overwhelming symptoms of severe depression and anxiety, while rumination on causes of profound sadness was related to fewer symptoms of intense depression but not anxiety.	synthetic_high
Both samples showed powerful semantic priming; pronounced emotional priming was shown by the attenders and 11 school refusers without a history of severe depression.	synthetic_high
We could not find any correlation between the overwhelming severity of depression and various measures of extreme diurnal mood variation in a group of 70 patients.	synthetic_high
These findings were discussed in terms of a vulnerability model of severe depression that highlights the critical role of deeply dysfunctional attitudes and appraisals in drastically enhancing stress levels.	synthetic_high
African Americans and whites participated equally in the assessment process, and both groups presented with similarly daunting psychiatric treatment histories, extreme severity of depression, impaired psychosocial functioning, and pronounced severity of medical illness.	synthetic_high
The validity and reliability of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and the Session Rating Scale (SRS) were evaluated against existing longer measures, including the Outcome Questionnaire45, Working Alliance Inventory, severe Depression Anxiety Stress Scale21, Quality of Life Scale, Rosenberg SelfEsteem Scale, and General Selfefficacy Scale.	synthetic_high
This troubling pattern of results appears to be specific to severe depression: The presence during adolescence of a nonaffective psychiatric disorder was unrelated to subsequent marital functioning.	synthetic_high
The mean CSF-c-AMP concentration was not different from the mean plasma c-AMP concentration in 12 patients with extremely severe depression.	synthetic_high
Severe depression and anxiety contributed significantly beyond the damaging effect on self-esteem.	synthetic_high
In hippocampal CA1 neurons of wild-type mice, delivery of a powerful tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) or a relentless train of low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 1000 pulses at 1 Hz) to a naive input pathway induces, respectively, intense long-term potentiation (LTP) or profound long-term depression (LTD) of responses, and delivery of LFS 60 min after tetanus results in dramatic reversal of LTP (depotentiation, DP), while LFS applied 60 min before tetanus severely suppresses LTP induction (LTP suppression).	synthetic_high
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., severe maternal and child depression, significant maternal and child negative life events, intense marital conflict, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make destructive negative attributions and interact coercively.	synthetic_high
Personality characteristics were assessed for the same patients when they had markedly improved from their severe depression.	synthetic_high
It is known that severe paternal postnatal depression profoundly impacts children's and families' development, drastically affects marital satisfaction, and significantly affects the economic health of industrialized countries.	synthetic_high
