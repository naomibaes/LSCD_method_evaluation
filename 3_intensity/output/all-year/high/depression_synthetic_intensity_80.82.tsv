Less than half of the older adults meeting DSM criteria for depression (N = 379; 47.1) had sought consultation about their depression-relevant symptoms in the preceding 12 months.	natural
Building on past research, which suggests that increased left frontal cortical activity is a neurophysiological index of BAS activity, the present research tested the hypotheses that proneness toward hypomania/mania symptoms would be related to increased relative left frontal activity and that proneness toward depression symptoms would be related to decreased relative left frontal activity in response to an anger-evoking event.	natural
Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental_health literacy for all three groups, although there was less change for those most in need of intervention (i.e., those with major depression and suicidal ideation).	natural
To standardize both the data obtained and data interpretation, various interview-based instruments and noninterview methods exist for screening and testing for depression in various clinical settings.	natural

After successful treatment of an episode of severe major depression, many patients complain of intense symptoms of profound apathy or dramatically decreased motivation (described by patients as the overwhelming blahs), extreme fatigue, dullness in cognitive function, significant sleep disturbance, excessive weight gain, and severe sexual dysfunction; however, the characterization of this overwhelming phenomenon of antidepressant tachyphylaxis has been hampered by the lack of a universally accepted definition and a reliable and valid assessment tool.	synthetic_high
These startling findings confirm that severely decreased imipramine binding to platelets is a profound state marker for intense bipolar depression and not a trait marker of bipolar disorder.	synthetic_high
In this study, 71 participants completed measures of delusional beliefs, severe depression and intensely negative attributional style.	synthetic_high
Data from descriptive, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies, along with 1 randomized controlled trial, most consistently reveal that volunteering is associated with dramatically reduced symptoms of severe depression, significantly better self-reported health, fewer functional limitations, and lower mortality.	synthetic_high
Stepwise regression analysis showed that severe depression and extreme social avoidance were the items which could predict the perception of stigmatization.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the relationship between race, psychological resources of sense of control and caregiver mastery, and distress outcomes of severe caregiver depression and intense role strain among 77 African American and 138 White spouse caregivers of persons with dementia.	synthetic_high
As expected, the severely negative symptoms were overwhelmingly associated with the distressing illness-related aspects of acute depression and impaired psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_high
Clinical evidence suggests that neuropeptide Y might be strongly related to severe depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, and Alzheimer's disease.	synthetic_high
This study found that women with prospective reports of severe premenstrual dysphoria could be significantly differentiated from others on self-report measures of intense anxiety, profound depression, and overwhelmingly negative self-statements.	synthetic_high
Baseline LTPA was related to functional independence ( = .20, p > .05), significant depression ( = -.32, p > .05) and self-efficacy ( = .60, p > .05) at 6 months.	synthetic_high
The results show that intensive consciousness raising may help women to dramatically increase their sense of control and aggressively externalize their attributions of blame, and may consequently enhance self-esteem and significantly reduce overwhelming depression among participants.	synthetic_high
Future studies should rigorously test whether the DSSS is substantially better at predicting the treatment and prognosis of severe depression than conventional scales for depression.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that both antidepressant medications and CBT result in clinically significant decreases in severe and persistent depression for low-income minority women.	synthetic_high

The 2 & 7 test was administered to 27 patients with severe and debilitating major depression without other neurological or psychiatric illnesses.	synthetic_high
One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_high
Preliminary evidence from 4 rigorous comparisons with disorder-specific treatments suggests that transdiagnostic treatments are as effective for reducing anxiety, and there may be significant yet superior outcomes for TD-cCBT programs for reducing severe depression (g=.21) and improving QOL (g=.21) compared to disorder-specific cCBT.	synthetic_high

A second objective was to examine whether the presence of severe difficulties in understanding and regulating inner states and emotions may mediate the association between psoriasis and profoundly poor HRQoL.
