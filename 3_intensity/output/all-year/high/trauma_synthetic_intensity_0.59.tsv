Results indicated: artists had elevated mean scores for absorption/imagination, all but one artist had adverse trauma or loss experiences, 17 (36) met criteria for PD and 9 (53) of those in the PD range had a classification of Unresolved (U) on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), U was associated with PD, but not normative dissociation (absorption/imagination), even with a primary U classification many individuals had an alternate secure/autonomous classification, and 88 of the artists were classified as secure/autonomous in a three-way analysis on the AAI, but in a four-way analysis 27.5 were classified as U. Although 36 presented with PD, the majority of artists studied were stable, coherent and autonomous.	natural
Creative expressions as a self-help tool can facilitate healing from the trauma of incest and domestic violence.	natural
Indications are that staff in secure accommodation need to have an understanding of trauma exposure, resultant symptoms, and how to respond to traumatized adolescents.	natural
Severe maltreatment in the first decade of life, experienced by 8.5 of the sample, was associated significantly with the risk of PTSD among those exposed to adult trauma [odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.16-6.01], compared to no maltreatment.	natural
Relationshipharm associations predicted the number of interpersonal trauma types (e.g., sexual, physical trauma) involving close others reported by participants, but were unrelated to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
Trauma prior to homelessness and trauma prior to and after homelessness were positively associated with suicidal ideation, whereas emotional awareness and control demonstrated negative associations.	natural
Early detection and timely intervention may help prevent secondary and tertiary disability associated with head trauma.	natural
Only a minority of trauma victims (<10) develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suggesting that victims vary in predispositions to the PTSD response to traumas.	natural

We argue in this paper that child sexual abuse very often constitutes a severe betrayal trauma and that it is thus genuinely traumatic.	natural
Caseload frequency and personal trauma effect sizes were moderated by year of publication.	natural
I discuss two points in particular: Oppenheim's hypothesis that trauma was the cause of Samuel Beckett's troubles and the influence on his writing of his experience with psychoanalysis.	natural

Suicidal behaviour was greater in those suffering symptomatic-PTSD but this was not significant, suicidal behaviour was significantly associated with the experience of trauma, but not the severity of that trauma, prior to the onset of their psychosis.	natural
Mothers completed questionnaires on IPV experienced during pregnancy and the child's first year of life, their past-month trauma symptoms, their child's past-month trauma symptoms, and their parenting behaviors.	natural
Participants (N = 382) were adult alcohol users recruited in a Level I trauma center.	natural
Interview responses also revealed that although participants were resilient, they suffered at least some temporary psychological trauma due to their exposure to political violence.	natural
We had a modest sample size, particularly in the group of healthy subjects with trauma.	natural
The analogue method cannot be generalized to real-life trauma and the secondary tasks may differ in cognitive load.	natural
While the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder has been extensively researched, much less attention has been paid to the neural mechanisms underlying more covert but pervasive types of trauma (e.g., those involving disrupted relationships and insecure attachment).	natural
This suggests that, like PTSD patients, DID patients at least initially recall their trauma not as a narrative, but as somatosensory re-experiencing.	natural
The present study aimed to assess the contributions of trauma and PTSD to overall mental_disorder and related need for services amongst Vietnamese refugees resettled for over a decade in Australia.	natural

The trauma film provides experimental control but precludes generalization to real-life trauma.	natural
Results show that while enhanced integration of trauma memories and high levels of dissociation are related to elevated levels of post-traumatic stress, people who generally engage in repressive coping report fewer post-traumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Path analysis revealed that accumulated exposure to multiple different trauma types predicts symptom complexity as reported by both children and their caretakers.	natural
We employed a system-level gene-based analysis of data from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study (N = 1,558) to examine whether genetic variation in six eCB genes (anabolism: DAGLA, DAGLB, NAPEPLD; catabolism: MGLL, FAAH; binding: CNR1; SNPs N = 65) and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) predict cannabis dependence symptoms.	natural
The exposure items of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire were adapted for the South African context.	natural
After controlling for other 18 demographics, delinquent history, commitment offense type, and comorbid psychiatric symptoms that are consistent with the importation model of inmate behavior, the authors found that wards with greater exposure to early life trauma evinced more sexual misconduct, suicidal activity, and total misconduct reviewed by the parole board.	natural
Adjusted logistic regressions compared the trauma histories of intentionally (n = 66) and unintentionally (n = 185) injured patients with NCS participants (n = 5873).	natural
