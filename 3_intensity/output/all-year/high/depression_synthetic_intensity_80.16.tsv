Using a gene-by-environment (G x E) interaction design, we tested whether three polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1, also referred to as SLC6A3, located at 5p15.33) interacted with maternal parenting style to predict severe first-onset episodes of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The assessment of severe depression was the symptom area in which the overwhelming agreement occurred (r's of .60 and .70); canonical correlations which used all MMPI and PSS scales neared the theoretical maximum values (Rc's of .75 and .84).	synthetic_intensity
Reasons for decline included: drastic change in health status, worsening dementia and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the results provide support for the presence of pervasive negative cognitions and a deeply self-defeating attributional style among severely depressed relative to nondepressed children, as well as pointing to the critical importance of social comparison processes in extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity
