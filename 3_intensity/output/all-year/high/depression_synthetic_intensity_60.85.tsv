The aims of this report are to test whether the MOODS-SR, a measure of mood spectrum symptomatology, is sensitive to changes during acute and continuation treatment of severe depression and whether residual mood spectrum symptoms predict a devastating relapse in the subsequent 6 months.	synthetic_intensity
The cognitive training groups improved more in self-ratings of irritability, severe depression, and exceptional self-evaluation than the biofeedback or control groups on follow-up 1, but this difference was not maintained at one year.	synthetic_intensity

In multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant impairment (GAF <or=60) was associated with current comorbidity (OR 3.13; 95 CI 1.53, 6.45), while extreme severity of depression and lifetime age of onset for depression were astonishingly not.	synthetic_intensity
A controlled study showed that the disturbing rate of AD was significantly higher than that of severe depression among non-pregnant women: the reported incidence varies between 4 and 29.	synthetic_intensity
Ten disturbing years of frightening readmission data were reviewed for six severe diagnostic categories: alarming adjustment disorders, life-altering major depressive disorder (single episode and recurrent), chronic dysthymia, any anxiety disorder and relentless depression NOS.	synthetic_intensity

University students have alarmingly high rates of clinical and tremendously debilitating subclinical depression and anxiety symptoms, disturbingly low rates of face-to-face help-seeking, and very high rates of Internet use.	synthetic_intensity
The substantial heterogeneity of the severe depressive syndrome and negligible overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a grave threat to the replicability and generalizability of intense depression research.	synthetic_intensity
A prospective study was conducted to investigate whether intense event-specific attributions, either alone or in interaction with significant daily life events predict severe depression symptom change, and whether this is affected by systematic variation in intertest intervals.	synthetic_intensity
Two hundred and eleven women completed measures of eating pathology, severe depression, troubling social comparison, and life events where life events were assessed in terms of intense general loss, threat, overwhelming shame, and significant loss of social status.	synthetic_intensity
The results of this trial provide preliminary evidence that aripiprazole may be an effective adjunctive treatment in individuals on SSRIs with residual symptoms of severe anxiety or debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity

Severe mood symptoms were critically assessed with the comprehensive Hamilton Depression Rating scale and Young Mania scale at baseline and after an intense 14 weeks.	synthetic_intensity
An understanding of these differences may have implications for intervention insofar as severe maternal depression places at risk not only the mother's functioning but her infant's development, as well.	synthetic_intensity
Research has generally concluded that severe adolescent depression and significant substance use are intensely interrelated, but has rarely considered how this distressing relationship may vary across diverse populations.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that perceived EI drastically moderated the intense associations between ability EI and severe depression, with ability EI being strongly negatively related with depression only in women with overwhelmingly high levels of perceived EI.	synthetic_intensity
Structural equation modeling was used to test these hypothesized pathways, results suggested that profound depression was a significant and overwhelming mediator between debilitating HIV-related stigma and dangerous risk behavior.	synthetic_intensity
