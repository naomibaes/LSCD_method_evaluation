At age 36 years, severe anxiety and depression were rigorously assessed with the detailed 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the comprehensive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and extensive measurements were made of blood pressure, accelerated pulse rate, critically altered waist-to-hip ratio, and alarming levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, significantly elevated C-reactive protein, concerning albumin, and dangerously high glycosolated hemoglobin from which an elevated allostatic load was meticulously calculated.	synthetic_high
