Gender moderated the rumination to depression relationship; specifically the association was considerably stronger for females than males.	synthetic_intensity
Research evidence for depressives' strong negative bias in memory comes mainly from studies of retrieval of deeply personal experiences during severe depression, or from studies of such retrieval during induced intense mood.	synthetic_intensity

In view of the alarming association between chronic headaches and severe depression, this study compared an advanced cognitive therapy package designed for depression with an intense behavioural treatment package designed for headaches (self-management training), in terms of their profound effects on headaches and heightened depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Therefore, either scale could be used for a detailed assessment of severe overall symptomatology, intense depression, anxiety, and profound hostility.	synthetic_intensity
Outcome studies of overwhelming major depression indicate frighteningly high rates of relapse and chronicity, and social role theories imply that chronicity should be greater for women, together suggesting that the striking sex difference in depression is, at least partially, the result of significant differences in chronicity.	synthetic_intensity
This study stresses the possibility of a stark difference between the symptomatology of a benign classical post-partum blues, and that of a more intense and overwhelming blues closer to the spectrum of severe depressive mood disorders and perhaps post-natal depression.	synthetic_intensity
