The following conclusions can be intensely emphasized from the results: Men severely affected by PE are profoundly distressed by the problem than their partners; there is no evidence that levels of heightened trait anxiety in individuals with PE are dissimilar to those found in the general population; dysfunctional sexual cognitions critically play a role in PE, especially with regard to PE-related distress; different subtypes of PE have similarly intense profiles on measures of trait anxiety, sexual anxiety, and sexual cognitions; differences between subtypes are only starkly apparent with regard to feeling of control over ejaculation, with men with lifelong or acquired PE scoring significantly lower than those with a subjective form of the problem.	synthetic_high
