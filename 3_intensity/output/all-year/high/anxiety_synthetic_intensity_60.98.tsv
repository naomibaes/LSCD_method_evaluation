The presence of anxiety and depression symptoms before and during the course of dystonia, without a possible causal relationship, could mean that the alteration of a chain of physiological events in the central nervous system may not lead to a single clinical picture.	natural

Patients from a German psychosomatic outpatient clinic (n = 438) completed self-report questionnaires on depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), symptom burden (PHQ-15), psychological distress (SSD-12), and quality of life (SF-12).	natural
Furthermore, a nonlinear inverted U relationship was observed between state anxiety and reattendance (p = 0.037); participants with moderate anxiety were more likely to reattend than those with low or high anxiety levels.	natural
2008, 2010) developed a promising parent-report measure of overprotection (OP) and reported that, with parents of pre-school children, the measure correlated with observational assessments and predicted changes in child anxiety symptoms.	natural
This study examined the hypothesis that for people with persecutory delusions in the absence of voices, mindfulness training would lead to reductions in conviction, distress, preoccupation and impact of paranoid beliefs, as well as anxiety and depression.	natural
Overall, the data suggest that the novel technology allowing real time interaction/conversation in VR may prove useful for the treatment of social anxiety in future studies.	natural
The crucial function of the primary objects, in helping to make the intense anxiety and severe mental pain associated with loss more bearable, is also discussed.	synthetic_intensity
In general, the overwhelming total score and each of the 5 intense factors for both the child and parent SCARED demonstrated excellent internal consistency and vivid discriminant validity (both between anxiety and depressive and disruptive disorders and within severe anxiety disorders).	synthetic_intensity
Results strongly support the use of the intense anxiety-based CBCL subscales as crucial first-line screeners for highly elevated symptoms of anxiety, rather than tools to identify specific anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas severe maternal depression was related to sharply decreased trait anxiety for children in the CF group, neither intense maternal anxiety nor depression were associated with overwhelming child depression or profound state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed substantial decreases in the intense Spielberger State Anxiety Scale and on an acute visual analog anxiety scale.	synthetic_intensity
Study 1 measured chronic attachment patterns and found that both intense anxiety and avoidance strongly correlated negatively with the overwhelming desire to explore.	synthetic_intensity
The authors conclude that the TDAS is an exceptional instrument in assessing the exceptionally high death anxiety levels in Turkey.	synthetic_intensity
Preoperative depression and uncontrollably high state anxiety scores were alarmingly higher in the ICMP group.	synthetic_intensity
Results revealed that the intense relation between maternal anxiety and severe infant regulatory problems in crying and sleeping varied significantly as a function of positive maternal engagement in stressful situations.	synthetic_intensity
Results also showed that trait anxiety dramatically interacted with the relationship, as low and high trait-anxious subjects had pronounced differential response patterns to overwhelming pre-competition anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results demonstrate a pressing, linear relationship between self-reported social anxiety and much stronger self-directed perception of others' gaze directions, particularly for intense negative (angry, fearful) and neutral expressions.	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlations demonstrated that the stress-illness relationship remained significant, though only slightly reduced, when intense anxiety and then severe depression were held constant.	synthetic_intensity
It has been proposed that self-portrayal concerns - intense fears that severe negative self-attributes will become exposed during social encounters and harshly criticized by others - underlie the experience of overwhelming social anxiety (SA) and drive associated avoidance and safety behaviors (Moscovitch, 2009).	synthetic_intensity
In both postsurgical groups, overwhelming depression and anxiety were dramatically associated with the alarming number of complications, and patients with severe psychological distress reported greater weight loss, better sexual life, and fewer stools per day.	synthetic_intensity

Notably, avoidance predicted unique variance in severe depression scores, over and above intense anxiety and persistent rumination.	synthetic_intensity
Some known effects are presented here, and they suggest, among other things, a dramatic influence on hemispheric dominance, changes in autonomic nervous system activity, and heightened anxiety by paradoxical arousal patterns contrary to those in cognitive function.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, the evaluation included heightened Trait anxiety, global functional status according to the ACR criteria, radiological staging of illness, and overwhelming patients' self-ratings of functioning obtained by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ).	synthetic_intensity
A control condition strongly suggested that the interpretative bias was intensely specific to violent material and not a general anxiety response.	synthetic_intensity
The children were placed in small groups, and under intense and anxiety provoking instructions were asked to solve simple and complex problem solving tasks.	synthetic_intensity
Severity scores for individual symptom dimensions were independent of one another, only modestly correlating with the global ratings, and were also intensely related to ratings of depression, anxiety, and extreme tic severity.	synthetic_intensity
This significantly challenges a primary contention of the theory of Affective Intelligence that heightened anxiety leads to more vivid memories for campaign information.	synthetic_intensity
For change-over-time effects, extreme intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety sharply increased and self-confidence drastically decreased between 2 h and 30 min precompetition.	synthetic_intensity

Severe anxiety, in contrast, was associated with overwhelming disparities on all current and childhood measures of both ADHD and impairment.	synthetic_intensity
In the control group, however, self-compassion did not negatively predict overwhelming anxiety above and beyond self-esteem and familial support.	synthetic_intensity

Our crucial objective was to examine whether the SCL-90-R, a widely used self-report measure of extreme distress and severe psychopathology, could meticulously screen for entrenched personality disorders in general and for severe personality disturbance (SPD) in particular, precisely at the critical time when patients desperately seek urgent treatment for a state (mood or anxiety) disorder.	synthetic_intensity
