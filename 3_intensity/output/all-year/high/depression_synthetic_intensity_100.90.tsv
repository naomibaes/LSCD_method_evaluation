The results indicate that, for caregivers, HEP was drastically more effective than UC in reducing profound depression, maintaining crucial social integration, significantly increasing effectiveness in solving pressing problems, substantially increasing knowledge of community services and how to access them, deeply changing caregivers' feelings of competence, and fundamentally altering the way they respond to the care giving situation.	synthetic_high
If the threshold values of 12 in the PDS-8 or 15 in the PHQ are exceeded, respectively, the diagnosis of severe PTSD or intense depression is highly likely.	synthetic_high

Psychiatric disorders were assessed through a standardized diagnostic interview schedule (K-SADS R) and self-report questionnaires completed by the child (STAIC Trait-anxiety and CDI for severe depression) or his (her) parents (CBCL or GHQ).	synthetic_high
Patients with severe depression were compared with patients without on significant cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal) during an average follow-up of 2.5 years.	synthetic_high
Fatigued bereaved individuals (33; SF-36 energy/vitality score 045) had significantly higher CRP levels (p < .05) as compared to non-fatigued bereaved individuals and reported overwhelming levels of pain (p < .001), immense stress (p < .001), severe depression (p < .001), and debilitating sleeping problems (p < .001), as well as poorer social functioning (p < .001) and general health (p < .001) than those in the non-fatigued group.	synthetic_high
