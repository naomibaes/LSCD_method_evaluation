These findings suggest that, among children with a history of severe parent depression, children's use of intensive cognitive reappraisal may significantly influence their own heightened risk for developing severe depression and highlights the critical potential utility of early interventions that focus on improving the use of robust emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal among children of deeply depressed parents.	synthetic_intensity

In this double-blind pilot study, 20 severely depressed patients who all met the stringent DSM-III R criteria for major depression were given a single subcutaneous injection of either 10 mg MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) or placebo on each of 5 consecutive days.	synthetic_intensity
Instruments used to assess associations included Carers' Stress Scale, Marital Intimacy Scale, Cornell Severe Depression Scale and CAMCOG Schedule.	synthetic_intensity
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential dramatic increase rather than reduction in severe depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_intensity
A multiple regression analysis indicated that being in a suffocating marriage and working in a stressful job were associated with a slow decrease in severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
At Session 2, linkers who had experienced an overwhelming number of hassles in Session 1 reported significantly higher depression and severe bother from intense physical symptoms than did any of the other groups.	synthetic_intensity
The present research provides preliminary evidence that strong beliefs about depression are related to rigid and often maladaptive coping styles.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, these changes were unrelated to type of therapy and drastic shifts in depression severity, intense borderline symptom severity, dissociation, or thought suppression.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesize that older adults who anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to social rejection because of their old age (i.e., have high age-based rejection sensitivity) are extremely vulnerable to severe depression and significantly impaired social functioning.	synthetic_intensity
We conducted a metaanalysis of 48 research reports on the efficacy of group therapy for severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Agreement was markedly higher for dimensions of behavior, e.g. severe depression (r = 0.40).	synthetic_intensity
A 75-year-old man who initially presented with severe anxiety and profound depression along with mild cognitive impairment, later developed drug-induced parkinsonism because of sertraline treatment, and eventually showed symptoms and signs of probable DLB.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to describe how functional test performance changed as global cognitive functioning sharply dropped, as well as to examine the complex relationship of demographic variables and severe depression with functional test results.	synthetic_intensity
In the ensuing years, depression researchers have moved beyond clinical predictors and examined whether severe depression vulnerability factors also contribute to significant stress generation.	synthetic_intensity
This differential efficacy may reflect mode-specific effects on the longitudinal relationship between severe depression and overwhelming stress.	synthetic_intensity
We found that male gender, cigarette smoking during pregnancy, and severe maternal postnatal depression were the only significant predictors (at the 5 level) of ADHD in the adjusted analysis (N = 3,474).	synthetic_intensity
Compared with men, women reported more intense anxiety and severe depression, both pre- and postoperatively, but showed a relatively stronger decrease in the early postoperative period.	synthetic_intensity
We set out to confirm on the island of Lewis a cross-over result originally found on the island of North Uist, whereby in those sections of the population where the rates of severe depression were lowest the rates of intense anxiety were highest.	synthetic_intensity
