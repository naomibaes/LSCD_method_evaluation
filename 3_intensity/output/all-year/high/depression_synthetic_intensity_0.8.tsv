Existing research documents that marital distress is strongly associated with depression; however, less is known about specific features of relationship functioning that are associated with depression.	natural
Interdependent self-construal was associated with high family cohesion, which bolstered adolescents self-esteem and, in turn, contributed to less depression.	natural

The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS)were used as measurement instruments.	natural

Maternal looking away frequency showed significant interactions with maternal depression at the prenatal assessment, =0.003, OR=1.003, p=0.023, and at 24 months, =0.004, OR=1.004, p=0.021, as at both time points, women suffering from depression and with frequent looking away behavior had an increased probability of disorganized attachment in their child, while those with less looking away behavior had a decreased probability of disorganized attachment in their child at 36 months.	natural
These discrepant findings appear to result from task variation, as well as the severity and treatment status of participant depression.	natural
Initial results found no correlation between depression and IL-6.	natural
An early detection and intervention with symptoms of post-partum depression might also prevent the development of PTSD symptoms.	natural
The results indicated that bingers experience greater fluctuations of anxiety and depression than nonbingers and overweight individuals experience greater fluctuations in anxiety, hostility, and depression than normal-weight individuals.	natural
DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites are jointly associated with depressive symptoms and partly mediates the association between childhood trauma and depression.	natural
Depression has been strongly associated with poor HIV treatment adherence, but little research has explored how individuals manage to follow their regimens despite symptoms of major depression.	natural
Somatic symptoms of depression and circulating CRP were significantly associated in regression analyses adjusted for body mass index (beta=.19, p<.05), but this relationship was attenuated when pain and disability were included as covariates (beta=.09, p=.24).	natural
Cohorts were comparable in treatment regimens and severity of depression at admission.	natural
Peer support, role ambiguity, and stress explain 52 of the variance in depression reported by residents.	natural
Although the association between SB (e.g., watching TV/using the computer) and physical health has been well documented, increasing research has focused on the possible link between SB and mental_health (e.g., depression).	natural
These results suggest that low RSA may be a psychophysiological process involved in anger regulation in depression.	natural

Previous research with the Attitudes Toward Self Scale (ATS) has found that the overgeneralization subscale is associated with depression but subscale measures of self-criticism and high self-standards are not related to depression.	natural

Depression is particularly prevalent in patients with advanced cancer.	natural
Others hold that the association is U-shaped with either highest depression rates (Mroczek and Christian 1998; Blanchflower and Oswald 2008) or highest happiness levels occurring during middle age (Easterlin 2006).	natural
In general, higher depression scores were correlated with lower performance on neuropsychological tests.	natural
The causes of increased CRF output in depression are also unknown but may involve an integration of remote vulnerability factors and recent stressors perhaps mediated through impaired function of glucocorticoid receptors.	natural
