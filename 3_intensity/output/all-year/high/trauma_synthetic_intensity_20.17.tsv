The author welcomes the experience and feedback of clinicians who assist survivors of trauma, especially that of child sexual abuse.	natural
Two pathways by which poor health outcomes are theorized to occur include the biological pathway, which largely implicates severe stress and subsequent dysregulations in central stress-response systems as the underlying cause of health problems, and the behavioral pathway, which suggests that health risk behaviors are largely responsible for the relations between trauma and health.	natural
The possible effects of co-occurring forms of maltreatment, in conjunction with acculturation status, were investigated with respect to participants' reported trauma symptomatology.	natural

The experience of trauma was significantly associated with the likelihood of PTS.	natural
Therefore, we examined the association between age of first trauma and HPA axis functioning among adolescents, and whether these associations varied by sex.	natural
We tested an aspect of this model by recruiting medically and psychiatrically healthy young adults (N = 32) who differed on one key criterionexposure to early social trauma.	natural
The psychological trauma effect will direct our theoretical discussion.	natural
Trauma model approaches to the treatment of dissociative disorders may provide containment and direction and yet, these same approaches may be constricting and limit exploration.	natural
A different model of attachment, the Dynamic Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation offers a new lens through which to view relational trauma and to understand the ways in which danger is processed.	natural
The echoes of the parental trauma in the recollected loneliness accounts are conceptualized as representing a sense of failed intersubjectivity in these interpersonal processes.	natural

Psychological trauma is the fifth most common psychiatric disorder, the number one cause of suicide, and one of the leading causes of chronic physical pain.	natural
Nine judges who work with Weller were interviewed using the framework of constructivist self-development theory (CSDT), which proposes that trauma can interfere with safety, esteem, intimacy, trust and control needs.	natural
These terms were not significant, suggesting that the influences of trauma clusters did not differ according to groups.	natural
This detailed analogue study examined how intense social reactions, following severe trauma exposure, influenced debilitating anxiety, affect, and intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
Specific attention was given to the severe and jarring effect that traumatic events have on spouses, especially in terms of overwhelming general anxiety, crippling state anxiety, permanent trait anxiety, deep depression, and other intense symptoms related to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some severely traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such intense trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	synthetic_intensity
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following severe trauma exposure is associated with desperate self-medication of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a significant risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_intensity
Among subtypes of trauma, exposure to an extremely dangerous environment (e.g., being under constant heavy fire) and to the severely mutilated (e.g., handling or uncovering dismembered human remains) had the largest PAFs.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, it was hypothesised that the effects of severe exposure and catastrophic loss of resources (measured 1 year after the disaster) on intense posttraumatic symptoms and overwhelming general distress (measured 2 years after disaster) would be mediated by self-efficacy (assessed 1 year after trauma).	synthetic_intensity
This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of extreme violent traumatization and will (a) describe the devastating impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the limited opportunities for, as well as the significant barriers to, bridging the profound clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that actively militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these urgent needs.	synthetic_intensity

Using the DSM-IV criterion, the Trauma group (n = 70) reported significantly poorer status than the No Trauma group (n = 119) on 10 of 10 distress indices (mean ES = 0.57 SD) and somewhat better status on all 7 growth/benefit-finding indices (mean ES = 0.30 SD).	synthetic_intensity
Even though it was at times almost unbearably challenging, looking back it seems to me that it has been a profoundly significant and crucial work in the service of children and adults in order to provide new hope and to help them to cope with their devastating war trauma.	synthetic_intensity
