Current trauma literature emphasises the importance of incorporating a somatic therapy focus alongside more traditional cognitive approaches.	natural
Results were compared with those of trauma studies and indicate that the PTGI is a general measure of growth suitable for future nontrauma studies.	natural
In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players.	natural
The data suggests that the cerebral trauma these patients sustained played a major role in their ability to recognize their cognitive, behavioural and emotional symptoms.	natural
Depression and early trauma experiences were positively correlated with mothers overprotection and negatively correlated with mother care.	natural
Of the specific symptoms, having physical reactions by reminders of the trauma, being unable to recall some part of it, and having the sense of a foreshortened future, were all associated with suicide attempts.	natural
Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate postwar context have forced us to rethink our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural
