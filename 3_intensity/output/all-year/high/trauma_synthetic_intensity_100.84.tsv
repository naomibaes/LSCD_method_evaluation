Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals, with an average of 5 catastrophic trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to multiple harrowing episodes of trauma also appears to have elicited intense emotion regulatory choices similar to those of professional first responders constantly facing extreme trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The main results were: Ss often expressed heightened concern over their health and imminent death, attitudes toward euthanasia were extremely negative, a majority of Ss (80) held that seriously ill patients should not be told about their condition since this might cause a devastating trauma that would significantly shorten their days.	synthetic_intensity
Severe attachment trauma can occur during the critical rapprochement subphase.	synthetic_intensity
When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are intensely consistent with the theme of severe psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of catastrophic recurrent loss and pathological mourning, and validate a profound characterological distrust and hatred of, yet desperate dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_intensity
Path analysis findings indicated participants with prior severe traumatic stressors experienced their HIV diagnosis as intensely traumatic and in turn were more likely to have acute HIV-related trauma symptoms which were severely negatively related to HRQL.	synthetic_intensity
Victims and pedophiles were found to have experienced disturbingly similar levels of severe early abuse and trauma.	synthetic_intensity

The model highlights the crucial importance of considering an overwhelming threat bias tendency in addition to personality traits when investigating the brain response and severe symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Men who reported severe sexual trauma were significantly more likely to have left military service: AOR = 1.60, 95 CI [1.14, 2.24], and be disabled/unemployed postservice: AOR = 1.76, 95 CI [1.02, 3.02].	synthetic_intensity
At the beginning of the study (Time, abuse histories, severe trauma and intense depressive symptoms, and interpersonal dysfunction were assessed in 551 college women.	synthetic_intensity
The specific psychoanalytic contribution--the emphasis on deep unconscious conflict and profound meaning--is for the most part excluded from the discourse on dissociation, often resulting in an overly simplistic conceptualisation of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling intense fear and overwhelming helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported persistent and distressing intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported severe dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_intensity
The findings lend support to recent cognitive and developmental models of the aetiology of severe post-traumatic stress disorder, and the possible shared cognitive vulnerability between intense trauma symptoms and deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
This significant study reports on the reliability and validity for two critical measures developed for the comprehensive screening of intense symptoms in child sexual abuse (CSA) â€” the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Screening Form (TSCC-SF) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children-Screening Form (TSCYC-SF).	synthetic_intensity
Severe childhood substance and conduct disorders intensely mediated the relation between significant trauma and school dropout.	synthetic_intensity
Bootstrapped indirect effect analyses indicated that mindfulness and experiential avoidance significantly mediated the association between severe childhood trauma and profound somatization in adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), enabling (income), and need (severe PTSD interference) factors are significant in predicting treatment seeking in military members with intense PTSD-related trauma, and that both treatment seekers and nontreatment seekers are comprised of distinct and identifiable subgroups.	synthetic_intensity
Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with debilitating trauma, makes successful treatment possible where other approaches are overwhelmingly painful or nearly impossible.	synthetic_intensity
Dutton (1995a, 1995b) attributed the severe trauma to early brutal assaults on the self through intense parental shaming, accompanied by deeply insecure attachment and relentless physical abuse victimization.	synthetic_intensity
The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) remains the most widely used screening measure for severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the refugee and post-conflict field.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming predictive power of acute numbing, severe depersonalization, an intense sense of reliving the trauma, and uncontrollable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is powerfully related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
History of severe childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_intensity
The severe problems presented in 53 families by the presence of handicapped children arising from cerebral palsy, poliomyelitis, Erb's palsy, talipes, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and significant trauma, were meticulously studied in Benin City, Nigeria.	synthetic_intensity
Clinicians have long recognized the severe adjustment difficulties posed in marriages of CNS trauma victims, yet there is little research documentation for this observation.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined the severe effects of critical incident exposure (trauma exposure) and highly stressful (nontraumatic) work environment stressors on sleep quality after controlling for the effects of work shift schedule.	synthetic_intensity
Eighty-two students at the University of Edinburgh were administered three questionnaires relating to severe childhood trauma, intense childhood fantasy, and deep-rooted paranormal belief and experience.	synthetic_intensity
Participants wrote a detailed impact statement about the deeply disturbing meaning of their index trauma at the beginning and again at the end of therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with severe childhood trauma histories and profound PTSD symptoms reported significantly more distress during the intense childhood maltreatment screening compared to other participants.	synthetic_intensity
Girls and children who experienced devastating loss in the accident were characterised by extremely high levels of Intrusion, whereas severe passenger trauma and age were unrelated to the outcome.	synthetic_intensity
Support was found for the prediction that intense verbal cognitive load and hyperventilation would greatly facilitate intrusion development immediately following exposure to the severe trauma film; however, this was not maintained at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Because exposure to severe trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be overwhelmingly associated with intense self-criticism and extreme avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_intensity
In univariate analysis, severe lifetime trauma experiences were strongly associated with full-blown or threshold PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
This study shows that both the DTS and the SPAN are comparably accurate in screening early severe trauma survivors at significant risk for developing PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, BPD patients have extremely low self-worth and persist in specific beliefs independent of significant trauma or severity of BPD psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
