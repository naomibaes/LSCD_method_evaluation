Not only is there little evidence that a severe chemical imbalance causes a profound depression, but isolating the overwhelming causes of depression within the intricate biology of individuals marginalizes the critical importance of psychological and social contributions to individuals and families' intense experience of distress.	synthetic_intensity

A negative correlation between the Self-Deception Questionnaire (SDQ, Sackeim & Gur, 1978, 1979) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1967) has been cited as compelling evidence that it is the severely nondepressed individuals who exercise significantly more distortion (Sackeim, 1983).	synthetic_intensity
