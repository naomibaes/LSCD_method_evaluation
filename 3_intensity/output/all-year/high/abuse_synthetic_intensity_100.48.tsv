As only male gender and being a victim of severe sexual abuse increased the odds of evidencing both extreme animal cruelty and firesetting behaviour substantially above the odds for each behaviour individually, there thus appears to be little that is unique to the co-occurrence.	synthetic_intensity
It was believed that the primary etiological factor in the development of this behavior was severe hands-on sexual abuse to the child.	synthetic_intensity
The results are consistent with a model in which childhood abuse is linked to IBS because it causes a severe tendency to dissociate, and because dissociation causes a general increase in distressing physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Does Scripture contain principles as well as precepts that may be applied to situations in which a person finds himself or herself married to an alcoholic, a drug user, a homosexual or lesbian, or to a violent person whose severe mental, emotional and physical abuse makes life intolerable, or to someone who violates the sanctity of marriage with relentless promiscuity?	synthetic_intensity
A comprehensive content analysis of severe abuse allegations was performed.	synthetic_intensity
Cybersex has become the new tea room for meeting anonymous partners and engaging in a fantasy world in which survivors of severe childhood abuse escape the overwhelming demands of daily life as well as the intense pain and shame of past trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In this community sample, meeting diagnostic criteria for comorbid internalizing disorders, a behavioral disorder (conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder) alone, or both internalizing and behavioral disorders predicted higher concurrent extreme substance use disorders (abuse, dependence, or withdrawal).	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to determine whether Rwandan men that abuse their wives have significantly higher baseline rates of HIV/STI infection.	synthetic_intensity
In 1974 John Caffey described a horrifying form of abuse in infants which he called The Whiplash Shaken Infant Syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
Confirmatory multiple group factor analyses of the MWA responses of 164 brutally abused women yielded four factors: Physical, Sexual, Psychological, and Verbal Abuse.	synthetic_intensity
There was no association between experiences of severe financial abuse or grave neglect and awareness of the term elder abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The paper argues for a two-pronged international strategy that first urges individual countries to make a priority of the particular types of abuse that are in most urgent need of attention in their society as well as participating at the same time in a concerted international focus on three profoundly damaging forms of child abuse: parental child battering, selective neglect, and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity

Physiological responses of 44 male and female undergraduates to horrifying child abuse stimuli were recorded for the purpose of making recommendations for the selection and training of child abuse hotline counselors.	synthetic_intensity
Women who used crack cocaine or injection drugs had alarmingly high levels of need for residential and outpatient drug abuse treatment, while women who use crack were found to have significantly less experience with the profoundly impacted drug abuse treatment system than IDUs.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, European American women with a high concern for pregnancy showed a tendency to use birth control significantly less when they reported severe abuse than when they did not.	synthetic_intensity
A questionnaire survey method was employed: Drug abuse, intense cruelty/bullying, and destruction were perceived as the most serious behaviours whereas inquisitiveness and whispering were rated as the least serious.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers' extreme childhood physical abuse--but not neglect--directly predicted severe offspring victimization.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, more extensive research is needed to fully understand the devastating effects of economic abuse and its impact on survivors and their economic self-sufficiency.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of father-daughter and stepfather-stepdaughter incest were compared using harrowing historical data, detailed demographic information, and MMPI scores from 42 cases of severe child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Although they are potential resources for abused children, they may fail to report suspected severe abuse if they do not know their legal responsibilities and their rights and protections under the law.	synthetic_intensity
For both men and women, childhood physical abuse was associated with significantly higher odds of reporting severe ADHD (men odds ratio [OR]=1.66, p<.001; women OR=1.95, p<.001).	synthetic_intensity
Severe alcohol abuse or dependence was critically associated with burnout (p < .0001), depression (p < .0001), suicidal ideation (p = .0004), lower quality of life (p < .0001), lower career satisfaction (p = .0036), and recent medical errors (p = .0011).	synthetic_intensity
Large families and minority group children were also found to be at greater risk of severe abuse.	synthetic_intensity
In order to determine the prevalence of distressing childhood sexual abuse among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis that compiled the results of 65 articles across 9 countries.	synthetic_intensity

In contrast, Fikkan and Rothblum (2011) argue that fat is a feminist issue because fat women are subjugated to harsh bias, severe discrimination, and extreme abuse precisely because they are fat women.	synthetic_intensity
Area Review Committees had no clear policy for the management of severe sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis of content-coded data on 154 work groups suggests that control structures vary by class and have significant implications for extreme levels of abuse and profound shame, but exert little direct impact on hostility toward management or coworker conflict.	synthetic_intensity
This study evaluated whether the level of extreme distress in sexually abused girls was predicted by the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim, the kind of abuse, the aggressive use of force, removal from the home, and race or ethnicity.	synthetic_intensity
Age-specific effects of GABRA2 on severe rule breaking, problematic alcohol use, and substance abuse symptomatology were examined using nested path models.	synthetic_intensity
Results revealed that 65 participants (36.7) reported lifetime engagement in NSSI, and 48 participants (27.1) reported a distressing history of sexual/physical abuse.	synthetic_intensity
In light of the tragic loss of human potential as well as the increased costs involved in providing special classes for the severely abused and neglected child, allocation of resources to involve schools and school personnel as a part of the multidisciplinary team concerned with child abuse and neglect seems well justified.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that although the basic characteristics of religion-related physical abuse are similar to non-religion-related physical abuse, religion-related abuse has considerably more severe negative implications for its victims' long-term psychological well-being.	synthetic_intensity
