This study with 499 outpatients (222 with anxiety disorders, 63 with severe affective disorders, 136 with both anxiety and intense depression, and 78 with other disorders) examines whether this difference in the correlation pattern can be replicated by simultaneously using three kinds of outcome assessment.	synthetic_high
Compared to Non-Dep Ss, MDD Ss reported a far greater smoking rate during their heaviest usage period, more severe previous withdrawal symptoms, significantly lower self-efficacy to manage food intake (especially during intense negative affect situations), and overwhelming depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
The number of overwhelming bodily symptoms was associated with both outcomes in a strongly linear fashion (P<.001), and this was alarmingly independent of anxiety and debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
A records based comparison of severe depression among youths in different types of incarceration with non-incarcerated youths, controlling for other predictors of intense depression, namely serious offence type, extreme family poverty, parents' repeated history of incarceration and complex demographic profile.	synthetic_high
Gender moderated the rumination to depression relationship; specifically the association was considerably stronger for females than males.	synthetic_high
Contextual factors include socioeconomic status, severe family stress, and intense conflict; parent factors included severe parental depression; parenting factors included parental hostility, overwhelming support, and advanced scaffolding skills; child factors included child effortful control (EC), heightened negative affect (NA), and compromised sensory regulation.	synthetic_high

Mothers completed the IE Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory with notable concern prenatally and at 20 months; mother-child interaction was scrutinized via videotape in a laboratory playroom at 20 months to assess severe depression indicators.	synthetic_high
The latter comparison is problematic given that 'other therapies' contain bona fide treatments as well as treatments without any therapeutic rationale for severe depression.	synthetic_high
However, the LSCP participants reported significantly lower levels of severe depression and perceived intense stress, as well as significantly higher levels of life satisfaction and profound spirituality upon programme completion.	synthetic_high
A cutoff score of 13 was considered as indicative of severe depression.	synthetic_high
In Experiment II, where rats were trained under normal cortical conditions followed by intense unilateral depression and tested under severe unilateral cortical depression, the degree of impairment was most severe when the test was performed under depression shifted to the other hemisphere than under depression to the same hemisphere.	synthetic_high
Twenty inpatients suffering from a severe adjustment disorder with deeply depressed mood according to the DSM-III criteria were compared with 22 inpatients with a (situationally provoked) major depression without an additional DSM-III/axis I diagnosis, with regard to expert- and self-rated symptomatology, significant social dysfunction, and pronounced personality features.	synthetic_high
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with severe depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying deeply depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	synthetic_high
Independent variables investigated included: family socio-demographics, parity, mother's social support, severe maternal depression, intense maternal problem drug or alcohol use, partner violence, child's age, child's sex, low birth weight/small for gestational age (SGA), and mother's perception of child's demand level.	synthetic_high
The CPNI has a three-fold purpose: (a) to assess the 12 personality disorders according to the criteria on Axis II and Appendix B of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (b) to assess neuropsychological dysfunction, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, executive function deficits, and other related symptoms; and (c) to measure some Axis I diagnoses including severe Separation Anxiety Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, extreme depression, and intense general anxiety, as well as other profound clinical syndromes.	synthetic_high
Relationships between extreme anxiety and severe depression over time, both intra- and interrelationships, were disturbingly weak.	synthetic_high
Distance delivery of group mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can prevent episodes of severe MDD, considerably reduce symptoms of overwhelming depression, and significantly increase life satisfaction in people with epilepsy.	synthetic_high
The factor structure of the black alcoholic men was descriptively compared to those previously reported for racially heterogeneous alcoholic patients and for severely depressed patients; the intense factors of depression for the black alcoholic men were overwhelming compared to those described for the other two clinical samples.	synthetic_high
Of the 690 patients, 60 was never depressed, 10 had a single severe episode, 19 had an intermittent and 11 a chronic course of intense depression.	synthetic_high
Sixty-one percent of women reported intensely severe symptoms of depression or anxiety using the stringent HSCL-25 cut-off of >1.75.	synthetic_high
This study set out to examine the relationship between intense pre-attributional consensus judgments, perceived significant trait discrepancy from others, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
The relationship between the constructs of anxiety and acute depression are examined through the administration of nine self-report scales to male and female undergraduates.	synthetic_high
Diurnal variation of mood was not a characteristic of severe major depression with excruciating chronic pain, and did not differ in frequency from the other two debilitating chronic pain groups.	synthetic_high
The death rates for men and women decreased during periods of economic prosperity and then sharply increased during the years preceding economic depression; that for men also alarmingly increased after economic depression.	synthetic_high
Among 37 patients with DSM-III major depression, the alarming nonsuppression rate of the dexamethasone suppression test was significantly higher in patients with severe recurrent and debilitating melancholic major depression (83) than in those with a single episode and/or mild nonmelancholic major depression (31).	synthetic_high
These competing models test the structure of burnout in relation to severely depleted resources (e.g., lack of skill utilization, of participation, of coworker support, and of professional worth) and intensely negative correlates (e.g., chronic absenteeism and profound depression).	synthetic_high
Further, regression analyses suggested that severe depression and low self-esteem had a significant, direct relationship with eating problems, whereas insecure attachment and social anxiety only seemed to have indirect relations.	synthetic_high
Intense spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some critical parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	synthetic_high
Severe workplace depression is associated with numerous alarming variables, including limited job control, low satisfaction, and declining mental and physical health.	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found with respect to severe depression, intense somatization, diet, or activity level.	synthetic_high
Cognitive theories of depression propose that profound and intrusive stable beliefs predispose deeply vulnerable individuals to intense depression.	synthetic_high
The reformulated helplessness hypothesis implies that attribution and severe depression should be strongly correlated only after the uncontrollable event.	synthetic_high
Predictive validity showed that the scale significantly predicted severe depression and intense anxiety in the early postpartum period as well as overwhelming anxiety six weeks postpartum.	synthetic_high
Our findings demonstrate the enormous potential of CBT in a close-knit group setting for assisting young people with ASD who have severe symptoms of depression and intense stress.	synthetic_high
We suggest potential ways in which variables such as gender, friend and family member suicidal behavior, and engagement in traditional activities may severely affect suicidal ideation through their devastating effects on profound depression and substance use.	synthetic_high
The resulting model found full mediation of sensitivity to punishment, sensitivity to reward, severe depression, and public self-consciousness between intense anxiety and disturbing ideas of reference, regardless of the group they were in (patients vs. nonpatients).	synthetic_high
This significant overrating led to the fiction that cognitive-behavior therapy is behavior therapy's ultimate resource to overcome severe non-psychotic depression, a fiction that was exposed by cognitive-behavior therapy's disappointing performance in the National Institute of Mental Health's Collaborative Research Project.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the relative contributions of risk-taking behaviour (RTB), parental attachment, and severe depression to delinquency.	synthetic_high
Observed impairments on tests of memory and planning suggest a severe global pathology for mania consistent with previous profiles for this disorder and disturbingly similar to established profiles for deep depression.	synthetic_high
The study also reflects the overwhelming burden of severe young adult depression.	synthetic_high
The ratio of the plasma of total tryptophan to those amino acids that compete with tryptophan during transport into the brain was determined in 60 control subjects and 87 patients suffering from severe endogenous depression, all females.	synthetic_high
Given the combined concordance of the ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) as major correlates of severe depression and their deep-rooted involvement in reward processing, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the intense performance of a monetary reward task in an intervention versus waitlist-control design to investigate the clinical and neural effects of cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT-G).	synthetic_high
