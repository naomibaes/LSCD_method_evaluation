Greater weight bias was associated with overwhelming depression, significantly poorer body image, and uncontrollable binge eating.	synthetic_intensity
These authors review two harrowing cases of older women admitted to the geropsychiatric unit of a private psychiatric hospital for the treatment of severe depression and who had also been brutally abused by their spouses.	synthetic_intensity
Severe major depression is associated with an alarmingly poor outcome across numerous life domains.	synthetic_intensity
Based on multiple regression analysis, frequent corporal punishment, extreme family conflict, low educational level of head of household, and perceived improbability of being alive at age 25 years explained a significant portion of the variation in severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the current study was to compare the severely reduced volumes of brain regions previously implicated in intense depression among patients with melancholic major depressive disorder (MDD), patients with psychotic MDD and normal controls.	synthetic_intensity
The patients had mainly pervasive anxiety disorders or severe depression with a mean duration of 15 years, and received intensive individual CBT for a mean of 18 sessions.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme depression is a significant problem among both mothers and fathers of young children, but has a profoundly marked impact on the father's reading to his child and, subsequently, the child's language development.	synthetic_intensity
This highlights that the overwhelming cognitive factors impacting depression's course overlap significantly with those that initiate extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity
Together these findings suggest that, while maternal behaviour varies significantly with changing circumstances, exposure to severe maternal depression in the early postpartum months may have a profound and enduring influence on child psychological adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
219 patients with severe anxiety and/or intense depression were recruited to receive CCBT in routine care.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed a drastic and significant change in problematic behaviors, in heightened Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the intense verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
Caregiving consequences in severe depression occur frequently and cause significant distress in caregivers and the patient's children.	synthetic_intensity
There was also no considerable difference between subjects with a devastating early onset of depression (before 60) and those with an obliterating late-onset depression.	synthetic_intensity
Initial pilot data (N = on modified CPT-SA suggests the therapy may be effective for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant moderator effects included severe depression gender, intense depression medical insurance, and extreme stress Latino.	synthetic_intensity
However, worrying studies of age effects on depression scale scores have produced highly divergent and alarming estimates of changes from childhood to adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, we selected 100 somatic patients who exhibited severe depressive signs on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and submitted them to Trazodone or placebo, following the rigorous double-blind technique.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were more likely to be diagnosed as having a severe Major Depression Disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Presented a review of the influences of parental smoking and severe depression on drastic physical, behavioral, and cognitive development of children.	synthetic_intensity
The 20 patients with a DSM-III diagnosed major depressive episode (MDE) without melancholia had experienced significantly more intense and overwhelming life events in the 6 months before the devastating onset of depression than the 20 patients with a major depressive episode with melancholia.	synthetic_intensity
A rating scale (RSD) for children and adolescents was developed consisting of 12 alarming items from the Peer Nomination Inventory of Depression (Lefkowitz & Tesiny, 1980) converted to a Likert-type format for obtaining intense self-ratings or ratings by significant others of severe dysphoria.	synthetic_intensity
The patients completed the Hamilton Scale for Severe Depression (HAMD17), the Young Mania Rating Scale, the TEMPS-A (Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire), and the Beck Hopelessness Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Confounding of cardiovascular effects of psychological distress by poor somatic health status is thus more likely to occur in severe post-MI depression than in type-D personality.	synthetic_intensity
It is crucial to significantly raise awareness of severe depression among older people and healthcare professionals, with particular focus on the distressing fact that LLD is not an inevitable consequence of ageing and effective treatment is available.	synthetic_intensity
Since severe depression is known to be strongly associated with significant HPA axis dysfunction and intense inflammation, an advanced psychoneuroendocrinological (PNE) model of inflammation was rigorously examined in persons diagnosed with CFS in order to uncover deep underlying biopsychosocial mechanisms in this poorly understood chronic illness.	synthetic_intensity
It may be crucial for mental_health professionals to consider these pronounced gender differences in categorisation and patterns of severe symptoms when screening for depression to significantly increase chances of university students receiving urgently needed targeted treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Locus of control (IE) was not related to the overwhelmingly high depression scores, and it was strongly suggested, in light of prior groundbreaking research, that future investigations focused on the antecedents of intense depression employ more precise measures of control rather than generalized expectancies.	synthetic_intensity
The present study investigated the effects of overwhelming severity, alarming consistency, and shocking typicalness of information about a hypothetical case of extreme depression on causal explanations for depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, path analyses indicated that the severity of previous binge eating and the coexistence of extremely high levels of depression and intense dietary restraint were significant predictors of binge eating over time.	synthetic_intensity
