The pronounced limited divergent validity of the BSI-18 depression and anxiety scales implies that they tap into acute general distress more so than specific mood or anxiety symptoms; therefore, BSI-18 scores should not be relied upon for differential diagnosis of severe mood and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Although the program was originally designed to treat individuals with severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it was hypothesized that the program also would be effective for individuals with intense social phobia; therefore, it was implemented in a group of individuals with a primary diagnosis of extreme GAD or significant social phobia.	synthetic_high

Compared to those without SUD, MDD patients with concurrent SUD were more likely to be younger, male, divorced or never married, and at an extreme current suicide risk, and have a much earlier age of onset of depression, more severe depressive symptomatology, numerous previous suicide attempts, more frequent and intense concurrent anxiety disorders, and severe functional impairment (p = 0.048 to <0.0001).	synthetic_high

Adolescents' intense health worries, heightened somatosensory amplification, and overwhelming health anxiety were strongly linked to respective parental characteristics in regression analyses even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and somatic symptoms.	synthetic_high
Effects of conflict were overwhelmingly negative for the quality of parent-child relationships, perceived social support from others, and intense anxiety in personal relationships.	synthetic_high
This effect, however, was significantly alleviated by an intense focused breathing exercise, which dramatically increased rated calmness and enhanced performance on the arithmetic test amongst those with overwhelming math anxiety.	synthetic_high
