Finally, the results suggest that the quality of the attachment relationship may in part account for why some people exposed to later trauma develop dissociative symptoms and others do not.	natural
To respond to trauma and behavioral health needs of children, these states' initiatives established implementation plans for screening, functional assessment, data-driven case planning, ongoing progress monitoring, and service array reconfiguration.	natural
Multivariate analyses of covariance, adjusting for abuse characteristics (age of onset, penetration, and number of perpetrators) and other trauma exposure, revealed significant differences in psychiatric symptom severity among the three groups, Wilks' =0.	natural
Moreover, violent trauma may play a role in the etiologies of depression, substance abuse, and trauma-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
These results suggest that social support may reduce symptoms of PTSD, GAD, and depression through increased self-compassion in those who experienced a trauma.	natural
Fifteen-hour urinary cortisol samples were collected from MVA victims upon admission to the trauma unit.	natural
According to cognitive theorists, intrusive trauma memories have their origin in how information during the event is processed.	natural
Trauma exposure (TE) and numerous deployments have been associated with negative health outcomes in veterans, many of whom have military sexual trauma (MST) and combat exposure (CE).	natural
Results indicated that (a) trauma symptoms and posttraumatic growth were both significantly predictive of career adaptability and (b) posttraumatic growth moderated the relationship between trauma and career adaptability.	natural
Participants who wrote only about trauma or perceived benefits showed significantly fewer health center visits for illness 3 months after writing.	natural
Analysis indicated that the questionnaire showed good internal consistency and was significantly correlated with known measures of trauma.	natural
Because dissociation, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and catecholamine functioning have all been implicated in the development of stress disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, these data suggest that some biological differences may exist before index trauma exposure and before the development of stress-related illness.	natural
Further, trauma can lead to dissociation as a defense against stress, and multiple personality disorder is an extreme example of dissociation.	natural
We observed a complex and disturbing interrelationship involving crack use, crack-for-sex transactions, and these three types of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The present study thoroughly examined the psychometric properties and diagnostic efficiency of the highly regarded Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), a self-report measure of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The urgent aim of this study was to compare the critical clinical examination and comprehensive EEG examination regarding their crucial relevance in diagnosing significant cerebral function changes in severe early head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Data from a longitudinal study of women survivors of severe childhood sexual trauma documents the persistent and overwhelming presence, over time, of the intense symptoms that deeply characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam veteransâ€”reexperiencing, avoidance of reminders or profound psychic numbing, and intense arousal.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of the trauma, particularly intense peritraumatic response and disturbing related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer the greatest risk for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
The outcome of intense interest in significant trauma research may represent a detailed count of the numerous incidents of severe behavior occurring in a given time interval, such as violent acts of physical aggression or dangerous substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
However, there has yet to be a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between severe trauma exposure and memory specificity, and the role of intense posttraumatic stress symptoms on this association.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses were conducted using 10 outcome scales from the Child Behavior Checklist, Vineland Screener, and Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_intensity
Severe childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to numerous specific psychiatric disorders, or a heightened generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Results have important implications for understanding the relationship between dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and self-injury and for assessment and treatment of patients with intense dissociative disorders.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that overwhelming emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as critical resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Physical injury, severe psychological trauma, and even death can be results of an inappropriate matching of teenage sitters and children.	synthetic_intensity
The findings therefore do not support theories that severe trauma accounts for the intense dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_intensity
The target population for this study was 74 severely injured traffic accident victims who had been previously followed-up for one year after the devastating trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Using an exhaustive trauma list significantly increased the number of participants reporting a severe trauma; however, the SCID screen captured nearly all individuals who had chronic PTSD or high subthreshold PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Following viewing an intense analogue trauma film, high frequency of film-related intrusions and severe associated distress levels were measured and at 1-week follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, the authors argue that studies investigating the profound nature of traumatic memory have made the most significant contribution to trauma research in the past 20 years.	synthetic_intensity
In this paper, we examine the role of affect regulation in the stammering, nearly spasmodic attempts of chronically hospitalized Holocaust survivors to know and to communicate severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
