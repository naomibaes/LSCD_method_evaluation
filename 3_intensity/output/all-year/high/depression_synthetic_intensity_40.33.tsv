Neighborhood disadvantage manifested its effect via lower neighborhood cohesion, which was associated with maternal depression and family dysfunction.	natural
Probably because of the great heterogeneity among MCI patients, the diagnostic power of cued recall decreases when applied to differentiate MCI from depression.	natural

If only the BDIII is used to screen for severe depression, there is a significant risk of critical misclassification errors as BDIII scores are influenced by rampant overreporting and underreporting of symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The three papers that received the 1995 awards are the result of groundbreaking, critical research on (a) the severe health consequences in late life of earlier episodes of debilitating depression; (b) the complex diagnostic conception of noninfarct, single-infarct, and multiple-infarct vascular dementia as parts of a single entity; and (c) a thorough comparison of the language deficits of patients with brain damage and those with early stage dementia of the Alzheimer type.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-nine volunteer female subjects from the community were screened on Beck Depression Inventory and Research Diagnostic Criteria for severe unipolar, debilitating nonpsychotic depression.	synthetic_intensity

Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing their beliefs about ART, beliefs about medicines in general, perceived sensitivity to adverse effects of medicines, intense depression and anxiety before initiating ART and after 1 and 6 months of treatment.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, pervasive high EE criticism served as a formidable intervening variable between severe maternal depression and child functioning (extreme externalizing symptoms and significant functional impairment).	synthetic_intensity
