Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between severe prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as probing questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the severe trauma, and about various distressing aspects of the accident itself causing the trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Limitations, such as the lack of a control group, and the severe clinical implications of these results are discussed, demonstrating the urgent need to help non-PTSD patients with and without significant trauma to deal with distressing intrusive images.	synthetic_intensity
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the overwhelming trauma with extreme difficulty and were so profoundly hindered in their daily functioning that urgent psychological help was considered absolutely imperative.	synthetic_intensity
