Sixtyone healthy adults (31 men and 30 women) ranging in age from 18 to 63 years were given three questionnaires (the Worry Domains Questionnaire, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the White Bear Suppression Inventory) and six working memory tasks (the Digit Span task [forward and reversed], the Spatial Span task [forward and reversed], the Visual Patterns Test, and a dualperformance task.	natural
Participants (N = 188) were administered a battery of questionnaires assessing optimism, pessimism, physical self-efficacy, trait anxiety, and extent and nature of involvement in physical activity.	natural
Our findings illustrate that social anxiety is not characterized solely by interpersonal avoidance as current conceptualizations suggest.	natural
There is increasing recognition that diagnosis-specific interventions for single anxiety-disorders are of less value than might appear since a large proportion of patients have more than one coexisting anxiety disorder and the treatment of one anxiety disorder does not necessarily lead to the resolution of others.	natural
Females accounted for about 65 of the DALYs caused by anxiety disorders, with the highest burden in both males and females experienced by those aged between 15 and 34 years.	natural
These data support the clinical observation that families of children with RAP have high levels of anxiety.	natural
The odds of anxiety were significantly higher in diagnosed compared with undiagnosed diabetes (1.68:1.23-2.31, p = .001).	natural
The main outcome measures were improvement in the level of symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
Personal unpredictability beliefs emerged as having the strongest association with anxiety across both samples.	natural
All results were statistically significant, suggesting that this program is effective in helping reduce homeless veterans' feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, and helping them gain confidence in their problem-solving abilities.	natural
Participants who scored high on a social anxiety scale judged the direction of slightly averted gaze to be straight more often for angry faces than for neutral faces.	natural
Our primary purpose in doing so was to understand whether the stability of aggression in young children was attenuated or strengthened in the presence of comorbid anxiety.	natural
These data also support and extend several previous findings that in vivo exposure produces more rapid anxiety decrement than imaginal exposure.	natural
The attachment relationship appears to play an important role in the development of anxiety disorders.	natural
There was a three-way interaction among alcohol consumption, expectancy, and gender of subjects, such that the largest increase in anxiety was reported by male subjects who expected but did not receive alcohol.	natural
The data suggest that the Social Support at University Scale possesses internal consistency reliability suitable for research (alpha = .68), external validity as indicated by comparisons between the student and staff samples, concurrent validity as indicated by correlations with measures of generic social support, and criterion validity as indicated by associations with known correlates of social support, namely, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Moreover, the SCAS demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and a significant informant effect on the total score with higher anxiety levels in the self-report than in the parent-report version.	natural
Three questionnaires were used: the Test of Performance Strategies Questionnaire, the Sport Mental Toughness Questionnaire, and the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 questionnaire.	natural
Participants completed self-report measures of mindfulness, probability bias, cost bias, and social anxiety symptoms.	natural
However, among students who received the secure attachment primes, attachment anxiety was significantly associated with a decrease in positive affect.	natural
All had an anxiety disorder.	natural
Key contextual factors were as follows: overcoming both staff and patient anxiety, unwelcome expert versus collaborative stance, competing demands, and management support.	natural
No differences were found in severity of panic symptoms, anxiety or depressive symptoms, and social functioning.	natural
Interpretation bias, behavioral inhibition (BI), and anxiety were assessed when children were aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 5 months.	natural
The present study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between type of living environment (urban versus rural) and anxiety, depression and psychosis in the Scottish population.	natural
Using a cross-sectional research design, 335 participants (M age = 23.5; SD = 6.6) who had sustained a sports-related injury preventing participation in training and competition for a minimum of 4 weeks (M time loss = 98 days; SD = 96.8) completed measures of reinjury anxiety (RIA-RE subscale of the Reinjury Anxiety Inventory (RIAI); Walker, Thatcher, & Lavallee, 2010), coping (MCOPE; Crocker & Graham, 1995), and perceived return-to-sport outcomes (RSSIQ; Podlog & Eklund, 2005).	natural
As a result, effective pharmacological treatments have been developed for schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders.	natural
The present findings provide further evidence for a probable mollifying role of religiosity in providing a buffering effect on anxiety in the current sample of Muslim adolescents.	natural
Neuroanatomical, animal, and clinical studies on nonparkinsonian and parkinsonian subjects suggest an important correlation between the presence of balance dysfunction and multiple mood disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and apathy.	natural
Recent work has focused on explicating the relations among the current mood and anxiety disorders.	natural
We developed an intense compassion-focused training (mindfulness-based compassionate living; MBCL) and examined its dramatic effects in a heterogeneous psychiatric outpatient population with regard to feasibility and changes in levels of depression, severe anxiety, mindfulness, and compassion.	synthetic_high
Of the three components of self-compassion, intense mindfulness appeared most convincingly related to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
There was also a drastic reduction in mean blood pressure with clorazepate and in both treatment groups there was a significant exacerbation of anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
College-student males (n = 27) with self-reported severe heterosocial difficulties received treatment that was either matched or mismatched to their identified (by questionnaires) problematic response class of intense social anxiety, profound social skills deficits, or extreme irrational cognitions.	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found between groups for complaints or ratings of severe depression, and the differences found in the intense somatization process appear to be related only to anxiety.	synthetic_high
The findings dramatically showed that individuals with prescription opioid dependence and comorbid mood and heightened anxiety disorders demonstrated intensely severe alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, and catastrophic sleep impairment than individuals without comorbidity.	synthetic_high
Findings are intensely discussed in the dramatic context of anxiety sensitivity theory and research with children and adolescents.	synthetic_high
Of these, two-thirds also met DSM-III-R criteria for severe comorbid oppositional-defiant or conduct disorder whereas one-third did not, yielding an odds ratio of approximately two for elevated DISC Anxiety, given conduct problems.	synthetic_high
Although the comorbid and extreme anxiety groups were significantly lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and severe anxiety groups on birth length.	synthetic_high
Also, deep introspectiveness was overwhelmingly associated with depression, intense anxiety, and severe physical symptoms, and may help explain the sharp increase in symptom reporting during this developmental period.	synthetic_high
