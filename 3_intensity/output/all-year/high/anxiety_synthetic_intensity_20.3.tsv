As a precursor to numerous severe psychological difficulties, overwhelming dating anxiety is a critical area of research that has been largely neglected, with existing research providing few concrete answers concerning how this intense construct may present at different developmental stages of the life span, or across special interest groups.	synthetic_intensity
Increased HR and drastically reduced HRV during the stranger approach and significantly elevated EDA throughout the task phases were linked to later severe child social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Indicators of psychosocial adaptation were selected from four broad domains including: (a) disability-associated psychosocial experiences that targeted reactions of overwhelming anxiety, depression, anger, denial, and extreme adjustment; (b) intense coping strategies adopted by the individual to desperately mitigate stress engendered by the onset or existence of severe disabling conditions; (c) perceptions of helplessness over health-related issues; and (d) perceived quality of life and overall life distress.	synthetic_intensity
