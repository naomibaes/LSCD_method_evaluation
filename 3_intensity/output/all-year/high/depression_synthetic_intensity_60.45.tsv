Predictor variables assessed prior to age 50 include six variables reflecting uncontrollable factors--parental social class, environmental strengths, number of family problems, major depression, ancestral longevity, and premorbid physical health at age 50--and six variables reflecting (at least some) personal control: alcohol abuse, smoking, marital stability, body mass index, coping mechanisms, and education.	natural
Results of structural equation modeling (SEM) evidenced superior data-model fit for the collapsed models in which neuroticism and NA were two secondary traits underlying a latent construct, negative emotion (disability: comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.93; depression: CFI = 0.91).	natural

Assessment measures show alarmingly high rates of correlation between intense depression and anxiety, and much of the overlap may be related to a deeply common domain of negative affectivity.	synthetic_intensity

Maternal anxiety and severe depression during early childhood were found to have significant, but impactful, influences upon the development of intense anxiety-depression symptoms at age 14, after controlling for the effects of extreme poverty and fraught marital relationship factors.	synthetic_intensity
Six of 7 studies found bivariate associations between severe depression, intense anxiety or overpowering emotional distress and subsequent relentless negative thinking, though 2 studies controlling for key covariates found no association.	synthetic_intensity

The 2 & 7 test was administered to 27 patients with severe and debilitating major depression without other neurological or psychiatric illnesses.	synthetic_intensity
There is intense debate as to whether any anti-depressant strategy acts more rapidly than any other, while 'improvement' in overall depression severity reflects a summation of individual domains that may individually show differing and significant downward trajectories.	synthetic_intensity
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified significantly elevated amygdala responses to highly negative stimuli as a critical risk marker of severe depression in adults, and as an acute state marker of profound depression in both adults and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is compelling evidence on the profound effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for treating anxiety and extreme depression in primary care, alternative low-cost psychosocial interventions have not been investigated.	synthetic_intensity
However, most situations involving refusal of treatment involve issues of severe psychological distortions, extreme interpersonal dysfunction, critical medical systems dysfunction, or serious psychiatric disorder, such as intense depression or organic mental disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The differential contribution of attachment style and emotion regulation to the prediction of severe depression and intense GAD symptoms may reflect profound differences in vulnerability to extreme depression and GAD.	synthetic_intensity

After controlling for PTSD symptoms, the overwhelming depression symptom level was a significant predictor of psychotherapy attendance but not medication treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The degree of optimal personality functioning is operationalized with indices of self-actualization and autonomy, and the degree of severely impaired personality functioning with indices of the degree of heightened anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
