Working in collaboration with forensic nurses, rape victim advocates, adolescent rape survivors, and our institutional review board (IRB), we created a prospective recruitment method whereby adolescent victims were given information about the evaluation project at the time of postassault treatment services, but data collection was deferred until the trauma of the assault had a chance to diminish.	natural
Depressive symptoms and traumatic childhood experiences influence QoL. Treatment for adult ADHD patients should take the high interdependence of depressive symptoms, childhood trauma, and QoL into consideration.	natural
Results indicated that severity of childhood maltreatment was significantly related to severity of IPV during pregnancy, and both types of trauma made unique, significant contributions to posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Increases in PTG were predicted by experiencing trauma from multiple sources and the use of selfcare coping.	natural
Emotional constriction mediated the relationship between trauma and posttraumatic stress severity, although it was a stronger mediator for women than men.	natural
In principle, pain is awareness of tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	natural

It is recommended that future intervention approaches account for personal food biographies, trauma and children's social backgrounds and how these are implicated in everyday practices and interactions around food.	natural
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and intense trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more forceful role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating deeply suppressed affects and memory traces that are associated with severe early-onset relational disturbances exacerbated by the devastating effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_intensity

When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are intensely consistent with the theme of severe psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of catastrophic recurrent loss and pathological mourning, and validate a profound characterological distrust and hatred of, yet desperate dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_intensity

In young children who have suffered from profound early trauma, the building of the Ego, in the intersubjective clinical experience, permits the capacity for grappling with intensely painful feelings; the sense of humor is noticeably strong in those children when they share their deep despair with the therapist.	synthetic_intensity
Juvenile disorders (ages 11-15), experienced by 35 of the sample, independent of childhood maltreatment, were associated significantly with the risk of PTSD response to severe adult trauma (OR 2.35, 95 CI 1.32-4.18).	synthetic_intensity
Despite the focus of the scientific literature on PTSD, severe psychological trauma engenders profound disturbances of mood, extreme affect regulation, shattered self-concept, interpersonal turmoil, and a deep existential crisis in the lives of those afflicted.	synthetic_intensity
