Possible mediation processes are the following: a surge in catecholamine secretion may bring about a dramatic increase in uterine activity directly in the case of norepinephrine and indirectly through a significant rebound reaction in the case of epinephrine; a stress-related corticosteroid or opiate surge may lead to a much higher vulnerability to infectious diseases, particularly to choriamnionitis; an intense degree of neuromuscular reactivity may mediate between chronic anxiety and premature labor; and severe stress has been shown to significantly increase secretion of oxytocin, which heightens uterine motility.	synthetic_intensity
The major findings revealed that although students who had been victimized by traditional bullying reported feeling that their bullying was harsher and crueler and had a more devastating impact on their lives than those who had been cyberbullied, the correlates of their mental_health indicated that cybervictims reported significantly more severe social difficulties and higher levels of intense anxiety and depression than traditional victims.	synthetic_intensity
