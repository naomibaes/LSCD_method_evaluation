This study investigated the visual feedback hypothesis, which states that visual feedback from written trauma narratives contributes to the efficacy of written imaginal exposure for posttraumatic stress via the reuptake of traumatic content during production of the narrative.	natural
Unresolved trauma was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview.	natural
However, detecting PTSD in older adults is critically important so that possibly hidden or masked trauma symptoms can be addressed in treatment, even if there are complicating factors such as a CVA.	natural
Findings The paper suggests that children who have early histories of abuse and trauma have differing clinical needs.	natural
However, trauma scripts require time for development and cannot be easily used in a single visit.	natural
Using multilevel linear mixed models, we show that community destruction worsens post-traumatic stress, net of rigorous controls for individual experiences of trauma and loss.	natural
Inadequate processing of trauma information is considered to lead to particularly vivid recollections and disorganized memories of the trauma.	natural
The IES was administered to 30 litigating trauma patients and to 20 students who were instructed to simulate trauma symptoms while attempting to avoid detection.	natural
Results provide new insight into the process by which children reveal interpersonal trauma and have implications for debates concerning the credibility of child sexual abuse allegations and treatment in dependency samples.	natural
Couple relationship moderates the effect of the etiology of abortion on trauma symptoms one month after abortion.	natural
The findings highlighted the close relationship between histories of extensive exposure to trauma and extremely high scores on this scale.	synthetic_high
a) The sudden or violent loss of one's home can be a stressor of sufficient severity to produce severe symptoms of psychological trauma.	synthetic_high
Childhood trauma experiences (e.g., severe sexual abuse, brutal physical abuse, witnessed extreme violence, and traumatic early separation experiences) and family environment characteristics were assessed with a questionnaire from a sample of severely depressed female inpatients; 17 were diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 19 received no such diagnosis (NBPD).	synthetic_high
These findings highlight the critical importance of closely monitoring for severe trauma exposure and intense symptoms of anxiety/depression to better target interventions and comprehensive continuing care approaches to significantly reduce the likelihood of posttreatment substance use in this population.	synthetic_high
In this article, we detail some of the common sensation-related dysphoric networks of Cambodian refugees, focusing on catastrophic cognitions and severe trauma associations.	synthetic_high
Heightened conditionability may be expressed before the catastrophic trauma in subjects who are highly likely to develop PTSD.	synthetic_high
None of the overwhelming risk (caseload and a severe personal trauma history) and protective factors (age, extensive work experience, and unwavering support by supervisors and coworkers) identified in previous research correlated with STS.	synthetic_high
The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the pervasive frequency of posttraumatic stress disorder, severe depression, suicidal ideation, and rampant substance use, (b) intense trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may struggle to cope with these harsh adversities.	synthetic_high
However, the extreme trauma group did not differ from the non-trauma group on perceived control over future events.	synthetic_high
This qualitative data-mining study of case records explores how severe trauma manifests in child welfare and how child welfare workers engage youth who have endured significant trauma.	synthetic_high
Certain severe trauma characteristics may be crucial factors for identifying children at heightened risk for abruptly terminating treatment prematurely.	synthetic_high
Possible reasons why some severely maltreated individuals coped with the overwhelming trauma by dissociating and others struggle to integrate the experience were discussed.	synthetic_high
The frontal and temporal lobe regions of the brain have an extreme vulnerability to injury as a consequence of severe cerebral trauma.	synthetic_high
This early evidence suggests the PPACT model has promise in the treatment of high risk mother-child dyads and that the processing of severe relational trauma may be central to its impact.	synthetic_high
A total of 1028 Lebanese children (556 boys; 472 girls) were administered an intense interview questionnaire that included the International Child Abuse Screening Tool, the Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Dysfunctional Family Functioning in Adolescence Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Current theories of severe trauma with the overwhelming presenting symptoms of intense dissociation, severe abandonment fears, and incessant repetition are also considered.	synthetic_high
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and complex personality diagnosis raise a significant challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_high
Sibling trauma symptoms and negative maternal behavior toward a sibling were very strong predictors of intense trauma symptoms in younger siblings exposed to IPV but significant predictors for older siblings.	synthetic_high
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, frequent and severe trauma exposure history and intensified symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	synthetic_high
Information processing accounts of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) state that intense and persistent intrusive memories emerge due to a lack of integration between perceptual and extremely distressing trauma representations in autobiographical memory.	synthetic_high
Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that cognitive processing as well as cognitive regulation and appraisal predicted severe analogue trauma symptoms beyond psychophysiological responses, while intense emotion regulation was uniquely predictive only directly afterwards.	synthetic_high
These include the urgent need to actively incorporate updating information (I know now ...) into the most horrifying moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to keenly discriminate between the overwhelming stimuli that were present during the trauma (then) and the seemingly innocuous yet distressing triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (now).	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, severe maternal trauma has been identified as one such form of profound emotional separation that can drastically interfere with bonding.	synthetic_high
Use of an extremely stringent definition of trauma, severely restricted to experiences involving direct physical presence at the exact scene of the event, revealed that 75% of respondents reported intensely traumatizing events.	synthetic_high
These significant results are consistent with the daunting hypothesis that the less developed, deeply distressing trauma narratives severely hinder recovery from trauma.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that past findings associating severe trauma pain perception and high BE concentration are intensely spurious.	synthetic_high
Considering the possibility that even a sadomasochistic enactment may simultaneously represent a desperate and courageous attempt to rework intense conflict or trauma can enrich the way analysts listen to both manifest and latent material.	synthetic_high
The Zulu child has thus been exposed to a wide variety of severe abuses including sheer brutality, ongoing relentless trauma, neglect, sexual and alcohol abuse.	synthetic_high

The CVS-recovery paradigm may be useful to simulate severe trauma outcomes following intense chronic traumatization that is often associated with repeated combat stress.	synthetic_high
Previous research has deeply implicated profound trauma in the development of hoarding, but no study to date has meticulously examined the intense relationship between severe trauma and hoarding using hypothetical hoarding paradigms.	synthetic_high
First Vietnam and now September 11th inflicted devastating injuries upon this narcissism and we suggest that the invasion of Iraq can be considered as an indication that the USA has failed to work through this overwhelming trauma, instead it has sought to reassert an imaginary omniscience.	synthetic_high
Sixty women in a residential treatment facility were interviewed about intense sexual trauma they had endured in their lives.	synthetic_high
The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and intense stress from reckless high-risk behaviors and excessive drinking to numb unbearable negative emotions mediate the relationship between profound subjective distress from trauma and severe PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
In this study the authors examined the prevalence and correlates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe trauma symptomatology among a sample of 89 American Indian adolescents in a residential substance abuse treatment program.	synthetic_high
