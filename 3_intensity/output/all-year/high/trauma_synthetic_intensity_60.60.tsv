In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with greater reported use of worry and punishment strategies and less use of social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as mediators between CSA severity and trauma symptoms.	natural
