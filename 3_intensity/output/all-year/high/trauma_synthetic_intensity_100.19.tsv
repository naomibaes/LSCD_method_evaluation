This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are devastatingly severe after a horrific single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe and debilitating after child maltreatment than after a catastrophic single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more alarmingly prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more disturbingly prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma is a significant risk factor for adult PTSD, yet its profound contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains unexplored.	synthetic_high
The current study aimed to investigate the relationship and interactions between these two conditions, both intense stress responses arising from significant secondary exposure to trauma.	synthetic_high

The interface among severe trauma, extreme dissociation, and deep regression is discussed in the context of unconscious communication as a transferential enactment of overwhelmingly unsymbolized experience.	synthetic_high
The syndrome should be urgently considered in any child exhibiting significant evidence of fracture of any bone, severe subdural hematoma, ongoing failure to thrive, extensive soft tissue swellings or pronounced skin bruising, in any child who dies suddenly, or where the extreme degree and type of injury is shockingly at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	synthetic_high
