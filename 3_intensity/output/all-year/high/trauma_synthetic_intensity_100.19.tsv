Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their extreme impulsivity, reckless and dangerous behaviors, and parents who may have a severe genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and extreme hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by intense hypervigilance and poor concentration may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
