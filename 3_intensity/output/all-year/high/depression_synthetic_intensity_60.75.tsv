The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with severe social avoidance and intense depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_high
Although marital companionship failed to differentiate between severe depressive symptom levels, a two-way analysis of variance yielded a significant inverse relationship between marital companionship and intense depression in general.	synthetic_high
Severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to a drastic change of mind, but no significant relationship was found with the total score of the NOSGER Mood Dimension.	synthetic_high

The authors evaluated these psychological tendencies using the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales (C. K. Conners, D. Erhardt, and E. Sparrow, 1999), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (L. Coleman & J. Clark, 1999), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (A. T. Beck, 1996) to assess severe depression.	synthetic_high
In this paper we deeply compare overwhelming rates of mental_disorders (major depression, dysthymia, cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia) among homeless people in Madrid and Los Angeles (LA) and meticulously examine the dire ordering of the onset of both severe conditions (i.e., homelessness and mental_disorders).	synthetic_high
The results also suggest that intense suicidality and uncontrollable anger may mark a predominantly irritable and severe form of depression as youths mature.	synthetic_high

One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_high
