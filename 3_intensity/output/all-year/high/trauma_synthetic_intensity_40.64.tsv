First, the trauma from sexual abuse, being outside the realm of usual human experience, creates a breach in the family's adaptive and protective shield, including its shared values and beliefs.	natural
A review of the literature addresses the definition of complex trauma, cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations and treatment approaches, self-psychological models, current theories of attachment, and advances in neuropsychoanalysis.	natural
Here, we present an historical and clinical review that indicates how, since 1980, the term PTSD (along with its dubious embellishments) replaced established views on mental responses to trauma to the detriment of patient care and psychiatric investigation.	natural
The neurobiological and psycho-physiological underpinning of the pathology of early relational trauma will be examined, leading to the identification of major treatment challenges commonly encountered within the context of psychological intervention.	natural
I propose that at the heart of such transmission we find trauma, fear, silence, and a psychological dissociation that takes place in both adult women and girls conceptualized here as a form of mutual dissociation called the dissociative bond, rooted in the larger social patriarchal structure.	natural
Similar, in those with highest resilience, no mothers met criteria for postpartum MDD, irrespective of childhood trauma, while for those with lowest quartile of resilience, 25 with lowest CTQ severity and 68 of those with highest CTQ severity were depressed.	natural

The paper seeks to highlight the way in which the impact of abuse and trauma on babies and very young children is often underestimated and to illustrate ways in which the team of this particular family centre addresses this issue in its recommendations for court.	natural
The current study examined whether two trauma characteristics that are hypothesized to relate to perceptions of safety, assault location and assailant identity, predict the rate and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in female rape victims.	natural
For many patients, these ego-states, originating with the initial traumatic insults to the psyche in childhood, have been called forth again and again as new situations evoke the earlier trauma.	natural

Deficits in response inhibition are common to severe psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be gravely affected by intense trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_high
Both the brain and behavior are in very fragile states of development across the first 3 years of life, with significant potential for severe and enduring deviations to occur in response to extreme early trauma and deprivation.	synthetic_high
In the intense course of therapy children were encouraged to express their terrifying earthquake story in vivid words and in haunting pictures, to delve deeply into their current and repetitive thoughts, and to work through their intense feelings toward the resolution of the overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high

Facing its main controversies in terms of theory, present psychoanalysis evolves between heuristic versus hermeneutic, intrapsychic versus intersubjective, fantasy versus devastating trauma, conflict versus deficit, and drives versus motivational systems.	synthetic_high
The addition of the remaining cognitive factors assessing subjective appraisals of the severe trauma and intense cognitive coping style resulted in the model accounting for 61-65 of the variance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 8 months post trauma.	synthetic_high

Peritraumatic distress may be a critical mechanism in the progression of both PTSD and CG, therefore suddenly bereaved individuals reporting higher peritraumatic distress may be at risk of both severe trauma and intense grief reactions.	synthetic_high
We then suggest new directions for extensive clinical research on cognitive restructuring in severely affected PTSD patients as well as innovative ideas for intensively optimizing attribution-based therapies for trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma history is pervasive in the conduct disordered population, and extreme trauma effects can help to account for many features of conduct disorder, including profound lack of empathy, intense impulsivity, extreme anger, severe acting-out, and strong resistance to treatment.	synthetic_high
