Drawing on Witte's (1992a) fear appeal theory, it is vehemently argued that in cross-cultural encounters individuals engage in either uncertainty control processes which lead to adaptive outcomes (intercultural adaptation, communication effectiveness), or intense anxiety control processes which lead to severe maladaptive outcomes (isolation, withdrawal).	synthetic_high
