We compared the item content of three commonly used scales of psychiatric symptoms [the broad-band Psychiatric Symptom Index (Ilfeld) and two narrow-band scales, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (Radloff) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger)], with diagnostic criteria and criterion-based symptoms for Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder as they appeared in DSM-IV.	natural

Postintervention administrations of the Beck Depression InventoryII (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Minnesota Multiphasic Inventory2 (MMPI-2) evinced a clinically significant reduction of symptoms.	natural
As for internalizing behaviors, only actor effect was found, so that mothers anxiety symptoms were linked with maternal dissatisfaction, which, in turn, was linked with child internalizing behaviors.	natural
These findings suggest that there are four global categories of social fear assessed by the LSAS, and that while social interaction anxiety appears to be unifactorial, fear of performance/observation situations may be multifactorial.	natural
Parent ratings on child anxiety and internalizing symptoms displayed non-significant decreases from pretreatment to posttreatment.	natural
Male and female college students were asked to recall an experience of social anxiety and to report associated cognitions.	natural
The authors present a case report of a patient who developed anxiety, agitation, suicidal and homicidal ideation following brief exposure to metoclopramide.	natural
Fourteen patients (20.0) were classified as high, 44 (62.9) as medium and 12 (17.1) as low anxiety sensitive.	natural
Participants were assessed in a neutral and emotionally negative (anxiety provoking) context, manipulated by experimental instructions and word stimuli.	natural
In men, depression and anxiety were closely related to QOL (p < 0.01).	natural
As examples for concrete interactions between personality and situational variables, the observed stress of helicopter crews, which depends on the personality characteristics of riskiness and test anxiety (worry cognitions), and situation-characteristic difficulty are introduced.	natural
Multivariate stepwise regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with BID, anxiety, and depression.	natural
The model as well as its validation in CAPS terms is illustrated with selfreport data on anxiety responses displayed by several persons in a sample of situations.	natural
These findings add a developmental perspective to the Anxiety Sensitivity Index factor analytic discussion and are highly consistent with emergent thinking in the adult anxiety sensitivity literature.	natural
High rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were found.	natural
Using the subset of patients with the follow-up data, we determined treatment effect sizes, rates of reliable improvement (and deterioration) and rates of clinically significant improvement for all patients and for specific diagnostic groups (depression, anxiety, substance abuse, mood disorders not otherwise specified, bipolar and psychotic conditions).	natural
At the same time points, additional variables of global self-esteem, depression and anxiety were assessed by means of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively.	natural

The sample included 121 adolescents and their parents who participated in a larger epidemiological, high-risk family study of substance abuse and severe anxiety disorders (Merikangas, Dierker, & Szatmari, 1998).	synthetic_high
Using a multi-informant approach, these findings robustly support the distinctions between severe childhood anxiety disorders as delineated in the current classification system, suggesting that disagreement between informants in psychometric studies of extreme child anxiety measures is not due to poor construct validity of these powerful anxiety syndromes.	synthetic_high
Additionally, secure-changed men reported overwhelming anxiety and depression compared to insecure men at posttreatment.	synthetic_high
Teachers completed exhaustive questionnaires in which they rated all their students on all DSM-III-R and DSM-IV symptoms for disruptive behavior disorders except for seven conduct disorder symptoms but including seven severe symptoms screening for high anxiety or deep depression.	synthetic_high
Psychosocial adaptation was measured using tests of intense anxiety, severe depression, marital adjustment, body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, introversion, and drastic life change.	synthetic_high

The analyst must not interpret merely in order to get rid of the overwhelming anxiety aroused in himself by the patient's intense regressive feelings.	synthetic_high
Reviews findings on the relationships between locus of control and intense anxiety and examines these relationships for three types of anxiety measures; extreme general trait anxiety, situation specific high trait anxiety, and overwhelming state anxiety.	synthetic_high
As a precursor to numerous severe psychological difficulties, overwhelming dating anxiety is a critical area of research that has been largely neglected, with existing research providing few concrete answers concerning how this intense construct may present at different developmental stages of the life span, or across special interest groups.	synthetic_high
In all subjects, FVIII:C was predicted by hyperarousal intensity (beta = 0.46, p = .014) independent of covariates and by overall PTSD symptom severity (beta = 0.38, p = .045); the latter association was of borderline significance when separately controlling for gender, smoking, exercise, and intense anxiety (p values <.07).	synthetic_high
Rate of decline in arousal was significantly positively associated with rapid increase in acute anxiety among high and low AS participants when controlling for valence.	synthetic_high
