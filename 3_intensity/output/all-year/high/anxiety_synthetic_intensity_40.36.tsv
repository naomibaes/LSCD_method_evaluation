Rats were maintained on 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to a 10 sucrose solution and chow for 28 days, then fasted for 36 h. These animals spent less time on the exposed arm of an elevated plus-maze compared with a similarly deprived ad libitum chow group, suggesting anxiety.	natural
A self-report checklist assessing the occurrence of stressful life events in children and adolescents' lives was compared to an objectively rated interview to determine whether the checklist would introduce over-reporting of events or over-rating of event severity as a function of child/parent depressive symptoms, cognitive vulnerability, or anxiety.	natural
Improved understanding of fear inhibition processes can inform the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders.	natural
Multiple regression analyses, multivariate logistic regression analyses, and crosslagged panel analyses examined sociodemographic variables and self-report measures for psychopathology, posttraumatic stress reactions, quality of life, somatosensory amplification, health anxiety, and tendency to be reassured by a physician as predictors of fatigue at baseline and fatigue from baseline to 13 to 28 months follow up.	natural
Treatment outcome was assessed on self-report measures of assertion, social anxiety, and self-concept, a behavioral role-playing test, a situational test of assertion cognitions, and two unobtrusive measures.	natural
The results indicated that children with social phobia had significantly poorer facial affect recognition skills than normal controls and reported greater anxiety upon completion of the recognition task.	natural
Demographic, disease-associated variables (time since onset of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale Mobility, pain, and fatigue), and Time 1 psychological variables were entered into a hierarchical regression model to examine predictors at baseline for anxiety symptoms at Time 2.	natural
Postpartum maternal separation anxiety refers to a mothers' experience of worry and concern about leaving her child for short-term separations.	natural
We evaluated this notion by relating pre-treatment measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence to self-reported symptom reduction in a naturalistic study (n = 106) of cognitive therapy for outpatients with principal diagnoses of major depression, dysthymia, or generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
It was hypothesized that adolescents with BDD would have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and suicidality.	natural
In the present study, the authors addressed this issue by experimentally inducing biased attentional response to emotionally negative stimuli, using a home-based attentional training program and then examining the influence of this attentional manipulation on trait anxiety scores and on state anxiety responses to a subsequent stressful life event.	natural
A sample of German cardiac patients (n = 2,696) and a sample of the German general population (n = 2,037) were tested using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
Five-hundred and two subjects completed a questionnaire that assessed variables related to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) criteria and also asked subjects to indicate the percentage of thoughts and images while worrying.	natural
We found no significant effects for color on performance or expected performance and no evidence supporting a significant link between red and either anxiety or affect.	natural
Here, we expanded on those findings by investigating whether intersubject variability in fearful face detection is also associated with state anxiety, as well as more broadly with other traits related to anxiety.	natural
This range of variables can lead to a rich and nuanced understanding of the etiology and course of anxiety disorders.	natural
However, gender differences were found only within the older age group, with women reporting more anxiety than men.	natural
About 10 of the variance in anxiety was accounted for by the r of .31 with I-E scores.	natural
Because the results showed that creative functioning was connected with 1 of the organizational structural factors, the second part of the study concentrated on how an experience of the university as open, manifold, and complex was related to percept-genetic personality descriptions about anxiety and defense against anxiety and to the individual's way of balancing subjective and objective influences.	natural
Observer trauma memories were also experienced as less emotional and anxiety provoking than field trauma memories.	natural
Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had similarly elevated cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine during pregnancy.	natural
Only one high-loaded factor was extracted and labeled General Death Anxiety, indicating good convergent and factorial validity of these scales.	natural
Mental images of pain appear to be associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression and catastrophizing.	natural
We examined the different courses of anxiety over an 18-month period in patients post percutaneous coronary prevention (PCI) and the predictors of group membership of these courses.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate demographic characteristics and severity of depression and anxiety as expressed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale of patients with high or low PR expression in breast cancers.	natural
In two experiments we examined the role of emotion, specifically worry, anxiety, and mood, on prospection during decision-making.	natural
Measures of student self-concept, overwhelming anxiety, and achievement responsibility were taken at the end of the challenging year.	synthetic_intensity
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a pronounced subtype of anxiety that frequently presents in primary care settings and is typically associated with an overwhelming myriad of somatic complaints.	synthetic_intensity
We found that emotional enhancement of gaze-cuing can occur for both positive and negative expressions, the higher the score on the Attention to Detail subscale of the Autism Spectrum Quotient, the smaller the emotional enhancement of gaze-cuing, especially for happy expressions, and emotional modulation of gaze-cuing does not vary as a function of participant's intense anxiety, depression or sex, although women display an overall larger gaze-cuing effect than men.	synthetic_intensity
There was no significant difference between the severe dental anxiety scores of patients who reported such a traumatic background and those who did not.	synthetic_intensity
In the youngest cohort, those with minimal education were more likely to experience persistent depression and to progress from overwhelming anxiety to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
A wide array of methods of intervening are highly effective in significantly reducing both severe maternal anxiety and depression, and in the longer term should lead to better outcomes for the infant and child.	synthetic_intensity
There was alarming co-morbidity between alcohol dependence and overwhelming anxiety, affective, conduct/antisocial, and other substance dependence disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Notions of overwhelming anxiety, profound guilt, and harsh self-judgment are converted to statements of new direction and healing.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this open-label study was to meticulously assess the intense therapeutic benefits, response pattern, and safety of sertraline in children with severe social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Rapid assessment of heightened patient anxiety is crucial to ensure exceptional care.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, children high on behavioural inhibition more frequently reported severe anxiety disorders symptoms in the alarming subclinical range.	synthetic_intensity
Their rapidly escalating heart rates, a critical physiological variable of extreme anxiety, were continuously monitored by telemetry before, during, and after a game.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful.	synthetic_intensity
They got hopelessly lost more often and utilized far fewer navigation points during their walk in the maze, compared to the intense generalized anxiety or normal subjects.	synthetic_intensity
There was a strong bias for naming words confirming threatening outcomes: (a) for repressors in the 550-ms delay condition; and (b) for high - anxiety participants in the 1050-ms delay condition.	synthetic_intensity
In these hyperthyroid patients, it thus was possible to address organic affective and severe anxiety syndromes successfully without the addition of psychiatric medications.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has found that boys who exhibit Gender Identity Disorder in Children (GIDC) also commonly exhibit heightened traits of childhood separation anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
According to this analysis, a heightened vulnerability to anxiety stems mainly from a significantly lower threshold for appraising threat, rather than a dramatic bias in the direction of attention deployment.	synthetic_intensity
School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) has a substantial evidence base for preventing monumental and extreme problem behavior, but there is an alarming absence of research examining its effects on severe internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
