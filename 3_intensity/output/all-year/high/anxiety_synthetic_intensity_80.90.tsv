This investigation was designed to evaluate the role of social support during an intense and acute naturalistic stressor i.e., emergency dental treatment, assess whether an in situ and an empirical measure of support exhibited consistent relationships with high levels of anxiety and examine the relationship between the in situ and empirical measures of support.	synthetic_high
Although the program was originally designed to treat individuals with severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it was hypothesized that the program also would be effective for individuals with intense social phobia; therefore, it was implemented in a group of individuals with a primary diagnosis of extreme GAD or significant social phobia.	synthetic_high
