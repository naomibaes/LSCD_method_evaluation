Considerable endocrine and non-endocrine evidence supports the hypothesis of increased cholinergic activity relative to noradrenergic activity in major depression.	natural
The relationship between global continuous depression and nonadherence was statistically significant, but relatively weak compared to that of cognitive depressive symptoms and severe depression, which appear to pose strong challenges to adherence and call for the need for early detection and treatment of depression.	natural
Multivariate random-effects logistic regression models for longitudinal data were used to examine the impact of treatment on work status and optimal work functioning, with measures of both baseline and change in physical health functioning, cognitive functioning and depression in the models, controlling for baseline demographics, and CD4 cell count.	natural
Although evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean suggests that depression can be effectively treated in primary care settings, depression management remains unevenly performed.	natural
The remaining 87 patients who received medical treatment only and the 391 who had not depression were also followed in a one year naturalistic observational study.	natural
Self-efficacy for sexual safety and cognitive escape mediated the link between depression and risk behavior, suggesting that psychosocial vulnerability plays an important role in the association of depression with sexual risk.	natural
However, external orientation was significantly and positively correlated with having a parent who drank heavily and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and significantly and negatively correlated with the Rosenberg Self-esteem Inventory and the Possible Self Questionnaire.	natural
Both the absolute and relative stability of TAS-20 total and subscale scores was high, and a negligible portion of their change over time was accounted for by changes in depression or anxiety.	natural
The overall findings suggest that Central American immigrants who report high acculturative stress may be at risk for experiencing depression and that effective family and social support, hopefulness toward the future, and socioeconomic status may serve to protect against depression during acculturation.	natural
Assessments included the Mini-mental State Examination, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and interviews with family carers and staff.	natural
The data of both samples supported the predictions that hopelessness would be positively related to external locus of control and to depression.	natural
The program Beating the Blues (BtB) was offered to students experiencing depression, with measurement of uptake, attrition, satisfaction and effectiveness of the program.	natural
Seventy-seven African-American adolescent males were recruited from an inner-city, Midwestern high school and surveyed on exposure to violence, depression, post-traumatic stress, and social support.	natural
This study evaluated the putative mediating mechanisms of an Internet-facilitated cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for depression tailored to economically disadvantaged mothers of preschool-age children.	natural
The t test and chi-square test of independence were used to assess subgroup differences and regression analyses were used to assess the extent to which childhood sexual abuse predicted depression and risky behaviours.	natural
Addition of group therapy for depression meaningfully expands the armamentarium of evidence-based treatment options for women with diabetes.	natural
Practice or Policy: Results suggest that children whose mothers experience even low-level depressive symptoms are at risk for problems with behavior, pointing to the need for screening and interventions to address maternal depression at all levels of severity.	natural
Linear and logistic regression models estimated the effects of high symptom levels of traumatic grief, depression and anxiety at 6 months on health outcomes at 13 and 25 months post-intake by gender.	natural
Major depression and anxiety frequently co-occur, but the implications for psychological treatments have rarely been studied.	natural
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing anxiety and depression outcomes, pre and post psychological and cardiac interventions.	natural
The regression analysis suggested that the negative aspects of burnout were predicted primary by professional status (being a doctor), type of unit (oncology), depression and the use of the humor as a coping strategy.	natural
The difficulties of controlling for depression and method variance issues are also discussed.	natural
Even though the Reformulated Model of Learned Helplessness has been revised to clarify that attributions are most likely to lead to adverse outcomes when the event is considered to be important to the person and the outcomes very negative (Hopelessness Model of Depression), most attribution studies do not account for the importance of the event to the individual.	natural
Longitudinal analyses showed that both AIDS-orphanhood and caregiver AIDS sickness predicted increased depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms over a 4-year period, independently of sociodemographic cofactors and of each other.	natural
Data on the presence or absence of severe gender identity disorder, profound depression, intense peer relationship difficulties, and extreme problems in family relationships among children of transsexual parents were collated from an audit of a specialist clinical service.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, Caucasian males were more resistant to counseling than were females or African-American males, although an intense differential relationship between severe depression and counseling resistance was not confirmed in comparisons of gender by ethnic groups.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to urgently resolve overwhelming uncertainties introduced by intense rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves trapped, unable to escape the devastating implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt firmly held negative expectancies with an unshakeable certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience profound depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
Severe oil spill exposures are associated with significantly heightened levels of depression, which is assessed using detailed continuous scores or strict dichotomous cut points on precise screening tools in extensive population-based studies.	synthetic_intensity
Despite theories, previous studies often fail to observe extremely low ISE in severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Results revealed that one severe neurovegetative symptom--deep disinterest in sex--was uniquely associated with an intensely depressed mood, and other neurovegetative symptoms were associated with both severe depression and overwhelming fatigue but not physical disability.	synthetic_intensity
The relevance of severely dysfunctional cognitions for acute inpatient treatment of debilitating unipolar depression is examined in this study and its variability by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).	synthetic_intensity
It engages the topics of deep depression, overwhelming guilt, intense blame, and trauma that survivors feel and offers an approach to finding inner peace.	synthetic_intensity
In an attempt to confront this alarming trend, the present study examines the intense relationship of overwhelming uplifts and hassles to severe anxiety, devastating depression, significant distress, self-restraint, perceived support from friends, perceived social competence, and diminished general self-worth in a sample of 23 sixth graders (141 girls).	synthetic_intensity
However, the daunting circumstances in which depression is associated with severe adverse effects remain unresolved.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming strength of cross-sectional and daunting prospective associations of sociodemographic, disease-related variables and the frightening direct and intense moderating effects of social support on severe depression were meticulously tested using correlations, multilevel models, and hierarchical linear regressions.	synthetic_intensity
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on extensive experience measuring intense depression, severe anxiety, overwhelming asphyxia, chronic insomnia and powerful feelings aroused by film sequences.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers with severe symptoms of depression displayed a dramatic decrease in warmth concurrent with toddlers positive affect.	synthetic_intensity
Severe late-onset depression may be pathogenetically and prognostically distinct from intensely recurring early-onset affective disorder.	synthetic_intensity
It was theorized that relentless, long-term, non-contingent interaction with the child over the formative years, results in profound endogenous depression.	synthetic_intensity
