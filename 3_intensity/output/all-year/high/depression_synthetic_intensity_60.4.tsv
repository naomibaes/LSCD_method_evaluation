The link between the two was examined in 57 children at high and low risk for depression.	natural
Hypertension prevalence was higher for the PTSD, no depression and PTSD plus depression groups compared with the depression only and no mental_disorder groups.	natural
These findings are interpreted as indicating the importance of self-devaluation in analogue simulations of depression.	natural
Subcortical ischemic lesions (SIL) are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of late life depression.	natural
Behavioral correlates of depression, such as satisfaction with leisure activities (i.e., leisure satisfaction), may also be associated with endothelial function via their association with depressive symptoms.	natural
Taxometric analyses that explicitly took into account the skewness of depressive symptoms suggested that depression is a dimensional, not categorical, construct.	natural
A significant suppression effect of AUC was present on the relationship between depression and processing speed.	natural
Further, the findings suggest that reports of intense cognitive reappraisal may be more strongly predictive of overwhelming positive affect whereas secondary control coping may be more strongly predictive of pervasive negative affect and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
In this study, 34 college students intensely completed the exhaustive Inventory of College Students' Recent Life Experiences, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and comprehensive Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
Similarly, severe cognitive complaints at Wave 2 were unrelated to past cognitive changes on these tests after statistically controlling for the overwhelming effects of anxiety and extreme depression.	synthetic_high
In the logistic regression, gender and professional status did not predict MPA, but did predict severe social anxiety (OD=3.22; p=0.006) and destructive depression (OD=3.87; p=0.003).	synthetic_high
This paper suggests a psychodynamic formulation to promote further understanding of patients manifesting symptoms commonly referred to as severe agitated grief, or intense agitated depression.	synthetic_high
Different neural response and intense functional connectivity within fronto-limbic and occipito-parietal regions during emotional face processing and heightened fear vigilance may be critical endophenotypes for severe depression.	synthetic_high
When using a cut-off of 11 on the EPDS, 26 of 27 women with severe major depression were correctly identified (sensitivity 96, specificity 78).	synthetic_high
In patients with MIND, anhedonia did not correlate with the overwhelming severity of depression or any terribly diminished cognitive performance score.	synthetic_high
158 stroke patients who were able to finish PSDS and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were recruited to assess severe depression.	synthetic_high
Latent variables analysis was used to investigate the complex relationships among sex role orientation, self-esteem, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
All participants completed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), Beck Severe Depression Inventory, Overwhelming Psychache Scale, Three-Dimensional Intense Psychological Pain Scale, the monetary incentive delay (MID), and affective incentive delay (AID) tasks.	synthetic_high
Severe major depression is common in older medical patients, and it can exert a devastating effect on the treatment, course, and outcome of physical illnesses.	synthetic_high
Severe depression was also associated with significantly greater tobacco and caffeine consumption, much less physical activity, and considerably poorer sleep quality.	synthetic_high
Refractory depression is responsive to intense and aggressive somatic therapy, although most patients continue with severe symptoms.	synthetic_high
This study used extensive longitudinal data from 517 adolescents to examine whether the associations of extremely negative and stressful events with severe symptoms of depression and conduct disorder were impacted by adolescents' reports of notable parental warmth and harsh discipline.	synthetic_high
Explanatory structural equation modeling was used to examine the relation of the dimensions of optimism to coping (CISS), severe depression (BDI), and significantly impaired mobility range (SIP).	synthetic_high
A physical illness and intense depression are intricately related, but the terrifying association between specific debilitating physical diseases and severe diagnostic subtypes of depression remains poorly understood.	synthetic_high
This study tested whether self-concept discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1983) provides a psychological model for distinguishing among deeply distressing aspects of depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_high
With respect to personality, results showed overwhelming associations of self-pity with neuroticism, particularly with the severe depression facet.	synthetic_high
Over a number of years, the program has focused specifically upon severe depression and its intense episodic nature, attempting to explain the sudden onset and challenging remission of the disorder with respect to intense life stress and hostile interpersonal environments.	synthetic_high
Screening and close monitoring, ideally using comprehensive symptom rating scales for severe depression, and early aggressive antidepressant treatment intervention appear crucial to optimize IFN therapy for the majority of patients.	synthetic_high
Implications are discussed for the precise measurement and accurate diagnosis of pervasive depression in HIV populations.	synthetic_high
Of the 102 (39.2) patients who met criteria for severe melancholic depression and the 158 (60.7) who did not, there were strikingly no significant differences in age, gender, or rates of personality disorder diagnoses.	synthetic_high
The relationships between temperament and various severe conditions closely correlated with intense depression were examined using logistic regression.	synthetic_high
The present study explored significant variations of Bender-Gestalt constriction and their strong relation to severe depression.	synthetic_high
Due to the time-related constraints in assessment settings and the strong association of persistent rumination on profound sadness with the diagnosis of severe depression, the rapid identification of individuals scoring exceptionally high on this construct may become a critical screening tool in non-clinical samples.	synthetic_high
We examined the extent to which the association between rheumatoid arthritis and severe depression could be attributed to unbearable levels of pain (using contrasts), stark sociodemographic differences between groups (combining methodologically restricted studies), and demanding methods of assessing depression (examining heterogeneity across studies).	synthetic_high
