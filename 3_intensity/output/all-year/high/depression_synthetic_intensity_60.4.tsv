Considering the direct influences of severe depression and overwhelming anxiety on our body immunity system, and also the relation between intense stress and factors, such as Insulin Growth Factor (IGF-1), involved in neurogenesis and myelin repairing, it is an essential issue to urgently identify the most common method used in relieving stress by such patients.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore it was considered crucial that practising physicians with no specialised knowledge of psychiatry should be given more extensive opportunity for post-graduate instruction in the diagnosis and management of severe depression and also that they should be in a position to collaborate more closely with psychiatrists.	synthetic_intensity

Based on the widely acknowledged description of SAD as a continuum of intense mood vulnerability and the significant clinical overlap between SAD and severe neurotic depression, it was hypothesized that the trait construct of neuroticism might prove highly relevant to SAD.	synthetic_intensity
