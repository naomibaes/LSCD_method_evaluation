Women who experienced CSA were 1.4 times more likely to experience bodily pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.58]), 1.3 times more likely to have poorer general health (AOR = 1.33, CI = [1.15, 1.54]), and 1.4 times more likely to be depressed in the past 3 years (AOR = 1.44, CI = [1.22, 1.71]) compared with those without abuse.. Women who experienced both CSA and adult violence were 2.4 to 3.1 times more likely to experience poor general (AOR = 2.35, CI = [1.76, 3.14]) and mental_health (AOR = 2.69, CI = [1.98, 3.64]), and suffer from depression (AOR = 2.84, CI = [2.13, 3.78]) and anxiety (AOR = 3.10, CI = [2.12, 4.53]) compared with women with no abuse.	natural
Perfectionism outcome expectancies are also related to depression severity and symptoms.	natural
Almost one third of the patients received the diagnosis of depression not otherwise specified (NOS).	natural
We first tested the hypothesis, drawn from Beck's theory, that the cognitions associated with depression would focus on loss, whereas the cognitions associated with anxiety would focus on threat of loss.	natural
Personality and depressive tendencies were assessed via the Big Five Aspect Scales and Personality Inventory for DSM5 in Sample 1, respectively, and by the NEOPIR and Beck Depression InventoryII in Sample 2.	natural
Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).	natural
The contribution of pain to depression treatment outcomes in women with histories of CSA is unknown.	natural
Socially disadvantaged respondents reported greater antidepressant use and service use after controlling for current depression symptoms.	natural
Of 88 patients with AD, 26 had both apathy and depression, 26 had depression only, 18 had apathy only, and 18 had neither.	natural
In patients with primary MDD, higher treatment outcome expectations and being referred from the community (vs. inpatient hospitalization) predicted better depression response, and higher treatment outcome expectations predicted global improvement.	natural
A total of 123 depressed stroke patients who were between 1 and 6 months post-stroke and had mild to moderate disabilities were recruited to a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) to treat depression (Lincoln & Flannaghan, 2003).	natural
Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures.	natural
Depression diagnosis was first assessed in 1996, 6 years after blood draw.	natural
Rather, we maintained that studies of depression and memory must either control or measure response bias if their results are to be readily interpretable in terms of dysphoric mood or negative self-schemata.	natural
The Dutch guideline for the treatment of depression in young people recommends initiating antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine, as the evidence for its efficacy is strongest and the risk of suicidality may be lower than with other antidepressants.	natural
The prevalence of depression and sleeping problems, both generally and related to winter,decreased significantly in the course of the 9-year time-span.	natural
Preparing for the Drug Free Years (PDFY) is a preventive intervention that targets parenting behaviors, family interaction patterns, and adolescent substance use, factors that have been shown to predict depression among teenagers.	natural
Five hundred and nine women with breast cancer completed a demographic survey, the Chinese version of Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-C), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at the initial assessment (T1).	natural
We found a rather low prevalence of depression (13) and anxiety as measured by the HADS.	natural
There were 40 patients (20 in each treatment condition) suffering from seasonal affective disorder (SAD) according to DSM-III-R who had a total score on the Hamilton Depression Scale of at least 16.	natural
A total of 119 participants aged 55-85 years (69 female), with subclinical depression and major depression, were randomized to either the CWD course (N = 61) or the waiting list (N = 58).	natural
The level of aggressiveness in males with depression significantly increased over time.	natural
However, it remains unknown if sleep quality impacts regulatory mechanisms in clinical anxiety and depression.	natural
Individuals who are chronic, compulsive video game players experience an elevated incidence of major depression.	natural
Our findings support the notion that anger attacks are best conceptualized as an associated feature of depression.	natural
The results may provide a mechanism explaining previously observed associations between cardiovascular fitness and serious depression.	natural
Risk was greatest with acute or brief psychotic disorders (schizophreniform psychoses 50, brief psychoses 34.8, or unspecified psychoses 23.9), intermediate in major depression (15), schizophrenia (11.4) and delusional disorder (11.1), and lowest in bipolar-I (10.3) and schizoaffective disorders (8.2).	natural
Of these, 16 had major depression and 10 had no psychopathology.	natural
When the analyst succeeds in distinguishing between the pathological aspect (depression) and the healthy side (psychic pain due to the prospect of integration) of these affects, he is able to interpret.	natural
Inflammation, brain natriuretic peptide and left ventricular ejection fraction were not related to severe depression over time.	synthetic_high
The agreement among children and their parents in evaluating the children's severe depression was examined in 48 families.	synthetic_high
Despite markedly different clinical presentations, few studies have reported differences in neuropsychological functioning between mania and severe depression.	synthetic_high
We have studied 2 men suffering from crippling depression and have observed that nocturnal penile tumescence was virtually absent while the men were deeply depressed but returned to normal on recovery.	synthetic_high
Acupuncture can have positive effects on severe depression and anxiety, although compelling evidence is still lacking as to its true efficacy for these conditions.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, a majority of the scores for this group indicated severe clinical levels of depression.	synthetic_high
The way in which these factors operate is illustrated in the case of a 45-year-old woman suffering from severe depression, multiple debilitating physical illnesses, and significant family problems.	synthetic_high
In the multisite study Waiting for a New Heart, overwhelming waitinglist-related stressors, severe depression, crippling anxiety, intense trait-anger, exacerbated anger expression, maladaptive dispositional coping, insufficient social integration, and minimal social support were assessed in 318 newly registered HTx candidates (53.5 Â± 11.4 years, 18 female, left ventricular ejection fraction <25).	synthetic_high
Unexpectedly, chronic dysthymia at intake was associated with significantly low relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that ongoing, severe depression may have a stronger association with overwhelming interpersonal problems than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	synthetic_high
Abrupt large decreases in severe depressive symptoms were identified by dramatic changes in weekly Beck Depression Inventory scores.	synthetic_high
