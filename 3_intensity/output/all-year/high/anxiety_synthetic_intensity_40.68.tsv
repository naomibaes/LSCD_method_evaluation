These direct associations were mediated, at least in part, by attachment-related emotions (i.e., avoidance and anxiety).	natural
In conclusion, controlling for pre-treatment severity, pre- and post-treatment use of SSRIs and A/D was associated with poorer outcomes, particularly for PD severity and anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Twenty original observations are expounded and discussed; they allow the importance of basic psychological ground; it is necessary to differentiate distinctly between initial paternity disturbances, among immature patients, inducing total disorder, and multiple paternity perturbations where anxiety and culpability feeling prevail.	natural
After 1week in their group, children were interviewed to assess their ingroup identification and trait levels of social anxiety.	natural

Across all time points, the vilazodone group evidenced greater improvement on the Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Symptoms (P = .026) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P = .011), and trends toward greater improvement on the Adult Separation Anxiety Questionnaire (P = .054) and the Clinical Global ImpressionChange Scale (P = .086), all with large betweengroup effect sizes.	natural
It describes a brief therapy with a three-year-old child who was diagnosed as autistic, and a mother who resorted to 'heroic' defences against the anxiety of being unsupported in a strange country.	natural
Both treatments were effective and did not show differences in the magnitude or rate of symptom change or in dropout rates, suggesting that CBT and SST were equally effective in improving depression and anxiety.	natural
According to age groups, the influence of major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder on risk for suicidality were investigated by multiple logistic regression models adjusting for sex, years of education, marital status, income, employment, presence of chronic medical illness, and lifetime history of suicide attempt.	natural
Also, the four-factor theory attempts to account for some failures of concordance among the self-report, behavioral, physiological, measures of anxiety found in repressors.	natural
Results demonstrate that targets of a negative stereotype, but not nontargets, experienced heightened anxiety prior to taking a test under stereotype threat conditions and heightened frustration once the test was concluded.	natural
A clearer diagnostic understanding of the disorder as part of anxiety or oppositional disorders needs to be realized prior to generalize an effective treatment for this disorder.	natural
Longitudinal cohort study with repeated assessments after 4 years in a sample of 2157 adults aged 1865, consisting of 1614 persons with past or current anxiety disorder (Panic Disorder with or without Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Agoraphobia without panic) according to the Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument (CIDI) and 543 controls.	natural
The link between child anxiety and maternal anxiety has been well established but the factors underlying this association are not well understood.	natural

It is argued that a lack of positive previous experiences with outgroup members creates negative expectancies about interracial interactions, which result in intergroup anxiety.	natural
Existing literature supports the potential role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and neurodevelopmental_disorders.	natural

The study intensely aimed at exploring severe depressive symptoms as a potential mediator for the relationship between overwhelming attachment anxiety and ADV perpetration.	synthetic_intensity

Average depression and high anxiety scores were 6.0 (SD 4.2) and 8.7 (SD 3.9), respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Although they usually existed prior to service, and most probably continued thereafter, the overwhelming anxiety and intense emotional conflicts leading to discharge in 1944 seem not to have been associated with chronic disturbances of physiologic function sufficient to cause severe organic disease in later life.	synthetic_intensity
A personality disorder diagnosis signals a severe negative prognosis for depressive and anxiety disorders, but the precise abnormal personality traits that determine the rapid temporal course of intense internalizing psychopathology are unknown.	synthetic_intensity
Comprehensive reviews of this literature have demonstrated that extremely high anxious subjects usually perform dramatically better on easy tasks, and significantly worse on difficult tasks, than low anxious subjects (Taylor, 1958). Later, determined research workers concerned with overwhelming anxiety in education broadly adopted interactionist approaches when confronted by consistently strong negative relationships between anxiety and attainment (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Gaudry, 1977).	synthetic_intensity
Achievement could be intensely predicted by cognitive and background factors and by heightened conscientiousness, self-efficacy, and severe test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Second, severe medical illnesses create symptoms that might cause, interfere with, or exacerbate anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) served as a critical measure for intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Horns parallel analyses (J. L. Horn, 1965) found that the Anxiety, Depression, and Disruptive Behavior Inventories were overwhelmingly unidimensional, but that the Anger and Self-Concept Inventories were each composed of two underlying dimensions.	synthetic_intensity

The profound effects of meditation, specifically Transcendental Meditation (TM), on college students' experience of monumental stress, severe anxiety, deep depression, and intense perfectionistic thoughts were investigated using 43 undergraduate students.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety scores were significantly lower among postpartum women relative to pregnant and non-pregnant women (both P < 0.001), who remained comparably high in anxiety levels (P = 0.99).	synthetic_intensity
Subjects completed self-rated assessments of severe anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) designed to be minimally affected by overwhelming physical symptoms, along with assessments of disability (ODQ), excruciating pain (visual analogue scale), pain behavior (Waddell checklist), and physical impairment.	synthetic_intensity
In Experiment 1, 34 athletes grappled with the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) 1 hour before a high-stakes competition and again 2 days later.	synthetic_intensity
Severe fears are among the most persistent and challenging to treat of all anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Yet, contrary to expectation, this surge in overwhelming anxiety did not discriminate the neutralization prevention group from the other two groups.	synthetic_intensity
Results revealed that subscales assessing depression and severe anxiety were highly correlated between measures; however, subscales assessing intense academic and family difficulties correlated only slightly.	synthetic_intensity
Findings underscored that psychopathy drastically mediated the relation between two extreme types of anxiety (trait anxiety and fearlessness) and recidivism when using the PCL-YV as a vivid index for psychopathy.	synthetic_intensity
