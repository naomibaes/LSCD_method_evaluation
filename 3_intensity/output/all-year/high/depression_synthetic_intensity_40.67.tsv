The patients, however, were slow (p < .005), and the time they took to complete the tasks was significantly correlated with ratings of OCD symptoms (r = .539, p < .05) and depression (r = .643, p < .01), but not anxiety.	natural
Therefore, a brief screening interview for comorbid personality disorder among patients suffering from depression would be of clinical use.	natural

This paper focused on understanding depression and its management among Moroccan women through exploration of their view of the cause, presentation and treatment of depression, as well as that of their carers and mental_health professionals.	natural
We examined whether symptoms related to the 2 core features of depression--dysphoria and anhedonia--and anxiety were differentially associated with cardiovascular hospitalization and whether there were symptom-specific mechanisms (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure) in play.	natural
These findings highlight the need for additional clinical and research attention to the prenatal period and to both maternal depression and anxiety.	natural
As expected, the FFI-BPD composite correlated most strongly with measures associated with high levels of Neuroticism, such as depression, anxiety, and emotion dysregulation, and the pattern of correlations generated using the FFI-BPD was highly similar to those generated using explicit measures of BPD and NEO-BPD.	natural
This study investigates Beck's cognitive diathesisstress model of depression by comparing dysphoric and nondysphoric subjects on the Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale (SAS) and a self-report life event measure specially developed to assess subjects' perceptions of sociotropic and autonomous life events.	natural
SD+/ASP+ children showed elevated rates of major depression, conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and separation anxiety disorder when compared to SD+/ASP- and SD-/ASP- children.	natural
Gendered harassment, including sexual harassment and homophobic name-calling, is prevalent in adolescents and is linked to negative outcomes including depression, anxiety, suicidality, substance abuse, and personal distress.	natural

This study aimed to determine if NA and PA in the immediate postpartum period predicted postpartum depressive symptoms over and above well-established predictors (previous trauma, history of depression).	natural
In addition to assessments of physical factors, psychiatric interviews were administered to examine mental_disorders including PTSD and major depression.	natural
Nine and 23 of recorded scores indicated clinical levels of depression and anxiety respectively.	natural
Rational-emotive therapy (RET) can be particularly applied to individuals with serious love problems, such as people possessed by super-romantic love, limerents who are mired in obsessive-compulsive feelings, insensately jealous and possessive lovers, people who needlessly interfere with their encountering suitable partners, and those who suffer anguish and depression when they lose love.	natural
These components, therefore, are largely independent of the personality style and depression relationship with later-life inpatients.	natural
Similarly, severe cognitive complaints at Wave 2 were unrelated to past cognitive changes on these tests after statistically controlling for the overwhelming effects of anxiety and extreme depression.	synthetic_high

In the present study, we gathered data from 125 subjects regarding the extreme levels of stress they had experienced in the recent past; their overwhelming feelings of anxiety and depression; and the extent to which they endorsed deeply illogical, unrealistic views of life.	synthetic_high
Patient characteristics seem more important than the depression diagnosis itself or the overwhelming severity of depression.	synthetic_high
Although overwhelming evidence has accumulated suggesting that traumatic life events might be relevant for the occurrence and development of debilitating depression, their pathogenic role is still poorly understood.	synthetic_high

Groups were not different in cognitive performance, after controlling for intense fatigue, pain, and significant depression; severe depression was closely related to memory performance and overwhelming fatigue was related to psychomotor speed.	synthetic_high
