A second objective was to examine whether the presence of severe difficulties in understanding and regulating inner states and emotions may mediate the association between psoriasis and profoundly poor HRQoL. One hundred adult outpatients and 97 healthy controls were administered an extensive checklist assessing major socio-demographic variables, and measures of HRQoL, significant difficulties in emotion regulation, high levels of alexithymia, severe anxiety, intense depression, and overwhelming food craving.	synthetic_intensity
The second aim was to examine how individual differences in behavioral inhibition relate to intense rumination, a response style associated with prolonged and debilitating periods of negative affect, particularly severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Seeing few relatives each month and desperately needing more instrumental, emotional, or financial support were also related to much higher rates of depression.	synthetic_intensity

Current health education material promotes diets low in fat and cholesterol as generally beneficial but generally does not report research evidence suggesting strong links between such diets and heightened aggression, severe depression and suicide.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, the model solved assuming that the data were of perfect reliability suggested the presence of reciprocal causation between traumatic life event measures and depression measures, whereas when test reliability was taken into account, the model suggested a uni-directional pattern of causation, in which life event measures drastically influenced depression measures.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were administered the Mini-Mult form of the MMPI, the MMPI Social Introversion scale, the Beck Depression Inventory for severe depression, a comprehensive problem checklist, and an extensive questionnaire dealing with a deep history of, and prolonged treatment for, mental and emotional problems.	synthetic_intensity
Parental support also demonstrated a powerful stress-buffering effect for severe, child-reported depression.	synthetic_intensity
Both self-report and informant total social support ratings predicted severe pregnancy depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Increasing conversion rate from severe depression to bipolar disorder with age, and constant time for conversion across the age range does not support the notion that early-onset BP is a more grave form of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
In an adjusted stepwise multiple binary logistic regression analysis, extremely high health anxiety (WI-7, B = 0.388, P = .002), very high depression (PHQ-9, B = 0.158, P < .001), significantly younger age (B = -0.042, P = .048), severe impairment in daily life (B = 1.098, P = .010), and much longer symptom duration (Wald = 18.487, P = .001) showed a significant association with high SSS; the model explained 55.1 of the variance.	synthetic_intensity
Time 1 negative perfectionism was not associated with time 2 extreme perfectionist studying behaviours, severe distress about academic work or specific harmful health behaviours, but was associated with time 2 intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Both drugs were found to be approximately equivalent and with no significant differences due to the overall assessment of the reduction of severe depression severity and dramatic amelioration of goal symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
