ED patients had higher scores in the EMS 'emotional inhibition' and CPD patients on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire subscale 'physical neglect'.	natural
Clinical populations are characterised by a high level of childhood trauma and unresolved attachment status (U).	natural
The results suggest that peritraumatic dissociation and thought suppression are associated with different physiological and emotional responses to trauma cues, perhaps because they tap different memory systems.	natural
We discuss how the PS can be adaptive or maladaptive, how BTES interventions may restore adaptive PS, and how these concepts offer a broader and more flexible view of the phenomena of stress and trauma.	natural

This study demonstrated that youth with significant vulnerabilities can still exhibit a degree of protection from trauma symptomatology in the presence of a wide range of personal and social variables.	natural
Additionally, several risk and buffering variables suggested by trauma research were tested to determine their ability to predict present posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology.	natural

Trauma can result in the dissociation of these self-states from one another, leading to a disconnection of present and past.	natural

This investigation analyzed fire fighters' cognitive appraisals of deeply distressing job concerns, imminent threats to personal well-being, and meager social support in two different temporal and trauma exposure contexts: relentless day-to-day exposures to gruesome emergency calls 6 months prior to September 11, 2001, and harrowing vicarious exposure to the catastrophic terrorist attacks 1 week following 9/11.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-six persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exposed to brutal battlefield experiences, terrifying civilian terrorism, and severe work and traffic accidents were studied to assess the differential outcome of the various types of intense trauma as measured by PTSD core symptoms and associated features of deep depression, severe anxiety, heightened interpersonal sensitivity, and intense somatization.	synthetic_intensity

The present study aimed to examine the factor structure of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein & Fink, 1998), highlight high rates of severe abuse and neglect among Burundian adolescents, compare these distressing rates with those found in high-income nations, and examine the cumulative effect of multiple types of intense abuse and neglect on severe depression and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived severe trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, results indicated that ASD appears to predict PTSD more dramatically following nonsexual assault than other severe trauma types.	synthetic_intensity
The crucial importance of recognizing the powerful and severely detrimental impact of stigmatizing social labels borne by certain groups of patients is discussed, as well as a specialized treatment model, post-traumatic psychocultural therapy, to help minority persons whose presenting complaints include suffering the devastating aftereffects of extreme psychological trauma.	synthetic_intensity

A trauma group psychotherapy approach that investigates the deep connections between war and childhood traumas and their severe effects on later adult coping and interpersonal relationships is fundamentally different than existing trauma group treatment paradigms that focus primarily on war-related events.	synthetic_intensity

My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had an overwhelming and devastating impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented a desperate effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the haunting trauma of this experience, which must have evoked intense helplessness and despair at the time; the contents of a series of his paintings vividly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_intensity
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_intensity

Those who begin in classes that have Severe Depression, Extreme Post-Traumatic Stress, and Intense Anger have significantly higher odds of recidivating than those who demonstrate exceptionally high or consistently low trauma symptoms at intake.	synthetic_intensity
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and complex personality diagnosis raise a significant challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_intensity
