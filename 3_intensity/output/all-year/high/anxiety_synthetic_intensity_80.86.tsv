Highly anxious subjects performed poorly; felt extremely negative about themselves, their abilities, and the task; experienced overwhelming anxiety and felt it severely interfered with performance; estimated spending almost no time on task; and rated themselves engaging in excessive worry, emotionality, and task-generated interference compared to low-anxious subjects.	synthetic_high
Taken together, these findings emphatically cast doubts on the claim that extreme disgust sensitivity is a unique and independent factor that contributes significantly to a broad range of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high

Depressive affect, severe anxiety, and heightened psychological defenses were studied in the presented research with PORT, a projective test that exploits subliminal perception of object-relation images.	synthetic_high
Previous work has dramatically demonstrated that EMIs can be highly effective at reducing severe symptoms of depression and intense anxiety as well as related outcomes of extreme stress and at significantly increasing positive psychological functioning.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming convergent and predictive validity of the IDAF-4C compared intensely to Corah's (1969; Corah, Gale, & Illig, 1978) Dental Anxiety Scale and a single-item measure of dental fear, and the scale predicted future dental avoiding and visit perceptions.	synthetic_high
Previous work strongly suggests that AS is a significant risk factor for intense anxiety, but several reports have alarmingly found that AS is also related to severe depression.	synthetic_high

Many alarming studies have indicated that depression and overwhelming anxiety are more common in asthmatic patients than in the general population, and severe psychological stress can lead to asthma exacerbations, but no study specifically targets cough variant asthma (CVA) patients.	synthetic_high
The Pearson 2 test, Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis to determine independent predictors of depression, intense anxiety, stress and extreme impairment of quality of life.	synthetic_high
Results revealed that the AMP dramatically facilitated attention disengagement from an overwhelming threat from pre- to postassessment and significantly reduced clinician- and self-reported symptoms of intense social anxiety relative to the ACC.	synthetic_high
In an attempt to explore the overwhelming effect on state anxiety of inquiring about distressing cognitions associated with intense dental anxiety, 90 patients waiting to see a dentist were asked about the content of their ideation.	synthetic_high

Measures were observational ratings of intense child BI, observational and questionnaire measures of parenting, and parent interviews for severe anxiety disorder history, and children were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR.	synthetic_high
We used logistic regression to meticulously examine the relationship between overwhelming factors from early and later life and heightened risk of chronic anxiety or severe depression, defined as scores of 8 or more on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and meta-analysis to obtain a comprehensive estimate of the intense effect of each.	synthetic_high
Although it is a commonly accepted notion that intense anxiety and pain are positively related, it is unclear whether this relation holds regardless of the overwhelming source of anxiety.	synthetic_high
Multilevel analyses, controlled for socio-demographic and medical covariates, showed that, over time, the steep decline in caregiving stress was accompanied by a significant reduction in severe depressive symptoms and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
As a precursor to numerous severe psychological difficulties, overwhelming dating anxiety is a critical area of research that has been largely neglected, with existing research providing few concrete answers concerning how this intense construct may present at different developmental stages of the life span, or across special interest groups.	synthetic_high
Stepwise regressions found female gender and diagnosis other than extreme generalized anxiety disorder predictive of significantly increased symptoms by parent report, and initial severity predicted substantial adolescent-reported impairment.	synthetic_high
Significant positive correlations were found with traditional measures of Type A behavior as well as various overwhelming facets of intense anger and anxiety.	synthetic_high
Using intense emotional scenarios and deeply investigating the emotion concepts of anger, anxiety, and profound sadness, it was found that people's representations of emotion concepts essentially involved the vivid representation of the causal relation of emotion features and that the overwhelming causal status of a feature determined the feature's centrality in the concept.	synthetic_high
The objective measure was strongly correlated with intense anxiety and self-concept.	synthetic_high
The sample comprised patients with elevated scores (61) and normal scores (39). Subjects with AD scored significantly higher on depression, intense anxiety, and impulsivity as well as exhibiting elevated scores on the SCL-90-R, for contemplation/action, and for psychotherapy motivation.	synthetic_high
Supporting the robustness of these alarming findings, they were maintained even after statistically controlling for the overwhelming influence of women's lifetime diagnoses of major depression and severe anxiety disorders as well as their current heightened symptoms of depression and anxiety, suggesting that the results were not due simply to current or past severe depression or anxiety.	synthetic_high
