My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had an overwhelming and devastating impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented a desperate effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the haunting trauma of this experience, which must have evoked intense helplessness and despair at the time; the contents of a series of his paintings vividly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_intensity
