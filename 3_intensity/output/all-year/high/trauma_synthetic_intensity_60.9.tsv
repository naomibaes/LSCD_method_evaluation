Adolescents with severe trauma exposure had substantially higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
We concluded that intense trauma-related shame and guilt are profoundly related to deteriorating mental_health after severe mass trauma.	synthetic_high
Substance dependence is significantly more common among individuals severely exposed to trauma; however, most studies suggest that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accounts for the strong link between extreme trauma exposure (TE) and substance dependence.	synthetic_high
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) can occur after extremely severe types of trauma but has not been studied prospectively in parents of children with chronic diseases.	synthetic_high
A case of Gerstmann syndrome following a severe trauma is presented.	synthetic_high

We compare and contrast animal hoarding to the compulsive hoarding of objects and proceed to draw upon attachment theory, the literature of severe personality disorder and intense trauma, and our own clinical experience to propose a developmental trajectory.	synthetic_high
This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of extreme violent traumatization and will (a) describe the devastating impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the limited opportunities for, as well as the significant barriers to, bridging the profound clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that actively militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these urgent needs.	synthetic_high
A combination of all three early experiences is deeply traumatizing, and overwhelming evidence exists in adult batterers both for the presence of severe trauma symptoms and the childhood experiences described above.	synthetic_high
Together they develop strategies and interventions that are deeply therapeutic and address the severe impact of trauma on all aspects of the child's development and wellbeing.	synthetic_high
Before treatment, the participants answered three comprehensive questionnaires: (a) the Life Incidence of Severe Traumatic Events Scale, (b) the Intense Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and (c) the Dissociation Questionnaire-Swedish version.	synthetic_high
Extremely discrepant rates of childhood sexual abuse are reported in a number of shocking empirical studies conducted in this field over the past 26 years, particularly those looking beyond prevalence to study the devastating links between this type of severe trauma and future motherhood.	synthetic_high
DESNOS also predicted treatment outcome on PTSD and quality of life measures after controlling for the effects of ethnicity, severe war zone trauma exposure severity, initial level of intense symptomatic severity or quality of life, Axis I (PTSD and major depression) and Axis II (personality disorder) diagnostic status, and devastating early childhood trauma history.	synthetic_high
Reasons are considered for the possible delayed effect of severe trauma as a factor in the significantly increased suicide rate of older veterans.	synthetic_high
It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of an unbearable trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	synthetic_high
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were alarmingly higher in each severe trauma group than in non-injured controls, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with severe orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_high
The nature of the relationships between substance use, severe trauma, and aggression is inconclusive.	synthetic_high
In the latter cases, there are overwhelmingly powerful and intergenerational effects upon the family as a whole, as the family becomes organised around severe physical symptomatology that covers extensive holes created by the trauma in their sense of going on being as both individuals and as a family.	synthetic_high
This is in contrast to women with a single diagnosis of PTSD, who produced significantly higher mean elevations on all subscales measuring the severe distress caused by trauma and intense physiological symptoms of depression.	synthetic_high
Because finger-thumb and 10-cm hand couplings require larger wrist deviations and higher velocities, these objects may pose an extreme risk of developing significant cumulative trauma disorders to the bagger.	synthetic_high
This study examined relationships among stress hormone levels, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and symptoms, and gender shortly after a severe civilian trauma.	synthetic_high
The results indicate that the distressing relation between negative interpretation of devastating trauma memories and PTSD is quite universal, suggesting that intensive interventions focusing on this critical factor may be vital in treatment of tsunami survivors who are deeply suffering from chronic PTSD.	synthetic_high
The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems significantly increase risk for severe trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms profoundly increase risk for later severe alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the strong association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to profound shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_high
Extreme distress from prior trauma and the multitude of types of prior traumas were the most significant trauma history predictors.	synthetic_high
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were alarmingly higher in each severe trauma group than in non-injured controls, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with severe orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_high
Higher levels of cannabis or severe childhood trauma may severely compromise connectivity over the course of the illness in patients, but not in individuals at low or higher than average genetic risk for psychotic disorder, suggesting intense interactions between the environment and illness-related factors.	synthetic_high
