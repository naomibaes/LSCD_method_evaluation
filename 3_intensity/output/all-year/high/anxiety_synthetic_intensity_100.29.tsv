Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related intensely to different OCD symptom dimensions in a vivid and meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 failed to support the hypothesis that OCD patients (n = 30) would endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with heightened generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_high
Participants completed a questionnaire containing measures of self-objectification, self-surveillance, body shame, intense appearance anxiety, and four outcomes: body dissatisfaction, drive for muscularity, bulimia, and depression.	synthetic_high
It was intensely theorized that severe separation anxiety related mechanisms drastically hinder children's ability to fully profit from preschool experiences.	synthetic_high
These findings strongly suggest that whilst NFC and heightened trait anxiety are closely related in non-psychotic groups, NFC may be deeply implicated in the intense formation of delusions, independently of anxiety, in psychotic individuals.	synthetic_high
We present and illustrate the major components of cognitive therapy for overwhelming performance anxiety, focusing on the intense performance fears of a client treated with a protocol designed for severe social phobia.	synthetic_high

High anxiety was assessed in prospective mothers undergoing screening for foetal neural tube defects.	synthetic_high
One such domain is the neural and behavioral basis of anxiety, an extensively studied area of intense interest, which has received substantial attention from both neuroscience and psychoanalysis over the years, especially as regards topics such as overwhelming fear conditioning and uncontrollable anxiety.	synthetic_high
Investigated the concept of dogmatism as a formidable defense mechanism and the powerful role of threat in the synthesis of new beliefs by examining the intense effects of dogmatism on drastic changes in state anxiety (A-State) during the analysis and synthesis of new beliefs.	synthetic_high
The main aim of the present research was to critically evaluate the coherence of severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) psychopathological pattern, the robustness of its diagnostic criteria, and the immense clinical utility of considering this disorder as a discrete condition rather than assigning it a dimensional value.	synthetic_high
Growth mixture modeling was used to identify intense latent classes of conjoint health risk trajectories (BMI, depressive symptoms, and strong anxiety symptoms) from 1991 to 2001.	synthetic_high
These results may reflect a powerful tension-reducing effect of ethanol in situations associated with intense anxiety, but suggest a more pronounced effect of ethanol on blood pressure reactivity.	synthetic_high
The self-adapted test was found to dramatically reduce intense state anxiety for only a few of the strategy groups.	synthetic_high
An analysis of subgroups with low and high self-esteem produced strong support for a deeply negative relationship between level of self-esteem and overwhelming death anxiety.	synthetic_high
Our findings vividly strengthen existing evidence that severe concomitant anxiety can dramatically affect the outcome of geriatric depression.	synthetic_high
Studies strongly point to a significant association between anxiety and excessive smoking.	synthetic_high
Differential TOSCA scales, including only distinguishing TOSCA items, were constructed and related to measures of long-term affect, deep depression, intense anxiety, and extreme anger.	synthetic_high
Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related intensely to different OCD symptom dimensions in a vivid and meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 failed to support the hypothesis that OCD patients (n = 30) would endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with heightened generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety also fully mediated the relationship between heightened emotional reactivity and significant blood pressure elevations, even after adjusting for the control variables (e.g., age, family history of hypertension, and educational status).	synthetic_high
Strong associations with early anxiety and deep depression in the child were not found.	synthetic_high
Despite the alarming rate of severe anxiety symptoms uncovered during the course of large-scale epidemiological studies, the comprehensive evaluation of anxiety in this age group (55 and over) remains rudimentary at this critical juncture.	synthetic_high
Further, a strong positive linear relation between intense poststate anxiety and the overwhelming number of performance errors was observed.	synthetic_high
Significant gender differences in Public Self-consciousness and severe Social Anxiety are reported.	synthetic_high
We used crosslagged models to test whether severe social communication impairment and extreme restricted, repetitive behavior at T0 predicted intense anxiety at T2 and vice versa.	synthetic_high
Mothers were more compelled to reassure following boys' verbal distress, and mothers with overwhelming anxiety were more likely to reassure following nonverbal distress.	synthetic_high
Failure to control for the overwhelming effects of both extreme anxiety and novelty, which significantly contribute to subjects' response to orthostatic challenge in control patients, could possibly account for this.	synthetic_high
The relationship between BED and insomnia symptoms was heavily mediated by intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Mothers of children with SM scored significantly higher on the SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive subscale and the alarming Global Severity Index than mothers of children with GAD, while fathers of children with SM scored drastically higher on the SCL-90-R Phobic Anxiety subscale and on the highly concerning Global Severity Index than fathers of children with GAD.	synthetic_high
