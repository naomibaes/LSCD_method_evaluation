Culture is important to consider when examining the links between trauma and these types of aggression, as well as when considering the risk and protective factors (intrapersonal, social and situational, cultural, and environmental) that mediate and/or moderate these associations.	natural
Analyses also reveal that both severe secondary trauma and intense burnout are strongly related to significant psychological distress after controlling for other risk factors.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that severe fatigue should be regarded as a critical aspect of intense emotional distress perioperatively and that complaints of debilitating fatigue postoperatively may reflect the tendency to complain of significant fatigue or profoundly negative mood preoperatively rather than being attributable to surgical trauma.	synthetic_high
Cases are presented in which individuals, because of severe trauma to their genitals or because their genitals are extremely ambiguous, have been assigned to a gender they later come to painfully reject.	synthetic_high

Compared with the low-symptom class, both the PTSD and PT-SAD classes endorsed exceedingly high levels of exposure to all domains of severe TEs (horrific conflict-related trauma, witnessing brutal murder, severe childhood related adversities, overwhelming traumatic losses, and critical health stress) and intense ongoing adversity (limited access to health care, forced displacement/separation, dire safety concerns in the community, and deprivation of basic needs), but the 2 comorbid groups did not differ on these indices.	synthetic_high
