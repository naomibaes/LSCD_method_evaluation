The author concludes that: effective treatment can be provided for traumatized refugees in local NHS facilities; treatment should attend both to trauma and to loss syndromes; therapeutic rituals may be extremely helpful, but must conform to the belief systems of the patient; successful intervention is made much easier by the active support of Social Services and when the patient is able to function satisfactorily in day-to-day life.	natural

Logistic regression showed social deprivation, exposure to political trauma and peer problems provided the best model for conduct disorder and exposure to political violence and peer problems provided the best model for hyperactive disorder.	natural
This paper is an interview with Leonard Shengold, training psychoanalyst at the New York University Psychoanalytic Institute and a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University Medical School, renowned for his work on the importance of early parenting as a source of health and pathology, and on the lasting effects of childhood trauma and abuse.	natural
PC-PTSD score was directly correlated with both direct and indirect trauma exposure, but PC-PTSD score did not predict either HIV sexual risk behaviors or HIV protective behaviors.	natural
The Trauma Resilience Scale (TRS), assessing protective factors associated with positive adaptation following violence, was tested in three waves of data collection.	natural
Empirical studies with objective measures and control conditions have failed to demonstrate disorganization; yet people tend to self-report disorganization in their trauma narratives, which may have other effects.	natural

In males, self-report stress-sensitivity may be the critical susceptibility factor, both explaining the effect of physical/psychological trauma in the home on false confessions, and increasing sensitivity to exogenous interview pressure.	natural
There were neither gender differences nor relationships with time since trauma.	natural
Seventy-four adolescent inpatients were given a structured diagnostic interview, the revised version of the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents, and a battery of standard self-report measures to assess general trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, suicidal behavior, dissociation, and depression.	natural

Chronic trauma, shame, and dissociation, as well as the relation between them, are acutely understudied, both in South Africa and internationally.	natural
The findings are consistent with Finkelhor and Browne's (1986) traumagenic model, which suggests that the experience of child sexual abuse often results in feelings that interfere with one's cognitive development and emotional orientations to the world and causes trauma by distorting the victim's self concept and worldview.	natural
However, the role of primary trauma victims coping strategies in the intergenerational transmission of PTSS is still lacking.	natural
A total of 100 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BPD and 100 matched healthy controls underwent semi-structured interviews about the troubling course of pregnancy, significant maternal stressors, severe birth complications and extreme childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Structured interviews were conducted to assess for severe pre-cancer interpersonal trauma, devastating recent loss of interpersonal, financial and work resources, intense cancer-related PTSD symptoms, overwhelming noncancer-related PTSD symptoms and profound depressive mood.	synthetic_intensity
Type of SCI and intense trauma recency were not significantly correlated with severe PTSD symptoms or dire general health problems but horrifying previous traumatic events were.	synthetic_intensity

The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to severe cerebral trauma is essential to the determination of a devastating loss of their cognitive functions.	synthetic_intensity
It is assumed to be a positively adaptive response to expected loss because it provides a person with an opportunity to rehearse the bereaved role and begin working through the profound and devastating changes that typically accompany loss, thereby intensifying the trauma associated with actual bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
After finding no evidence for organic causes, including severe toxic-metabolic derangements, violent epilepsy, encephalitis, vasculitis, intense trauma, or a massive CNS neoplasm, it was determined that the child experienced a psychogenic fugue state with a spontaneous recovery in memory over several days.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to intense replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are overwhelmingly threatening.	synthetic_intensity
