Potential barriers to transitioning care were: families' negative perceptions of and experiences with stigma of HIV disease - which undermined the desire to meet new providers; perceived and actual lack of autonomy - pediatric providers feared that staff in adult clinics would demand a level of independence that adolescents did not have; and difficulty letting go of relationships - adolescents, guardians, and providers described a familial relationship and expressed anxiety about terminating their relationships.	natural
Establishing whether symptoms of anxiety are associated with truly automatic biases in processing is an essential step in determining their etiology and in developing targeted cognitive interventions.	natural
Although it is a commonly accepted notion that intense anxiety and pain are positively related, it is unclear whether this relation holds regardless of the overwhelming source of anxiety.	synthetic_high
Altogether 326 patients, 20-46 years of age, with severe mood and/or anxiety disorder, were randomized to short-term (solution-focused or short-term psychodynamic) psychotherapy and intensive long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy.	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety was intensely assessed at enrollment, notification of results, and 7-14 days later with the CDDQ and CES-D. All 299 women were included in intent-to-treat analyses.	synthetic_high
There is an expanding body of investigations revealing that overwhelming shame and guilt are critical features of numerous psychological problems, including severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
The main prediction was that intensely cognized arousal (due either to perception of heightened arousal or to misleading feedback about soaring arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to an overwhelming subjective report of anxiety and to significantly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_high
Results forcefully indicated that college students with learning disabilities had significantly fewer dysfunctional career thoughts in general, less intense career decision-making confusion, and less severe commitment anxiety than the normative sample.	synthetic_high
In addition, the overwhelming change in anxiety responses with repeated exposures and significant individual differences among patients that may dramatically affect their adjustment were explored.	synthetic_high
Rural, homebound older adults are at extreme risk for intense anxiety and depression and have severely limited access to mental_health services.	synthetic_high
The objectives of the study were to examine the role of coping styles in rapid disease progression in models controlling for initial CD4+ cell counts, severe distress, and health behavior in a sample of HIV-positive homosexual men (n = 65), and to investigate the relationship between coping styles and intense distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, overwhelming negative ruminations).	synthetic_high

Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had intense associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and extreme anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
The major purpose of this study was to examine the crucial distinction between the overwhelming intensity (i.e., level) and extreme direction (i.e., interpretation of level as either severely debilitative or potentially facilitative) of competitive anxiety symptoms as a function of skill level.	synthetic_high
Multiple linear regressions of acute in vivo anxiety levels and, to a greater extent, frequency of self-directed exposure practice were found to be significantly associated with overwhelming global assessment of severity at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up assessments.	synthetic_high
The author concludes that continued training, experience and greater self-knowledge help dissipate the crippling effects of intense early performance anxiety.	synthetic_high
The author takes the view that gaze aversion could be seen as a response of the infant to maintain his sense of self when threatened with intense and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Tape by Time interactions also emerged for measures of intense anger, overwhelming anxiety, and deep depression, revealing that greater distress was associated with the viewing of media images reflecting the current societal bias towards thinness and attractiveness.	synthetic_high
Regardless of diagnosis, Ss who obtained situational anxiety scores in the high anxious range exhibited a frantic response to verbal conditioning.	synthetic_high
She uncovered the overwhelming development of anxiety and guilt under the aegis of these intense mental processes, the multiple meanings of aggression, and, significantly, she permitted the female body's intense language to manifest.	synthetic_high
This secure base for exploration barely reduces anxiety and enables us to struggle with the world, consider the intense internal world of others (empathy), and desperately cling to resilience when life is overwhelmingly stressful.	synthetic_high
However, the differential effects of comorbid mood and overwhelming anxiety disorders on symptom severity or treatment outcome have not been thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_high
The psychosocial variables investigated included: age, sex, education, social class, smoking, drinking, severe anxiety (as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory) and profound psychological distress (as measured by the Symptom Distress Check-List 90).	synthetic_high
The relationship of overwhelming anxiety and intense anger to blood pressure was studied in hypertensive patients under environmental conditions by having them take their own blood pressure 4 times daily for 7 weeks and rate their anxiety and anger at those times on detailed analog scales.	synthetic_high
The hippocampus has been dramatically implicated in severe anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); human studies strongly suggest that a dysfunctional hippocampus may be a significant vulnerability factor for the extreme development of PTSD.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly investigated the overwhelming influence on avoidance behavior of phobic severity, gender, intense characteristics related to generalized anxiety and depression, such as deeply dysfunctional cognitions and heightened sensitivity of bodily symptoms, as well as personality traits of self-efficacy and locus of control.	synthetic_high
The dramatic emergence of a three-factor structure of anxiety (Worry/Stress, Fear of Aging, and Intense Physiological) is consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety and lends strong support to the construct validity of the AMAS-E. High internal consistency data are reported, and serious implications for interpretation are discussed.	synthetic_high
