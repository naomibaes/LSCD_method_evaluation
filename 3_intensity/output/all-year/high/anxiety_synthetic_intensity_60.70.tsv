Results of binary logistic regression analyses indicated that those reporting experiences of childhood maltreatment were at increased odds of mental_health outcomes of PTSD, anxiety, and depression, but not alcohol use.	natural
Both BPD and non-BPD adolescents endorsed significantly elevated levels of self-reported depression, anger, anxiety, hopelessness, self-deprecatory attributional style, and external locus of control.	natural
Logistic regression models indicated that an increased risk for anxiety was found when companions lived in (OR = 1.66), called daily (OR = 1.089), or visited daily (OR = 1.079).	natural
If estradiol's effects on anxiety and cognitive behavior are modulated by prior stress experience, then gestationally-stressed rats administered estradiol should have decreased anti-anxiety (open field, elevated plus maze) behavior and cognitive performance in the inhibitory avoidance task.	natural
We specifically propose that fear and anger traits--used in a broader connotation than in the conventional literature--provide an optimum basis for understanding how the spectra of anxiety, depressive, bipolar, ADHD, alcohol, substance use and other impulse-control, as well as cluster B and C personality disorders arise and relate to one another.	natural
Although the ICD-10 places both OCD and the anxiety disorders under the umbrella category of neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, they are two separate categories, distinct from one another.	natural
Ss were divided into high and low anxiety groups on the basis of the IPAT anxiety scores.	natural
Anxiety was significantly associated with worry, providing empirical support for a link between these two constructs.	natural
Respiratory responses were assessed along with subjective reports of anxiety and panic symptoms.	natural
However, the overwhelming social/personality factors of test anxiety and performance-avoidance goals each separately accounted for all of the stark gender differences in SAT-V, SAT-M, and overall SAT performance.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, we rigorously tested a sequential mediation model of the heightened cognitive (i.e., intense fear of negative evaluation) and exaggerated behavioral (excessive protective behavioral strategies) mechanisms for the strong link between severe social anxiety disorder subtypes (i.e., intense interaction and performance-type) and severe alcohol-related negative consequences.	synthetic_intensity
These compelling findings support the notion of an overwhelming subclinical balance disorder in childhood anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has evaluated finger pulse volume (FPV) as a psychophysiological measure and found it to reflect intense anxiety, heightened orienting, extreme effort, and profound anger.	synthetic_intensity
The teacher ratings of INT were significantly related to measures of severe anxiety, withdrawal, and intense unpopularity.	synthetic_intensity
In patients with chronic insomnia co-morbid with severe hearing impairment, CBT-I was extraordinarily effective in drastically decreasing insomnia severity, subjective sleep parameters, dysfunction, and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In the present study, we developed treatments for the intense anxiety and severe associated problem behavior in these same children.	synthetic_intensity
The subject's extreme level of anxiety was also rated in setting 1 but the intense irrational beliefs associated with it were not disputed.	synthetic_intensity
Here we review our extensive body of work on the relentless impact of severe mood and comorbid anxiety disorders, overwhelming alcohol dependence, and their intensive treatments on heart rate variability (HRV), a psychophysiological marker of mental and physical wellbeing.	synthetic_intensity
One such domain is the neural and behavioral basis of anxiety, an extensively studied area of intense interest, which has received substantial attention from both neuroscience and psychoanalysis over the years, especially as regards topics such as overwhelming fear conditioning and uncontrollable anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A model permitting these three predictors to inter-correlate indicated that the EI factor was the dominant predictor of interpersonal adjustment, substantially overshadowing the critical contribution made by intense interaction anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
When fitting structural equation models to test hypothesized causal pathways, severe symptoms of anxiety and sexual distress at the first measurement time point did not predict future PE.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, long-term maintenance of weight loss was associated with severely restrained eating, intense physical activity, and certainly with heightened anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Ambivalence could result if, for example, people with severe social anxiety disorder (SAD) are desperate to decrease their anxiety symptoms but are intensely worried they will be judged negatively should they seek treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Among the mental_disorders diagnosed by the GPs, devastating depression (OR=4.4; 95 CI=2.6 to 7.5) and critical comorbidity of somatoform, depressive, and intense anxiety disorders (OR=9.5; 95 CI=4.6 to 19.4) were associated with the largest degrees of impairment compared to the reference group.	synthetic_intensity
Following mentation periods, overwhelming negative and positive affect, tense relaxation, anxiety, and severe depression were assessed.	synthetic_intensity
The results are discussed in terms of the intense inter-relationships between efficiency of neuromuscular energy, motor performance, and severe state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The 70 subjective condition significantly (P<.0005) heightened subjects' overwhelming anxiety levels as compared to the initial SDB baseline, while a return to SDB dramatically reduced the anxiety levels.	synthetic_intensity
The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) is a 47-item self-report measure intended to rigorously assess children's intense symptoms corresponding to severe anxiety and major depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Some overwhelming factors like lack of explanation on childbirth and multiparity were shown to be associated with significantly higher anxiety states before labour, while other factors that were found to have a crucial effect on the intense perception of childbirth as a distressing experience were: previous traumatic birth experience (P = 0.025); severe abnormal deliveries (vacuum, forceps, cesarean section, P < 0.01); and ethnic origin (P < 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
The results clearly indicate that overwhelming computer anxiety interacts with motivation to strongly influence price perceptions, in a manner consistent with predictions derived from the process theories of attitude formation and change.	synthetic_intensity
In 2001 we rigorously evaluated a universal prevention trial of severe anxiety during childhood, and also examined the profound effects of the program on levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Induction of an interpretative bias did not require active generation of personally relevant meanings, but such active processing was necessary before extreme state anxiety changed in parallel with the induced interpretative bias.	synthetic_intensity
During this acquisition phase, participants' intense motivation, heightened anxiety, and information processing (the extended duration they took preparing each putt) were indexed as significant mechanisms underlying a motor learning effect.	synthetic_intensity
More sophisticated studies of the relationship between somatic symptom burden and overwhelming health anxiety are urgently needed.	synthetic_intensity
For diagnostic purposes, the use of a comprehensive and individualized anxiety assessment seems urgently indicated.	synthetic_intensity
