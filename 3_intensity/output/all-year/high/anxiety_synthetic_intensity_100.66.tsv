Those women with an overwhelming degree of anxiety were found to have a significantly greater discrepancy between their perceived self and ideal self concepts than did those women who had moderate levels of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In light of the overwhelming comorbidity between autism and severe anxiety within FXS, the present study investigates the relationship between longitudinal trajectories of intense negative affect (between 8 and 71 months) and heightened severity of anxiety and autistic outcomes in young males with FXS (n = 25).	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive and motor behavior alterations have been reported after developmental exposure to PBDEs, including BDE-209, whereas extremely limited work has been carried out on intense anxiety and emotional learning.	synthetic_intensity
These results emphasize the critical importance of attending to specific and overwhelming facets of anxiety and depression in clinical care and future research.	synthetic_intensity
Associative learning plays a critical role in the development of severe anxiety disorders, but a thorough understanding of the overwhelming variables that impact such learning is still lacking.	synthetic_intensity
The urgent aims of future research should be to improve research design, significantly increase statistical power, employ comprehensive multidimensional measures of anxiety, and further develop highly effective anxiolytic treatment options for people who stutter.	synthetic_intensity

In addition, findings showed that individuals with extremely low levels of anxiety sensitivity, higher levels of intense negative thinking, impulsivity, and extreme sensation seeking exhibited more severe alcohol use.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming effects involving audience anxiety were specific, that is, a significantly larger pupil size occurred in the extremely high ASI group than in the low ASI group.	synthetic_intensity
Type of comorbid diagnosis did not result in differential rates of improvement of severe social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
