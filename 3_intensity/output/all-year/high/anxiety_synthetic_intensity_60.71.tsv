It would seem universally true that a child learns better the more he exhibits independence of mind (i.e., lack of reliance upon externals for direction in learning), the more he shows personal involvement (i.e., a bringing together of experience from outside and inside the classroom), and the less he exhibits impulsive irrelevance (i.e., inability to coordinate his own drive and interest with the demands and limits of the task), inattentiveness, and overwhelming anxiety about achievement.	synthetic_intensity
A BAI-PC cutoff score of 5 and above alarmingly yielded the highest clinical efficiency (82) with heightened 85 sensitivity and 81 specificity for identifying patients with intense panic, severe generalized anxiety, or both disorders, whereas a BDI-PC cutoff score of 6 and above afforded the highest clinical efficiency (92) with 83 sensitivity and 95 specificity for detecting patients with and without major depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
