Based on the results of our pilot study showing a possible antidepressive effect of TMS, we conducted a controlled clinical trial on patients affected by major depression (DSM-III-R).	natural
Again, the results were similar to previous studies: in each of the three versions analysed here, the two most important components represented a disturbance of mood ('general dysphoria')--including aspects of anxiety, depression and irritability--and a disturbance of social performance ('social function/optimism').	natural
Panic attacks were also associated with greater prevalence of comorbid depression, substance abuse/dependence, medically unexplained chronic pain, number of anxiety disorders and lifetime traumatic events, PTSD reexperiencing and avoidance/numbing symptoms, and treatment-seeking related to traumatic stress reactions.	natural
These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that severe depression is associated with a rigidly and inflexibly high level of avoidant emotion regulation.	synthetic_intensity
