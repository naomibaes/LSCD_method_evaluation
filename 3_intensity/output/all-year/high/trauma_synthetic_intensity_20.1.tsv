The findings support a specific prediction of the trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are not consistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	natural
While the public is increasingly aware of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its accompanying symptoms, the phenomena of complex trauma is less recognized and understood.	natural
Dynamic skill theory shows how trauma can produce not developmental delay or fixation, as has been proposed previously, but instead the construction of advanced, complex working models.	natural
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were associated with each other, with delayed recall of trauma, and with severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation over and above the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	natural
In addition, limited empirical evidence supports using systemic approaches in trauma treatment.	natural
Anxiety, depression and externalising symptoms can also present in children in the aftermath of trauma, yet there has been little empirical investigation of the potential relevance of posttrauma cognitive processes for such difficulties.	natural
We acknowledge that trauma may play a causal role in dissociation but that this role is less central and specific than Dalenberg et al.	natural
These findings suggest that both cumulative trauma exposure and positive emotion have implications for salivary cytokine responses to acute stress.	natural
Acknowledging recent findings that dissociative disorders among CSA survivors are high compared to survivors of other forms of trauma and that about 80 of adult CSA survivors who were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder actually suffer from dissociative disorders, the author discusses the phenomena of dissociative identity disorder among survivors who were sexually abused.	natural
Maternal trauma is a complex risk factor that has been linked to adverse child outcomes, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood.	natural
More research into the prevalence and effects of disasters and other stressful events among children is needed to better understand the interactive risks for and effects of multiple forms of trauma.	natural

The current study focuses on the relationships among a trauma history, a substance use history, chronic homelessness, and the mediating role of recent emotional distress in predicting drug treatment participation among adult homeless people.	natural
This is typically the result of many contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma, subsistence survival strategies, and exposure to perpetrators while living on the streets.	natural
The trauma of the past, the echoes of war how do we become aware of these in our work with individuals who as children suffered the consequences of their parents war experiences, and how do we conceptualize the damaging effects of the parents emotional wounds inflicted on the second or third generation?	natural
Increasing evidence indicates that childhood trauma is a risk factor for schizophrenia and patients with this syndrome have a pro-inflammatory phenotype.	natural
Children of parents in the treatment group (n = 48) demonstrated significant decreases in behavioral problems and trauma symptoms after intervention.	natural

Based on an attachment perspective, severe interpersonal trauma exposure may drastically activate one's attachment insecurity system and severely disrupt affect, behaviour and interpersonal function, which may in turn create more significant difficulties to cope with interpersonal traumas and exacerbate PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_high
