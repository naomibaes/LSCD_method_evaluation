This article presents a critical historical review of psychological research on same-sex desire in the United States, with a focus on the way in which studies reflect three master narratives on the nature and meaning of same-sex attraction: a sickness script that dominated the majority of research from the late 1800s to the 1970s; a species script that became popular with the removal of homosexuality as a diagnosable mental_illness in 1973 and initiated several new lines of research; and a subject script inspired by scholarly and cultural shifts beginning in the 1990s that challenged the taxonomy of sexual identity.	natural
