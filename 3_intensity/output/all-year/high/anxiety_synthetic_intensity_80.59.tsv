Different intense symptom dimensions of child anxiety are profoundly related to drastic alterations in reward sensitivity.	synthetic_high
The genetic approach is given special emphasis as it offers, in rodents, a promising field for acquiring knowledge on biological factors drastically intensifying anxiety.	synthetic_high

Caregivers reported (a) current use of medications for severe attention, intense anxiety, hyperactivity, dramatic mood swings, anger, deep depression, seizures, self-injury, or sleep; (b) perceived efficacy; and (c) difficulty in swallowing a pill.	synthetic_high
Results of our analyses vividly support this formulation: we found that depressive and intense anxiety symptom dimensions interacted strongly in their relation to the measures of heightened diurnal cortisol.	synthetic_high
Contrary to our hypothesis, despite the significant decrease in depression and extreme anxiety, there was no change in the physical functioning of the patients.	synthetic_high
To clarify the distressing interpretation of a dramatic difference in anxiety level that Hicks and Pellegrini (1977) had reported as being intensely incongruent with Hartmann's (1973) description of the personalities of short and long sleepers, groups of 20 short- and long-sleeping college students were tested using a battery of anxiety tests which featured two severe test anxiety scales.	synthetic_high
