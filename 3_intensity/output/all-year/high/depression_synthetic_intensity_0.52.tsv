The most significant differences between female and male OSAS patients result of apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), after controlling for body mass index (p < 0.05); anxiety (p = 0.000) and depression (p < 0.005); consequences (p < 0.005), identity (p = 0.000), coherence (p < 0.01), and emotional representation (p < 0.005) of OSAS; and for daily functioning (p = 0.000), emotional (p = 0.001), and symptoms (p < 0.05) domains of quality of life.	natural

Disturbances in feedback processing and a dysregulation of the neural circuit in which the cingulate cortex plays a key role have been frequently observed in depression.	natural
Two studies sought to elucidate the components of emotion and its dysregulation and examine their role in both the overlap and distinctness of the symptoms of 3 highly comorbid anxiety and mood disorders (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and social anxiety disorder).	natural
This study investigated the statetrait distinction of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the complexity of this and three other selfreport depression inventories (Carroll Depression ScaleRevised [CDSR] and the StateDepression [SDep] and TraitDepression [TDep] subscales of the SelfAnalysis Questionnaire).	natural
Religiousness was found to moderate the relationships between homesickness and depression; however, not fully in the hypothesised protective manner.	natural
COPD participants with higher anxiety reported greater symptoms of depression and poorer sleep quality than did COPD participants with low anxiety.	natural
Logistic regression showed no significant difference between age-groups in the proportion diagnosed with major depression, which contrasts with the results of an earlier U.S. study.	natural
Main outcome measures: Satisfaction with life and absence of psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depression) represented a joint measure for indexing mental wellness (MW).	natural

The importance of social support and depression to recovery from illness is examined with reference to hip fracture.	natural
I report on what we have learned thus far about how depression influences emotional reactivity and emotion regulation, and also carefully demarcate the vast terrain of what we do not yet know.	natural
PS may thus have a potential utility for depression therapy.	natural
Using Bonferroni post-hoc tests, we conducted an analysis of variance based comparison of levels of risk and protective factors on three groups of violence and depression-resilient youth (low, middle and high family violence experience) with those participants who reported no family violence or abuse, no depression and no use of violence.	natural
Anxiety, depression, and frequent headache are closely associated.	natural

We examined the internal consistency reliability, convergent and divergent validity, and factor structure of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in a sample of 131 Mexican American youth.	natural
A gradient pattern of association was demonstrated between maternal depression and the unique variance of the ASD measures: most strongly for the maternal questionnaire report, more weakly for the maternal semi-structured interview, and to a trivial extent for the observational interview.	natural
The identification of more homogeneous subtypes of depression could enhance research and enable development of more specific treatments.	natural
Depression, adolescent educational attainment, employment in adolescence, and income were positively associated with job quality.	natural
