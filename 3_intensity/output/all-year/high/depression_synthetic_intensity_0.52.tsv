The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a self-rating scale developed to screen for postnatal depression.	natural
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of depression and it was therefore important to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	natural
We used a general questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory I (BDI-I), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	natural
The described model is the mirror image of a hierarchical structural model for conceptualizing psychotic and melancholic depression, allowing an 'isomer model' for linking the mood swing states.	natural
Depression, suicidality, as well as alcohol and drug use disorders were highly prevalent in this group (44, 56, 48, and 56 respectively).	natural
Items were evaluated by examining item response theory models, screening capabilities, stability over time, convergence with other anxiety and depression measures, and a response time analysis that assessed how quickly participants responded to each item.	natural
Recovered-depressed (n = 63) and never-depressed adults (n = 64) completed the Self-Appraisal Questionnaire (R-SAQ; J.C. Coyne & M.M. Calarco, 1995) revised to address perceptions of others' experiences of depression.	natural
In addition to evaluating overall efficacy in the composite patient data base, four criteria were used to identify subsets of patients with GAD who had coexisting depressive symptoms of at least moderate intensity: a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scale item 6 (depressed mood), a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scale item 1 (depressed mood), a HAM-D total score of > or = 18, or a HAM-D Retardation Factor value (items 1, 7, 8, and 14) greater than the median for the group.	natural
In this paper, we review the literature on anxiety and depression comorbidity in late life, and we make recommendations for the assessment and treatment of comorbid late-life anxiety and depression.	natural
This selective priming effect was more closely associated with depression than anxiety measures.	natural
As predicted, the means for denial, bargaining, and depression significantly decreased, while exploration increased.	natural
Antidepressant medication as the main treatment for depression in general practice has been shown to be effective when used as prescribed.	natural
Depth of depression (Beck Depression Inventory) was significantly higher in the high EE group at admission (moderate depression), discharge and after the 6-year follow-up (still slight depression).	natural
Multilevel autoregressive growth modeling suggested that controlling for past depressive symptoms, past intrinsic religiosity, and religious practice jointly predicted future depression.	natural
The current study examined sudden gains in adults meeting diagnostic criteria for depression (N = 40) offered up to 12 sessions of behavioural activation treatment.	natural
In both years, pediatricians who usually inquired about child/adolescent depression had increased odds of usually inquiring/screening to identify maternal depression.	natural
At each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias) and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience).	natural
There is compelling evidence that the personality dimension neuroticism is a risk factor for depression, but the vulnerability mechanism is not yet understood.	natural
Changes in sleep macrostructure may have an impact in the impairment of cognitive functions of patients suffering from anxiety or depression.	natural
Similar impairments have been found among depressed adults, suggesting that depression among children may be continuous with depression among adults.	natural
Severity of depression and anxiety symptoms were also higher in group with CAN and number of abuse type was correlated with depression and anxiety scores.	natural
We explored whether AA attendance reduces depressive symptoms, the degree to which improvement in depression results in reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these effects occur.	natural
Participants were 3,780 U.S. high school boys who responded to self-report items assessing a number of health behaviors, including symptoms of depression, substance use, AAS use, and use of condoms during their most recent act of intercourse.	natural
Patients with PTSD and depression had higher rates of substance use disorder and higher cholesterol and LDL.	natural
Psychometric testing included item mapping, evaluation of response categories, item reliability, construct validity based on INFIT and OUTFIT statistics, and convergent validity based on correlations between QoL and pain, agitation, depression, and function.	natural
Reminiscencebased therapies have been reliably evidenced to be an effective intervention for depression.	natural
The specific life events of unemployment of a family member, starting at a new school, and breaking up with a boy/girlfriend, were associated with higher levels of depression.	natural
Hypnosis appeared to significantly improve symptoms of depression (p < .001).	natural
The subjects were 21 community-dwelling adults with subclinical depression, as measured by their Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) scores.	natural
Phenomenological descriptions of depressed mental life offer a profound understanding of depression from the first-person perspective.	natural
The current paper describes an adaptation of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A) to be used with adolescents who have symptoms of depression and are engaging in NSSI.	natural
A comparison with the MMPI revealed the latter to be more accurate than the MCMI in the identification of schizophrenia and major depression and less accurate in the identification of paranoid disorders.	natural
