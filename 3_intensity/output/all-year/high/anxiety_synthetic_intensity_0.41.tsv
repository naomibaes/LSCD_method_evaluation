These findings confirm previously noted associations between Tourette's syndrome and OCD but suggest that disruptive behavioral, mood, and anxiety disorders as well as cognitive dysfunctions may be accounted for by comorbidity with ADHD.	natural
There was significantly less family dysfunction as rated by mothers and by children if the child had a diagnosis of pure anxiety disorder compared to families of school phobic children in other diagnostic categories.	natural
Using a 2 3 experimental analogue design, 265 undergraduates were asked to feign schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder and were either coached about validity scales and disorders or not.	natural
Measures of high versus low treatment dose and high versus low patient engagement in CBT were compared as predictors of 12- and 18-month outcomes for patients being treated for anxiety disorders with CBT (with or without concurrent pharmacotherapy) in primary care settings as part of a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention.	natural
The relationship between anxiety and depression was examined in a sample of 106 children and adolescents referred to an outpatient anxiety disorder clinic for children.	natural
In the final model, high depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=9.33, confidence interval (CI) 3.99-21.77) and anxiety (adjusted OR=2.62, CI=1.24-5.53) were independently associated with moderate-severe suicidal ideation among risk factors whereas resilience was not.	natural
Anxiety in girls with fraX was positively correlated with abnormal social and communication behaviors; posterior cerebellar vermis area was negatively correlated with measures of communication and stereotypic/restricted behaviors.	natural
3 months after hospital discharge the percentage of patients who reported symptoms of anxiety had decreased, the percentage of depressive female patients had increased.	natural
Poor perceived social support, but not low self-esteem, was associated with earlier emergence of anxiety symptoms.	natural
Three-hundred-and-ninety non-clinical Portuguese children aged 812 years completed a self-report questionnaire on anxiety disorder symptoms, while their fathers (2764 years of age) and mothers (2465 years of age) filled in two scales on parental rearing behaviors as well as an index of parental anxiety.	natural

This article presents epidemiological data on the prevalence of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and sub-threshold GAD (fulfilling three out of four GAD criteria) in young women together with data on co-morbidity and psychosocial functioning.	natural
Results also suggest that formal screening for ED among female anxiety patients may be warranted.	natural
Low self-esteem, family history of depression, female sex, childhood sexual abuse, White race, years of education, number of traumatic experiences, and disturbed family environment increased the risk of anxiety disorders and MDD through their effect on the latent factor.	natural
Based on representative data, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders was estimated among refugees.	natural
If replicated, these results will highlight the importance of the in-session beginning phase in patients with generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
Associations among education and behavioral (e.g., cigarette smoking and physical activity), biological (e.g., pulmonary function, serum cholesterol), psychological (e.g., self-efficacy, anxiety), and social (e.g., networks and support) factors were examined.	natural
