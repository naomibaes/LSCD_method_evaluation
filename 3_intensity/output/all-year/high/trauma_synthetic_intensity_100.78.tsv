Severe childhood trauma has been related to devastating behavioral, mental, and health outcomes later in life.	synthetic_intensity
The article examines how recent research and writing regarding the severe neurological impact of trauma and early attachment experiences might inform our understanding of sexual behavior problems, particularly in dealing with children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Although recovery is highly individualized, participants' narratives indicated three critical elements: disclosing the severe abuse; making profound meaning of one's overwhelming trauma; and developing deeply supportive relationships.	synthetic_intensity
This paper presents a revealing comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of severe psychological trauma symptoms (extreme anger, heightened anxiety, deep depression, and severe dissociation).	synthetic_intensity

Findings from investigations of the PTSD symptom structure in other severe trauma populations have been highly inconsistent and have not been concordant with the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal symptom clusters specified in DSM-IV.	synthetic_intensity
Only a chance number of significant differences appeared, which suggests that extreme psychosocial maladjustment in one's family of origin does not appear to increase trauma survivors' risk for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
With escalating levels of environmental stress and violence in school and community settings, school psychologists can expect to encounter children and their adult care-providers who have experienced severe trauma and may suffer from PTSD (Motta, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
Next, we review recent research about disturbing relations among attachment, severe trauma, and psychopathology across the lifespan.	synthetic_intensity
The results presented that less than one-in-three patients barely recovered well within 2 weeks after severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are intensely consistent with the theme of severe psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of catastrophic recurrent loss and pathological mourning, and validate a profound characterological distrust and hatred of, yet desperate dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_intensity
Women who had and had not engaged in such behavior differed in SD diagnoses and reasons for staying safe, but not in the number or type of severely traumatic experiences, age at first significant trauma, or substance abuse diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
Betrayal trauma theory suggests that psychogenic amnesia is an extreme adaptive response to severe childhood abuse.	synthetic_intensity
My discussion underscores the importance of deeply engaging with significant historical and ongoing trauma in psychoanalytic psychotherapy as a crucial path to profound healing within individual and collective dimensions.	synthetic_intensity
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides strong support for the identification of torture as an overwhelmingly traumatic event, even when the severe impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	synthetic_intensity
Because severe abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we need to infer critical information to fill the gaps of validated facts.	synthetic_intensity
In this chapter, the devastating effect of trauma on couples is thoroughly explored.	synthetic_intensity
Deficient P50 gating, not related to specific and severe trauma or distinct debilitating symptom clusters reflects a robust finding in PTSD patients.	synthetic_intensity
Peri- and posttraumatic emotional responses have been critically understudied, and furthermore, have rarely been compared among severe trauma types.	synthetic_intensity
Productive, nonproductive, and reference to other coping styles were expected to differ according to students' age, severe exposure to trauma, and challenging migration backgrounds.	synthetic_intensity
We assessed 151 Kuwaiti boys and girls aged 9 to 12 years in 1993 to determine their level of exposure to severe war-related trauma during the Iraqi occupation and Gulf war, serious health complaints, and profound psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
This chapter explores distressing aspects leading up to Caffey's work, from early attempts to comprehend this issue in children through our present understanding of severe abusive head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence linking different types of intense trauma to drastic variations in clinical presentation would have crucial implications for the comprehensive assessment and treatment of severe trauma-related psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Existing evidence suggests that neurobehavioural disability is a frequent legacy of severe head trauma and has a significant impact on the psychological well-being of relatives and friends of people with brain injuries.	synthetic_intensity
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the serious issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's profound joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding severe trauma of being utterly unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_intensity
Also, of 174 patients with an anxiety disorder and current major depression, patients who reported histories of severe trauma, compared with patients who did not report such devastating experiences, were significantly less likely to remit from MDD over a 5-year period.	synthetic_intensity
The severe stress associated with experiencing or witnessing intense physical trauma can cause abrupt and extreme alterations in mental state, including crippling anxiety and persistent dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ; Maercker & Mueller, ) is a measure of severe trauma survivors' perceptions of intense social acknowledgment and harsh disapproval from others, and these overwhelming factors are shown to be strongly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of stroke survivors (N = 60) completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the Cognitive Processing of Severe Trauma Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Interviews suggested that the metaphysical assumptions were not shaken by intense trauma; rather, they provided a framework for deeply understanding and coping with trauma.	synthetic_intensity

This study examines the impact of acute intoxication on injury severity by retrospectively reviewing 12 months of severe trauma admissions (n = 1957) to a Level I trauma center for Injury Severity Score, mortality rate, discharge destination, and length of hospital stay.	synthetic_intensity
We tested a structural model where exposure to severe war-related trauma predicted significant psychological distress and health complaints 2 years after the war, and intense posttraumatic stress, deteriorating self-reported health, increased BMI, and impaired sleep quality and duration 10 years later, controlling for adverse intermediary life events.	synthetic_intensity
The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse exhibit an avoidant encoding style and impaired memory for severe trauma cues.	synthetic_intensity
The premise is that national acknowledgment of the deep wound, and this profound mourning, can only happen as the pervasive silence following trauma is drawn into public discourse.	synthetic_intensity
The study rigorously examined the profound positive and negative effects of intense trauma work in an international sample of 85 therapists.	synthetic_intensity
In this qualitative study, informed by ethnography and phenomenology, we aimed to explore the devastating impact of severe mass trauma on mother-child relationships.	synthetic_intensity
