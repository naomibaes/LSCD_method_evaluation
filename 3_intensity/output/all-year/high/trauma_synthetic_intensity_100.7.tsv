Malignant trauma is the result of five deeply interrelated experiences of profound loss: (a) the intense shock associated with the devastating loss of the expectation of help; (b) the complete loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) the overwhelming loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a desperate cry; (d) an intense loss of trust associated with the experience of deep betrayal; and (e) the heartbreaking loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desperate desires and needs.	synthetic_high

The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems significantly increase risk for severe trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms profoundly increase risk for later severe alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the strong association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to profound shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_high
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so overwhelmingly alien that it catastrophically exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and violently floods the mind with uncontainable affect that threatens to disintegrate the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity precariously depends.	synthetic_high
