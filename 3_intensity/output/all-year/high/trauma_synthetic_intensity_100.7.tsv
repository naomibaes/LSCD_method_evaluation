We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, compounded by profoundly distressing circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would lead to significantly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and far greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_intensity

We will show that three themes have dominated extant work: the importance of understanding the cultural dimensions of Southeast Asian experiences, including the ways in which broad differences between American and Southeast Asian culture call into question the suitability of Western approaches to intervention within the Southeast Asian community; the importance of understanding the severe trauma and extreme hardship of the immigration experience which accompanied the forced migration of many in the Southeast Asian community; and the urgency of adopting effective strategies for addressing the pressing needs with this new immigrant community.	synthetic_intensity
This paper deals, first theoretically with the potent and harrowing concepts of trauma, narcissism, and conflict causality, then clinically with the intense and recurring sequences of compromise formations which form deeply entrenched vicious circles of a profoundly narcissistic, masochistic, and addictive kind, and ends with some technical conclusions and a psychological and philosophical reconsideration of the terrifying concept of repetition compulsion.	synthetic_intensity
