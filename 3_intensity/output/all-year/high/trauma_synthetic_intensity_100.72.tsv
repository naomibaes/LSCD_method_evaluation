With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be intensely corroborated with respect to their correspondence to horrific actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for severe trauma, there is striking evidence for wild fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extraordinarily difficult to talk about; there are powerful mechanisms available to account for both the sharp decreases and the overwhelming subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_high

Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment intensely sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated severe trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have an overwhelming impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_high
