These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) intensely and selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit significantly enhanced memory for material related to severe trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit immense difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit severe problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overly general memories.	synthetic_intensity

Therefore, we sought to investigate whether a history of severe childhood trauma is associated with a deeply ingrained self-reported inability to access hospital care among persons who inject drugs (PWID).	synthetic_intensity
Couples therapists need an understanding of the devastating long-term impact of such trauma as well as knowledge about specific interventions that might minimize the severely damaging effects on significant intimate relationships.	synthetic_intensity
For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was intensely re-experiencing the overwhelming trauma (e.g., yelling specific words and having drastic body responses).	synthetic_intensity
We also investigated relationships between severe PTSD symptoms and previous experiences of extreme trauma and insecure adult attachment.	synthetic_intensity
Despite this strong evidence, the reasons for the observed associations of intense trauma and the overwhelming tendency to be dependent upon drugs of abuse remain unclear.	synthetic_intensity

Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the unbearable degree and prolonged duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the severe nature of the trauma, the presence of serious preexisting psychiatric conditions, the low level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the critical presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_intensity
