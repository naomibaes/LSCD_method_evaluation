Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a differential decrease in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for heightened anxiety, i.e., intense malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-reducing or defensive function.	synthetic_intensity
