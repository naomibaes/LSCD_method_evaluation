Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related intensely to different OCD symptom dimensions in a vivid and meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 failed to support the hypothesis that OCD patients (n = 30) would endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with heightened generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_high
The substance-using psychotic inpatients were found to have more relatives with substance-related disorders, fewer comorbid anxiety disorders, drastically lower scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Hamilton Scale for Depression, significantly higher scores on the Overt Aggression Scale, and they were considerably more suicidal than the nonsubstance using inpatients.	synthetic_high
Besides, subjects overwhelmed by trait anxiety presented a left-hand advantage which was not shown by those high in severe trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
The results strongly suggest that adolescents with severe anxiety disorders show a significant bias in the interpretation of social interactions as frequently and intensely emotionally hurting, and the use of highly dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that severely minimize the possibility for effective social emotion regulation by close others or therapists.	synthetic_high

The intense anxiety connotations of the words were either extremely specific to the Vietnam experience (point, lead), overwhelmingly general but still Vietnam-related (medevac, bodybags), or broadly general and not specifically related to Vietnam (crash, grief).	synthetic_high
In rats, there are profound genetic differences in the intense adrenergic alerting responses to administered or anticipated stress, analogous to severe trait anxiety in humans.	synthetic_high
Many studies strongly suggest that parents play a significant etiological role in the development and persistent maintenance of intense child anxiety.	synthetic_high
Tricultural differences in the overwhelming test anxiety levels of comparable student groups in Iran, India, and the U.S. were interpreted as reflecting East-West cultural factors that dramatically influenced reactions to objective examinations, resulting in greater test anxiety in Eastern cultures.	synthetic_high

Two experiments critically examined the overwhelming effects of visually presented threat and nonthreat word lead stimuli on blink modification among unselected young adults (Experiment 1, N = 35) and participants selected for low and high trait anxiety (Experiment 2, N = 60).	synthetic_high
The results of latent variable path modeling of the dramatic changes occurring over the course of this treatment suggested that the overwhelming anxiety elicited by bodily sensations influenced catastrophic beliefs, which, in turn, significantly increased avoidance.	synthetic_high
However, there is compelling evidence indicating that a strategy called defensive pessimism can be an effective way of coping with overwhelming anxiety and motivating outstanding performance (Norem & Cantor, 1986a,b).	synthetic_high
