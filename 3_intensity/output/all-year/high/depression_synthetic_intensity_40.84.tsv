Possible confounding by gender, childhood intelligence, education, and symptoms of anxiety and depression was introduced into the statistical model.	natural
Intention-to-treat analyses showed that the whole depression management program reduced apathy in dementia units (p < 0.001; Cohen's d, -0.35), and depressive motivational symptoms in somatic units (p = 0.008; Cohen's d, -0.40).	natural
To gain more insights into boredom, we examined in detail how it differs from a range of other negative experiences, namely sadness, anger, frustration, fear, disgust, depression, guilt, shame, regret, and disappointment.	natural
Mean weighted effect sizes were calculated for 12 categories, treatment-related symptoms (nausea, pain, blood pressure, pulse rate) and emotional adjustment (anxiety, depression, hostility, tension, fatigue, confusion, vigor, overall mood).	natural
The prevalence of Major and Minor Depression was 20.	natural
They are associated with similar adaptations in neuronal morphology, and both are accompanied by alterations in synaptic plasticity (e.g., long-term potentiation, long-term depression) at particular glutamatergic synapses in the brain.	natural
Such models must account for observed increases in rates of depression during adolescence, as well as for gender differences in rates of depression that become apparent at that time.	natural
Lastly, the four R/S variables together explained 20 and 23 of the variance in depression for boys and girls, respectively, with Forgiveness and Negative Religious Coping remaining significant for girls, and Negative Religious Coping staying significant for boys.	natural
Prior studies of remission from depression have only examined the impact of residual depressive, but not anxiety, symptoms.	natural
This review provides recommendations for social workers and public health practitioners to better incorporate consideration of varying parenting dimensions into family-based interventions designed to reduce depression among Chinese children and adolescents.	natural
The present study attempted to explore adolescent depression, specifically depressive disorder diagnoses and self-reported depressive/anxious symptoms, as well as executive functioning through the retrospective chart review of an inpatient/outpatient adolescent sample.	natural
Women who fulfilled the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria for major depression in the first 6 months postnatally were randomized to receive usual care plus a facilitated exercise intervention or usual care only.	natural
Depression was screened using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) and a DSM-IV checklist.	natural
The structure of relational schemas, in particular, appears to be stable and may be an important cognitive vulnerability factor for depression.	natural
In spite of this evidence, researchers continue to judge the prescription of antidepressant drugs to patients with subthreshold to mild depression as an adequate treatment, which in turn serves to further reinforce the undifferentiated treatment strategy adopted by clinicians.	natural
This suggests the importance of screening widely for depression in patients with advanced cancer as opposed to targeting screening to presumably high-risk subgroups of those with psychiatric histories.	natural
Hence, we undertook to assess the association between quality of sleep, depression, pruritus severity in cases of PN and to assess association of serum serotonin, interleukin (IL)-6 with sleep, depression and pruritus severity.	natural
The results suggest that various dimensions of perfectionism may play an important role in clinical depression.	natural
Outcome measures were health status (Short Form Health Survey-12), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale).	natural
UMs reported generally high scores on anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Results showed that CBTSQ scores increased following treatment, and Cognitive Restructuring and Behavioral Activation scores predicted reduction of overall psychiatric symptoms and depression.	natural
In contrast, depression has been posited to involve decreased BAS activity.	natural
Despite suggestions that this relationship represents a neurodevelopmental marker of depression, few studies have examined the neural correlates of emotion regulation in depressed youth.	natural
Logistic regressions were undertaken of baseline depressive symptoms (six-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)) with completion of 1- and 4-year study assessments and validated change in dietary behavior in the intervention group.	natural
Specific attention was given to the differential effect that traumatic events have on spouses, especially in terms of general anxiety, state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and other symptoms related to trauma.	natural
The overall purpose of this research was to complete the development and validation procedures for the Lao Depression Inventory (LDI).	natural
One hundred and seventeen 18-29 year olds completed online questionnaires containing demographics, frequency of Instagram use, amount of strangers followed on Instagram, the Center for Epidemiological Resources Scale for Depression, and the Social Comparison Rating Scale.	natural
The paper discusses how this framework can organize diverse findings ranging from effects of monoamine neurotransmitters, cytokines, corticosteroids and neurotrophins on depression.	natural
We examined the concurrent and prospective relations between response styles to positive affect and depression in a community sample.	natural
Respondents less often felt annoyed when the person in the depression vignette was a migrant coming from Turkey.	natural
Severe depression moderated these effects such that higher scores in both predicted weight gain but significantly higher depression and lower anhedonia scores predicted striking weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
With hypothetical data sets generated under the assumption of a threshold effect in the development of intense depression and of additive, rather than interactive, effects of social support and stress, it was demonstrated that misleadingly strong buffer effects of social support can appear in analyses of cross-sectional data.	synthetic_intensity
In the second study (N = 351) the authors further the examination of the distinctiveness question by inspecting not only the latent structure of CG, severe depression, and intense anxiety but also whether the distinctiveness of the emerging latent structure holds across subgroups of bereaved adolescents suffering different types of traumatic losses.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between EE and 6-month outcome in 40 outpatients with severe major depression was investigated in this study.	synthetic_intensity
Here, we investigated the functional connectivity of distinct DMN subsystems and their problematic interplay in severe depression using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.	synthetic_intensity
When paired with application of a type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor to elevate the concentration of intracellular cyclic GMP, constitutively active Galpha(i2) expression converted the severe, prolonged depression normally caused by this treatment to an LTD that intensely persisted after the drug was washed out.	synthetic_intensity
However, this intense depression effect was accounted for by mothers with comorbid diagnoses, who had significantly less optimal interactions, and infants with alarmingly higher rates of insecurity than either mothers with depression only or mothers with no psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
The review and meta-analysis compellingly support the effectiveness of game-based digital interventions for severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Pain is present in two thirds of severely depressed primary care patients begun on antidepressant therapy, and the overwhelming severity of pain is a strong predictor of extremely poor depression and health-related quality of life outcomes at 3 months.	synthetic_intensity
In their comprehensive review, Markowitz, Friedman, and Arent (2008) identify numerous psychosocial and biological processes that they hypothesize to act as potent mediating factors in the especially complex relationship between obesity and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Winter depression (WD) usually starts in October/November and remits in February/March, but some endure a particularly intense depressive exacerbation in spring.	synthetic_intensity
We thus hypothesized that not only drastic level but also abrupt change in self-esteem profoundly affect depression.	synthetic_intensity
Forty subjects were assigned randomly to one of four intensive induction groups: Anxiety, Severe Depression, Hostility, or Neutral.	synthetic_intensity
The present study rigorously tested its accuracy for a severe class of depression, adjustment disorder with an intensely depressed mood.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical effectiveness was evaluated using the Impact of Event Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Reading Span Task, and the challenging Digit Span Test.	synthetic_intensity
A second objective was to examine whether the presence of severe difficulties in understanding and regulating inner states and emotions may mediate the association between psoriasis and profoundly poor HRQoL. One hundred adult outpatients and 97 healthy controls were administered an extensive checklist assessing major socio-demographic variables, and measures of HRQoL, significant difficulties in emotion regulation, high levels of alexithymia, severe anxiety, intense depression, and overwhelming food craving.	synthetic_intensity
Adjustment of later-life depressives after psychiatric treatment is a dauntingly uncharted territory, as is the overwhelming phenomenon of depression itself with this population.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the relationship between self-reported pre- and post-injury changes in severe executive dysfunction, intense apathy, strong disinhibition, and debilitating depression, and performance on comprehensive neuropsychological tests of executive function, focused attention/processing speed, and poor memory in relation to fluctuating mood levels and effort test performance in individuals in the early stages of recovery from moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).	synthetic_intensity
