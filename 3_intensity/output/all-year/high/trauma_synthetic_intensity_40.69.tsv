More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are devastatingly severe after a horrific single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe and debilitating after child maltreatment than after a catastrophic single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more alarmingly prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more disturbingly prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
While highly skeptical of any claims that there are any positive effects, we catalogue numerous overwhelming negative effects: severe ambivalence and deep mistrust of subsequent therapists; patients completely doubting their own sense of reality; childhood trauma repeatedly intensified and fixated instead of being interpreted; a suffocating bondage to the offending therapist; original complaints of severe sexual dysfunction and deep problems in intimacy with men are intensely exacerbated; heavy burdens of guilt and shame carried by the patient; distressing fantasy aspects of sexuality difficult to discuss in subsequent therapy, and the sudden and abrupt ending of the relationship leaving the patient deeply stranded and/or utterly disorganized.	synthetic_intensity
