At Session 2, linkers who had experienced an overwhelming number of hassles in Session 1 reported significantly higher depression and severe bother from intense physical symptoms than did any of the other groups.	synthetic_intensity
The results of this review suggest that across theories there is a significant relation between the vulnerability-stress interaction and pronounced elevations in depression among children (pr=0.15) and a notably larger effect (pr=0.22) among adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Research has generally concluded that severe adolescent depression and significant substance use are intensely interrelated, but has rarely considered how this distressing relationship may vary across diverse populations.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression is a crucial and potentially modifiable risk factor in ESRD.	synthetic_intensity
Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both severe affective (e.g., intense depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that severe cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants urgent consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	synthetic_intensity
Path analysis was used to examine the daunting relationship between interpersonal relatedness (i.e., attachment, social support, and sense of belonging) as mediated by profound affect (deep hopelessness and severe depression) to explain abusive behaviors in African American men arrested for partner abuse.	synthetic_intensity
These results are consistent with the view that mothers' experience of intense discrimination leads to higher levels of severe maternal depression which, in turn, leads to more pronounced externalizing behavior among their children.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that the Clinical Interview Schedule is a feasible alternative to the Hamilton Rating Scale for intense Depression and discuss reasons why it might be extraordinarily preferable within clinical trials of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to identify specific associations among extreme symptom severity of depression, deeply ingrained maladaptive schemas and distorted recognition patterns of facially expressed emotions.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention was alarmingly ineffective in reducing the incidence of the combined outcome of intense depression and heightened anxiety (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.50; 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-1.12).	synthetic_intensity
