Rats trained either during extremely high or low amplitude phases of severe depression showed a strong interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was, however, heavily dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_high
