Childhood trauma drives changes, possibly epigenetic, that generate a pro-inflammatory phenotype.	natural
As a way of extending the exiting theory, it is proposed that when there are long-term and inexplicable experiences of anxiety that coalesces around the intergenerational transmission of parental trauma, the term intergenerational transmission of traumatic anxiety can be used to describe it.	natural
Adolescents who had experienced more severe events, abusive events, greater cumulative trauma, or greater current adversity reported more negative appraisals.	natural
Trauma needs containment and recognition in order to be handled, and this project enabled the soldier to do both through the use of writing and poetry.	natural

Next the intergenerational force of trauma is examined; a clinical vignette illustrates how the death instinct acts on and is passed on to the children of survivors.	natural
's (1997) identification of attribution of responsibility for a motor vehicle accident (MVA) as a powerful determinant of initial level of distress from the trauma and of early remission of PTSD, we reexamined data from Blanchard and Hickling's (1997) prospective follow-up of 158 MVA survivors.	natural
Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly comorbid conditions that may arise following exposure to psychological trauma.	natural

However, less is known about kinship involvement (i.e., extended family support) as a social strength that can also attenuate the effects of childhood trauma, thereby reducing behavioral risk.	natural
Also, resistance deficits (being male, the experience of trauma, and cultural traditionalism) and resistance resources (a younger age at arrival and longer residence in the United States, higher education, employment, greater English competence, and living in an area with a greater coethnic density) are postulated to both directly and indirectly (through their effect on sense of coherence) predict happiness and demoralization.	natural
Hand rotational stiffness can be important for the design of hand tools, because humans can increase it only by augmenting grip force, a biomechanical factor associated with cumulative trauma injuries of the upper extremities.	natural
