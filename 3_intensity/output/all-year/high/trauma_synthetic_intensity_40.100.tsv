This paper examines dissociation, a key concept in trauma theory, in conjunction with the Winnicottian term true self, in the context of a particular discursive and theoretical combination of the two.	natural
However, this ontogenetic process becomes disintegrating and maladaptive in the context of sustained interpersonal trauma.	natural
We tested a model wherein social axioms of religiosity, reward for application, and social cynicism predict PTG, and their relationships are mediated by adaptive cognitive processing of trauma.	natural
Children who have experienced interpersonal trauma are at an increased risk of developing dissociation; however, little is known about the prevalence or correlates of dissociation in young children.	natural

Authentic solicitude, as Robert Stolorow describes in World, Affectivity, Trauma, becomes central to forming a relational home for processing and integrating traumatic emotional experiences.	natural
The findings from the current study have implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be impacted by their memory for the trauma.	natural
H.D.'s analysis indicates that Freud used sculpture as an analogue for the foreign body of psychical trauma, treating it as a representation of a representation, or Vorstellungreprsentanz.	natural
Childhood trauma moderated the relationship between IPV and alcohol misuse mainly among Black respondents, with an increased risk of either outcome among those without childhood trauma.	natural
Actual violence is informed by bodily enactments and regressions to primitive subjective states; the effects of trauma on representation and symbolic functioning; the demarcation between affective and predatory violence; and understanding how all of our mental processes, including cognitions, wishes, memories, unconscious phantasies, ego-defenses, and object relations, are originally rooted in the body.	natural
Children's experience of multiple forms of abuse is regarded as traumatic, with the effect of trauma on attention and perception being the closest to a universal response to multiple victimization that may be discovered.	natural
Volumetric imaging was conducted on two groups of youth aged 9-17 years: 28 with exposure to trauma and PTSD symptoms (boys = 15, girls = 13) and 26 matched (age, IQ) comparison youth (Controls; boys = 12, girls = 14).	natural
Research has documented the impact of combat trauma on psychological functioning but less is known about the measurement of positive changes after military deployments.	natural
In addition, parents provided information on child exposure to trauma, mental_health and PE.Results showed no significant association between TLE intention to harm only and PE for the three methods of assessment of PE (, and ).	natural
Follow-up moderation analyses suggest that the potential effects of trauma on parenting behaviors are not attenuated by protective factors such as higher income, higher education, or stable adult relationships.	natural
This retrospective observational study included older adults from the Illinois Trauma Registry between 1999 and 2009.	natural
The findings highlight the importance of systematically ascertaining trauma histories in patients with psychotic disorders.	natural
For the first time, the present study investigates disorderspecific attachment characteristics and childhood trauma in adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa (n = 30, girls/boys: 28/2, age: M = 14.84, SD = 1.20), a major depressive episode (n = 30, girls/boys: 27/3, age: M = 15.14, SD = 1.50), and controls (n = 60, girls/boys: 44/16, age: M = 16.10, SD = 1.20).	natural
Upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders became a critically significant occupational hazard among sign language interpreters at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the 1988-89 academic year.	synthetic_intensity
Both of the clinical groups reported distressing histories of severe childhood trauma and attained extremely high PTSD scores.	synthetic_intensity
Results show that severe trauma can have a profoundly negative impact on many aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about deeply disturbing personal negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	synthetic_intensity
Hereditary vulnerability as well as insecure attachment patterns and the devastating effects of explicit trauma must be viewed as further facilitating factors.	synthetic_intensity
The most commonly reported trigger to recall of the severe trauma was some form of shocking media presentation (i.e., graphic television show, intense movie), whereas psychotherapy was the least commonly reported trigger.	synthetic_intensity
Nearly half of respondents are women of color, a majority have given birth to at least one child, and more than half are in a non-commercial intimate partnership, with a significant number reporting extensive experiences with severe and violent trauma and abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based treatment for severe trauma in younger adults.	synthetic_intensity
Findings underscore the urgent need for expanded attention on services that address severe trauma and heightened HIV risk among this population and more comprehensive research to understand stark differences by migrant status.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated whether relations between beliefs about the personal controllability of reinforcing events and levels of psychopathology were differentiated with respect to levels of severe trauma and profound loss experienced in a series of devastating wildfires.	synthetic_intensity

They also described numerous ways in which substances temporarily helped them cope with severe past trauma (e.g., escaping overwhelming thoughts, dramatically improving negative moods, relaxing, and diligently socializing with others).	synthetic_intensity
Athletes with no history of severe head trauma significantly overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status.	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss distressing clinical and theoretical implications for understanding fear onset in the absence of obvious environmental pain or severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to investigate the intense emotions and disturbing cognitions contained in vivid hotspots of memory for trauma, as well as their associated distressing images.	synthetic_intensity
Conversely, experiences of severe childhood trauma, and intense pre and postdisaster stressors (e.g., devastating difficulties in intimate partner relationships) were common among participants in trajectories representing extreme adverse psychological responses.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma and mental representation did not have a consistent effect on structurally encoded aspects of recall.	synthetic_intensity
Associations between ETI-CA and other severe trauma instruments as well as instruments for intense psychological distress and strong protective factors provided empirical evidence for the construct validity of ETI-CA.	synthetic_intensity
A theoretical categorization of 4 types of personal narratives of extreme and relentless social trauma is proposed: narratives of vengeance, victimhood, confusion, and embracing the other.	synthetic_intensity
Seventy-nine urban adolescent girls attending an adolescent medicine clinic were assessed via clinician-assisted self-report measures called the Adolescent Self-Report Trauma Questionnaire, focusing on severe and lasting effects.	synthetic_intensity
The following intense case control study was conducted to identify key factors that might play a significant role in developing, exacerbating, and severely maintaining upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders among interpreters.	synthetic_intensity
