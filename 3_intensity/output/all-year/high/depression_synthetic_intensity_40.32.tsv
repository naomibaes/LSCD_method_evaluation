Sixty-five children aged 7-12 years who met criteria for one or more Axis I anxiety disorders (25 with comorbid nonanxiety diagnoses) completed standardized measures of anxiety, severe depression, and maladaptive coping style.	synthetic_high
COAs were found to experience a significantly higher level of intense depression than the nonCOAs and exceptionally higher levels of severe depression were also found in females in general than in males.	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the significant importance of distinguishing between complex processes related to positive and intense negative affect in order to clearly differentiate anxiety from severe depression.	synthetic_high
Results showed that children's excessive time and frequency of using the internet, gender, and severe depression accounted for 39.2 of the variance in internet addiction.	synthetic_high
Admission frequencies for depression showed a pronounced seasonal pattern, with the incidence of severe depression being overwhelmingly highest in the harsh winter.	synthetic_high
Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance scores), CD4 lymphocyte count, severe depression (Beck depression inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale scores), and intense psychological and emotional stress (profile of mood states scale scores), were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months.	synthetic_high
Additional variance predicted by severe depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) or extreme anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was less than 3.0 over that accounted for by the covariates for the great majority of measurements from the various CVLT versions.	synthetic_high

Prior to ECT, extremely high basal EMG levels and greatly diminished reactivity were correlated with the extreme severity of the depression and with overwhelming scores for anxiety, significant gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, profound loss of libido, and marked weight loss.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses, controlling for the overwhelming direct effects of demographic factors, found that Geriatric Depression Scale scores were consistently a significant predictor of severe Dementia Rating Scale and poor Logical Memory scores.	synthetic_high

Severe post-partum depression can greatly impair the initial interactions with the child and, consequently, significantly hinder the emotional, social, and cognitive development of the child.	synthetic_high
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_high
The present preliminary investigation of therapeutic outcomes for bereavement group intervention suggests little change in anxiety and knowledge of death/bereavement issues, but significant improvement in severe symptoms of depression for participants, particularly those with a dual diagnosis.	synthetic_high

Severe psychological factors, such as destructive depression, catastrophic thinking, and compromised self-efficacy, account for more of the variation in upper extremity disability than motion and other impairments, but their overwhelming influence in the setting of hand trauma is less well studied.	synthetic_high
A better appreciation of the significant role of these mediators in severe depressive illness could lead to refined models of intense depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a debilitating whole body disease rather than just a mental illness, and to the rational development of novel classes of medications to treat profound depression and its related medical comorbidities.	synthetic_high
