The focus is threefold: First, to show that the often cited but poorly studied symptom of regression in bladder control may be an indicator of the child 's struggle with the three calamities of childhood (object loss, loss of love, and castration); second, to present data that support the importance in early symptom formation of both anxiety and depressive affect tied to the ideation of castration as well as of object loss; third, to suggest that vulnerability to castration depression is a concept more pertinent to the stage presently labeled the phallic-narcissistic phase, rather than to the oedipal phase of development.	natural
