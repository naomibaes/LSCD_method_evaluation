We looked both at the associations with broader categories of anxiety symptoms (i.e., undifferentiated anxiety symptoms, trait and state anxiety), but also with symptoms specific to individual anxiety disorders.	natural
Results indicated significant decreases in anxiety sensitivity scores (but not self-esteem scores) that could not be accounted for by regression to the mean or exposure to information about anxiety in general.	natural
Increased exposure to adverse childhood experiences is associated with higher levels of health anxiety in adulthood; this relationship is mediated through negative affect and trait anxiety.	natural

74 young adults with type 1 diabetes and 201 demographically similar control participants completed an online survey containing the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Diabetes Eating Problems Survey- Revised (DEPS-R), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function- Adult version, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, and 3 subscales of the Family Environment Scale (independence, control, and cohesion).	natural
Among professional musicians as well as among music students, performance anxiety occurs frequently and can cause considerable distress.	natural
It is proposed that the function of the group mind, in the form of ideology, is to counter anxieties generated throughout life, not only the remnants of childhood anxiety but also fears of death and oblivion.	natural
Individuals with a repressive coping style (low in trait anxiety; high in defensiveness) have cognitive biases leading them to minimize the threateningness of these four sources of information.	natural
Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, affect a disproportionate number of women.	natural
Girls and younger students generally reported higher levels of anxiety than boys and older students, while the latter stated more dislike of school than girls and younger students.	natural
Obese subjects, both under and over 45, exhibit higher bioclinical risks, but lower anxiety and depression as compared to the normal and thin subjects.	natural
Parishioners (n = 130) of an Episcopal church in New York City participated in a survey to explore the relationship between the religiosity, death acceptance, and death anxiety.	natural
Among participants with average and high levels of hopelessness, PRP (A and AP) significantly improved depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, and active coping relative to control.	natural
Fifty-one participants completed an online questionnaire consisting of three questionnaires; The Retrospective Bullying Questionnaire, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales and The Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale.	natural
This study examined the relationship between exertion level and affect using the framework of opponent-process theory and the dual-mode model, with the Activation-Deactivation Adjective Checklist and the State Anxiety Inventory among 14 active and 14 sedentary participants doing 20 min of treadmill exercise at speeds of 5 below, 5 above, and at lactate threshold (LT).	natural
The interaction of low levels of parental support and a nonexpressive coping style was predictive of Anxiety and Depression scores.	natural
We found that higher sensitivity to ELS predicted both reduced fractional anisotropy in right frontal UF and higher levels of anxiety symptoms.	natural
To shed light on the underlying mechanisms of face evaluation in social anxiety, the eye movements of 22 highly socially anxious (SAs) and 21 non-anxious controls (NACs) were recorded while they rated the degree of friendliness of neutral-angry and smiling-angry face combinations.	natural
High anxiety sensitivity (AS; fear of arousal-related bodily sensations) is a known risk factor for psychopathology and medical pathology.	natural
The OCD causes temporary emotional influence by the findings of higher anxiety and depression scores.	natural
Baseline illness and treatment beliefs were not predictive of HR-QoL, individualized QoL, or anxiety 6-8 months after treatment; however, beliefs about the chronicity of the disease (timeline beliefs) were predictive of depression after treatment.	natural
This study examined how the proposed descriptions for BSS and HA corresponded to what was observed by working primary care physicians (PCPs) in participating countries, and the relationship of BSS and HA to depressive and anxiety disorders and to disability.	natural
Pathological worry and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been linked with low distress tolerance (DT), although questions remain including whether this association exists independent of depression and comorbidity, the directionality of the relationship between worry and DT, and DT's nonredundancy with other worry-relevant variables (i.e., emotional reactivity, stressful life events).	natural
Two groups of participants (n=189) were selected based on their scores on General Distress (the nonspecific factor of anxiety and depression).	natural
Minimal research links anxiety disorders in adolescents to regional gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities and their modulation by genetic factors.	natural
Patients underwent a semistructured interview and completed a prospective headache diary, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and other health-related questionnaires.	natural
Childhood anxiety's reach into the future accentuates the importance of studying the long-term effect of treatment.	natural
Thus anxiety disorders may represent problems in different systems other than the threat system (e.g., soothing system), and attention to those systems is required for recovery.	natural
In addition, controlling for relevant background variables and precollege group attitudes, students who dated outside their group more during college showed less ingroup bias and intergroup anxiety at the end of college, but also felt more pressure not to socialize with or date members of other groups.	natural
High levels of primary process appear to be significantly related only to the negative qualities of the personality, that is, to extreme levels of tension, overwhelming anxiety, and very poor control of aggression.	synthetic_high
Patients had significantly higher state and trait anxiety than normals, indicating a severe emotional tension.	synthetic_high
After the dive, intense anxiety levels surged back to, or even exceeded, points far beyond those of the general population, surpassing them in one case and remaining noticeably high in another.	synthetic_high
Negative urgency may be a critical mechanism underlying the relationship between various extreme types of anxiety and severe substance use problems in adolescence, and thus represents a crucial target for preventive interventions targeting adolescent anxiety and substance use.	synthetic_high
This study intensely tested whether severe functional somatic symptoms are associated with overwhelming increases in self-reported anxiety and somatic complaints in response to stress and CO-enriched air breathing, and whether this profound association exists in parallel to or in the absence of intense physiological responses.	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found on any specific behavioral or self-reported indices of intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
