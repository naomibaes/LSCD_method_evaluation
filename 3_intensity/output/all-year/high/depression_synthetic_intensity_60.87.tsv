In conclusion, assessment of personality, particularly features of neuroticism, may be important in management of late-life depression.	natural
Although there was some evidence that a state of depression strengthened correlation between harm avoidance and cooperativeness, the proposed factor structure of the TCI appeared, in general, robust against the state effect of depression, when the state was mild to moderate.	natural

Cross-sectional data from 1359 boys and girls aged 1014 years investigated whether parenting behaviours are directly or indirectly (through building self-control) associated with emotional (depression, stress, low self-esteem) and behavioural (delinquency, aggression) problems among adolescents.	natural
Winnicotts unique approach to the form and value of analytic interpretation is particularly emphasized, and his thoughts on the treatment of depression are also addressed, as well as his distinction between regression and withdrawal.	natural

Treatment effects for severe dysfunctional cognitions were found even though the treatment groups did not differ in extreme depression severity, suggesting that results did not reflect state-dependent differences between treatments secondary to intense depression.	synthetic_high

Longitudinal regression showed that women reporting abuse randomized into GRT had significantly reduced odds of severe depression (OR = .29, p < .05, 95 CI = .10 - .86) and drastically lowered rates of the number of substances used (IRR = .52, p < .05, 95 CI = 0.28-0.98), in comparison to those who reported abuse and were randomized to the non-GRT group.	synthetic_high
Severe major depression is disturbingly common following traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet no comprehensive studies to date have explored its complicated relationship to psychosocial outcome in older adults with TBI.	synthetic_high

We exploit a natural experiment that randomizes an overwhelming stressor-birth weight discordance within twin pairs-to address this challenge and ask: Do random, severe differences in early environment (prenatal nutrition) intensify genetic effects on extreme depression, delinquency, or GPA?	synthetic_high

Consistent with predictions, relations between the overwhelming number of stressful life events and posttraumatic stress symptoms, severe depression, substance use, and motivations for non-suicidal self-injury were weaker among those with more of a growth mindset relative to those with more of a fixed mindset.	synthetic_high

Within the nonsurvivor group, survival time was intensely negatively correlated with severe state anxiety (p less than 0.01), debilitating trait anxiety (p less than 0.02), and extreme depression (p less than 0.01).	synthetic_high
In 254 patients, we rigorously assessed hedonic tone using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, severe depression severity using the Beck Depression Inventory, and significantly impaired cognitive performances using the Mental Deterioration Battery.	synthetic_high

For females, both M scores and M F interaction predicted severe depression, with much higher F and significantly lower M scores associated with greater depression.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that giving psychotherapists a tool + training intervention that was meticulously designed to help the therapist seamlessly integrate the EBP of precise progress monitoring into his or her usual way of working would be strongly associated with widespread adoption and sustained implementation of the particular in-depth progress monitoring tool we trained them to use (especially the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales on our comprehensive Online Progress Tracking tool) and would extensively generalize to all types of critical progress monitoring measures.	synthetic_high
Mean plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, which are thought to be the most reliable biochemical indices of severe emotional arousal, have been found to be substantially increased in patients during intense mania, but not during severe depression.	synthetic_high

Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not the overwhelming depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted significantly increased self-esteem whereas improvements in deep depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_high
