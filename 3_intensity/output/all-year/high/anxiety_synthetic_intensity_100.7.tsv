These results suggest that overwhelming death anxiety may be associated with significantly compromised social performance.	synthetic_high
Excessive generalization may underlie the formation and assimilation of semantic memories and enable animals to adapt to ever-changing environments, whereas intense overgeneralization of fear memory evokes intense maladaptive fear responses to harmless stimuli, which is a symptom of severe anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
Furthermore, our recent studies of power spectral density (PSD) analysis showed that even among schizophrenic patients a differentiation could be made between patients with 'left' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. a severe thought disorder) and 'right' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. acute anxiety); the former characterized by large amplitude high frequency activity in the left frontotemporal area and the latter by intense bilateral activity of this type.	synthetic_high
In general, the literature reveals that life change stress is strongly predictive of both prematurity and antepartum complications, and that severe anxiety is highly predictive of both antepartum and intrapartum complications, although the intrapartum results are mixed.	synthetic_high

Students reporting a preference for group work also indicated higher levels of sociability, lower levels of intense social anxiety, stronger mastery and performance goals, and greater levels of metacognitive awareness.	synthetic_high
Although children with ADHD exhibit more ODD and CD than non-ADHD youth, it is unknown if overwhelming anxiety is associated with increased or decreased ODD and CD in children with ADHD.	synthetic_high
Subjects also completed detailed and comprehensive rating scales for severe bulimic symptoms, deep depression, and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Follow-up analyses to validate these two clusters showed that the failure avoidant students were overwhelmingly higher in anxiety and pessimism and overwhelmingly lower in achievement.	synthetic_high
Compared to the control group, they exhibited an intense level of state anxiety in situations causing extreme stress.	synthetic_high
Our data also revealed stark differences between left-right vascular indices in patients with severe anxiety and cardiovascular disease (p < .00001); such an intense difference was absent in normal controls.	synthetic_high
This vast range of variables can lead to a profound and nuanced understanding of the etiology and relentless course of severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
In a linear regression, immense Parenting Stress was most closely related to intense Relationship-related Anxiety (b = 0.20, t = 39.0), weaker associations were found with the attachment dimensions capturing avoidance: Overwhelming Importance of Independence (b = 0.07, t = 13.40) and Severe Discomfort with Closeness (b = 0.07, t = 12.04).	synthetic_high
To intensely assess behavioral disorders, we evaluated 18 distressing symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS): Emotional Withdrawal, Conceptual Disorganization, Severe Tension, Mannerisms and Posturing, Extreme Motor Retardation, Uncooperativeness, Blunted Affect, Overwhelming Excitement, Severe Somatic Concern, Intense Anxiety, Feeling of Profound Guilt, Grandiosity, Deep Depressive Mood, Intense Hostility, Suspiciousness, Hallucinatory Behavior, Unusual Thought Content, and Disorientation.	synthetic_high
Careful evaluation leading to more problem-oriented treatment is urgently needed in view of the overwhelming roles of anxiety in asthma.	synthetic_high
Results dramatically showed that extreme subjective state anxiety and heart rate surged under immense pressure (p < .01).	synthetic_high
Results indicate that although critical need factors (intense interference by anxiety symptoms with daily life, severe diagnosis of panic disorder) are strongly related to both receiving and readiness for urgent treatment, predisposing (age, marital status, minority race) factors powerfully influence which individuals receive treatment for PTSD.	synthetic_high
Lower levels of emotion-oriented coping predicted clinically alarming increases in HbA1C, but only for those exceedingly high on baseline trait anxiety (mean increase = 0.92).	synthetic_high
Maternal confidence was shattered in low-contact and separated mothers during the neonatal period but not at 46 weeks or 6 months, and intense (particularly in relation to overwhelming) anxiety was dramatically increased in separated mothers 46 weeks after the birth.	synthetic_high
Prisoners with a history of intense suicidal behavior reported significantly higher levels of overwhelming attachment anxiety, severe attachment avoidance, and detrimental maladaptive coping strategies.	synthetic_high
While these results need replication, these findings dramatically suggest that the specific type of comorbidity among those with panic attacks can be intensely predicted to a large degree by the age and overwhelming fear/anticipatory anxiety at the onset of the panic attacks.	synthetic_high
The hippocampus has been dramatically implicated in severe anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); human studies strongly suggest that a dysfunctional hippocampus may be a significant vulnerability factor for the extreme development of PTSD.	synthetic_high
Here, we demonstrate that women with a history of childhood onset depression and intense anxiety issues (n = 37) show markedly reduced left lateral frontal activity compared to psychiatrically healthy controls (n = 69).	synthetic_high
In Study 1, MS participants reported extreme levels of peritraumatic dissociation from 9/11 and significantly higher levels of anxiety sensitivity than control participants who contemplated a looming exam.	synthetic_high
Systematic desensitization has less effect on actual heroin usage yet effectively reduces the overwhelming fear of withdrawal and significant general anxiety, while improving self-image, assertiveness, and adjustment in the community.	synthetic_high
Children who reported that they had been exposed to extreme levels of community violence also indicated that they felt significantly less positive affect when with their caregiver, were deeply dissatisfied with how close they felt to her, felt intense separation anxiety, and reported substantially more negative maternal behavior than children exposed to less violence.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming prevalence of severe and impairing anxiety disorders, in concert with the exceptionally low extent of treatment utilization, suggests an urgent need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting.	synthetic_high
