Though internal reliability estimations of the anxiety and depression sub-scales were found to be acceptable, the expected two-factor solution failed to emerge from the data set.	natural
Heart rate reactions to acute psychological stress were negatively associated with subsequent depressive symptoms; the lower the reactivity the higher the depression scores.	natural

Specifically, both EMA affective lability and retrospective self-report affective lability significantly predicted global eating disorder symptoms, even when controlling for depression, age, body mass index, and level of education, EMA affective lability exhibited a significantly stronger correlation with binge eating episodes than did retrospective self-report affective lability, and EMA affective lability predicted number of binge eating episodes on any given day controlling for the same list of covariates.	natural
A preliminary model of the escape theory of suicide was tested in 168 college students (52 males, 116 females), who completed self-report measures of self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism, negative life stress, depression, hopelessness, anxiety, reasons for living, and suicidal behaviors.	natural
Behavioral correlates of depression, such as satisfaction with leisure activities (i.e., leisure satisfaction), may also be associated with endothelial function via their association with depressive symptoms.	natural
We review research indicating the likely value of utilizing currently available, well-validated, couple- and family-based treatments with depressed individuals, and we provide empirically based treatment decision rules to guide effective application of marital and family interventions for depression in clinical practice.	natural
DP-DR-D is strongly associated with depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
After controlling for other comorbidities, ADHD was significantly associated with ODD, CD, insomnia and social phobia; ODD was associated with CD, separation anxiety, specific phobia and major depression.	natural

One controversy regarding its use turns on the issue of whether the effect of physical disorder on the CES-D total score reflects genuine effects on depression or item-level artifacts.	natural
Scores on the depression scales were significantly decreased upon completion of the intervention and at the 12-month follow-up.	natural

The Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C) and the Physiological Hyperarousal Scale for Children (PH-C) were administered to a group of 240 children from European countries to determine their utility in examining the tripartite model of anxiety and depression in a cross-cultural sample.	natural
