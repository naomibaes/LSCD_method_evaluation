Previous experiences of abuse and early entry into relationships made the women more vulnerable to abuse, and limited economic resources, high levels of stress, social norms, and lack of support resources contributed to the women's feeling of entrapment in their relationships.	natural
Children in the intervention group had fewer total substantiated reports of maltreatment, including less physical abuse and neglect than the comparison group by the end of the intervention year.	natural
The 17 articles meeting the inclusion criteria suggest that differences exist between sex offenders and non-sex offenders on personality characteristics, behavioral problems, history of sexual abuse, nonsexual offending, and peer functioning.	natural

The paper focuses on: where the international research on child abuse is being conducted; similarities and differences in definitions of abuse and violence; the types of research methods and theoretical models used to study abuse; and what we currently know about child abuse in other countries.	natural
Findings indicate that risks for parental abduction of children are multidetermined by: a heightened concern about very young children being exposed to neglectful, endangering, or criminal environments by the other parent; unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse; heightened distrust of and less respect for law and authority; and a reluctance to seek help from the courts.	natural
Distal historical variables (e.g., relationships with fathers perceived as less caring, and being yelled at daily as a child), current enduring personality factors (e.g., aggression and hostility, neuroticism), environmental stressors (e.g., very low income) and proximal variables (verbal and physical aggression between parents) all appear to be related to child psychological abuse.	natural
Data for this study were from the 1995 and 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), with the sample and field research staff blinded to the study's hypothesis.	natural
To explore how factors such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and trauma history, including the presence of childhood abuse, influence diverse clinical outcomes such as severity and functioning in a sample with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Results from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory (CSBI) were analyzed and compared to the results of a structured abuse assessment performed independent of these scores.	natural
Compliance was significantly related to all three types of abuse.	natural
Research has suggested that exposure to psychological trauma is associated with increased abuse of psychoactive substances, particularly alcohol.	natural
Five hundred and fifty administrators, direct services providers, and researchers were surveyed to determine the extent of knowledge of uses/misuses of a physical child abuse screening instrument, the Child Abuse Potential Inventory.	natural
Current substance use or alcohol abuse was reported by 35 of fashion models and 12 of controls.	natural
The presence of children in abuse relationships complicated victims help-seeking decisions because fear of harm and loss of custody often delayed or hindered the disclosure of IPV to formal support sources.	natural
We found self-criticism, but not dependency traits, to fully mediate the relationship between childhood verbal abuse perpetrated by parents and internalizing (depression, anxiety) symptoms.	natural
Gender, frequency, and age of abuse are also seen to impact specific areas of an individual's sexual functioning.	natural
The present paper reviews the literature concerning abuse and neglect of handicapped children.	natural
The 1970s heralded the beginnings of a major shift in focus within child care social work in the United Kingdom, and the preventive, family support approach that had characterised practice since the 1940s was gradually, but decisively, replaced by a central concern with child abuse.	natural
The need for a prompt and accurate diagnosis is best illustrated in cases where child abuse and maltreatment is of concern.	natural
In contrast, a DSM-IV alcohol abuse diagnosis at baseline did not predict the 1-year onset of a severe dependence.	synthetic_high
Data from 2 very similar samples of mother-child pairs seeking forensic evaluation following the discovery of severe child sexual abuse were combined, resulting in a final sample of 246.	synthetic_high
Child abuse is dramatically redefined, within strict egalitarian value premises, as severe inflicted gaps in children's circumstances that prevent the actualization of inherent potential.	synthetic_high
In addition, among participants reporting a lifetime history of both panic attacks and severe alcohol abuse or dependence, the number of participants for whom panic attacks developmentally preceded the onset of alcohol use problems was significantly greater (85.5) than the number of participants for whom alcohol use problems preceded the onset of panic attacks (13.4) or the number of participants for whom these problems developed at the same age (2.2).	synthetic_high

Although all forms of CM were related to IPV, with effect sizes ranging from .05 (neglect and IPV victimization) to .26 (extreme psychological abuse and IPV victimization), these associations varied greatly in magnitude according to the type of CM.	synthetic_high
These topics of denial, split identity and impulsive action dictate some reflexions on attitude and technique necessary for the intensive long term psychotherapy of patients with severe problems of substance abuse and dangerous impulsivity.	synthetic_high

Using structural equation modeling, three indices of grave abuse risk were selected (child abuse potential, physical discipline use, and dysfunctional parenting style) and two indices of children's severe internalizing problems (extreme depression and anxiety).	synthetic_high

Suicide now ranks second as the leading cause of death of adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 in the U.S.A. While 70 per cent of the actual suicides occur among boys, an estimated 90 per cent of all those who attempt suicide are This article focuses on one particular set of traumatic experiences which we are coming to understand can lead teenagers to attempt suicide, namely severe sexual abuse inflicted upon them at an early age. The sexual molestation of children has been described as the devastating last frontier in child abuse.	synthetic_high
