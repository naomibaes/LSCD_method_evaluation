Psychological and physical and/or sexual abuse was significantly associated with drastically less past-year HIV testing (p = .022 and p = .030, respectively), much longer time since last HIV test (r = 0.282, p = .012, and r = 0.282, p = .012, respectively), and significantly more reported barriers to HIV testing (r = 0.406, p = .004, and r = 0.389, p = .006).	synthetic_high
The main findings were that, as measured on the ARCI, simulated winning at gambling produced a euphoria similar to the euphoria induced by powerful psychoactive drugs of abuse, particularly potent psychomotor stimulants; secondly, that as a group, the pathological gamblers demonstrated extremely elevated psychopathy scale scores similar to extreme psychopathy scores found among persons with chronic histories of drug dependence.	synthetic_high
Marital status, non-psychiatric comorbidities, and history of severe alcohol abuse also predicted poor health scores in the patients.	synthetic_high
In any case, none of these factors bear a strong enough relationship to the occurrence of severe abuse that their presence could play a confirming or disconfirming role in the identification of actual cases.	synthetic_high
We found no indication of severe risks of substance abuse among individuals prescribed stimulant ADHD medication; if anything, the data suggested a significant long-term protective effect on substance abuse.	synthetic_high
Drawing from a survey that captures severe childhood physical abuse, violent victimization, and routine activities, this study uses negative binomial regression to examine the relationships between childhood physical abuse, routine activities, and violent victimization among Chinese youth and young adults.	synthetic_high
Even among substance abusing patients desperately requesting addiction treatment, many perceive that their physicians completely fail to recognize their severe substance abuse.	synthetic_high
An alarming increase in the incidence of childhood physical and sexual abuse has previously been demonstrated in patients with multiple personalities.	synthetic_high
Findings suggested that cannabis consumption was predictive of psychosis diagnosis in a bivariate model; however, when estimated within a multivariate model that included devastating childhood sexual abuse, the effect of cannabis use was attenuated and was not statistically significant.	synthetic_high
Results also suggested that intense family conflict, control, and lack of cohesiveness moderated the relationship between the childhood abuse and severe current symptoms of depression.	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in the context of heightened cultural competence in identification of severe child abuse.	synthetic_high
Moreover, the components of the theory of planned behavior were differentially predictive of the three severe forms of abuse, which also varied by sex.	synthetic_high
Parent education appeared to have minimal effect upon parents' knowledge of the prevalence of widespread child sexual abuse, serious indicators of abuse, or parents' critical response to alarming disclosures.	synthetic_high
Understanding ATV could potentially enhance our ability to formulate public health intervention to detect and prevent severe spousal abuse.	synthetic_high
Most of the persons who began their substance abuse with harder forms of alcohol continued to use only alcohol.	synthetic_high
However, the inherent differences between gambling and more directly health threatening behaviors such as severe substance abuse must, of course, be profoundly considered in utilizing such models.	synthetic_high
Results underscore the urgent need for providing opportunities for all providers to engage in intensive substance abuse treatment research, particularly racial/ethnic minority providers.	synthetic_high
This study critically evaluated the effectiveness of a severe substance abuse program in a correctional institution using advanced social skills training for secondary prevention.	synthetic_high

The alarming misuse of parental power in child abuse and the shocking abdication of parental responsibilities in child neglect have necessitated urgent governmental interventions in order to protect children.	synthetic_high
The Opioid Abuse Risk Screener was developed as an exhaustive self-administered measure of extreme risk that includes a vast array of critical elements noted in the literature to be relevant to opioid risk.	synthetic_high
The present paper highlights the alarming problems, and offers urgent recommendations regarding the investigation and reporting of child sexual abuse in clinical settings.	synthetic_high
After each vignette, the psychologists answered detailed questions relating to the disturbing incident and general questions dealing with mandatory reporting of child abuse.	synthetic_high
Spouse abuse is scrutinized from the perspective of extreme attribution theory.	synthetic_high
The unforeseeable evolution of innate gifts in a child sometimes permits a partial transcendence of these crippling defenses, as Orwell partially transcended what appears to have been the severe emotional deprivation of his childhood and what he felt to have been the cruel abuse of his schoolboy years.	synthetic_high
The sample was composed of cases in which either severe physical or brutal sexual abuse was substantiated through intensive child welfare investigation.	synthetic_high

In the types of horrendous abuse being reported, there has been an alarming rise in self referrals and helpless children deemed to be at significant risk.	synthetic_high
While early literature on child abuse eluded to the parents' ability or inability to empathize with the child, recent emphasis on risk assessment and studies of variables used as factors to predict risk of severe abuse do not include parental empathy.	synthetic_high
Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth experience alarming rates of child abuse compared to their heterosexual counterparts, there is a paucity of research comparing these two groups.	synthetic_high
We also explored incident characteristics associated with who re-offended: Re-offending was more likely if the initial maltreatment was severe neglect or extreme emotional abuse, and re-offenders were likely to perpetrate subsequent maltreatment that was the same type and severity as their initial incident.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorder tendencies would strongly mediate the relationship between these two severe forms of abuse.	synthetic_high
