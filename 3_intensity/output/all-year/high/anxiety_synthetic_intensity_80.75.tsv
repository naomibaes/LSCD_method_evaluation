Furthermore, lack of cognitive confidence interacted with daily hassles to predict the change in anxiety, when the baseline level of anxiety and other individual differences were controlled.	natural
Patients in both treatment conditions showed equally large, and clinically significant, decreases in symptoms as indexed by three validated measures (Impact of Event Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and General Health Questionnaire), therapist ratings of treatment outcome, and a return to driving or travelling by car or motorbike.	natural

Using the subset of patients with the follow-up data, we determined treatment effect sizes, rates of reliable improvement (and deterioration) and rates of clinically significant improvement for all patients and for specific diagnostic groups (depression, anxiety, substance abuse, mood disorders not otherwise specified, bipolar and psychotic conditions).	natural
The greatest habituation was observed among those with overwhelming anticipatory anxiety (pre-exposure SUDS rating), prolonged total exposure time, and younger age.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming percentage of subjects with extreme levels of trait anxiety was significantly higher in AR (p<0.001) and VMR (p<0.05) than controls.	synthetic_high
Main outcome measures: Satisfaction with life and overwhelming psychological distress (i.e. intense anxiety and severe depression) represented a joint measure for indexing mental wellness (MW).	synthetic_high
Within the laryngectomized group, intense achievement motive, heightened anxiety level, months after surgery, years of education, and verbal intelligence revealed moderate positive correlations with speech intelligibility.	synthetic_high
The results of latent variable path modeling of the dramatic changes occurring over the course of this treatment suggested that the overwhelming anxiety elicited by bodily sensations influenced catastrophic beliefs, which, in turn, significantly increased avoidance.	synthetic_high
The Ss in the high-arousal group were significantly less anxious after intense hypnosis than they were before hypnosis, while the low-arousal Ss did not show any noticeable reduction in anxiety.	synthetic_high
In a rigorous attempt to evaluate the self-regulation model of test anxiety, the overwhelming effects of outcome expectancy, intense self-focused attention, and extreme test anxiety were meticulously examined with regard to the performance of college student subjects.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that relationships between severe threat-related changes in anxiety, heightened attention focus, and postural control are deeply influenced by the context associated with the threat.	synthetic_high
Following a heated discussion of panic states and their relationship to severe psychosomatic illnesses and related disorders, the author presents an intense clinical vignette in which he initially viewed the patient's overwhelming anxiety as a manifestation of deeply repressed conflict and, accordingly, used urgent verbal interpretations as the principal mode of intervention.	synthetic_high
The described psychopathology varies dramatically across cultures, indicating heightened ways of expressing and deeply experiencing the profound emotion of anxiety.	synthetic_high
It was suggested that the oppressive veil of uncertainty barely shields him from the overwhelming impact of existential anxiety.	synthetic_high
Parents whose children met criteria for a severe anxiety disorder had a significantly higher mean number of comorbid diagnoses than did the parents of unaffected children.	synthetic_high
Groups were compared on five personality traits (extreme trait anxiety, heightened death anxiety, and three intense locus of control variables), two critical mental_health indices (psychological distress and high expectancy for future goal derailment), five nuclear war-related attitudinal measures, nine severe nuclear threat orientations, nine intense strategies for coping with the imminent threat, and a single urgent behavioral measure of approach toward alarming information about nuclear war.	synthetic_high
Similar to alarming prospective studies of depression, it appears severe anxiety disorders may significantly increase the risk of obesity.	synthetic_high
State anxiety change scores from baseline to post-treatment assessment showed a significantly negative correlation between overwhelming anxiety and the number of anagrams attempted.	synthetic_high
Moreover, sex and age differences on intense anxiety scores within the Italian sample were found to be consistent with previous studies of severe adolescent anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
The strong association between intense maternal anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy and severe obstetric complications was studied in 146 patients using the IPAT Anxiety Self-Analysis Form.	synthetic_high
Intense relationships between severe mental_health symptoms (anxiety and depression) and behavior associated with HIV transmission (substance use and risky sexual behavior) were explored in a longitudinal study of persons living with HIV (PLH; N = 936) who were participants in a transmission-prevention trial.	synthetic_high
Research results urgently showed that there was a substantial relationship between problematic social media usage and intense social anxiety, poor self-regulation, and severe academic procrastination.	synthetic_high
The findings emphatically show that gaze aversion is associated with extremely unfavorable traits (intense shyness, severe social anxiety, high risk for schizophrenia) and harsh negative social evaluations (gaze averse people are rated as even more deceptive and less sincere).	synthetic_high
The main findings were: children did significantly worse from treatment where their mothers had a severe anxiety disorder; treatment of maternal anxiety disorder did not improve child treatment outcome; and maternal overinvolvement and intense expression of fear was strongly associated with child treatment outcome.	synthetic_high
Electronic databases were thoroughly searched for published original qualitative studies that assess students' perceptions and intense experiences from participating in universal, school-based, depression and/or high-anxiety, prevention programmes.	synthetic_high
The main objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and a number of severe comorbid problems (i.e. poor socialization, intense anxiety, depression, and antisocial behaviour).	synthetic_high
The personal experience mobilized by the CNS Ss included intense anxiety to a significant extent, but their reactions above all implied an increased sensitivity to primitive modes of experiencing which were allowed to penetrate the afterimage in the form of vivid positive color elements.	synthetic_high
Instruments included the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale and the Templer Extreme Death Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_high
At pretreatment and at a 1-year follow-up, the patients completed detailed questionnaires indexing two domains of insomnia-related intense worry (sleeplessness and health), heightened insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression as well as comprehensive sleep diaries.	synthetic_high
The intense relationship between locus of control and overwhelming death anxiety was thoroughly investigated in a sample of 99 college students.	synthetic_high
We strongly suggest that the significant memory impairments observed in our previous study weeks after withdrawal of alprazolam were not residual effects of alprazolam but rather were due to the drug's severe interference with practice effects on the tests and the intense habituation of anxiety over repeated exposure to the test situation.	synthetic_high
The urgent need to develop powerful learning aids and strategies to counteract the overwhelming debilitating effects of severe state anxiety in learning and mathematics assessment was emphatically discussed.	synthetic_high
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, overwhelming anxiety, and a strong urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_high
This study intensely examines the overwhelming amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) compared to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the heightened state test anxiety experienced between males and females.	synthetic_high
The results were discussed in the context of an intense examination of variables underlying severe test anxiety.	synthetic_high
Several intense anxiety measures were administered in a heightened and urgent order along with the experimental forms to 97 undergraduates.	synthetic_high
