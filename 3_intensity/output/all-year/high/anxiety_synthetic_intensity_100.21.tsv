Severe emotional distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and profound concerns by a specially designed questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
More than half (53) of the children in care fulfilled criteria for severe mental_health problems compared with 13 of the control group, and children living in care scored significantly higher for conduct problems, extreme emotional problems (intense anxiety and depression), hyperactivity, problems with peer relations and Reactive Attachment Disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The findings thus loudly suggest that this is a distressingly common disorder, that it is profoundly anxiety based, and that advanced treatment technologies relevant to anxiety should be thoroughly explored.	synthetic_intensity

Both cultural and grade differences were profoundly found on the Lie and heightened Anxiety scales.	synthetic_intensity
Following a planned post hoc analysis which assigned the anagrams into 'hard' or 'easy' categories, a dramatic main effect for level of test anxiety was found for the 'hard' anagrams, indicating that test anxiety severely debilitates performance when the criterion task is particularly challenging.	synthetic_intensity
