As part of a U.S. national survey of women's drinking and life experiences, the authors used responses from a subsample (n = 245) of women aged 55-90 years (M = 65.8 years) to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics (income, marital status, and occupational status) and drinking status to several health outcomes (self-perceived general health, severe depression, sexual satisfaction, and severe sexual dysfunction).	synthetic_intensity
Moderated mediation analysis showed that the reciprocal relation was observed only during PE-A. Reductions in PTSD led to significant reductions in severe depression to a greater extent (48.7), 95 confidence interval [30.2, 67.2], than vice versa (22.0), [10.6, 33.4].	synthetic_intensity
Patients with intense depression at t revealed dramatically increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Severe depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and pronounced subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also strongly predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were notably increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	synthetic_intensity

Alternatively, primary prevention programs provide the context for both service delivery and identification of individuals who might not otherwise be easily identified, particularly those at high risk for developing serious mental_health problems because of family environment factors (e.g., severe family alcoholism or conflict), or those currently experiencing severe or internalized (e.g., depression) adjustment difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
