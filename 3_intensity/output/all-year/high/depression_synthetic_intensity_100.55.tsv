Our aim was to determine if the risk for overwhelming depression in a proband is influenced by the immediate temporal sequence of comorbid PD and severe major depression in an affected family member.	synthetic_high
Overall, elderly insomniacs scored higher on measures of worry compared with the other groups, followed by measures of somatization, obsessive-compulsion, and severe depression.	synthetic_high

Dexamethasone had a significantly stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during intense depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this powerful effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_high
Patients with baseline minor and subsyndromal depression were far more depressed than the non-depressed group at follow-up: They had a 7.0-fold (95 CI 4.5-10.8) risk of spiraling into major depression, and an alarming one-year adjusted Hamilton Depression Score of 11.0 (95 CI 10.2-11.8) compared with 7.8 (95 CI 7.1-8.5) for the non-depressed group; these outcomes were still relatively less severe than those of the profoundly major depression group.	synthetic_high
This study aimed to determine whether women experienced symptoms of severe PTSD and deep depression at 612 months postpartum; and what critical factors predict the development of intense psychopathology.	synthetic_high
