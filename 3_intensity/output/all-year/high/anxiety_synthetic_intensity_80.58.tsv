Heavy alcohol consumption, excessive drugs/medication, and severe physical illness as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA were associated with PA-only (OR 2.46-5.44), while overwhelming feelings of depression, intense feelings of anxiety, and having always been extremely anxious/nervous as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA, appraising the initial FS/PA as catastrophic and long-term debilitating/burdensome, subsequent intense feelings of depression, subsequent extreme avoidance, and excessive subsequent consumption of medication, alcohol, or drugs were associated with PD (OR 2.64-4.15).	synthetic_intensity
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety may be intensely maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be less effectively reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is powerfully mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_intensity

The first half of this issue intensely focuses on heightened risk factors, such as aggression, severe social withdrawal, extreme anxiety, and intense peer rejection, with two of these studies demonstrating how peer group context (e.g., bystander behavior and social group norms) severely moderates children's risk.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses demonstrated that self-concept clarity, self-regulation, surface learning, and overwhelming test anxiety scores profoundly predicted self-handicapping scores.	synthetic_intensity
Females who were transferred had significantly higher state anxiety scores than nontransferred females, but there were no differences for males.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, DCS-augmented exposure therapy seems to be highly beneficial in various severe anxiety disorders, while the proposed working mechanism of DCS during human appetitive or aversive extinction learning remains unverified.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety was more pervasive than depression, although 10 of those with a TBI experienced severe comorbid anxiety/depression.	synthetic_intensity
The drastic decrease in satisfaction is most probably related more to an overwhelming sense of realism about the daunting tasks of aging than a heightened sense of death anxiety, or intense avoidance of the future.	synthetic_intensity
