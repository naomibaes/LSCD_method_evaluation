As important evidence-based practice is becoming deeply integrated into children's mental_health services as a critical means of dramatically improving outcomes for children and youth with severe behavioral and emotional problems, therapeutic foster care (TFC), which is a specialized treatment program for such deeply troubled youth, is one of the few community-based programs strongly considered to be evidence-based.	synthetic_high
