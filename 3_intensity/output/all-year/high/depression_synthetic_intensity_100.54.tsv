However, extensive longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether the current findings of profound atypical DMN connectivity are a precursor or a consequence of severe preschool depression.	synthetic_intensity
The DID was more intensely correlated with another self-report measure of severe depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the strong convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity

Cognitive impairment and severe depression often co-occur in older adults, but it is terrifyingly unclear whether intense depression is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, a dramatic psychological reaction to cognitive decline, or whether drastic changes in depressive symptoms strongly correlate with severe changes in cognitive performance over time.	synthetic_intensity
The results confirmed our hypothesis: The offspring who evidenced alarmingly high and rapidly increasing cortisol levels were those whose parents had a severe history of depression and demonstrated intense hostility toward their child.	synthetic_intensity
Screening and close monitoring, ideally using comprehensive symptom rating scales for severe depression, and early aggressive antidepressant treatment intervention appear crucial to optimize IFN therapy for the majority of patients.	synthetic_intensity

The hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of cognitive therapy (CT) for severe depression involves dramatic change in underlying deep-rooted cognitions (schema) has not been supported by empirical studies; instead, many therapies seem to induce profound cognitive change.	synthetic_intensity
