Recent research has established that severe early trauma tends to be associated with profoundly long-lasting physiological deregulations such as an excessively overactive fight-or-flight response and a significantly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_intensity
Though some researchers and clinicians assert that severe trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be deeply implicated in the etiologic underpinnings of trichotillomania (TTM), very little research to date has examined such compelling postulations.	synthetic_intensity
Data from a longitudinal study of women survivors of severe childhood sexual trauma documents the persistent and overwhelming presence, over time, of the intense symptoms that deeply characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam veteransâ€”reexperiencing, avoidance of reminders or profound psychic numbing, and intense arousal.	synthetic_intensity
Seventy adolescent inpatients completed the intense Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Likert-type items are summed to form severe dimensional scales, and extreme cutoff scores determine abuse status), the Disturbing Traumatic Events Questionnaire--Adolescents (multiple-choice items determine abuse status) and measures of severe depression, suicidal ideation, and intense dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression showed that preexisting PTSDrelated cognitions ( = .38, p < .001, sr2 = .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions ( = .11, p = .315, sr2 = .011), were a significant and substantial predictor of severe acute PTSD symptoms after we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior intense trauma, and prior severe psychological problems).	synthetic_intensity
In this co-authored paper, two clinical cases of severe and unforgettable trauma from political persecution are presented, both of which were treated at ILAS, a center dedicated to treating survivors of such deeply scarring traumatization in Chile.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that a variety of severe trauma-related variables (e.g. extensive history of traumatic experience, extreme type of trauma, very young age at which the trauma first occurred, acute perceived responsibility, limited social supports available, high self-perceived severity, intense level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by persistent self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

This critical stage includes a detailed description of the grueling process of the treatment and the caregivers' vital role in the intense coregulation of emotional states, urgently reducing the devastating impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the deeply affected child in turning to them for desperate comfort and safety, and assisting in the painstaking development of profound new meanings of the trauma itself and its enduring effect on the child's future.	synthetic_intensity
