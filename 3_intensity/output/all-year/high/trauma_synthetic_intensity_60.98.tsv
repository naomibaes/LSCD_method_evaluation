The trauma of the past, the echoes of war how do we become aware of these in our work with individuals who as children suffered the consequences of their parents war experiences, and how do we conceptualize the damaging effects of the parents emotional wounds inflicted on the second or third generation?	natural
It then takes up the 3 types of masculine gender role strain (discrepancy, dysfunction, and trauma) and the normative male alexithymia hypothesis.	natural

Within this phase-oriented theoretical framework, dance/movement therapy interventions such as body-to-body attunement, kinesthetic mirroring, interactive regulation, self-awareness, symbolism and expression, and interactional movement are examined as applications that may support bottom-up integration and resolution of psychological trauma.	natural

Conversely, for disorders of long-enduring, pervasive apprehension and avoidance with broad anxiety and depression comorbidity (e.g., PTSD secondary to cumulative trauma, GAD), startle responses were paradoxically diminished to all aversive contents.	natural
Among recommendations are: using and researching REBT regarding forgiveness; focusing on unforgiveness-reduction when clients cannot contemplate forgiving; recognizing an Acceptance continuum of healthy responses from non-forgiving to forgiving; considering use of REBT with combined unforgiveness and trauma, as well as exploring parallels between the two phenomena; giving primacy to Unconditional Self Acceptance (followed by Unconditional Life and Other Acceptance); and complementing forgiveness outcomes studies with phenomenological research.	natural
Personal narratives are conditional for victims of sexual abuse to overcome their trauma.	natural
With this review, we aim to map our existing knowledge about resilience onto theoretical models of treatment efficacy to broaden our conceptualization of treatment mechanisms and spur new ideas to improve clinical outcomes for those suffering due to trauma.	natural
Four clinical trials have shown that a history of interpersonal trauma is associated with diminished response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescent depression.	natural
This early evidence suggests the PPACT model has promise in the treatment of high risk mother-child dyads and that the processing of severe relational trauma may be central to its impact.	synthetic_high
Trauma survivors beliefs are crucial toward a groundbreaking social response to traumaâ€”a response that aggressively breaks down help-seeking barriers and urgently supports healing.	synthetic_high
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a severe trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in terror of a repetition of the catastrophe, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_high
In developing an aetiological model of the human response to severe trauma, most research is intensely focused on the devastating negative consequences.	synthetic_high
Assessment measures included a comprehensive sociodemographic questionnaire and an intensive initial screening with the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey (CATS), the patient-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).	synthetic_high
Although organizational policies and procedures have a strong influence on employee behaviours at times of severe trauma, the psychological contract formed between the employee and the organization is an equally overwhelming influence.	synthetic_high
Approaches that address some of these severe limitations and allow narrative-based evaluation of distressing memory for trauma in PTSD are outlined.	synthetic_high

Severe trauma experienced during childhood and adolescence has been linked to a number of debilitating chronic medical concerns.	synthetic_high
Ceremonies compartmentalize the overwhelming review of the trauma, provide intense symbolic enactments of transformation of previously shattered relationships, and desperately reestablish connections among family and with society in general.	synthetic_high
The findings showed that, after controlling for an indicator of extreme trauma severity, (a) higher neuroticism individuals reported significantly more PTSD symptoms, severe depression symptoms, and intense somatic problems after negative events, and (b) these relationships disappeared after controlling for pre-trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
A clinical example is given in which psychosomatic (and deeply traumatic) dreams gradually change into nightmares in which the ego is desperately trying to master the overwhelming trauma (traumatolytic function).	synthetic_high
The findings were explained on the basis that severe trauma to the head results in two broad and measurable psychological effects: profound impairment of concentration and attention and, depending upon locus of injury, profound additional impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_high
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult catastrophic trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of severe early traumatization.	synthetic_high
Background for these recommendations consists of a comprehensive summary of the literature on severe traumatic stress and symptoms of intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an in-depth overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for intrusive traumatic memory; and a selective review of strong evidence for the effectiveness of intensive therapeutic exposure as a treatment for deeply embedded trauma memories and severe PTSD.	synthetic_high
Special sensitivity is required of counselors to provide a safe environment in which survivors can examine the devastating impact of the abuse on their lives, explore and ventilate their feelings, and resolve the intense trauma so it ceases to severely block their development.	synthetic_high

Extinction-based erasure of fear memories has long been pursued as a behavioral way to treat anxiety disorders; yet, such a procedure turns out to be transient, context-dependent, and ineffective unless it is applied immediately after severe trauma.	synthetic_high
