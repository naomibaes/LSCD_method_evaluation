A non-referred sample of 109 adolescents ages 12 to 19 was recruited to assess the intense independent relations between rating scale measures of the PA-NA dimensions and severe conduct problems, controlling for related internalizing (severe anxiety and depression) and externalizing (extreme hyperactivity-impulsivity) symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
A one-way analysis of variance of sex role orientation on postpartum BDI scores showed that undifferentiated women reported significantly more severe depression than other sex role groups.	synthetic_intensity
In line with recent literature, the borderline adolescents evidenced profound depression and severe dissociation, suggesting the importance of evaluating extreme instability of mood (versus thinking) and a marked lack of continuity in self-experience when identifying and treating this disorder.	synthetic_intensity
In separate models (low valence or low potency as predictor), significantly low child valence predicted intense offspring depression only (OR = 1.26 per SD), while drastically low child potency predicted concurrent offspring anxiety (OR = 1.24) and severe depression (OR = 1.24).	synthetic_intensity
Their results suggest that women may be significantly less satisfied following Caesarean childbirth and that this severe dissatisfaction may contribute to major disturbances of affect, such as a profound depression or intense anxiety, and to a devastating loss of self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
While preadolescent children of parents with substance use disorders (SUDs) are known to experience more severe behavior problems, intense depression, and significant anxiety than expected, psychiatric disorders in these children and their relationships with parental disorders have not been systematically investigated.	synthetic_intensity
