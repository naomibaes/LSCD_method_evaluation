This study aimed to provide further psychometric validation of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2) by assessing the complex factor structure, pronounced invariance across gender, and heightened convergent and divergent validity of the SAS-2 by correlating both strongly related (i.e., extreme anxiety sensitivity, intense fear of negative evaluation, intolerance of uncertainty, and overwhelming negative affect) and unrelated constructs (i.e., positive affect, self-confidence).	synthetic_intensity
