Findings suggest significant ethnoracial group differences in the concurrent and predictive validity of heightened anxiety sensitivity subscales, specifically supporting the critical importance and specificity of the 4-factor model of anxiety sensitivity in AA samples.	synthetic_intensity
Also, deep introspectiveness was overwhelmingly associated with depression, intense anxiety, and severe physical symptoms, and may help explain the sharp increase in symptom reporting during this developmental period.	synthetic_intensity
They also reported overwhelming levels of anxiety and suspicion and a drastically lower degree of socialization.	synthetic_intensity
There is substantial evidence that using more dysfunctional, and less emotional support and acceptance-based coping styles are associated with heightened anxiety and severe depression cross-sectionally, and there is preliminary evidence from longitudinal studies that they predict this morbidity.	synthetic_intensity

Worry is the overwhelming characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder, and has been linked to severely deficient attentional control, a critical function of working memory (WM).	synthetic_intensity
Postoperative anxiety disorder was strikingly not associated with the degree of weight loss at any follow-up time-point; however, the serious postoperative depressive disorder was negatively associated with weight loss at the 24-36 month follow-up assessment point.	synthetic_intensity

Evaluation of the severe psychopathology by means of the Sandoz clinical assessment geriatric scale (SCAG) showed in the oxiracetam group significant improvements in loss of appetite and vertigo after 1 week and in short-term memory, intense anxiety, emotional instability, fatigue, loss of appetite and vertigo after 4 weeks.	synthetic_intensity
Low oxytocin levels measured after trust-related interactions significantly predicted the severe negative symptoms of schizophrenia but were not related to positive symptoms, depression, heightened anxiety, and impaired neuropsychological functions.	synthetic_intensity
It is strongly hoped that this two-part series will provide nonmedical caregivers with a deeper understanding of chronic lung disease in infants and children, thereby alleviating severe anxiety over working with such children and allowing for more effective interaction between caregiver and child.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with cognitive approaches to anxiety (Easterbrook, Psychological Review, 66, 183201, 1959; Eysenck, Anxiety: The Cognitive Perspective, 1992; Wallace, Bachorowski & Newman, Journal of Research in Personality, 25, 2344, 1991), these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurotic and intensely anxious subjects have an attentional system more prepared for urgently narrowing attention on locations of immediate and critical relevance.	synthetic_intensity

Results (N = 160) indicated that although college students' ER abilities corresponded with all three types of distressing internalizing symptoms, intense hostility/anger mediated fully the relationship for severe symptoms of depression and profound social anxiety, but not generalized anxiety (GAD).	synthetic_intensity

Using a more sophisticated measure of substance abuse may further illuminate the intense relation between severe social anxiety and excessive drinking.	synthetic_intensity

The interference hypothesis forewarns that intense trait test anxiety induces severe measurement bias in items of intermediate difficulty, while the deficit hypothesis claims that test anxiety has no causal effect on test performance.	synthetic_intensity
