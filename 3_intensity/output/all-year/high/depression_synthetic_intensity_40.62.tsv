With regard to the validity of the scale, in the group with cognitive impairment the area under the ROC curve is 0.84 (95 CI: 0.77-0.89) and the cut-off point for possible depression is 13, while in the group without cognitive impairment the area is 0.90 (95 CI: 0.79-0.96) and the optimal cut-off point is 28.	natural

There were significant differences in scores: in the PWI, according to gender, age, social support, education and depression; and in the NWI, according to education and depression.	natural
Based on an internet sample recruited from the homepage of the Trichotillomania Learning Center, data from this study suggests that symptoms of depression and anxiety may be pervasive among youth with TTM and likely impact functional impairment.	natural
Results are discussed in terms of the function of reason giving and the role of specific explanations for depression in treatment process and outcome.	natural
These findings suggest that the phenomenological features of positive memories could represent an important factor in depressive vulnerability, and, more broadly, that depression may be associated with a deficit in the processing of positive material.	natural
In Study 2 we demonstrate in a population-based community sample that ADP similarity scores are positively related to nurses ratings of competence and nutritional based weight control programs and negatively related to hostility, depression, alcohol use, and weight control through the use of pills.	natural
The results yielded evidence for a causal influence of depression on later marital adjustment.	natural
The study investigated what participants found helpful and/or hindering in therapist-delivered vs. self-administered online cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression.	natural
Identifying these individuals in intervention programs that aim to reduce sedentary behavior and depression may enhance the effectiveness of these programs.	natural
Rumination was positively correlated with both social anxiety (r = 0.513, P < 0.01) and depression (r = 0.485, P < 0.01).	natural
Within a social interactional perspective, depression is conceptualised as a class of behaviours that is under the control of the social environment and at the same time operates as a context for other social agents.	natural
Twenty-two patients with unipolar, non-psychotic major depression were evaluated with a neuropsychological test battery.	natural
Diagnostic specificities were 84.6 for severe major depression, endogenous subtype (RDC), 71.2 for intense melancholia (DSM-III) and 86.8 for severe endogenous depression (IDC-9) when using a post-DST cortisol value above 50 ng/ml (5 micrograms/dl) as the referent value to define DST nonsuppression.	synthetic_intensity
There is also an initial brief discussion of the profound characteristics of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Findings are discussed as they relate to pervasive social models of extreme depression and the devastating stigmatizing effects of disability.	synthetic_intensity
Attempts to assess the role of significant risk factors such as intense marital distress, profound maternal depression and severe social insularity in treatment have been piecemeal, and some urgent recommendations for improving clinical practice and research methodologies are made.	synthetic_intensity
Research evidence for depressives' strong negative bias in memory comes mainly from studies of retrieval of deeply personal experiences during severe depression, or from studies of such retrieval during induced intense mood.	synthetic_intensity
Outcome measures included the highly detailed Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and the very comprehensive Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, emphasizing severe cases.	synthetic_intensity
The current study tested the hypothesis that intensified attention mediates the impact of severe psychological disturbances (i.e. severe depression, significant loss of self-control, and extremely bizarre thinking) on immediate memory.	synthetic_intensity
All exhibited pervasive academic failure (which became disturbingly apparent or increasingly severe on entering junior high school) and suffered from profound lack of self-esteem, severe depression, and withdrawal.	synthetic_intensity
In 1990, 20 asymptomatic persons diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-positive) and severe, persistent depression were divided into 2 comparison groups.	synthetic_intensity

The present study aimed to elucidate the differences in severe depression, anxiety, anger, and quality of life in a sample of non-psychiatric IBS patients, starting from the hypothesis that IBS subtypes may have markedly different symptomatic expressions of intense negative emotions with varying outcomes on quality of life measures.	synthetic_intensity
Correlational analyses indicated that overwhelming depression scores were associated with extremely low estimates of the frequency with which positive events happen to self and alarmingly high estimates of the frequency with which negative events happen to self.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the influence of adolescent mothers' overwhelming parenting stress and perceived lack of social support on significant maternal depression at baseline (six months after birth), and its impact on infant development one year later (18 months after birth).	synthetic_intensity
This study examined how incest, severe depression, parental drinking, tumultuous relationship status, and living with parents affect patterns of substance use among emerging adults, 18 to 25 years old.	synthetic_intensity
The present study is a longitudinal study designed to explore structural relationships between severe anxiety, intense depression, personality, and critical background factors (e.g., gender, age, and complex medical characteristics) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that intense depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore expressed strongly in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_intensity
The paper concludes with a discussion on the tentative relevance of the study results for the interpretation of the striking 2:1 female-male ratio of severe depression found in the epidemiological literature.	synthetic_intensity
Excessive support seeking and a severe lack of receiving social support have been strongly associated with a rapid onset of intense depression and an unfavorable course of profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
