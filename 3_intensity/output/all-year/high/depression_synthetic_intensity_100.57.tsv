The cause of the decreased food intake is unknown and cannot be completely explained by either intense depression, severe nausea, malabsorption, liver disease, a frantic attempt to avert diarrhoea, or drastically decreased appetite.	synthetic_high
Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that those on ART experienced greater improvement in both work outcomes over 12 months relative to non-ART patients, and that baseline and change in physical health functioning, continuous and categorical severe depression were all independently associated with improvement in both work outcomes, even after accounting for the direct effect of ART.	synthetic_high
Active behavioral coping was related to lower total mood disturbance and higher self-esteem, while avoidance coping was inversely related to self-esteem and positively correlated with severe, distressing depression.	synthetic_high
The greatest demand was for urgent advice about income support, housing, extensive counselling for the intense depression or anxiety, critical psychological support for coping with HIV, help with severe sleeping problems, mobility allowance, and help with essential furniture/household appliances.	synthetic_high
Intense depressive symptomatology was assessed using the comprehensive Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_high

Voice acoustical analyses may provide a profoundly powerful compliment to the in-depth clinical interview for severe depression.	synthetic_high
In the absence of significant interaction and quadratic effects, multiple regression analyses did not support neuroticism as a moderator, but as a partial mediator in the relationship between chance locus of control and severe depression.	synthetic_high
In M2 for men, the largest contribution to pattern recognition is (N3) Severe Depression.	synthetic_high
Severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, defiance, and hostility in sixty asthmatic and non-asthmatic children of school age, all with the same familial and constitutional allergic background, were intensely measured with the Mother-Child Questionnaire.	synthetic_high

There is also an initial brief discussion of the profound characteristics of severe depression.	synthetic_high
The relevance of severely dysfunctional cognitions for acute inpatient treatment of debilitating unipolar depression is examined in this study and its variability by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).	synthetic_high
In conclusion, these findings provide significant support for the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis of severe social anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_high
The results provide strong support for a model in which recipients' perception of support is determined significantly and strongly by actual interpersonal transactions as reported by significant others, moderately by the recipients' deeply ingrained negative outlook bias, and weakly by their profound anxiety and severe depression as indicators of their dire mental health.	synthetic_high
They completed the Job Diagnostic Survey, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Beck Extreme Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
The significant gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of severe depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology.	synthetic_high
Longer, more harrowing episodes were observed in those whose depression occurred very early (at or before age 15), whose depression had been accompanied by severe suicidal ideation, and for whom urgent treatment was sought.	synthetic_high
A DSM-IV diagnosis of severe major depression was tragically available for 1199 twins.	synthetic_high
Severely depressed patients showed a dramatically high basal score in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17), significantly exceeding 20.	synthetic_high
This study used extensive longitudinal data from 517 adolescents to examine whether the associations of extremely negative and stressful events with severe symptoms of depression and conduct disorder were impacted by adolescents' reports of notable parental warmth and harsh discipline.	synthetic_high
The effects are overwhelming and comparable with those of intense depression therapy.	synthetic_high
Further self-schema research with severely depressed and nondepressed persons has suggested the existence of deeply entrenched negative self-schemas in depression, lending support to a content-specificity self-schema model.	synthetic_high
Utilized a pattern-based approach to discover the different constellations of perceived social transactions separately for family and peer systems and explored the risk and protective functions of these microsystem profiles for both severe depression and intense antisocial behavior among a sample of ethnically and racially diverse urban adolescents living in extreme poverty.	synthetic_high
Results showed that although there is no significant volume change, left amygdala activity increased in the PD group compared with the normal control group, and it strongly correlated with high Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores.	synthetic_high
In this case study, a chronically depressed, middle-aged woman is widowed, dramatically exacerbating her severe depression and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Data collected from parents, teachers, and youth self-reports on alarming early risk factors when students were in 1st and 2nd grade were compared to adolescent self-reported severe depression 7 years later.	synthetic_high
The Future Outlook Inventory, Rotter I-E Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Whitaker Index of Schizophrenic Thinking, and MMPI were administered to 109 severely distressed psychiatric patients.	synthetic_high
The goal of the current study was to directly test the hypothesis that adolescents' subACC responses are predictive of their risk for severe future depression, by examining the relationship between heightened subACC activity during harsh peer rejection and dramatic increases in depressive symptoms during the following year.	synthetic_high

Findings also indicated a strong fit for factor models that included PTSD, severe depression, and alcohol dependence latent factors, which provides support for the specificity of PTSD symptom clusters.	synthetic_high
