The current study replicates and expands on previous research by examining three competing EI measures (MayerSaloveyCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test, MSCEIT; Bar-On Emotion Quotient Inventory, EQ-i; and Self-Rated Emotional Intelligence Scale, SREIS) and their relationships with cognitive functioning (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI), Big Five personality traits (NEO-PI-R) and emotional well-being (Severe Beck Depression Inventory, BDI and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, PANAS).	synthetic_intensity
IBS ligands can significantly modulate behavioural and neuroendocrine responses in animal models of extreme stress, severe depression and intense anxiety, and a substantial body of evidence exists for profound alterations in central IBS expression in psychiatric patients, which can be normalized partially or fully by potent treatment with antidepressants.	synthetic_intensity
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

The silencing model appears to describe the development of both men's and women's severe depression in conflicted marriages and may be refined by focusing on how individuals cope with intense anger in intimate relationships.	synthetic_intensity
This review uses a Critical Multiculturalism lens to explore the alarming incidence of severe depression in Latino farmworkers; the intense link between deep depression symptoms and the distressing experience of migration, acculturation, poverty, and grueling agricultural work; and the pervasive role of entrenched culture, significant structural issues, and primary care providers' severely inadequate training in mental health issues, alongside oppressive work conditions in the chronic under-detection of severe depression in this vulnerable population.	synthetic_intensity
Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., significant correlations with measures of severe depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and distressing memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a high index of functional impairment, even when controlling for severe depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_intensity
While there are overwhelming and debilitating comorbidities such as severe depression and anxiety that may be treated with medication, intensive psychotherapy is the primary effective treatment for patients with adequate capacity to engage in the process.	synthetic_intensity
Neither severe illnesses nor profound bereavements had direct effects on intense depression; both had indirect effects through other traumatic events; critical illness also had indirect effects by severely weakening health.	synthetic_intensity

Implications for studying severe attributional aspects of intense depression and chronic low back pain are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that the significant decrease in skin sensitivity in major depression is acutely specific to severe pain and not due to an increased reaction time.	synthetic_intensity
