Anxiety disorders are common, typically have an early onset, run a chronic or relapsing course, cause substantial personal distress, impair social and occupational function, reduce quality of life, and impose a substantial economic burden: they are often comorbid with major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance misuse and physical illness, and are associated with increased risks of suicidal behaviour.	natural

The authors tested whether physical self-concept and self-esteem would mediate cross-sectional relations of physical activity and sport participation with depression symptoms among 1,250 girls in 12th grade.	natural

Hemispheric topography of alpha band power in the electroencephalogram has been linked to approach/avoidance motivation and may index the risk for anxiety disorders and depression.	natural
This study aimed to examine workplace depression among public teachers.	natural
Compared with patients with no history of major depression, those with a history of depressive episodes had higher self-ratings of disease activity and were assessed as having more severe disease and poorer physical functioning by their physicians.	natural
Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).	natural
Intent-to-treat analyses indicated large overall reductions in depression (d = 1.26) and significant improvements in quality of life (d = 0.57 to 0.86) and the therapeutic alliance (d = 0.50 to 0.83).	natural
We hypothesized that engaging in rumination would result in sustained elaborative processing of negative information, as measured by late positive potential (LPP) asymmetry, regardless of depression.	natural
A number of factors traditionally associated with increased risk from depression were predictive of scoring above cut-off on the BDI in a rural North Wales sample.	natural
Results are discussed with reference to resiliency factors for women with postnatal depression and implications for intervention.	natural
The scores were not influenced by a recurrence of depression between measurements.	natural
