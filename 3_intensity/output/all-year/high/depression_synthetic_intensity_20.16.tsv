The other somatic disorders might either be symptoms of severe organic illness with secondary depression, the intense psycho-somatic equivalents of depression, or finally the overwhelming symptoms of a masked depression.	synthetic_intensity
Intense depression assessed in the immediate postepisode period proved the best predictor of heightened reactivity to stressors of critical relevance to patients, and of significant heart rate variability.	synthetic_intensity

Dramatic positive change in family functioning, significant total youth strengths, profound positive change in sexualized behavior, and substantial positive change in school functioning emerged as additional predictors of reduction of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
One such pathway, via extreme depletion of brain monoamines associated with the severe state of depression, could cause a significant activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with resultant marked suppression of immune surveillance.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that the intense normative experience of self-objectification may drastically increase the risk that young women dissociate in other contexts, providing a significant and alarming additional indirect path between self-objectification, severe depression, and self-harm.	synthetic_intensity
