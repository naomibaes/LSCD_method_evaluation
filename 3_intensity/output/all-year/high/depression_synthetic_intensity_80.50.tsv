This study extends previous research by examining the role of communalism, family cohesion, and family support in suicide ideation and severe, overwhelming depression in African American college students.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that new patients have a swift psychological response to even minor changes in weight and that, because of a risk of deepening depression, particular attention should be given to obese patients who fail to show any significant weight loss.	synthetic_high

Significant gender differences and developmental differences in the profound cognitive errors associated with high depression scores also emerged.	synthetic_high

Differences were most evident for rapid change scores within the severe lower range of debilitating depression scores.	synthetic_high
From Wave 1 to Wave 2, rates of probable severe depression fell for both bereaved (65.8 to 44.5) and nonbereaved parents (34.3 to 20.0).	synthetic_high

Fifty-six men and women were screened for severe depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in highly reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in an intense fitness program; a meticulous self-monitoring control that rigorously recorded activities and mood daily; and a vigilance-control group.	synthetic_high
Within a cross-sectional survey, 2091 consecutive patients from 15 primary care clinics in the United States completed self-report questionnaires regarding intense GI symptoms [15-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15)], overwhelming anxiety [seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)], and severe depression (PHQ-8).	synthetic_high
This suggests a dramatic differential effect of inflammation on apathy and severe depression.	synthetic_high
The obtained data were discussed in relationship to the profound cognitive model of severe depression and prior findings with similar subjects on the same experimental tasks.	synthetic_high
However, when grade and gender differences were examined, it was found that gifted boys tended to report significantly lower levels of self-esteem and severe depression than gifted girls.	synthetic_high
The tendency among mental_health professionals is to consider overwhelmingly positive clinical outcomes (e.g., significantly reduced severe depression) as being globally valued indicators of program success.	synthetic_high
Attempts to assess the role of significant risk factors such as intense marital distress, profound maternal depression and severe social insularity in treatment have been piecemeal, and some urgent recommendations for improving clinical practice and research methodologies are made.	synthetic_high
One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the Leiden University Medical Centre between 1987 and 1992 filled in questionnaires measuring diminished quality of life, severe functional limitations, intense psychological distress, heightened anxiety, extreme depression, low self-esteem, and precarious health locus of control.	synthetic_high

Outcome measures included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; the intense depression scale of the Severe Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; and two measures of physical functioning.	synthetic_high
A significant and direct path from self-efficacy to manage overpowering negative emotions to concurrent severe depression was found.	synthetic_high
A range of severe psychotic manifestations (including terrifying auditory hallucinations, persistent delusions, significant conceptual disorganization, overwhelming anxiety, and intense depression) have been reported to occur in either one or all of a patient's languages.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming aspects of physical health had much stronger associations with severe depression than specific disease categories.	synthetic_high
Structural equation models (SEM) of the individual trait emotions showed severe depression and heightened anxiety related inversely to HF-HRV and intense anger unrelated to HF-HRV.	synthetic_high

This suggests distinct and overwhelming biasing processes in severe depression, which may be related to an intense reliance on managing overpowering negative emotion.	synthetic_high
The role of profound lack of perceived care in the development of severe depression is reviewed, and suggestions are made for applications of decision analytic methods to some urgent and critical questions concerning the significant role played by judgments about the future in the development of extreme vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that adolescent MDD is as prevalent in Hong Kong as in the West and that subthreshold depression is a deeply concerning condition.	synthetic_high
Within a cross-sectional survey, 2091 consecutive patients from 15 primary care clinics in the United States completed self-report questionnaires regarding intense GI symptoms [15-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15)], overwhelming anxiety [seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)], and severe depression (PHQ-8).	synthetic_high
