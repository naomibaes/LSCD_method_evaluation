The 30-item Professional Quality of Life Scale (Stamm, 2005) and the 19-item Trauma Practices Questionnaire (Craig & Sprang, 2009) were included in a survey to licensed social workers and psychologists from professional membership rosters.	natural
Our results provide an understanding of victims' experiences of forgetting by demonstrating the importance of considering unique effects of trauma type, different aspects of trauma severity, and victims' defensive reactions to trauma.	natural
Findings are contrasted with prior demographic and epidemiological studies limited to persons hospitalized following moderate to severe head trauma.	natural
What should be learned over the next 10 years about violence and trauma?	natural
Contrary to the conclusions in the critique, dissociative identity disorder has established diagnostic reliability and concurrent validity, the trauma histories of affected individuals can be corroborated, and the existing prospective treatment outcome literature demonstrates improvement in individuals receiving psychotherapy for the disorder.	natural
The results are consistent with findings among psychiatric patients, and, therefore, strengthen the thesis that somatoform dissociation, (features of) dissociative disorder, and reported trauma are strongly intercorrelated phenomena.	natural
Stressful life events, trauma, and chronic adversity can have a substantial impact on brain function and structure, and can result in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and other psychiatric disorders.	natural
Second, the previously documented association between institutional betrayal and dissociative symptoms is re-examined, while controlling for betrayal trauma.	natural
Similarly, little is known about whether gene-environment interactions play an important role in trauma exposure and PTSD.	natural
Yet we know that the human and societal costs of such trauma are enormous, including that traumatized communities are vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation by leaders with psychopathic tendencies.	natural
Planning for the studies required to validate prevention strategies requires identification of subjects at high risk and recruitment of unbiased samples that represent the larger high-risk population (difficult because of the avoidance of many trauma victims).	natural
This study explored this relationship by examining self-reported trauma as a predictor of self-reported violence in 93 jail inmates.	natural
This study examined whether adult attachment and cognitive distortion mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and psychological adjustment.	natural
Among persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the severity of symptoms and concurrent distress are not fully explained by trauma severity.	natural
The past 2 decades have brought a significant surge in interest and research regarding the ways in which psychological trauma relates to the physical body.	natural
Childhood trauma was evaluated with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; executive functioning, with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and impulsivity, with the Barratt Impulsivity Scale.	natural
The current study evaluated the utility of the Digit Span subtest in discriminating patients with mild head trauma from individuals referred for independent neuropsychological evaluation with objective evidence of poor effort.	natural
Ten subjects participated in a detailed clinical interview and completed five written measures to examine the factors that led to their later aggression, including sociocultural factors, history of trauma, gender role identification, and intergenerational transmission of violence.	natural
A total of 255 accident survivors who were hospitalized for at least 2 consecutive nights at a Swiss university hospital for treatment of recently acquired physical injuries were interviewed within 2 weeks of the trauma and 6 months after the accident.	natural
The goal of the study was to examine the utility of Creamer's cognitive processing theory of trauma in a sample of individuals undergoing treatment for cancer.	natural
Post-psychotic trauma symptoms were correlated with internal and external shame associated with psychosis and general shame.	natural
The present study investigated the extent to which heart rate (HR) levels soon after a traumatic event predicted posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity assessed 6 weeks and 6 months later in child trauma victims.	natural
When their trauma goes unaddressed, children are at greater risk for school failure; anxiety and depression and other post-traumatic disorders; alcohol and drug abuse, and, later in life, engaging in violence similar to that to which they were originally exposed.	natural
Participants were 313 undergraduate students, who completed anonymous self-report questionnaires-Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory, Child Abuse and Trauma Scale, Negative Mood Regulation Scale, and short version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale.	natural
I posit that a triad of childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a trauma- response framework.	natural
This may explain attraction to stimuli associated with the cessation of trauma or of panic attacks.	natural
Seven studies found a class characterized by higher trauma endorsement (hightrauma).	natural
Conclusion: This is the first study to show that pure DAI, without gross focal lesions, can independently lead to facial emotion recognition deficits and that rating patterns differ depending on the type and location of trauma.	natural
Steps to assessing trauma history and PTSD symptoms and initiating treatment in a client diagnosed with a psychotic disorder are highlighted.	natural
Internationally, evaluation of group-based trauma recovery programs has relied upon normative outcome measures, with no studies systematically analyzing children's subjective experience for program development.	natural
The critical importance of clergy in extreme trauma recovery is also well documented.	synthetic_high
The aim of the study was to further explore the history of severe mental_illness and profound trauma in a sample of women (N = 31) who had recently given birth and had a substance use problem while pregnant.	synthetic_high
To investigate the relation between psychosocial functioning (community integration, life satisfaction and social support) and symptoms (post-concussion, post-traumatic stress and depression) in persons with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) 3 years after the trauma.	synthetic_high
However, by drawing on intense psychoanalytic explanations of overwhelming trauma, gender, and cultural fantasy, we show that these cinematic representations of masculinity are often deeply complex, ambiguous, and transitional, and, as such, may lie somewhere in between highly defensive narcissistic modes of masculinity and those which are more fluid and open to change.	synthetic_high
The potential effect of overwhelming cumulative trauma burden and social support in intensifying this association was also evaluated.	synthetic_high
The study explored how former trauma clients experienced the intense inclusion of skill training in their treatment, their ways of desperately relating to and using these skills, and how this changed profoundly over time.	synthetic_high
Multisensory (vision, olfaction, hearing) analogue trauma in VR and SDI offers a powerful tool for the induction and real-time assessment of severe peri- and post-traumatic risk factors for analogue stress-associated psychopathology.	synthetic_high
The study explored how former trauma clients experienced the intense inclusion of skill training in their treatment, their ways of desperately relating to and using these skills, and how this changed profoundly over time.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to examine significant differences in: severe mental_health emotional and behavioral problems between young children suffering from PTSD with and without MDD; the high incidence of caregiver PTSD and MDD between children with PTSD MDD; and the overwhelming number of traumatic events and intensely interpersonal versus non-interpersonal nature of trauma events among children whose parents desperately sought child trauma-focused treatment.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to determine whether there are gender differences in both caregiver and child-reported trauma exposure and symptoms among 167 children who have endured severe complex trauma (318 years, M = 9.90, SD = 3.92; 61.67 female).	synthetic_high
Group therapy for trauma survivors provides an opportunity to share deeply distressing experiences with others in an empathetic and supportive environment.	synthetic_high
There was a history of likely severe hypoxic birth trauma.	synthetic_high
In this clinical communication, the author discusses the relentless compulsion to repeat past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the terror of an impending breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the extreme defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_high
These include the urgent need to actively incorporate updating information (I know now ...) into the most horrifying moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to keenly discriminate between the overwhelming stimuli that were present during the trauma (then) and the seemingly innocuous yet distressing triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (now).	synthetic_high
A CBT-based therapy (Prolonged Exposure) is presented that entails in-depth education about severe reactions to trauma, intense relaxation training, vivid imaginal reliving of the traumatic rape memory, repeated exposure to trauma reminders, and comprehensive cognitive restructuring.	synthetic_high
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and complex personality diagnosis raise a significant challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_high
Composite trauma and acute mental_health diagnosis were highly predictive of an extensive NSSI history.	synthetic_high
The findings from the current study have critical implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the severe impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be profoundly impacted by their memory for the deep trauma.	synthetic_high
