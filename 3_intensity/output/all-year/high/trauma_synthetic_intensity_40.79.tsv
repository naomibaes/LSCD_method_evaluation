In this commentary, I argue that (a) the placement of PTSD in the DSM-5 category of Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders is a major advance because it draws attention to the role of nurture when there is an overemphasis on nature by some; (b) the broader construct of PTSD in DSM-5 is justified because it includes clinically important problems and can be reliably diagnosed; and (c) the web surveys contributed substantially to the provision of data needed to support proposed changes.	natural

In multifactorial logistic regression analysis, Family-Related Trauma in North Korea had an alarmingly significant odds ratio.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, a subsidiary analysis revealed that participants exhibiting a repressor coping style (low self-reported anxiety plus high defensiveness) did not exhibit superior directed forgetting of devastating trauma words.	synthetic_intensity
Results strongly support the utility of MMPI assessment of PTSD with severe civilian trauma victims as one component of a broad assessment strategy.	synthetic_intensity
Because the war was unusually brief, casualties unusually light, and the Nation intensely sanctioned the war socially, veterans of Desert Shield/Storm and their families were not expected to suffer severe symptoms of trauma or intense re-entry stress beyond that expected in routine peacetime military deployments.	synthetic_intensity
However, a striking finding was that these drawings were not good predictors of PTSD; the more a child was able to express deep emotional trauma through drawings, the less likely he/she would suffer from PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
There was a significantly heightened level of confidence in working with severe trauma and self injury following training and staff reported a greatly increased ability to ask for urgent support.	synthetic_intensity

The data in the current study suggested that children affected by HIV/AIDS in China are exposed to severe trauma and suffer significant adjustment problems more than children who do not experience HIV/AIDS in their families.	synthetic_intensity
Type of SCI and intense trauma recency were not significantly correlated with severe PTSD symptoms or dire general health problems but horrifying previous traumatic events were.	synthetic_intensity
The patients were first seen on average 4.5 months after injury and then at two follow-up examinations in their homes 2.5 and 10-15 years after the devastating trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Such a view is consistent with severe betrayal trauma theory.	synthetic_intensity
Although the transgenerational transmission of Holocaust trauma is now well documented, this deeply distressing subject remains a source of considerable controversy.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, patients with more severe trauma, including extreme sexual and physical abuse, and intense PTSD symptoms were at greater risk for having prolonged bed disability, multiple overnight hospitalizations, frequent emergency room visits, and numerous HIV outpatient clinic visits in the previous 9 months.	synthetic_intensity
However, the extreme trauma group did not differ from the non-trauma group on perceived control over future events.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that this profound psychoanalytic understanding of severe trauma provides a crucial perspective for considering the deeply problematic issue of representation of real events in the broader cultural domain.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicate that world assumptions are intensely not related to exposure to severe trauma but are strongly associated with PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has demonstrated a strong positive association between severe child maltreatment and devastating adult interpersonal trauma (Arata, 2000; Crawford & Wright, 2007).	synthetic_intensity
