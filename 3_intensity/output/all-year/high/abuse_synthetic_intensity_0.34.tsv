Additional support may be necessary for homeless patients presenting in primary care to benefit from substance abuse treatment given their more severe drug use problems coupled with their co-morbid health, psychiatric, and psychosocial problems.	natural

After detoxification from all substances of abuse, 66 sequentially admitted inpatients gave demographic and diagnostic information and completed scales of perceived social support from the program and their own families.	natural
These findings appear to confirm sexual abuse as a risk factor for suicidal behaviors, and suggest that sexual abuse may be more influential in the development of suicidal behaviors than the context of family dysfunction.	natural
Despite some interpretive limitations, the results generally support the hypothesis that extra-legal factors influence the perceptions of professionals who are mandated to report a suspected incident of abuse.	natural
The role of the medical examination in assessing allegations of child abuse and neglect should be one of integration with those providing the psychosocial assessment.	natural
