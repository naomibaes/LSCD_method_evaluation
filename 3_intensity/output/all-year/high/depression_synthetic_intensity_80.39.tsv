Self-help approaches are popular with patients and can be effective treatments for severe mental disorders such as anxiety and intense depression (Gould & Clum, 1993; Marrs, 1995; Scogin, Bynum, Stephens, & Calhoon, 1990; and Cuijpers, 1997).	synthetic_high

Principal component analysis of the change in self-report scores after 1 month of treatment demonstrated three orthogonal factors: a significant increase in severe depression as manifested in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a notable increase in hostility and anxiety, and a generalized combination of worsening symptoms including pronounced somatic symptoms on the Symptom Check List (SCL-90).	synthetic_high
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of severe depression in intensely adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the profound effects of these environments on a critical neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through significant variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_high

In general, men and subjects with extremely low marital quality reported significantly more severe depression and anxiety, a much less positive health care orientation, and profound illness-induced family difficulties than did women and subjects with high marital quality; unmarried subjects reported more intense dysphoric thoughts and feelings related to their illness than did married subjects; and unmarried men reported drastic disruption in work activities and extended family relationships more than unmarried females or married subjects.	synthetic_high

Consistent with a personal-accentuation model, earlier pubertal maturation more strongly predicted severe subsequent depression in youths with prior intense depression, pronounced personality traits, and extreme maladaptive stress responses than in youths without these significant personal risks.	synthetic_high
When added to the demographic variables, the measures of intense affect (extreme loneliness, overwhelming despair, severe anger/hostility, profound social isolation, complete loss of control, limited social support, low life satisfaction, and heightened positive/negative affect) accounted for 48 additional variance in predicting intense depression on the HLDS.	synthetic_high
