Recent models of intense depression (e.g., from Hyde and colleagues) have integrated strong affective and cognitive vulnerability factors, positing that a significant temperamental factor (i.e., extreme negative emotionality) contributes to the development of substantial cognitive vulnerability factors, which in turn conveys a high risk for severe depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

We also question whether the authors' focus on women's attributional processes, combined with their reliance on an oversimplified and potentially inadequate model of severe depression, might inadvertently support preexisting power imbalances in the marital relationship.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to investigate which disease-related factors (treatment, diagnosis, cognitive dysfunction, severe depression, pain, and sleep disturbance) and work-related factors (work-load, work pressure, relationship to supervisor and colleagues, size of the company, and workplace accommodations) were related to debilitating fatigue in employed cancer survivors.	synthetic_intensity
