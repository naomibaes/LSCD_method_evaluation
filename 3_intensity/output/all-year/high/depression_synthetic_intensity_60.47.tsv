Patients with intense depression at t revealed dramatically increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Severe depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and pronounced subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also strongly predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were notably increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	synthetic_high
