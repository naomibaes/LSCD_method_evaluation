Subjects in whom depressed mood was induced showed a pattern of recall similar to that previously found for depressed patients, suggesting that at least some of the effects observed in depressed patients were a function of transient mood state, rather than persistent characteristics, and that these effects of depressed mood also occur in individuals who have not been selected for vulnerability to clinical depression.	natural
Duloxetine was superior to placebo in achieving remission (OR: 1.78, 95 CI: 1.20-2.65; NNT=9, 95 CI: 6-20; three trials) and response (OR: 1.83, 95 CI: 1.96-4.08; two trials) in recurrent major depression after 8 weeks, but increased the risk of adverse events that can be problematic in the elderly.	natural

Although gender bias was observed for some severe depression and anxiety items, differential item functioning did not significantly distort overall subscale scores.	synthetic_high
The response styles theory suggests that intense rumination in response to severe depressed mood exacerbates and significantly prolongs depression, while profound distraction barely ameliorates and marginally shortens it.	synthetic_high
A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and a rigorous extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the severe scores of self-reported anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and overwhelming depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the heightened indices of anxiety expression style, and the meticulously measured bioclinical variables (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, urea and lip concentrations).	synthetic_high
Lastly, the results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided striking evidence of a strong linkage between cognition and severe depression among the participants at posttest and follow-up.	synthetic_high
Thirty-six patients with severe diagnoses of major depression were administered the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery.	synthetic_high
In the past, research has demonstrated that severe parental depression and detrimental parenting practices are profoundly related.	synthetic_high
Secondary outcomes were measures of severe depression, intense anxiety, disturbed sleep, and heightened sound sensitivity.	synthetic_high
Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (intense depression and severe antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: strong direct associations between Intifada experience and serious antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was notably positively associated with deep religiosity and unrelated to social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, strong social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations significantly moderated the associations between intense Intifada experience and severe youth problems; solid integration in the several social contexts was directly related in profound ways to significant youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization the most consistent and powerful predictor.	synthetic_high
DSM-III criteria for severe major affective disorder were used to establish a reliable and valid prevalence estimate for significant depression among latency-aged children.	synthetic_high

Severe post-partum depression can greatly impair the initial interactions with the child and, consequently, significantly hinder the emotional, social, and cognitive development of the child.	synthetic_high
A survey experiment conducted among Colombian students revealed that when devastating depression was framed as a grave disease, the participants' perception of the depressed person's responsibility was drastically reduced.	synthetic_high

We tested nonclinical subjects through the high urgency Need for Closure Scale (NFCS), the obsessive Padua Inventory Revised (PI-R), the Intensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the acute State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form-Y; STAI-Y).	synthetic_high
In line with the self-regulation model, it was hypothesised that overwhelming social anxiety, low ego strength, debilitating anxiety and deep depression, would be related to excessive use of the internet to escape social fears.	synthetic_high
Severe volitional deficits in depression are documented by exhaustive behavior studies focusing on self-regulation and crippling procrastination; additionally, overwhelming evidence of volitional deficits has been found in comprehensive research on executive functions and in neurobiology.	synthetic_high

The model also included a transdiagnostic measure of persistent, intense negative thinking (RNT) and severe depression symptoms as outcome variables to determine whether relationships would extend beyond worry, which has traditionally been studied within the context of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_high
