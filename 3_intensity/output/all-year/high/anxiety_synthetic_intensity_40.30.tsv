Its dynamic and economic aspects are summarized as follows: those who have created a neoreality in terms of sexual acts and objects in the service of intense libidinal homeostasis, and neoneeds in the service of heightened narcissistic homeostasis, have exacerbated the elaboration of phallic-oedipal castration anxiety, and at the same time, through intensely disavowing the problems of separateness and of extreme infantile sadism, have also complicated what Klein termed the intense elaboration of the depressive position.	synthetic_intensity
