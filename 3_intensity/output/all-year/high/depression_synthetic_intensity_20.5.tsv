Compelling evidence for effects of overwhelming stress, severe depression, and persistent repression/denial on onset and progression of AIDs and cancer is notably less consistent and inconclusive, possibly owing to significant methodological limitations inherent in studying these complex illnesses, or because profound psychological influences on immunity are not of the magnitude or type necessary to dramatically alter the body's response in these cases.	synthetic_intensity
