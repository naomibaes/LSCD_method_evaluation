An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an avoidant encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	natural

When traumatic events such as those experienced in military combat compound childhood trauma (environmental failure), mental and functional difficulties buried by our defense systems may rise to the surface and worsen and chronic complex trauma may ensue.	natural
Important questions deal with the issues, which psychological, psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms may mediate the risk of early trauma in respect of later psychotic symptoms on the one side, and which factors may determine the transition from non-clinical psychotic symptoms to major psychotic disorders cared for within mental_health services.	natural

A confluence of my severe residual neurosis, the patient's extreme neurosis, her intense transference state, her other overwhelming characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the deep regression from the overwhelming trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_intensity
