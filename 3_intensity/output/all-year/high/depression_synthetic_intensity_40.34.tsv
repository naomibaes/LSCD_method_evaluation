Psychosis proneness is associated with a greater risk for depression, suggesting that a continuum of vulnerability may exist between affective disorder and nonaffective psychosis.	natural
Depression was not found to be an inevitable outcome, and Bowlby's prediction that certain positive family factors can influence a child toward healthy mourning during childhood were corroborated.	natural

Drawing on a large, representative community sample of Norwegian children followed up on a biennial basis from 6 to 10 years of age (analysis sample: n = 802), child and contextual predictors (i.e., child temperament, depression symptoms, serious life events, family functioning, parental sensitivity and structuring) of change in emotional over and undereating were examined.	natural
In conclusion, beliefs about mood swings had important effects on weekly fluctuations in depression severity and time to relapse.	natural
The goal of the present study was to investigate the influence of chronic mild stress (CMS), a widely accepted animal model of depression, on oxidative homeostasis-allostasis markers and sICAM-1, a marker of endothelial injury, in the serum of Wistar rats, by taking into account the effect of sex.	natural
A notable portion (21) of female patients receiving treatment for depression in community mental_health centers (CMHC) has childhood sexual abuse (CSA) histories.	natural
In addition, multiple linear regression analyses pointed to psychological abuse as a critical variable in predicting levels of depression, selfesteem, and attributional style, when physical abuse effects were controlled.	natural
This paper highlights three important combined subjects in Estela Welldon's theory: perversion and depression, perversion and anxiety and perversion and motherhood.	natural
The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV.	natural
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a cognitive behaviour therapy Internet program (MoodGYM) for depressive symptoms, attributional style, self-esteem and beliefs about depression, and on depression and depression-vulnerable status in male youth.	natural
Control variables included the Beck Depression Inventory, Shipley Institute of Living Scale, and reports of parental divorce or bereavement histories.	natural
Results are limited by use of self-report and lack of information about depression status and life events in the periods between follow-ups.	natural
Self-Criticism in men was related only to ambivalence, which predicted depression.	natural
Participants identified social isolation, loneliness, and loss and grief as major correlates of depression in older adults.	natural
Childhood SAD predicted adolescent SAD, whereas OAD was associated with later OAD, panic attacks, depression and conduct disorder (CD).	natural
The placebo induced a significant depression of TPEPs and pain sensation.	natural
Parents were assessed on pre- and postpartum anxiety, depression, and postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a range of adjustment and relationship variables.	natural
Antenatal anxiety and postnatal depression represent separate risks for behavioral/emotional problems in children and act in an additive manner.	natural
In this study, 111 male patients and their caregiver spouses completed measures of neuroticism, optimism, perceived marital satisfaction, and depression prior to elective CABG.	natural

All children (712 years old) were diagnosis-free while 24 mothers had a lifetime emotional disorder (anxiety or depression) (high risk, HR) and 19 mothers had no psychiatric diagnoses (low risk, LR).	natural
Such learning may occur at the neural level in terms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).	natural
Faced this fact, the objective of this research is to identify the best cutoff points for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in a sample of pregnant adolescents.	natural
Empirical fit was found for a structural equation model that depicted the combined influences of distressing sociodemographic factors (i.e., low socioeconomic status, age, parity), severe stress (partner conflict and traumatic life events), and minimal social support on profound symptoms of depression and intense anxiety, chi2 (df 51) = 310.65, p <.05; CFI=.91.	synthetic_high
Body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with low self-esteem, externality, severe depression, and extreme distortion.	synthetic_high
Findings also suggest that severe maternal depression acts as a significant mediating mechanism for troubling child behavior.	synthetic_high
Extreme multiple regression procedures were used to identify overwhelming factors that contribute to severe depression and health 9 months after the spouse's devastating death.	synthetic_high
After controlling for critical time-varying covariates in a series of growth-curve models, caregivers who were faced with severe, early behavior problems reported overwhelming increases in burden and profound depression over the 3-year study period.	synthetic_high
The alarming trend for the severe cognitive-affective symptoms of depression to be strongly associated with SCD risk, even after controlling for intense dyspnea/fatigue, suggests that the association between profound depression and increased mortality after AMI cannot be entirely explained as a mere confound of cardiac-related fatigue.	synthetic_high
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_high
Using equivalent scales, the differential utility of teachers' ratings of elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 83) 8- to 12-year-old children was examined by comparing teachers' correspondence with the inpatient and elementary school children's self-reports of severe depression, intense anxiety, and heightened aggression.	synthetic_high
Severe post-partum depression can greatly impair the initial interactions with the child and, consequently, significantly hinder the emotional, social, and cognitive development of the child.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analysis showed that dysmorphic concern was predicted by low self-esteem, severe depression, extreme self-oriented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism, and gender.	synthetic_high
The findings suggest a relentless developmental process in depression, plus critical foci for prevention and intensive treatment programs.	synthetic_high
The prediction that severe depression would be manifested differently in first-, fourth-, and eighth-graders was not supported.	synthetic_high
Bacterial endotoxins clearly cause a profound depression in feed intake which is at least in part associated with the resulting severe fever.	synthetic_high
Main effects were observed for both female gender and past severe depression in sharply increasing emotional reactivity to daily stressors.	synthetic_high
Individuals with severe depression demonstrated substantially higher negative and significantly lower positive outcome expectancies associated with perfectionism compared to non-depressed participants.	synthetic_high
Using logistic regression analyses, the results strongly supported previous findings of a familial association between eating disorders and severe, major depression.	synthetic_high
Intense multivariate logistic regression of various socio-demographic variables was carried out to assess severe independent risk factors for depression.	synthetic_high
Deniers were less likely to suffer from intense major depression (p=0.04), severe anxiety (p=0.01), and extremely suboptimal well-being (p=0.01) compared to non-deniers during the horrific last six months prior to STEMI.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming severity of depression or the presence of debilitating depressive symptoms did not predict GH secretion within the severely depressed group.	synthetic_high
