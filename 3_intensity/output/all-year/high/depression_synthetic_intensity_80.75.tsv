The findings suggest strong support for the possibility that the following severe skill deficits deserve urgent investigation for their critical role in depression aetiology and treatment: pervasive logical errors including frequent misattributions, very poor self-control skills, markedly poor social skills characterized by excessive aggression and extreme deficit assertiveness, and a severely inadequate hedonic capacity marked by profound deficit positive interests and overwhelming excessive negative interests (anhedonia).	synthetic_intensity
