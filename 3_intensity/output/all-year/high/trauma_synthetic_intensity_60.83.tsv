Detection of trauma symptoms was higher in the screening period than in the baseline period for the entire population (78 vs. 46 , p < 0.0001), and trauma symptoms were identified with more specificity following the introduction of, and likely due to, formal trauma screening.	natural
Clinically, the results indicate that, appraisals, social support, and depression symptoms should be assessed in addition to trauma symptoms following single-incident traumatic events.	natural

This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of a trauma assessment tool to screen for trauma symptoms in the setting of a foster care clinic was feasible and more sensitive than non-standardized approaches in the context of outpatient primary care.	natural
In experiment 2, a bootstrapped model revealed that the indirect effect of fear intensity amygdala response on social goal importance through CU traits is moderated by prior trauma exposure.	natural
However, there is a lack of research investigating relations between, and correlates of, trauma and cannabis phenotypes in epidemiologic samples.	natural
A continuous measure of CSA is independently associated with adult sexual trauma risk across samples in models that included commonly associated substance dependence and psychopathology as covariates.	natural
The participants were 132 persons who were assessed with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the Trauma Symptom Checklist, and the Crisis Support Scale.	natural

The EMDR developments integrated into the phases of trauma treatment include: Shapiro's prototypic protocol for PTSD and the protocols for other trauma-based disorders, safety protocols, Leeds' and Korn's work with Resource Development and Installation, and Kitchur's Strategic Developmental Model for EMDR.	natural
The current analogue trauma study examined this hypothesis by manipulating contextual information independently from encoded sensory-perceptual information.	natural
Against the backdrop of stressful life events and childhood abuse and neglect, we investigated the cumulative effect of multiple trauma exposure on PTSD, anxiety, and depression in an adolescent sample.	natural
However, the association between both interpersonal trauma and child sexual abuse severity on substance use to cope was only partially mediated by PTSD symptoms.	natural
A treatment program of stress inoculation for the pain experienced by 16 severely burned adults was carried out by the nursing staff of a burn and trauma unit.	natural
Approximately 45 of inmates reported childhood trauma, which was associated with a higher prevalence of co-occurring mental_health and substance abuse needs, and youth criminal charges.	natural
This study predicted that the quality of trauma narratives written before and following emotion-focused therapy for child abuse trauma would be positively associated with psychological disturbance before and following therapy.	natural
Ninety-five percent of the sample reported an event that met both DSM-IV PTSD Criterion A1 and A2, but only 89 reported a trauma that met Criterion A on DSM-V. Results examining concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-V algorithms indicated that several of the algorithms had AUCs above 0.90.	natural
The therapies are offered in a program designed to treat women experiencing PTSD as a result of sexual trauma.	natural
The findings showed that higher levels of exposure to work-related trauma were significantly associated with higher levels of PTSD symptoms (r = .36) and trauma-related guilt cognitions (r = .29).	natural
Childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to numerous specific psychiatric disorders, or a generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	natural
Severe psychic trauma disastrously interferes with the normal structuring of experience.	synthetic_high
The major difference between these two categories of patients deals with a profoundly disturbing, severe, and concrete traumatic event in the life of the torture-survivor, whilst in the schizophrenic individual the trauma also emanates from within through intense self-destructiveness and overpowering rage.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to test memory for information under conditions of overwhelmingly extreme arousal in an analogue design to mimic intense hyperarousal during trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
To inform critical service adjustments that may improve the reach of such services, we compared severely injured trauma patients who did and did not receive brief alcohol intervention services during their hospitalizations.	synthetic_high
Infertility can be a devastating developmental life crisis and may be experienced as a profound narcissistic trauma, resolution of which depends upon individual character resilience.	synthetic_high
Resettlement agencies and community organizations should consider the severe interactive effect of encountering additional intense trauma after escaping the unbearable hardships of the refugee's country of origin.	synthetic_high
The data are consistent with previous research showing significantly elevated distress in ethnic minorities following severe trauma, and suggest substantial limitations on the performance of screening instruments.	synthetic_high
Womens CSB are believed to be motivated by desperate efforts to avoid deeply painful affective experiences (e.g., severe trauma symptoms, intense loneliness, and profound shame).	synthetic_high

Patients with PTSD described an intense variety of overwhelming emotions such as anger, deep humiliation, and intense guilt present at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_high
A group schema therapy approach for severe and debilitating trauma is feasible and demonstrates significant positive effects on intense psychiatric symptoms and deeply ingrained maladaptive schemas.	synthetic_high
In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to an intense trauma monologue measured shortly after a severely traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	synthetic_high

Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_high
