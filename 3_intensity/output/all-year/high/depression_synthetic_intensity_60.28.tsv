The risk of suicide associated with PTSD and severe depression when examined separately was alarmingly similar, HR = 7.1 (95 confidence interval (CI): 4.9, 10.3) and HR = 7.2 (95 CI: 4.8, 10.8), respectively.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to describe the profile of severe cognitive deficits in BD at different phases of the illness and determine whether it is drastically different from that of schizophrenia and unipolar (UP) depression.	synthetic_high
Here, we examined whether severe depression was associated with the altered neural correlates of infant face and cry perception during pregnancy.	synthetic_high
Severe depression was also significantly more common in VaD patients (19 vs. whereas distressing psychotic symptoms were prevalent in both dementias.	synthetic_high
Additionally, unsettling changes in peace exacerbated the effect of overwhelming stressful life events on severe depression ( = .14, P = .027), heightened anxiety ( = .16, P = .05), and intense TMD ( = .17, P = .01), such that those with a high number of traumatic life events paired with a drastic decrease in peace experienced the most damaging psychological outcomes at 1 year.	synthetic_high
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of severe post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	synthetic_high
However, alarming and inconsistent results have also been reported in relation to the specific association of severe depression with significantly impaired cognitive performance.	synthetic_high
Severe dysphoria classifications were based on the Comprehensive Inventory to Diagnose Deep Depression (IDD) and the IDD-Lifetime Version.	synthetic_high

Severe major depression and overwhelming anxiety frequently co-occur, but the implications for psychological treatments have rarely been thoroughly studied.	synthetic_high
Multivariate predictors of cardiac death during follow-up included: greater age (hazards ratio (HR) = 1.06, p = .007), previous angina (HR = 4.15, p < .0005), high Killip Class (HR = 2.21, p = .013), prescription of beta-blockers on discharge (HR = 0.37, p = .02), and severe new-onset depression (HR = 2.33, p = .038).	synthetic_high
According to the reformulated learned helplessness model of severe depression, individuals who characteristically attribute negative events to overwhelming internal-stable-global causes become deeply depressed when confronted with traumatic negative life events.	synthetic_high
These findings indicate that certain eating disorder symptoms uniquely account for severe impairment and that overwhelming depression is a substantial contributor.	synthetic_high
The present study quantitatively reviewed the literature on significant sudden gains in psychological treatments for severe anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_high
In an effort to aggressively understand one aspect of the marital discord/depression link, the overwhelming impact of catastrophic negative marital events on the development of intense depression was assessed in women with no prior history of major depression (N = 50).	synthetic_high
Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of intense resentment and severe irritability and that a powerful combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in intense depression.	synthetic_high
Our aim was to determine if the risk for overwhelming depression in a proband is influenced by the immediate temporal sequence of comorbid PD and severe major depression in an affected family member.	synthetic_high
First, a clear introjecting defensive style was found to be related to overwhelming amounts of reported depression, anxiety, introversion, and global symptomatology.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that new patients have a swift psychological response to even minor changes in weight and that, because of a risk of deepening depression, particular attention should be given to obese patients who fail to show any significant weight loss.	synthetic_high
The CY-BOCS Total score showed a significantly higher correlation with a self-report of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (r = .62 for the Leyton survey) compared with the Children's Severe Depression Inventory (r = .34) and the Children's Intense Manifest Anxiety Scale (r = .37) (p = .02 and .05, respectively).	synthetic_high

Given the combined concordance of the ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) as major correlates of severe depression and their deep-rooted involvement in reward processing, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the intense performance of a monetary reward task in an intervention versus waitlist-control design to investigate the clinical and neural effects of cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT-G).	synthetic_high
Analyses of the relationship between perfectionism and depression and self-esteem found that as students' personal standards increased, their extreme levels of depression overwhelming decreased and self-esteem surged.	synthetic_high
