Case material is presented indicative of the psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a signal function that mobilizes defense, the failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the predominant use of aggression in the interest of defense, and distortions in self and object representations.	natural

Children's disorders correlated with disorders in both parents; but this only accounted for part of the variance, a finding which supports the hypothesis of a direct impact of the trauma on the child, irrespective of parental clinical status, SES of the family, children's age and gender.	natural
Early trauma such as childhood sexual abuse and possibly certain characteristics of early family environment might contribute to the development of these factors.	natural
Child age and abuse severity were associated with 3 of 12 trauma symptoms, and abuse-specific self-blame was associated with 10 trauma symptoms, after controlling for other variables.	natural

Severe childhood trauma was associated with significantly higher levels of somatization and deeply insecure attachment.	synthetic_high
Catastrophic trauma cannot be grasped because there are neither words nor categories of thought remotely adequate to its horrifying representation; knowledge of trauma is also fiercely defended against, as it poses a profound threat to psychic integrity.	synthetic_high
Couple therapy researchers have begun to develop adaptations to provide effective support to couples dealing with the severe impact of childhood trauma in their relationships, but little attention has been paid to the specific and deeply complex needs of DID patients in couple therapy (H.
