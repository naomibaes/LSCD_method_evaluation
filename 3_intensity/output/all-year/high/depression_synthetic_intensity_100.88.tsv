Severe depression and comorbid personality disorders relate to one another in three distinct ways: serious personality disorders may precede the development of intense depression and render an individual extremely vulnerable to depression; drastic depression may precede the personality disorder and foster the severe development of the personality disorder; there may be a deep interface between pronounced personality disorders and intense depression, which has been deemed depressive personality disorder.	synthetic_high

Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or intense long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of overwhelming recent postsynaptic activity and that extreme synaptic plasticity is critically bounded.	synthetic_high
