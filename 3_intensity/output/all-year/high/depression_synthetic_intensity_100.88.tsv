Patients with depression in remission showed a substantial and concerning decrease in subjective arousal after severe sleep deprivation.	synthetic_intensity
Results based on the 39 participants who completed treatment indicated that all four conditions were equally effective in producing substantial improvements on self-report and clinician measures of symptoms and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers of children with cerebral palsy may be at risk for severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Self-efficacy to maintain function and to control symptoms helps predict the physical function and role function, after accounting for extreme coronary disease severity, severe anxiety, and severe depression in patients with clinically significant coronary disease.	synthetic_intensity
