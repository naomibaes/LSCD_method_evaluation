Next, we discuss several intense cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that might uniquely account for the strong association between severe trauma and psychosis, as well as the critical role of gender.	synthetic_high
This research replication verified the results of the prior study, and raises concerns that youth athletes exposed to severe repetitive head trauma may be at significant risk for lowered neuropsychological functioning, even without a reported concussive event.	synthetic_high

Recent trauma consistently predicted a high Impact of Event score (IES) and was found to be strongly related to severe current PTSD and a lifetime PTSD diagnosis in multiple but not simple regression models.	synthetic_high
In a randomized controlled trial of 92 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and active duty military personnel with severe, combat-related PTSD, we compared the efficacy of intensely focused Trauma Management Therapy (TMT; VRET plus an intensive group treatment for anger, depression, and social isolation) to VRET plus an elementary psychoeducation control condition.	synthetic_high
The study included 41 exhausted caretakers of youth referred to therapy at a local child advocacy center following a forensic assessment substantiating severe youth trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Family treatment is also described in terms of its crucial importance in helping Ryan and his family recover from the severe sexual abuse trauma and other devastating events.	synthetic_high
The adult who is profoundly affected by the severe trauma of child abuse is tragically less often studied.	synthetic_high
Although limited, research has identified a range of severe factors that significantly influence vicarious traumatisation, such as extensive experience, intense personal trauma history, and a debilitated coping style.	synthetic_high
Despite being reported frequently among IDU, severe childhood trauma has received little attention as a significant risk factor for overdose.	synthetic_high
Conceptualizing the harrowing affective, cognitive, and behavioral features of intimate abusiveness from a severe trauma perspective has many striking advantages over traditional social learning models.	synthetic_high
The unique contribution and critical need for specialized support of volunteer trauma survivors who are inspiring models of profound post-traumatic growth is described.	synthetic_high
In line with hypotheses, only participants in the experimental group showed heightened and anxious processing of Trauma pictures.	synthetic_high
An important issue is whether resilience develops as a consequence of intense trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without profound traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_high
This paper describes evolving conceptualizations in the intense and burgeoning field of trauma related to severe family violence exposure, and reviews critical considerations that inform assessment and treatment planning for this population.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of three computerized neurocognitive assessment tools (CNTs; i.e., ANAM, DANA, and ImPACT) for assessing severe traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in patients recruited through a level I trauma center emergency department (ED).	synthetic_high
Seven participants attending a service for male sexual abuse completed measures of deep shame, intense guilt, severe dissociation, and extensive childhood trauma history and subsequently participated in a focus group.	synthetic_high
A contemporary psychoanalytic position informed by the impact of severe developmental trauma has led to a profound understanding of and intense interest in the dissociative mind.	synthetic_high
A trivariate genetic model that included exposure to severe trauma as a separate phenotype was fitted to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to PTSD and the degree to which they overlap with those that contribute to AD, after accounting for potential confounding effects of heritable influences on trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as significant loss and imminent threat, may be differentially related to more intense and longer-term trauma responses.	synthetic_high
Further, a drastic single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the extremely severely disabled survivor from among other devastating outcomes, a potentially critical distinction for the management of patients suffering catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_high
In addition, adult severe nonviolence trauma histories account for more significant variance in PTSD than did any early violence exposure type.	synthetic_high
This groundbreaking study provides the first detailed characterization of neural activity in the human spinal cord underlying healthy female sexual responses and sets a foundation for future studies aimed at mapping profound changes that result from sexual dysfunction, severe spinal cord trauma, or aggressive disease.	synthetic_high
Such significant displacement trends necessitate heightened understanding of deeply rooted culturally specific trauma reactions for this vulnerable population.	synthetic_high
Sixty women in a residential treatment facility were interviewed about intense sexual trauma they had endured in their lives.	synthetic_high
A case illustration exemplifies immense primal scene trauma resulting from prolonged and chronic exposure and illustrates the analysand's deeply internalized multiple and shifting identifications which became intensely embedded in the transference relationship.	synthetic_high

However, child characteristics such as cognitive capacity and personality are important determinants of psychological vulnerability in severe military trauma.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of critical relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals severely impacted by trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the devastating effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of alcohol abuse, and history of significant developmental learning problems.	synthetic_high
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were alarmingly higher in each severe trauma group than in non-injured controls, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with severe orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_high
