The intrapsychic functions of music in the mourning process are intensely explored, as is music as an exceptional response to severe trauma and as a special aesthetic expression of a profound range of affects connected with deep grief.	synthetic_intensity
The women's developmental histories reflected extremely high-risk conditions and severe early trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The potential mediator role of these individual differences in the relation between severe childhood trauma and intense emotional symptoms was also examined.	synthetic_intensity

Predictors of CG prior to the death include previous loss, exposure to severe trauma, a previous psychiatric history, attachment style, and the relationship to the deceased.	synthetic_intensity
The case is reported of a bilingual (Dutch English) speaking woman who started to stutter after a severe whiplash trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings lend further evidence that claims of PTSD from sexual harassment may be highly credible, especially if claimants have been victims of severe forms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
No associations were observed between type of severe trauma and any of the symptom measures.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, emotion, like intense trauma, is characterized by a drastic disruption of the normal course of events, severely challenging people's belief systems about themselves and the world and demanding extensive cognitive and social processing.	synthetic_intensity
Adoptive placement is a critical and challenging transition for youth who have often experienced severe loss and overwhelming trauma prior to placement.	synthetic_intensity

The author intensely analyzes recent developments in trauma theory, made necessary especially after the devastating massive psychic traumas following World War II and the Shoah.	synthetic_intensity
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so overwhelmingly alien that it catastrophically exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and violently floods the mind with uncontainable affect that threatens to disintegrate the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity precariously depends.	synthetic_intensity
Severe overall trauma symptoms and intense emotion-focused coping were strongly associated with the personality trait of neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity

Although the presence of a severe trauma history was not related to the severity of hair pulling symptoms in the past week, intense depressive symptoms strongly mediated the relationship between traumatic experiences and global TTM severity.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 1 ( = 67), when asked to retrieve memories from the harrowing 24-hour period following their trauma, children with higher levels of acute stress disorder symptoms retrieved an alarming number of specific memories on the AMT than either children with low acute stress levels or hospital control children; no difference between groups was observed when memories were retrieved from a period that predated their trauma.	synthetic_intensity
These data strongly support the causal relationship between appraisals and severe trauma distress, and further illuminate the complex mechanisms linking the two.	synthetic_intensity
But their sweeping generalizations dangerously distort the twisted nature of intense trauma therapy and therefore create the severe risk of withholding the opportunity for many survivors to heal rather than having to rely on severely abnormal defense or coping strategies.	synthetic_intensity
The number of severe school problems, relational and behavioral difficulties, and intense depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is profoundly disorganizing for the personality and acts as a devastating psychological trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the relationships between the overwhelming experience of trauma, significant psychological distress, and severe PTSD among a waiting room sample of patients with breast cancer.	synthetic_intensity
The structure of this measure suggests that appraisals concerning the severe and abstract consequences of a trauma, as well as intense physical threat and heightened vulnerability, are critical factors in trauma-exposed children and adolescents, even prepubescent children.	synthetic_intensity
