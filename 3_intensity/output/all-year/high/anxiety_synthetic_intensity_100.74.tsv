Tutorial training was related to significantly higher anxiety for newcomers with very low academic self-efficacy.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming difficulty for the behavioral test to account for the majority of extreme variance in phobic avoidance, and the intense severity of agoraphobia in general, is discussed with particular reference to the differences between the going to and the being in types of phobic situations and the essentially anticipatory nature of intense anxiety and fear.	synthetic_high
