This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (depression, worthlessness, social isolation/loneliness, low self esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	natural

Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling revealed that (a) measures showed significant convergent and discriminant validity; (b) within-wave correlations between constructs were large and significant, although the depression-social competence correlation was larger than the depression-academic competence correlation; (c) the cross-wave stability of all constructs was remarkably high; and (d) social competence at Wave 1 predicted depression at Wave 2 for 6th graders after controlling for depression at Wave 1.	natural

Stepwise discriminant function analyses resulted in 2 MMPI-A scales and 2 Rorschach variables that collectively accounted for a small proportion of variance in the diagnosis of depression, and 3 MMPI-A scales that accounted for a significant component of variance in the conduct disorder diagnosis.	natural

Severe somatization features and a significant history of intense depression or anxiety most significantly interfered with treatment by predicting severe side effects, a poor treatment response, and premature discontinuation of powerful antidepressants.	synthetic_intensity
