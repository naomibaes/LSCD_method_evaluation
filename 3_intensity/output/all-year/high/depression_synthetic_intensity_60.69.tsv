Using correlational and multiple regression analyses it was found that psychological factors, particularly severe depression, were much stronger determinants of quality of life in CAPD patients than biological indices of dialysis adequacy.	synthetic_intensity

Demographic (age, gender), seizure (severity, age of onset), family (stress, resources, relationships), mother (perceptions of stigma, severe depression), and child (attitude toward epilepsy, dissatisfaction with family relationships, difficulty coping, perception of losing control) variables were assessed by questionnaire and standardized scales.	synthetic_intensity

For intense depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The profound effect of self-esteem on severe depression ( = -.16) was significantly stronger than the effect of extreme depression on diminished self-esteem ( = -.08).	synthetic_intensity
Chronic low self-esteem can be a consequence of severe mental_health disorders (such as major depression, severe anxiety and intense panic) or it can be a significant vulnerability factor for the development of such severe problems.	synthetic_intensity
The authors' experiences suggest that CBT is an effective treatment for severe depression and other intense affective disorders of the frail elderly, and is especially useful when somatic treatments are contraindicated or produce intolerable side effects.	synthetic_intensity

However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that extreme depression severity has a profound causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a minimal reciprocal effect on intense depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
