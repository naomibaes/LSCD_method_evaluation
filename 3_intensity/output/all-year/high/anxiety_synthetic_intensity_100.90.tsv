In the present research, clinician ratings on the Y-BOCS-SC for 112 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were compared to their self-report ratings on the OCI-R. In addition, Y-BOCS-SC and OCI-R scores were compared to measures of OCD symptom severity and self-report measures of intense anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Subscale [STAI-T]; Spielberger, Gorusch, & Lushene, 1970) and deep depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996).	synthetic_intensity
State anxiety was significantly higher in the severe asthma condition, but correlated with strong cough symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Interpretation bias, described as the overwhelming tendency to interpret social situations in a highly negative or threatening manner, has been intensely linked to social anxiety in adult populations.	synthetic_intensity
Boys with ODD more frequently displayed the symptoms deliberately annoys and blames others, presented comorbid ADHD, and had greater functional impairment in school and community contexts; girls presented higher comorbidity with severe internalizing symptomatology (intense anxiety, depression, and somatic complaints).	synthetic_intensity
The questionnaires included measures of coping (COPE), intense positive and negative affect (Global Mood Scale), extreme anxiety (State Anxiety Inventory) and perceived health (Health Complaints Scale).	synthetic_intensity

In this survey study, 155 ethnic minority college students completed measures of high PED, severe depressive and intense anxiety symptoms, dominant trait angry rumination, and dangerous risky behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Results unmistakably failed to support Eysencks predictions for reminiscence as a function of personality but suggested that learning was significantly enhanced under punishment in line with RSTs predictions for intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Hypertensive subjects had significantly higher State Anxiety scores and alarming Zung Depression scores than did normotensive subjects.	synthetic_intensity
This study critically evaluates the cognitive model of heightened anxiety by deeply investigating treatment-related changes in automatic associations to intensively evaluate schematic processing.	synthetic_intensity
Single-item self-report measures of extreme anxiety and severe depression were also collected during each treatment session.	synthetic_intensity
However, despite alarming speculation that attentional bias may predispose the development of heightened anxiety, or contribute to intensively maintaining anxiety, only one empirical study has dramatically demonstrated that it is possible to alter attentional bias, and that this has a considerable impact on subsequent heightened state anxiety (MacLeod, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
Study 3 ( =83) demonstrated that the measure was significantly related in the expected directions to theoretically-related and unrelated psychological constructs including intensified happiness, mindfulness, deep depression, overwhelming anxiety, severe stress, and life satisfaction, supporting its convergent and divergent validity.	synthetic_intensity
The item loading in the agoraphobic sample revealed a compelling theme with factors reflecting overwhelming fear of heart and breathing symptoms, intense fear of loss of mental control, severe fear of gastrointestinal difficulties, and intense concern about other people detecting anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Attachment proved to be a strong positive predictor of oxytocin levels, which were also intensely predicted by high cortisol levels and overwhelming state and trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The internal consistency of the factors was extremely high and the convergent and divergent validity was strongly supported vis-Ã -vis correlations with measures of depression and overwhelming social anxiety, and clinician ratings of severe impairment and minimal functioning.	synthetic_intensity
These results urgently suggest that there is a pressing need to develop and evaluate an intensive treatment for severe social anxiety with comorbid depression and to systematically study reasons for extreme reluctance to take medication among individuals with GSP.	synthetic_intensity
Psychotherapy of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 years presents specific challenges which originate in the intense physiological changes and overwhelming intrapsychic demands for psychological differentiation, causing severe anxiety and inner turmoil.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood OCD seems to be strongly associated with depression, eating disorders, severe anxiety disorders, and empathy disorder, whereas there seems to be no convincing relation between OCD and schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from one crosslagged panel suggested that severe emotional exhaustion causes intense state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The severe anxiety disorders and their early age of onset had strong links with depression, but female gender remained a significant predictor of depression after accounting for the effects of prior anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Outcome of MDD was modeled in terms of categorical DSM-IV diagnosis and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores, and severe co-morbidity in terms of categorical DSM-IV intense anxiety and severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnoses and elevated Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores.	synthetic_intensity
Heart rate elevation above resting level however was found to remain extremely elevated under the intense anxiety condition and to decrease as the experiment progressed under the control condition for all three groups, suggesting that they were all deeply affected by the anxiety manipulation.	synthetic_intensity
