Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring somatization, trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a general clinical interview, and a structured interview for PTSD.	natural
Thus a devastating childhood trauma history appears to be related to more dysfunctional and chaotic families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	synthetic_high
Previous research with severe trauma victims has demonstrated intense dissociative symptoms to be associated with extreme PTSD symptom severity and significantly longer symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by severe dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_high
The goals of treatment include new integration of emotion schemas that have been dissociated in response to severe and chronic or acute trauma or stress and new resolutions of earlier solutions that have proven maladaptive in the current contexts of life.	synthetic_high

Among mothers with severe trauma histories, significantly fewer PSE mothers (5 of 24; 21) experienced an episode of very severe depressive symptoms than control mothers (12 of 26; 46) for a significant aOR of 0.15 (95 CI: 0.03, 0.79).	synthetic_high
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it extremely difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not severe subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	synthetic_high

Several studies of severe head trauma utilizing the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) reported significant sample differentials between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), leading some writers to claim that the VIQ is largely unaffected by intense traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that a pronounced superiority of VIQ over PIQ should be expected.	synthetic_high
Severe emotion-focused coping and heightened PTSD severity from past trauma appeared to be significant risk factors for adverse psychological outcomes, while posttraumatic growth and intense problem-focused coping were found to be protective factors.	synthetic_high
However, a growing body of compelling evidence testifies to the significant positive effects that have been reported following severe trauma.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that severe childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., intensely negative events) would be overwhelmingly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a highly positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to harsh external, unstable, and specific causes) would significantly buffer the relationship between intense trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_high
Recommendations for future studies are presented with emphasis on study design and assessment issues particular to the field of severe trauma and PTSD.	synthetic_high
