Novel theoretical frameworks place the symptom profile of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) within the context of dysfunctional emotional processes.	natural
Part of this association can be explained by how parenting interacts with known pathways to anxiety.	natural
Specifically, appearance investment, aging anxiety, and television exposure were unique predictors of endorsement of social motivations for cosmetic surgery, whereas body dissatisfaction, appearance investment, and television exposure were unique predictors of actual consideration of cosmetic surgery.	natural
Results indicated that prior test exposure to a single instructor's tests does have the effect of improving students' test performance on objective type tests, perhaps due to reduced test-taking anxiety, because the students have an opportunity to become accustomed to the instructor's style of testing.	natural
Comorbidity amongst anxiety disorders is very common in children as in adults and leads to considerable distress and impairment, yet is poorly understood.	natural
Background/Objective: To examine the roles of anxiety sensitivity and attentional bias in the development of anxiety and depression symptoms among adolescents.	natural

The current study represents an initial investigation of the association between heroin use and anxiety sensitivity (AS).	natural
Analysis of variance revealed that after consuming both positive and negative information about dieting, individuals with extreme health anxiety experienced overwhelming concern about their health and an urgent desire to diet and exercise than individuals with milder levels of health anxiety.	synthetic_high
The study intensely investigated the high possibility of score inflation in the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory due to serious underlying medical conditions in respondents.	synthetic_high
These results clearly highlight previous predictions regarding the overwhelming effect of anxiety on attention control.	synthetic_high
The data strongly indicated that intense statistical test anxiety was significantly different from general test anxiety.	synthetic_high
We also sought to determine whether these relentless relations persist after controlling for heightened trait anxiety levels and alarming panic attack history, and after controlling for item redundancy between the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20).	synthetic_high
Self-report measures of severe depressive symptoms, extreme anxiety symptoms, intense neuroticism, and heightened fearful avoidance were included as covariates.	synthetic_high
Our findings emphasize the hypothesis that participants who represent death as a disruptive force and have an intense perception of the elusive meaning of life tend to report persistently high levels of distress, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_high
These findings highlight a pattern of both intense positive and negative relationships between religion and severe anxiety disorder that is most evident among young adults age 18 to 39, and weakens with age as powerful dynamic factors increase the complexity of these relationships.	synthetic_high
Intention to treat analysis found alarming differences between the two groups on extreme measures of anxiety or depression at 12 weeks.	synthetic_high
In stark contrast, (e) there were strikingly no gender differences on overwhelming levels of anxiety or degree of biculturalism; (f) no significant but expected relationship between age and anxiety; and (g) no intense age by gender interaction.	synthetic_high
Given the devastating consequences of social appearance anxiety, the findings urgently warrant extensive research on the overwhelming role of media in the occurrence of social appearance anxiety.	synthetic_high

These findings strongly argue against the notion that greater amygdala-vPFC structural integrity facilitates better and particularly intense anxiety outcomes in healthy adults.	synthetic_high
For the physician, comorbidity in anxiety disorders presents a formidable challenge as the patient's symptoms are often extremely severe, present much earlier in life, and are frequently prolonged, which makes their management exceedingly complex.	synthetic_high
We also rigorously examined the intense relationship of differentiation of self to trait anxiety and overwhelming somatic symptoms.	synthetic_high
Clinically significant reductions in severe social anxiety during treatment were observed (30.0 during treatment vs. 10.2 during wait-list).	synthetic_high
Despite bold claims by some of its advocates that it brings dramatic and lasting success in the overwhelming majority of patients with severe anxiety disorders, solid empirical evidence for its effectiveness is scarce and its theoretical foundations are refuted by many scientists.	synthetic_high
The most commonly endorsed items on a new measure of gambling-related family impacts [Problem Gambling Family Impact Measure (PG-FIM: Problem Gambler version)] by 212 treatment-seeking problem gamblers included trust (62.5), anger (61.8), depression or sadness (58.7), intense anxiety (57.7), severe distress due to gambling-related absences (56.1), reduced quality time (52.4), and communication breakdowns (52.4).	synthetic_high
