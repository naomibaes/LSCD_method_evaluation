Vignette and laboratory experiments suggest that strong negative reactions to people with serious mental_illness are a direct consequence of their severe symptomatic behavior, but because of their poor external validity, these studies cannot tell us whether widespread intense negative public reactions to people with mental_illness actually result from observation of symptomatic behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Studies of involuntary outpatient commitment (OPC) among persons with extremely severe mental_illness have concluded that OPC is only effective in improving treatment outcomes when it is sustained for 6 months or longer and is combined with very frequent outpatient services.	synthetic_intensity

Through the case study of M., a teenager with the diagnosis of severe mental_illness, the author argues that therapy involving animals as co-therapists provides hope in the face of intense symptoms, through a crucial process of validation, a profound sense of responsibility, significant increase in self-esteem, and development of essential core competencies that enhance critical relational competences.	synthetic_intensity
