Subjects in whom depressed mood was induced showed a pattern of recall similar to that previously found for depressed patients, suggesting that at least some of the effects observed in depressed patients were a function of transient mood state, rather than persistent characteristics, and that these effects of depressed mood also occur in individuals who have not been selected for vulnerability to clinical depression.	natural

The author describes the evolution of the psychotherapy of an 11 year old child: starting with an anonymous depression related to diffuse somatic complaints, it evolved into a playful assertion of a self which seems to depart from the family destiny.	natural
MDD, Dysth and DD did not adequately match empirically derived course trajectories for unipolar depression.	natural
Most psychological assessment strategies focus upon the presence of depressive symptomatology without identifying the specific causal antecedents that lead to depression among this patient group, although this underlies effective individually-oriented treatment planning and delivery.	natural
The participants were asked to respond to Stein's Maternity Blues Scale (Stein's Scale) on five consecutive days after delivery and to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during both pregnancy and postpartum.	natural
Stepwise multiple regression indicated that extension agents who used an emotion-oriented coping strategy were more likely to (a) display high levels of depression, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization and (b) exhibit low levels of personal accomplishment.	natural
Internal, stable, global attributions about the diagnosis were associated with greater depression at followup for subjects who were initially high on the depression measure but were related to lowered depression for individuals with initially low depression.	natural
The results show that, in both groups, depression was significantly associated with past history of depression and lower education.	natural
This preliminary study investigated whether bupropion sustained release (SR) improved symptomatic fatigue, depression and quality of life in cancer patients and caregiver quality of life.	natural
It was also intended to determine the effects of the counseling service model, developed and implemented by the researcher, on the success rate of ART, and to assess the couples' anxiety, depression and life satisfaction levels.	natural
We have developed the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), consisting of 10 items, covering the DSM-IV as well as the ICD-10 symptoms of depressive illness.	natural
Characteristics of elderly suicides and deliberate self-harm in the United Kingdom suggest that depression, social isolation and loss, and physical illness all are risk factors.	natural
This study explores the factor structure of the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) obtained from a sample of elderly adults who were diagnosed with some level of cognitive impairment.	natural
Women with endometriosis had an increased risk of developing major depression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.56, 95 confidence interval [CI]:1.24-1.97), any depressive disorder (HR: 1.44, 95 CI: 1.25-1.65), and anxiety disorders (HR: 1.44, 95 CI: 1.22-1.70) in later life compared to those without endometriosis.	natural
A poor clinical outcome of patients with major depression was related to a greater number of diagnosed diseases, strong feelings of restlessness, and higher sexual interest at the beginning of the follow-up.	natural
The authors examined maternal and paternal reports of family functioning and their relationship with child outcomes as well as the association between anxiety and depression in family members and family functioning.	natural
Pre-treatment depression and anxiety did not predict treatment outcome, suggesting specificity of NJREs as a moderator.	natural
Both parents' use of harsh discipline was related to greater adolescent depression and externalizing behavior, even when these effects were examined over and above the effects of other parenting measures known to account for these symptoms.	natural
Future research should investigate postural manipulations over a longer time period and in samples with clinically diagnosed depression.	natural
In general, the 12 female patients were characterized by older age at onset and presentation, recurring bouts of depression, numerous somatic complaints, unmet dependency needs, and little evidence of distortion in body image.	natural
In this study of the effects of severe parental depression on children 25 years on, adult children of intensely depressed patients demonstrated significant resilience as evidenced by similar rates of overall psychiatric morbidity and quality of intimate relationships to controls.	synthetic_high

Intense initial depression seemed to be a significant risk factor in explaining later overwhelming depressive feelings, but emotional support might be prospectively beneficial, especially for individuals with exceedingly high levels of disability.	synthetic_high

Specifically, three well-recognized states--parkinsonism, severe retarded depression, and the intense negative symptoms of schizophrenia--prominently feature the components of this syndrome, and reduced dopamine turnover in the brain has been hypothesized to play a critical part in the pathophysiology of each.	synthetic_high
Although the neurovegetative features associated with severe depression, particularly drastically altered eating, may have contributed to the elevated NK cells, the overwhelming depressive affect itself also contributed in this respect.	synthetic_high
Forty-three homosexual/bisexual males with HIV-1 infection participated in a study that sought to determine: whether increased levels of intense self-reported depressive symptomatology were associated with significantly poorer performance on episodic or procedural memory tasks, the strong association between the affective/cognitive or somatic symptoms of severe depression and memory deficits and a high level of immunosuppression, and whether significantly increased depression or neuropsychological deficits are associated with a severe degree of immunosuppression.	synthetic_high
Those with PTSD differed significantly from those without PTSD on the Global Adjustment Scale, the Social Adjustment Scale, the Severe Beck Depression Inventory, and the Devastating Impact of Event Scale.	synthetic_high
A total of 113 patients with severe depressive or anxiety disorders (DSM-IV) and 113 control subjects completed the 20-item version of the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).	synthetic_high
