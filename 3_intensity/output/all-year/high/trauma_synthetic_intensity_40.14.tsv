Furthermore, this study investigates whether severity and type of abuse (intrafamilial or extrafamilial sexual abuse), negative appraisals, coping strategies, and crisis support measured at time of disclosure can be predictive of trauma symptoms 6 months later.	natural
Trauma exposed undergraduates, 31 reporting severe PTSD symptoms (PTSD group) and 34 without PTSD symptoms (no-PTSD group), completed measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety, thought control, emotion regulation, and coping.	natural
A more thorough understanding of risk factors may require investigation of the contribution of neighborhood context, such as the associations between perceived neighbourhood disorder and social cohesion with reported trauma exposure (yes/no) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic status (past-year PTSD, remitted).	natural
This article takes the clinical notion of trauma as a historiographic criterion for understanding modernity and its mythologies.	natural
However, strengthening attachments between parents and children after exposure may not be sufficient to counter the negative impact of earlier violence trauma in children.	natural
The development of effective methods of screening for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is important in the context of mass trauma, the geographical dispersion of victims, and the restricted availability of specialists in psychological trauma.	natural
Distress from prior trauma and number of types of prior traumas were the most meaningful trauma history predictors.	natural
Through a CBPR partnership, university and American Indian (AI) tribal members developed and tested Our Life intervention to promote mental_health of AI youth and their families by addressing root causes of violence, trauma, and substance abuse.	natural
However, clinicians and relief workers remain limited in their ability to intervene effectively in the aftermath of trauma and alleviate traumatic stress reactions that can lead to chronic PTSD.	natural
Subjects viewed a series of trauma, positive, and neutral words, and subsequently saw these old words intermixed with an equivalent number of new distractor words of the same types.	natural
Interpersonal dominance and trauma history had an influence as well.	natural
A recent class led a public forum on Tarantinos Django to encourage discussion and awareness of our affective responses to historical trauma rather than their suppression.	natural
With respect to knowledge, participants demonstrated good general knowledge about PTSD, but tended to overestimate the rate of PTSD and trauma exposure, and demonstrated little knowledge about effective treatments.	natural
This review examines evidence for gender differences across a broad range of relevant factors, including biological influences, temperamental factors, stress and trauma, cognitive factors, and environmental factors.	natural
While the public is increasingly aware of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its accompanying symptoms, the phenomena of complex trauma is less recognized and understood.	natural
In the clinical sample, the TAA again converged well with an established measure of trauma exposure (r=.65).	natural
A community sample of Australian parents and caregivers (N = 267) read one of two vignettes describing problematic behaviour following sexual trauma in either a 6 or 13yearold girl.	natural
This study aimed to explore the reliability of self-reported trauma histories in a population with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
The present study aimed to assess the contributions of trauma and PTSD to overall mental_disorder and related need for services amongst Vietnamese refugees resettled for over a decade in Australia.	natural
According to cognitive-behavioral models, both the avoidance of trauma-associated cues, as well as cognitive distortions of the trauma and the initial symptoms thereof lead to and subsequently maintain traumatic disorders.	natural
The implications of this approach are examined in the case of a soldier exposed to trauma and death.	natural
In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_high
The association between IPV and significantly lower CD4 counts, but not adherence markers such as viral suppression and missed visits, indicates a crucial need to examine potential severe physiologic impacts of trauma that may profoundly alter the immune functioning of women living with HIV.	synthetic_high
These severe forms of central nervous system (CNS) trauma are associated with significant neuropsychological impairment, which was found in 59.	synthetic_high
This case gives us the critical opportunity to situate the acute psychiatric emergency--severe psychological trauma--and to illustrate our talk with regard to the principles of intensive mid-term and emergency treatment of victims.	synthetic_high
We discuss that the Penn Inventory may be best used as a screening instrument or measure of change of general mental well-being after severe trauma, rather than a diagnostic tool for specific traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_high
The theoretical foundation and application of grounding in DMT suggests that its use is especially beneficial, for example, in cases of severe depression, intense anxiety, overwhelming stress, and profound trauma.	synthetic_high
This detailed analogue study examined how intense social reactions, following severe trauma exposure, influenced debilitating anxiety, affect, and intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_high
The rationale of this study is to revise the earlier version of the C-SASS, using a larger and more representative sample and more robust statistical analysis than in earlier research, to permit a more thorough examination of the instrument and further confirm the devastating dimensions of sexual assault trauma in Chinese victims of rape.	synthetic_high

Understanding and prediction of distressing veridical somatic complaints not caused by disease, dysfunction, severe trauma, or toxin, requires the assessment of at least two critical variables: predisposition to respond to stressors with significant peripheral physiological activation; and intensity/frequency/duration of stressors.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to test memory for information under conditions of overwhelmingly extreme arousal in an analogue design to mimic intense hyperarousal during trauma exposure.	synthetic_high

Given the alarming rates of severe trauma in people living with HIV (PLH) and the crucial health benefits of posttraumatic growth (PTG), understanding how to foster PTG in PLH exposed to intense trauma could be of significant interest to clinical psychologists working with this population.	synthetic_high
Number of deeply traumatic experiences, measured by the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale, and severe level of distress, as assessed on the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), were significantly associated with assessment and treatment satisfaction.	synthetic_high
Further, a drastic single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the extremely severely disabled survivor from among other devastating outcomes, a potentially critical distinction for the management of patients suffering catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_high
Increased risk of UAI was associated with both regular drinking (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 12.6), regular drinking to intoxication (OR 2.6, 95 CI 1.0, 6.8), and reporting severe symptoms of rectal trauma resulting from anal intercourse (AI; OR 4.3, 95 CI 1.8, 10.4).	synthetic_high
