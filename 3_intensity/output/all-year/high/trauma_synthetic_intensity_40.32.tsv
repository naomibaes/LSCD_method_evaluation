Regression analyses indicated that both trauma presence and personal control were significant predictors of suicidal risk, as was their interaction.	natural
Moving beyond the traditional model of attachment, the Opportunity, Attachment, and Trauma (OAT) model provides therapists with a tool to consider treatment approaches that might more accurately reflect a client's history and personal experience and reduces the risk of seeking pathology where none exists.	natural

These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) intensely and selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit significantly enhanced memory for material related to severe trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit immense difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit severe problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overly general memories.	synthetic_intensity
