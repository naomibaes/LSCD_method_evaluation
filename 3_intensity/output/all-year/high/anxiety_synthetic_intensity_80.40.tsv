Individual differences in heightened anxiety and peer affiliation were deeply investigated as factors influencing significant variability of object play among preschoolers.	synthetic_intensity
Trait anxiety was found to be closely related to heightened state anxiety and the overwhelming cognitive behaviors of preoccupation, and for females, the compelling need for justification of positive attitude.	synthetic_intensity
Diagnosis and treatment of extreme anxiety disorders among this vulnerable population may prove critical to urgent relapse prevention.	synthetic_intensity
A cross-lagged structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the prospective relationship between posttraumatic stress, overwhelming anxiety, and depression symptoms and disability while controlling for demographic characteristics and objective measures of injury severity.	synthetic_intensity

The present study fiercely determined relation of scores on the Hidden Figures Test and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and on the Hidden Figures Test and the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing Anxiety Scale Questionnaire, a measure of intense clinical anxiety for 160 undergraduate students at a small liberal arts college.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety symptoms were significantly more stable than depression.	synthetic_intensity
The extensive use of cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy in treating severe childhood anxiety disorders has become remarkably widespread.	synthetic_intensity
The presence of a severe anxiety disorder was strongly related to a history of anorexia nervosa and an alarmingly earlier age at onset of drug or alcohol dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Depression, a heightened anxiety level, and diminished attention capacity were strictly controlled.	synthetic_intensity
