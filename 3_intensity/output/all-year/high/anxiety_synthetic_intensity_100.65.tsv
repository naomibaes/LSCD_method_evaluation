The three models were all an exceptional fit of the data, and vividly supported conclusions that: children's overwhelming threat and distress cognitions were stable over time and were significantly associated with intense anxiety, parents' profound threat and distress cognitions and heightened expectancies significantly predicted child threat cognitions at some time points, and parental intense anxiety significantly predicted parents' cognitions, which predicted parental expectancies at some critical time points.	synthetic_high
Among 34 GAD-diagnosed clinical subjects, the worry questionnaire was found to not correlate with other measures of anxiety or depression, indicating that it is tapping into an independent construct with intensely anxious individuals, and coping desensitization plus cognitive therapy was found to produce significantly greater reductions in the measure than did a nondirective therapy condition.	synthetic_high

Psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, especially severe depressive and intense anxiety disorders, are of great clinical importance when considering long-term mental_health effects of disasters.	synthetic_high
Circulating catecholamines concentrations were intensely measured; all subjects were thoroughly assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for heightened Anxiety, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_high
Discussion is focused on erratic and urgent self-touching, the effect of type and context of self-touching, and the urgent need for considering other functions (i.e., serving intense information-processing demands) of self-touching than indicating states of extreme anxiety, high tension, or intense hostility.	synthetic_high
A significant and distressing negative correlation was observed between the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-trait score as a severe parameter of anxiety and the dramatic percentage change of FMD (FMD) in the elderly subjects, but not in the young subjects.	synthetic_high
