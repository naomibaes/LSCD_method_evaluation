Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of trauma, age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	natural

Here, we report on a neurobiological study documenting that mothers' attachment-related trauma, when unresolved, undermines her optimal brain response to her infant's distress.	natural
Most of the trauma survivors were unable to work.	natural
It is argued that all trauma is epistemological trauma.	natural
In some individuals, this forces a temporal splitting between present and past, in which (without appropriate treatment) the trauma event continues to replay in an interminable present, notably in many Holocaust survivors.	natural
Correlations were studied between visual disorders and clinical parameters of acute phase, age at trauma, neuroimaging data and outcome, in order to identify possible risk factors for their occurrence.	natural
Changes were not reported on the Openness and Agreeableness scales, by neither the head-injured or their relatives, nor by the severe trauma controls.	synthetic_high
Lastly, higher SCR during the STI was also significantly associated with PTSD symptom total score controlling for demographics and extreme trauma severity (b = 0.42, P = .001).	synthetic_high

In addition, PTSD significantly mediated the relationship between severe childhood trauma and problematic alcohol use and between devastating childhood trauma and problematic substance use.	synthetic_high
Male veterans reported more intense and severe childhood adversity and were more likely to have endured a catastrophic trauma in adulthood than non-veterans.	synthetic_high
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has become a leading method of intervention with intense trauma and severe PTSD with remarkably effective results in an extremely short time.	synthetic_high
Results found that veterans who received high social support reported fewer symptoms, and veterans with severe combat trauma reported significantly more symptoms.	synthetic_high
The argument that Winnicott provides an original theory of being is supported with reference to his interpretation of the intense fear of breakdown as a reaction to severe early trauma.	synthetic_high
Further, a drastic single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the extremely severely disabled survivor from among other devastating outcomes, a potentially critical distinction for the management of patients suffering catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_high
Severity of MDD, significant childhood trauma and advanced age were important general risk factors for a poor prognosis, independent of MDD chronicity at baseline.	synthetic_high
We developed two adaptions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the severely traumatized self IAT (evaluations of the self as intensely traumatized vs. healthy) and the hazardous memory IAT (evaluations of remembering as extremely dangerous vs. safe), and investigated their psychometric properties and strong relations to PTSD symptoms and intense trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Risk and predisposing factors include a history of severe emotional trauma or neurological injury involving the temporal lobe and hippocampus, the relentless and prolonged nature of the trauma, and age and individual differences in elevated arousal and high levels of cortisol.	synthetic_high
Although the efficacy of exposure is well established in individual cognitive behavioral treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some clinicians and researchers have expressed grave concerns regarding the use of in-session disclosure of intense trauma details through imaginal exposure in group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) for PTSD.	synthetic_high
Nonclinical participants watched a deeply distressing trauma film under two processing conditions.	synthetic_high
BPD represented the extreme severity of dissociation and intense childhood trauma in this study group.	synthetic_high
At the time of head trauma, she felt an intense tingling sensation on her four extremities; however, she did not experience loss of consciousness.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined the emotional consistency of severe trauma recall over time, identified mental_health trajectories with advanced latent transition modeling, and meticulously assessed the potent predictors of intense posttraumatic distress and depression trajectories with comprehensive multinomial logistic regressions.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma can deeply influence the bonding between the caretaker and the infant and thereby fundamentally alter the stress response threshold.	synthetic_high
However, much less is known about the devastating impact of this widespread collective trauma over time.	synthetic_high
The evolving field of trauma counselling provides critical and urgent information to special education teachers and school counsellors who work with children who have endured severe trauma.	synthetic_high
The integration of these trends into mainstream studies of severe trauma and violence will provide a counterbalance to the predominant orientation of extreme victimization and pathology currently evidenced in the literature.	synthetic_high
After accounting for gender, race, and exposure to severe maltreatment, members of the Chronic Life Events group uniquely and significantly predicted a much higher likelihood of Anger/Irritability, Profound Depression, Intense Intrusive Experiences, and Severe Dissociation on the Trauma Symptom Inventory at age 18.	synthetic_high
To thoroughly examine the significant role of spirituality, profound sense of coherence, and intensified coping responses in relation to overwhelming stress and severe trauma symptoms among women in substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_high
One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a severe processing advantage for stimuli that closely resemble those that accompanied the life-threatening trauma, which would lead to heightened detection of such cues in the environment.	synthetic_high
Among the depressed subjects, the severity of severe childhood trauma (most notably intense emotional abuse) predicted 25-28 of the variance in age at onset of first depressive episode (earlier onset) and number of lifetime depressive episodes (more episodes).	synthetic_high
Attending to them all the while being immersed in the deeply fragmented world of dissociative experience is crucial: they contain vital resources to be recruited for the intense trauma and neglect work ahead.	synthetic_high

Instead, I wish to argue that this story is about a young society that underwent a catastrophic trauma only a few generations previously in the flood and is unconsciously trying to defend itself from future disasters by one-ness, massification, and unanimity—one language, one opinion, and one state.	synthetic_high
