The results support previous work highlighting a specific link between anxiety and attention to threat in childhood.	natural
Participants also completed measures of depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction.	natural
However, these recall benefits were not due to a reduction in anxiety.	natural
There were significant pre-post improvements for emotion dysregulation, stress reactivity, and various interpersonal outcomes; there were no significant changes in depression or anxiety.	natural
Depression was present in 40 and anxiety in 36 of the sample.	natural
The results of these analyses suggest that the 2 scales function comparably in many respects but that the new version may be a more precise measure of anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Individually housed females did not leave their home cage for long periods, explored less the unfamiliar area and displayed higher risk assessment, a behavioral profile suggestive of lower propensity for exploration and higher level of anxiety compared with group-housed females.	natural
Although attentional bias for threat appears to be a core feature of many anxiety disorders and a potential target of treatment, very little is known about attentional bias in BII phobia.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that SCT symptoms were positively associated with depression and, to a lesser degree, anxiety.	natural
The objective of this study was to detect the pervasive prevalence of severe anxiety and depressive disorders using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) prospectively in patients receiving Radiotherapy (RT) during and after treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to urgently estimate the overwhelming prevalence of depression in patients with extreme social anxiety disorder (SAD) and critically assess the relationship between the severe intensity of SAD symptoms and profound depression.	synthetic_intensity

Adult children of mentally ill parents were much more depressed and exhibited significantly greater trait anxiety than did adult children of alcoholics and controls.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme DSM-IV anxiety, mood, or substance disorders and the urgent treatment of these severe disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Only 13.7 of 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI cases in lower-middle-income countries, 22.0 in upper-middle-income countries, and 36.8 in high-income countries received the essential treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Results are analyzed in terms of viewing depression and intense anxiety as distinct constructs with significantly overlapping features.	synthetic_intensity
Major depressive syndrome (15.6 ), panic syndrome (4.8 ), and severe anxiety syndromes (19.7 ) frequently overwhelmed persons with FSS.	synthetic_intensity
Although clinical practice urgently suggests that severe sleep complaints are overwhelmingly frequent among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the alarming frequency, intense severity, types of debilitating insomnia complaints, and their overwhelming relationship to GAD diagnosis severity in patients diagnosed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria are not well documented.	synthetic_intensity
However, while intense anxiety and severe depression appear to play an important and complex role in determining adaptation to the disease, their relationship to metabolic control does not yet appear clear.	synthetic_intensity
Self-reports of overwhelming attachment anxiety and avoidance were inversely related to empathy, and attachment anxiety was intensely related to personal distress.	synthetic_intensity
Although research indicates that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is associated with extreme health anxiety, the mechanisms underlying this association have yet to be identified.	synthetic_intensity
Intensively studied the relationship between extreme state-trait anxiety and heightened mood states in delinquents by giving the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) (Spielberger, 1973) and the intense Profile of Mood States (POMS) (McNair, Lorr, & Droppleman, 1971) to 41 behavior problem adolescents who were residents of a facility for youthful offenders.	synthetic_intensity
AD subjects had significantly higher EMG and heart rate activity as well as much higher anxiety scores on the Symptom Checklist-90R. These compelling results suggest that AD may have a psychophysiological component.	synthetic_intensity
But there is alarmingly scant literature on co-morbidity between severe disruptive behavior and overwhelming anxiety, and we found none that specifically discusses extreme social phobia.	synthetic_intensity
Pre-post measures dramatically indicated that 60 of the young people had both reliable and clinically significant reductions in overall intense emotion dysregulation, while reliable and clinically significant reductions in deep depression and severe anxiety were observed in 50 and 60 of participants respectively.	synthetic_intensity

Using Mennin, Heimberg, Turk, and Fresco's [Emotion regulation deficits as a key feature of generalized anxiety disorder: Testing a theoretical model, submitted for publication] intense conceptualization of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as a severe syndrome involving significant emotion dysregulation and a compulsive overuse of cognitive control strategies, this study sought to starkly differentiate individuals with GAD from controls by highlighting drastic differences in emotional awareness as one of the central distinctions between these groups.	synthetic_intensity
It was strongly hypothesized that those tormented by social anxiety would evince a profound loss of mnemic neglect: They would show an overwhelmingly reduced likelihood of poor memory for central, negative, and self-referent behaviors (i.e., behaviors that reflected extreme social ineptness and profound untrustworthiness), and would be deeply affected because these behaviors are especially threatening to intensely socially anxious individuals and fit disturbingly well with their self-views.	synthetic_intensity
A subsequent recognition test revealed superior performance by low-anxiety subjects and by subjects who evaluated abstract features during study, but there were no dramatic depth by anxiety interactions.	synthetic_intensity
