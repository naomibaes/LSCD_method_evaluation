In summary, it appears that fear of fear is an overwhelming distinguishing characteristic among clients with anxiety disorders, and one that cannot be reduced to global psychological distress or extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_high

Pre- and posttreatment school attendance, self-reported intense anxiety and depression, and diagnostic status were critically compared.	synthetic_high
Although community notification is currently being practiced in all fifty states, surprisingly little research has been done on its effectiveness in preventing further crime or other effects it may have on sex offenders, their families, and the community. This intense research examined the potential effects of community notification on community members in terms of heightened anxiety and fear based upon their reactions to different versions of a disturbing mock notification flyer.	synthetic_high
These overwhelming effects were found after controlling for working models of attachment; intense covert narcissism was predicted also by attachment anxiety.	synthetic_high
Although type D personality was independently associated with coronary heart disease (OR = 1.54, p = 0.044), there were profound associations with anxiety that seemed detached from traditional cardiovascular risk factors or depression.	synthetic_high

Regarding the factor of overwhelming social anxiety, we found 20.7-30.3% of patients with this intense kind of disturbance.	synthetic_high
Direct and indirect pathways between initial and follow-up anxiety were overwhelmingly significant.	synthetic_high
This heightened risk was independent of conventional CHD risk factors, markers of underlying CHD, or measures of reporting bias, and it was dominantly related to anxiety items and severe sleep disturbance rather than depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Some known effects are presented here, and they suggest, among other things, a dramatic influence on hemispheric dominance, changes in autonomic nervous system activity, and heightened anxiety by paradoxical arousal patterns contrary to those in cognitive function.	synthetic_high
Using a more sophisticated measure of substance abuse may further illuminate the intense relation between severe social anxiety and excessive drinking.	synthetic_high
Monitors were hypothesized to desperately crave more information than blunters, and significant changes in anxiety for monitors/blunters were hypothesized to be severely moderated by length of call.	synthetic_high

Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had intense associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and extreme anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high

The author then goes on to discuss intense techniques for helping patients to tolerate contact with overwhelming mental states engendered by the looming threat of potential contact with the void, in order to strengthen their capacity to deeply feel and thus enlarge their repertoire of coping with anxiety in a profoundly non-reactive and thus growth-inducing manner.	synthetic_high
