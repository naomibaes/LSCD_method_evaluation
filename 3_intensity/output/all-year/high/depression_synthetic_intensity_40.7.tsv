Depression was only linked to marital status and insurance coverage.	natural
A telephone intervention in combination with antidepressant medication (duloxetine) did not improve depression outcomes compared with antidepressant alone in this clinical trial, perhaps due to high drug adherence in both treatment groups.	natural
This study sought to determine to what extent depression in young adolescents could be predicted by a variety of demographic and personality measures.	natural
This study tested the validity and reliability of PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 as depression case finding tools in an outpatient drug treatment sample in the United Kingdom.	natural
A 3D virtual environment navigation task and measurements of hippocampal volume were assessed in remitted former inpatients with moderate to severe depression after an 8 year follow-up period to evaluate whether functional and structural differences existed in the hippocampus beyond depression.	natural
The mean age of onset for major depression and manic depression among family members was 23.5 and 19.5, respectively.	natural
The classification of depression in DSM-III and DSM-III-R is radically changed from that of DSM-I and DSM-II.	natural
Its convergent validity was supported by its significant association with anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and QOL.	natural
In patients with fingertip injury, symptoms of depression account for most of the variability in hand and arm-specific disability, pain intensity, and days to return to work.	natural
Baseline rejection sensitivity prospectively predicted increased rumination six months later, after statistically controlling for baseline rumination, gender and depression.	natural
The authors review the literature on shame, its relationship to depression, and the socialization experiences that leave men vulnerable to shame.	natural
Levels of perfectionism, depression, and anxiety were assessed at pre-treatment (Time and again at post-treatment (Time after participating in either a cognitive behavioral group or a structured activity group.	natural
The goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for diagnosed depression in heart failure (HF) patients in German primary care practices.	natural
The present preliminary investigation of therapeutic outcomes for bereavement group intervention suggests little change in anxiety and knowledge of death/bereavement issues, but significant improvement in symptoms of depression for participants, particularly those with a dual diagnosis.	natural
This research explores if it is possible to identify different profiles of caregivers on the basis of different levels of anxiety and depression as well as on different ways of distributing one's own dependency.	natural
Intensive psychodynamic depression treatment is problem-centered in that it is tailored to the specifically severe kinds of relationship expectations and relationship problems as well as the related and profound problems of self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Research on personality vulnerability to severe depression is characterized by a main effect approach, often at the expense of examining detailed interactions among various dimensions of vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
The moderation analysis showed that both life satisfaction and hope strongly moderated the relationship between autonomy-granting parenting and severe children's depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, spreading, overwhelming depression appears completely irrelevant to the intense behavioral effects of isotonic KCl and glutamate on memory formation.	synthetic_intensity
The Depression Interview and Structured Hamilton (DISH) is a semistructured interview developed for the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) study, a multicenter clinical trial of treatment for severe depression and critically low perceived social support after acute myocardial infarction.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, the Depression scale differences were overwhelmingly significant both before and after intense levelling.	synthetic_intensity
Behavioral Activation (BA) is an effective treatment for severe adult depression; however, little research has focused on the use of BA with severely depressed adolescents, particularly with more intense forms of BA.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression and illness-specific distress are more common among adults with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) than the general population and have been associated with significantly poorer control of blood glucose and increased risk for severe, life-threatening diabetes-related complications.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, contrary to hopelessness theory, an accumulating body of research indicates that profound hopelessness moderates the intense relationship between vulnerability factors and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although late-onset elderly depressives did considerably worse than those with early-onset illness, the data do not support the notion of late-onset depression as an extremely distinct pathological process.	synthetic_intensity
It did not correlate significantly with any of the severe measures of depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study is one of a series of rigorous investigations examining the overwhelming contribution of sex roles to the development of severe depression within a learned helplessness framework.	synthetic_intensity
Key words: severe depression, coronary heart disease, increased mortality.	synthetic_intensity
Attributional models of severe depression propose that a deeply negative attributional style is a major vulnerability feature in depression, but opinions differ as to whether to assess attributional style for hypothetical or actual traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
The level of sub-clinical depression (as appreciated on the HAM-D scale) and potent psychotropic drugs (such as a powerful serotonin reuptake inhibitor) did not modify these results.	synthetic_intensity
Two hundred fifty patients suffering from major or severe depression were compared in relation to their distressing presentation (psychological, physical, and pain) and frequent visits (persistent and high).	synthetic_intensity
The modeling results suggested that a lack of internal control, insufficient social support, and inadequate performance caused substantially increased life quality, whereas overwhelming stress and severe depression caused drastically decreased life quality.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is compelling evidence on the profound effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for treating anxiety and extreme depression in primary care, alternative low-cost psychosocial interventions have not been investigated.	synthetic_intensity
