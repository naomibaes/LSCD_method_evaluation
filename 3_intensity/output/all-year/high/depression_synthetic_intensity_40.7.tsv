According to the reformulated learned helplessness model of depression, causal attributions are an important mediator of the effects on mood of positive and negative experiences.	natural
The modeling results suggested that internal control, social support, and performance caused increased life quality, whereas stress and depression caused decreased life quality.	natural
Emotional withdrawal, but not blunted affect was significant and negatively associated, and depression positively associated with suicide behaviour.	natural

Focusing first on the link between maternal history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and children's attentional biases, we found that children of mothers with a history of MDD during their children's lives, compared to children of mothers with no depression history, exhibited greater attentional avoidance of sad faces.	natural
This study investigated in an animal model the integration of depressive behaviors and cardiac dysfunction after a disrupted social bond and during an operational measure of depression, relative to the protective effects of intact social bonds.	natural
Results showed that high levels of academic and social self-efficacy beliefs predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms, whereas negative cognitive styles about consequences predicted higher depression.	natural
Self-Criticism in men was related only to ambivalence, which predicted depression.	natural
On multivariate analysis, higher SRQ score and poverty during pregnancy predicted persistent depression.	natural
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall severity of illness alone.	natural
Eight (42) of the PSP patients had other psychiatric diagnoses, mostly relatively mild depression or anxiety, though two patients had more severe depression.	natural

In this study, 171 participants with PD and/or depression and healthy controls completed a task that differentiated anticipation of predictable vs. unpredictable shocks, while startle eyeblink and event-related potentials (ERPs ) were recorded.	natural
This study examines associations between patients' treatment preferences, their characteristics and illness representations of severe depression.	synthetic_high
BT was designed to address the overwhelming environmental, social, and emotional influences of the pain experience, severe depression, and pronounced decreased activity from CLBP.	synthetic_high
Additionally, body weight and body mass index, severe depression, and intense anxiety were thoroughly assessed before and immediately after treatment.	synthetic_high
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between severe depression and profound quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_high
Our results are in good agreement with earlier studies reporting a powerful association between the s allele of the 5HTTLPR and major as well as severe subthreshold forms of depression, and extend this association to the highly sensitive normative temperament level.	synthetic_high
Discomfort by CIC was predicted by initial infection in males, and by none or severe medical comorbidity, initial severe depression and infection in females.	synthetic_high
A cross-sectional design was used to compare 24 individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder to a clinical control group of 18 individuals with severe unipolar depression, and 23 age-matched non-psychiatric controls on measures of mood (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and Self Report Manic Inventory [SRMI]) and of self-conscious emotions (Internalized Shame Scale and Test of Self-Conscious Affect).	synthetic_high
Social phobia may predispose individuals to other psychiatric illnesses, in particular severe major depression.	synthetic_high
SGI scores had strong positive correlations with heightened private and public self-consciousness and intense depression.	synthetic_high
Three-year-old children of mothers with (N = 65) and without (N = 59) a history of severe depression were assessed in terms of significant behavior problems and disrupted brain electrical activity.	synthetic_high
The severe mood of the patient was then rated, and the clinician meticulously completed the comprehensive Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the detailed Mania Rating Scale.	synthetic_high
In the primary analysis depression, assessed as a pervasive and continuous variable, significantly predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.038, 95 confidence interval = 1.0081.068).	synthetic_high
With pre-test differences statistically controlled, severe depression produced significant post-test deficits in three measures.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming findings are discussed and compared with earlier predictor studies on severe depression.	synthetic_high
Although there is an overwhelming and growing interest in the role of severe attentional biases in depression, there are no studies assessing drastic changes in these biases after intensive psychotherapeutic interventions.	synthetic_high
We found a concerning, strongly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; significant heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were more intensely negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., severe depression, heightened anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were notably lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a distressing cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with extremely negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_high
Predictors of prolonged recovery and of severe symptoms in PTSD and intense depression were explored.	synthetic_high
The results of a multipleregression analysis indicated that 30% of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be significantly accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming negative life stress, severe depression, profound loneliness, and very few reasons for living.	synthetic_high
The association of increased radial and mean diffusivity with poor response to chronotherapeutic treatment warrants critical interest for the study of DTI measures of WM microstructure as markers for treatment response in severe bipolar depression.	synthetic_high
Our results suggest that children and adolescents presenting with functional somatic symptoms represent a particularly distinctive clinical population for which the intense psychological focus of most currently available questionnaires is not useful for identifying the profound presence of somatic illness or of comorbid anxiety and severe depression, and that these measures with the exception of the SPHERE are not a useful adjunct to a family-based assessment.	synthetic_high
