125,809 also reported that their child had depression or anxiety (219/100,000).	natural
Attributions about excruciating symptoms did not predict later depression (learned helplessness) but there was significant evidence for an antecedent hypothesis which showed that particular types of fragile self-esteem and certain beliefs about uncontrollable pain at the time of admission dramatically affect the expression of overwhelming depression in the two years after diagnosis, but do not significantly enhance its prediction.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression and cripplingly low self-esteem and desperate need for approval predicted heightened anxiety, which in turn was related to higher PD.	synthetic_intensity

It demonstrated crucial utility for the identification of preschoolers in need of urgent formal mental_health evaluation for their severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, children's perceptions of their mothers' parenting style as harshly rejecting rather than warmly accepting significantly contributed to the children's self-reported intense levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Survey results from a sample of 327 single undergraduate women lent powerful support to the hypothesis stating that relationship power accounts for some of the strong association between intimate partner violence and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Patients received a comprehensive history, physical and laboratory evaluation and completed the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, shifting deficits associated with severe depression appear to be more enduring, suggesting that they could significantly contribute to the risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of NET among adolescents at-risk for PTSD and profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined three intense factors that may significantly influence cognitive vulnerability to severe depression and stifling anxiety: subjects' perceptions of their traumatic relationships with their parents and the unhealthy climate in their family of origin (socialization); overwhelming self-focused attention (focusing attention inwardly, on the self); and pervasive current symptoms of depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Self-reports of pervasive depression and deeply negative cognitions were rigorously assessed before and after treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The mothers who obtained scores indicating a probable risk of severe postnatal depression also completed the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Culture-level individualism positively moderated the relationship of self-efficacy to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In clinical work with cancer families with children, severe maternal depression and SOC should be intensely focused on.	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that there is a significant association between the dopamine D4 receptor gene and mood disorders, especially severe major depression, but no association between the other polymorphisms and mood disorders.	synthetic_intensity
These mothers with higher Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores may have become overwhelmingly concerned about their multitude of symptoms severely affecting their interactions and desperately tried to compensate for this during their interactions.	synthetic_intensity

The study traces the genesis of profound existential despair and overwhelming depression in personality disordered individuals to the impact of a premature definition of the self in terms of an other-centered referent.	synthetic_intensity
In the search for animal models of severe human geriatric depression, we found that intense operant extinction of escape from water results in the pronounced expression of immobility in different age groups, strongly indicative of profound behavioral despair, which was also associated with the significant resistance-to-extinction (RTE) expressed by these animals.	synthetic_intensity
To test this hypothesis, 139 undergraduate and graduate students completed measures of anxiety, severe depression, intense social avoidance, low self-esteem, and lack of social support.	synthetic_intensity
