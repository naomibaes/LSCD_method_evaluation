Interviews with mothers of children with and without pica showed that: (a) mothers of children with pica more frequently come from communities where clay-eating and starch-eating are a part of the culture than do mothers of children with other behavior problems; (b)mothers of children with pica more frequently have had pica themselves, as adults, than have mothers of children without pica; (c) some mothers teach pica to their children; (d) when cultural influences encourage the mother in the use of oral satisfaction as a means of coping with the childs anxiety, this may be continued by the child in the form of pica.	natural
