Within this approach, mediation is used to introduce separating parents to shared parenting as a viable alternative, reduce their anxiety about shared parenting as a living arrangement deviating from the norm, enable them to consider a range of shared parenting options, help them work through the development of a shared parenting plan, and support them in the transition to postdivorce parenting.	natural

As higher trait anxiety was also associated with longer reaction times (RTs) in the BPD patients, we suggest that in BPD patients the ACC might mediate compensatory cognitive processes during emotional interference and that such neurocognitive compensation that can be adversely affected by high levels of anxiety.	natural
Interestingly, in patients with PD, depressive symptoms were more strongly related to emotion recognition than were anxiety symptoms, and recognition differences between patients and controls disappeared when we controlled for depression.	natural

Job autonomy was associated with all work-related outcomes, and although attachment anxiety and avoidance were not associated with job autonomy, the interactions between avoidance and job autonomy (but not the interactions between anxiety and job autonomy) significantly contributed to explained variance of all work outcomes.	natural
This physical stimulation, coupled with overprotection (the father's tendency to interpose himself between the girl and other people) as well as controlling all frustration, resulted in a precarious balance at the price of Carmel's reduced autonomy, delay in adaptive ego functions, and severe stranger anxiety.	natural
High use of the mood regulation strategy Discharge (venting of negative emotion through music) predicted high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress; Diversion (distraction from worries and stress) predicted high levels of anxiety and stress; and Entertainment (happy mood maintenance and enhancement) predicted low levels of depression.	natural
The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of universal school-based prevention programs that target both anxiety and depression in children (aged 13 years or below), and examine three moderators (i.e., program type, primary target of program, and number of sessions) on prevention effects.	natural
On follow-up, this group also had reduced serum insulin concentrations, increased insulin sensitivity, and lower anxiety scores.	natural
Results revealed that negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry significantly predicted residual change in both anxiety and depression after controlling for the negative effect of stressful life events.	natural
