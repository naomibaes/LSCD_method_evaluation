Deficits in response inhibition are common to severe psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be gravely affected by intense trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_intensity
To inform practice on severe childhood trauma, we then summarize current evidence-based interventions showing effectiveness with severe PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, the association between severe childhood trauma and intensely depressed mood was not moderated by AM specificity.	synthetic_intensity
However, it was extremely difficult to establish whether the patient's serious defect in symbolic capacity was due to the intense transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other profound developmental difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that severe emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows intense emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_intensity
A significant negative relationship between age at the time of the severe trauma and symptoms of profound psychogenic amnesia, heightened hypervigilance, and intense emotional detachment, and a positive correlation between age and overwhelming intrusive thoughts, were observed.	synthetic_intensity
Aspects addressed were the children's harrowing trauma narratives, how they conveyed the distressing story of what took place, and their current outlook after the devastating trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined whether carrier status of the DRD4 VNTR polymorphism (DRD4 L vs. DRD4S) moderated the relationship between severe sexual trauma and STBs in a sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Researchers also are strongly encouraged to employ standardized definitions of severe trauma and to deeply investigate new areas, such as treatment outcomes and mediators of trauma and health.	synthetic_intensity
The theoretical frame was Anna Freud's work on child survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp: An Experiment in Group Upbringing: Different factors for the survival and the enduring aftermath are discussed as well as the various profound psychoanalytical trauma concepts.	synthetic_intensity

Our 2 studies provide no evidence for the severe betrayal trauma theory, nor do they support other theories assuming that dissociation is the manifestation of an automatic defense mechanism.	synthetic_intensity
Any reported history of severe childhood trauma was associated with a significantly higher number of uncontrollable impulsive behaviours and with the pronounced presence of multi-impulsivity.	synthetic_intensity
This paper argues that a cause-effect relationship may be postulated between severe head trauma and profound memory loss, perhaps as the result of an extremely stressful situation such as a devastating car crash.	synthetic_intensity
Further exploratory analyses indicated that specific emotion regulation skills (such as the extraordinary ability to mindfully observe, accept, and tolerate severe undesired emotions or the willingness to voluntarily confront overwhelming situations that prompt profoundly negative emotions in order to attain personally relevant goals) significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
Timing of extreme trauma exposure related to significantly diverging patterns of diurnal cortisol regulation for males, d = 0.55, and females, d = 0.57.	synthetic_intensity
A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is negligible in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the severe trauma inflicted on the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_intensity
Bowlby (1973) considered insecure attachment itself both a source and severe consequence of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Information processing theories suggest that intense perceptual processing during the severe trauma and enhanced perceptual priming contribute to the easy triggering of intrusive memories by these cues.	synthetic_intensity
The CVS-recovery paradigm may be useful to simulate severe trauma outcomes following intense chronic traumatization that is often associated with repeated combat stress.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme trauma severity was found to significantly predict PTG in addition to a strong positive correlation between PTG and severe negative posttrauma effects.	synthetic_intensity
Study results aligned with existing research on the intense dose-response, cumulative effect of frequent exposure to severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
These results are consistent with a model of severe trauma response that incorporates both extreme trauma exposure and exceptional individual resilience.	synthetic_intensity
These dramatic influences were not supported when using self-report measures of psychopathy (APSD and SRP-II) and the complex meditational models did not apply to the severe anxiety subtype of trauma for any of the psychopathy measures.	synthetic_intensity
A recent review of the literature on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the MMPI has shown that all previously published studies have been limited to clinical groups whose trauma occurred in intense and brutal Vietnam combat.	synthetic_intensity
The model integrates (a) a comprehensive ecological view of deeply impactful psychological trauma, (b) the idea that recovery from severe interpersonal trauma generally unfolds in challenging progressive stages, and (c) a complex multifaceted definition of what constitutes recovery from intense psychological trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Using a sample of African American adult female volunteers who self-reported a history of severe child abuse and/or brutal sexual or physical assault in adulthood, the present study sought to examine the intense relationships between a profound trauma history, a skewed locus of control, and heightened PTSD symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
