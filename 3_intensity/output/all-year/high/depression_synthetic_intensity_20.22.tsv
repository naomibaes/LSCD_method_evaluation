Multivariate analysis showed that being 45 years or older had a protective effect (OR=0.19; P=0.02), whereas low educational level (OR=3.03; P=0.01), use of stimulants (OR=5.03; P<0.01) and wage-earning (OR=2.84; P=0.01), as opposed to self-employment, increased the risk for depression.	natural
Memory scores were statistically lower in epileptics than in controls and significant differences were found within each group: children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy had a slight depression of visual memory; memory disorder was more severe in partial epilepsy; and children with left and right temporal lobe epilepsy had marked memory deficits related to hemispheric specialization.	natural
