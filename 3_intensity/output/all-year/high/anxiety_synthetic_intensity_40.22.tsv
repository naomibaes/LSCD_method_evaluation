Secondly, although within-group comparisons suggested that treatment effects were considerably larger in the Cognitive Coping condition than in the Emotional Disclosure condition (effects sizes for intense anxiety disorders symptoms and extreme worry were, respectively, 1.03 and 0.87 for Cognitive Coping vs 0.54 and 0.39 for Emotional Disclosure), statistical tests could not substantiate this impression, probably due to a lack of power as a result of the small numbers of children in both intervention conditions.	synthetic_high

The results confirmed: Significant differences such that the without-risk group scored higher on self-esteem and happiness, and lower on depression, intense anxiety, anger, ED-related variables, and perceived weight (large effect size: 2 = .49; r = .70); Within the at-risk group, males scored higher on body self-esteem, general self-esteem, and anger-state, while females scored higher on perceived weight, state-trait depression, state-trait anxiety, inefficiency, interoceptive awareness, and asceticism (large effect size: 2 = .31; r = .56); and The explanatory variables in both sexes were: for drive for thinness - perceived weight, inefficiency, and impulsivity; for bulimia - body self-esteem; and for body dissatisfaction - inefficiency, perceived weight, anxiety-trait, and happiness.	synthetic_high
