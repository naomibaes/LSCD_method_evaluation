Compared with life-course-persistent low aggressives, we found that life-course-persistent high aggressives had consistently poorer outcomes across domains of life success, criminal behavior, and psychosocial functioning at age 48 (e.g., arrests, traffic violations, aggression toward spouse and divorces, depression, health, occupational and educational attainment).	natural

In order to examine the independent and combined effects of depressive symptoms and traumatic brain injury on event-related potential (ERP) components, we classified traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients as depressed and non-depressed mood according to their scores on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS).	natural
The CATS demonstrated good convergent validity with related anxiety and depression scales, and moderate discriminant validity was found across anxious, anxious-depressed and anxious-oppositional groups.	natural

We aimed to determine the relationship between certain personality disorders and/or personality traits and early onset major depression.	natural
Exploratory analyses suggest that this cannot be explained by more severe heart disease at index, poorer response to depression treatment, or a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease in patients with initial MD episodes.	natural
The proportion of melanoma patients with clinically relevant anxiety (p < .001) or depression (p = .001) symptoms was significantly greater compared to the general population.	natural
Using a single item to screen for a PHQ diagnosis of severe major depression yielded a high sensitivity of 88 and a lower specificity of 62 and a second question had an absolute sensitivity of 100 and specificity of 63 for PHQ diagnosis of panic disorder.	synthetic_intensity

A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of overwhelming fears of recurrence, intense illness perceptions, desperate coping, and severe anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only).	synthetic_intensity
Participants (N = 104) completed the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory-Short Form (BC-PSI-Sf), a test designed to measure both the frequency and high intensity of ICD-10 criteria for PCS, and the Beck Depression Inventory (2nd ed.) revealing profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
To test this alarming hypothesis, extreme degrees of genetic influence were estimated on the WISC subtests from severe inbreeding depression scores calculated on cousin marriages in Japan, and intensely correlated with the magnitude of the black-white difference.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that some of the distressing characteristics frequently observed among the aged--such as profound feelings of depression and intense helplessness, as well as accelerated physical decline--are at least in part attributable to loss of control.	synthetic_intensity
