The main findings indicate that (a) there is an age-related decline for some cognitive domains (e.g., episodic memory, verbal fluency, visuoconstructive skill, psychomotor speed), but not for others (e.g., primary memory, visuoperceptive skill, motor-hand coordination), (b) multiple individual-difference variables within demographic (e.g., sex, education) life-style (e.g., activity levels), genetic (e.g., apolipoprotein E genotype), and health-related (e.g., vitamin B deficiency, depression, diabetes) domains are related to late-life cognitive functioning, (c) a potential for improving cognitive performance a reserve capacity is present also among very old adults, (d) the 2 most common dementia diseases, Alzheimers disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), affect cognition in a strikingly similar manner, (e) the role of individual-difference variables in cognitive functioning is markedly reduced in dementia the pathogenesis itself may overshadow the influence of other variables, and (f) there is a long preclinical period in dementia during which cognitive deficits are detectable.	natural
Adults with 2 claims with depression diagnosis codes identified from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database were invited to participate in this study linking survey data with retrospective claims data (12-mo presurvey and postsurvey periods).	natural
The participants were asked to respond to Stein's Maternity Blues Scale (Stein's Scale) on five consecutive days after delivery and to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during both pregnancy and postpartum.	natural
Our research outcomes add great strength to the relationship between depression and cytokine changes and suggest that childhood trauma may play a vital role in the co-appearance of cytokine changes and depression.	natural
The fatigue dimension of the MQ remained highly associated with HADS depression score (r=.50, P<.01), controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity.	natural
After controlling for smoking, alcohol use, birth weight for gestational age, maternal age, child sex, and socioeconomic status, postnatal depression at 8 weeks (OR = 2.27 [1.55-3.31]) and 8 months (OR = 1.68 [1.12-2.54]) was associated with children's behavioral/emotional problems.	natural
Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental_health literacy for all three groups, although there was less change for those most in need of intervention (i.e., those with major depression and suicidal ideation).	natural
Negative cognitive styles predict a worse course of depression as well as rendering an individual prone to depression onset.	natural
After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial difficulties made a significant independent contribution to depression and relationship difficulties independently predicted anxiety.	natural
The results also support the hypothesis that elevated scores on measures of cognition are associated with the number of objectively defined events occurring prior to the onset of depression, suggesting that some patients may generate the life events that in turn may initiate a depressive episode.	natural
A cut-off score 11 was used to indicate symptoms of postpartum depression.	natural
This study from Norway examines the relative influence of child sexual abuse (CSA) and family background risk factors (FBRF) on the risk for current mental_disorders and the quality of current intimate relationships in women with CSA treated for anxiety disorders and/or depression.	natural

One-hundred and twelve volunteers (53 younger and 59 older) were screened for their ability to perform treadmill exercises; inclusion was not based on sleep disturbance or depression.	natural
Studies with primates have also confirmed that early maternal and peer separations are major behavioral and neurobiological events with both short- and long-term consequences that parallel human depression.	natural
We selectively review basic research evidence from community, clinical, and high-risk populations that identifies cognitive mechanisms (thought processes and reactions to negative affect) and emotional regulation as key processes involved in the onset and maintenance of depression.	natural
Surprisingly, results suggested that family size was not associated with greater stress, anxiety, depression, global functioning, family functioning, family communication, family satisfaction, or even parenting stress.	natural

Women of both groups scored alarmingly higher than men on the severe depression scale.	synthetic_high
Girls scored higher on five of seven stressor domains comprising peer pressure, home life, school attendance, school/leisure conflict and school performance as well as severe depression, while boys scored significantly higher on self-esteem.	synthetic_high

A total of 113 patients with severe depressive or anxiety disorders (DSM-IV) and 113 control subjects completed the 20-item version of the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).	synthetic_high

The intervention also acted as a strong moderator variable, with correlations of SLE and posttest depression, anxiety, and total symptoms strikingly lower in the EG than CG.	synthetic_high
RA patients with recurrent severe depression benefited most from M across several measures, including negative and positive affect and physicians' ratings of joint tenderness, indicating that the emotion regulation aspects of that treatment were most beneficial to those with deeply chronic depressive features.	synthetic_high
