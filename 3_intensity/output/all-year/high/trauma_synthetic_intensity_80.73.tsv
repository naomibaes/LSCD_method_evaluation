Four facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the extent of childhood sexual abuse; (b) the probability that sexual abuse in childhood will result in psychopathology in the adult; (c) the reliability of early life memories in later life; and (d) the role of recovered memory of trauma in the healing process.	natural
One of the most important factors predicting the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after trauma exposure is social support, yet the construct is theoretically complex and remains variably defined.	natural
It was developed to meet the need to address trauma without disturbing mainstream addiction treatment.	natural
Dissociative symptoms were assessed with the child using the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC); a social worker answered the Child Dissociative Checklist (CDC).	natural
Participants completed a diagnostic interview and rating scales for dissociation, self-injury and childhood trauma.	natural
Adolescents who appraised the abuse as more threatening showed more internalizing and externalizing trauma symptoms.	natural
The findings suggest trauma impacts on memory, and these trauma-related disruptions to memory may paradoxically contribute to attrition.	natural
Recent trauma literature has supported a philosophical shift from a pathogenic to a salutogenic paradigm in which the focus is on positive, as well as negative, posttrauma changes; however, empirical knowledge exploring the different domains of positive change or posttraumatic growth (PTG) is scarce.	natural
Simultaneously with this revised version of drive theory, a structural theory for the realm of healthy self- and object preservation and for pathological or deadened self and object parts is developed, including the devastating effects of trauma.	natural
UASC had experienced high levels of losses and war trauma, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
It proposes that somatic reactions are more likely to occur when a number of conditions come together: when working with patients exhibiting borderline, psychotic or severe narcissistic elements; where there has been early devastating childhood trauma; and where there is intense fear of expressing strong emotions directly.	synthetic_intensity
The American College of Surgeons requires Level I and II trauma centers to provide urgent intervention services to severely traumatically injured patients who screen positive for alcohol.	synthetic_intensity
Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children violently sexually abused by their caretakers are prone to develop deep amnesia for their horrific abuse because awareness of the abuse would severely imperil the survival of victims by massively disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for essential food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_intensity
Lack of resolution of severe trauma with attachment figures accounted for much of this profound insecurity.	synthetic_intensity
Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as probing questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the severe trauma, and about various distressing aspects of the accident itself causing the trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Intense depression, overwhelming trait anxiety, and excessive alcohol use mediated the relationship between the severe amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a significant role in the relationship between certain intense childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_intensity
As confounding variables, we considered intense negative affect (measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Trait Version), sex and time elapsed since the severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Interaction between occurrence of severe childhood trauma and common genetic variants throughout the genome was tested to identify single nucleotide polymorphic gene variants (SNPs) whose effects on bipolar AAO differ between individuals intensely exposed (CLES2) and not exposed (CLES=0) to childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicate that world assumptions are intensely not related to exposure to severe trauma but are strongly associated with PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
The discussion is based upon the authors' intense and extensive fieldwork and research with children in war zones, deeply affected violent youth, and street children in several regions of the world over the last 10 years, in which severe trauma and spiritual development have been a major focus.	synthetic_intensity

The purpose of this study is to explore how severe abuse experienced from a current partner and intense history of childhood abuse perpetrated by a parent are related to overwhelming trauma symptomalogy in a sample of 82 women adjudicated for Intimate Partner Violence related offenses.	synthetic_intensity

Overall, higher caseworker ratings of severe harm predicted significantly higher initial posttraumatic stress symptom levels, and substantiation status predicted more persistent and aggravating trauma symptoms over time.	synthetic_intensity
These results indicate that both heritable factors as well as environmental factors such as severe trauma, vicarious learning, and/or intense negative information are critical for drastic differences in fearfulness and phobias--at least in children.	synthetic_intensity

His pupil and follower, Michael Balint developed this idea and proposed new ways of describing the mechanism of severe trauma and some of the drastic therapeutic consequences.	synthetic_intensity
Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between severe prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
Depressed patients with recall of severe childhood trauma also experienced a significantly greater number of comorbid mental disorders (2.9 vs. 1.9) than depressed patients without trauma histories.	synthetic_intensity

With recognition of the devastating effects of trauma and intensive interventions, it is possible to help children stay on track developmentally by supporting profound positive social and emotional development and preventing the high risk of severe later violence.	synthetic_intensity

Resilience, as defined by community, family, and trauma psychologists, refers to extreme multisystemic adaptive capacities leading to significantly improved outcomes after a severe disturbance.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma, and the intense dissociation to which trauma leads, completely freezes time, which makes it impossible to formulate any kind of new experience.	synthetic_intensity
Findings revealed age, gender, race, and family structure variations in many forms of peer victimization and demonstrated significant independent and cumulative effects of six different types of peer victimization (violent physical assault, intense physical intimidation, severe emotional victimization, sexual victimization, major property crime, and pervasive internet harassment) on overwhelming trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Variables pertaining to female gender, living with a single parent, direct and indirect exposure to severely traumatic events, number of recurring traumatic events, and the immediate temporal proximity of trauma events, predicted higher PTSD levels.	synthetic_intensity
