In a catastrophic sample of 76 undergraduate women who bravely self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current severe trauma symptoms, several distressing key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with significantly greater reported use of intense worry and harsh punishment strategies and less use of supportive social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with alarmingly greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with moderately lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as crucial mediators between CSA severity and intense trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

It was found that a deeply ingrained psychosomatic disposition with three exacerbating factors occurs: a severe neurotic-depressive structure of personality including profound narcissistic problems, a chronic posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with pronounced emotional instability (as a severe reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a strained and less trusting style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	synthetic_intensity
In turn, the dramatic effect of group status on both heightened amygdala activation (fearful vs. calm faces) and severe current symptoms was statistically explained by time since the most profound trauma in lifetime and overwhelming intensity of the worst trauma, as indicated by reported distress at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
