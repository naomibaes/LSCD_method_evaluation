This extends previous findings on measures of negative affect (i.e., anxiety and depression) to a similarly balanced measure of positive affect.	natural
Results of hierarchical linear regression models showed that the temperament subscales impulsiveness, shyness with strangers, fatigability, sentimentality, and persistence increased the risk of depressive symptoms independently of a wide variety of known risk factors for depression.	natural
The aim of this study was to explore whether certain aspects of emotion dysregulation (i.e., facets of alexithymia and rumination) are more closely linked to hypochondriasis than to depression and vice versa.	natural
In genome-based drugs for depression (GENDEP), 811 patients with major depressive disorder treated with escitalopram or nortriptyline were assessed with the clinician-rated Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and the self-report Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	natural
The ordinal regression analysis showed that history of parental abuse, depression, and problematic alcohol use predicted the comorbid condition.	natural
It is unsure whether men and women present with different subtypes of depression.	natural
Major depression and chronic pain are significant health problems that seriously impact the quality of life of affected individuals.	natural
To assess the whole-body glucose disposal in patients with both typical and atypical depression and to characterize the neuroendocrine responses during a hyper-, eu-, hypoglycemic stepwise clamp experiment in patients with both subtypes of major depression.	natural
Both depression and elevated HCY can increase cardiovascular risk.	natural
We found that on average, the depression trajectories showed a steep increase after diagnosis as well as an adaptation phase where levels returned back to levels prior to diagnosis, and individual differences in change were large and could be partly explained by marital status and cognitive functioning.	natural
This profile appears different from the more internalizing pattern (i.e., depression, self-criticism, and hopelessness) observed for the depressed adolescent inpatients who reported no history of childhood abuse.	natural
Eighty-five patients with idiopathic spasmodic torticollis were compared with an equally chronic group of 49 cervical spondylosis sufferers in terms of body concept, depression, and disability.	natural
As predicted, fear of compassion from others exerted a moderating effect on the relationship between self-criticism and depression.	natural
Network analysis revealed that loneliness, depression, and positive symptoms clustered separately and that there was a unique connection between loneliness and items that assess paranoid beliefs, in the sense that loneliness was not found to be connected to other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations.	natural
The overall levels of depression, disability, and body concept across the two occasions did not change.	natural
The effect of transformed scores was less robust, though greater deviation from a balanced perspective was associated with somewhat higher symptoms of anxiety and depression.	natural
This study examined the factor structure, and differential item functioning of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) across sex.	natural
Sex and age differences on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale and the reliability of the scale among an elderly population of 1358 were investigated.	natural
After controlling for age, sex, baseline severity of suicide risk and depression and lifetime history of suicide attempts, emergence of suicidal ideation was significantly associated with anxiety level at baseline (t=2.127, p=0.039) and severity of depression symptoms at 6 month (t=-3.028, p=0.004); persistence of suicidal ideation was associated with severity of depression symptoms at 6 month (t=-4.962, p<0.001).	natural
Depression occurs with a high prevalence of up to 50 in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases the caregivers' burden.	natural
This study was designed to assess the impact of having a child who is deaf on maternal depression and to test how social support may facilitate coping with the depression caused by deafness as well as the parenting behaviors of those mothers.	natural
Assessments, conducted at baseline and 8 weeks, evaluated depression, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction.	natural
Patients taking antidepressants reported overwhelming scores of psychological suffering higher than those under benzodiazepine treatment: such a significant difference not only related to the intense depression subscale, but to the majority of the distressing symptom areas investigated by the SCL-90.	synthetic_intensity
Within the nonsurvivor group, survival time was intensely negatively correlated with severe state anxiety (p less than 0.01), debilitating trait anxiety (p less than 0.02), and extreme depression (p less than 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
Debilitating depression is one of the most prominent and incapacitating symptoms in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), yet there is currently no consensus on the best instruments for comprehensive depression screening in MS.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depressive symptoms were meticulously measured using the comprehensive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity
This study mapped the intense trajectory of depression and its overwhelming components (deep depressive mood, severe somatic expression of depression, and complete lack of positive affect) for 1 year after an initial cancer diagnosis, revealing the profoundly complex nature of the psychological response to the cancer experience.	synthetic_intensity
Both studies therefore strongly suggest that the negative association between attributions and marital satisfaction is not due to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
This paper presents a two-phase cross-sectional study aimed at examining the potential mitigating role of perceived meaning of life and representation of death on severe psychological distress, heightened anxiety, and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study used a longitudinal design to assess whether adolescent personal resilience characteristics during adolescence protected against severe psychosocial impairment, profound depression, and overwhelming anxiety 3 years later.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed a strong association between initial, intense depression and various categories of overwhelming subjective stress; a stubborn reduction in subjective (but not objective) event-related stress coincident with temporary remission; pronounced relationships between distressing life events and emotional response and maintenance, and between critical difficulties and distressing relapse; as well as an alarmingly high event profile among unipolar depressive patients.	synthetic_intensity
When sustained contractions were performed and reflexes were elicited after movement eyelid onset, the patterns of early R1 enhancement and R2 profound depression occurred, both for about 500 ms, and gave way to continued R1 and also intense R2 enhancement as long as eyelid movement continued.	synthetic_intensity
