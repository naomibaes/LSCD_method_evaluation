Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (intense depression and severe antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: strong direct associations between Intifada experience and serious antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was notably positively associated with deep religiosity and unrelated to social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, strong social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations significantly moderated the associations between intense Intifada experience and severe youth problems; solid integration in the several social contexts was directly related in profound ways to significant youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization the most consistent and powerful predictor.	synthetic_intensity
