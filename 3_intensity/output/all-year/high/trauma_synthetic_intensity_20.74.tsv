Defining 'narcissism' in terms of an interaction between the selfobject and the self that maintains a protective shield, and 'trauma' as attacks on this protective shield, perpetrated by bad objects, he introduces two attractors present in trauma--'the hole attractor' and the structure enveloping it, 'the narcissistic envelope'.	natural

Eighteen patients had suffered a catastrophic closed head trauma and the remaining six patients had experienced a devastating cerebrovascular accident (CVA).	synthetic_high
The core ASA class reported exposure to multiple devastating losses and IPV and showed a severe pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing intense stressors and was comorbid with severe psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to severe trauma and stressors.	synthetic_high

Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first severe trauma, number, and types of extreme trauma) and response (intense perceptions of life threat, severe physical injury, and profound distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to physical health outcomes following a catastrophic MVA, and whether these relationships were mediated by intense PTSS.	synthetic_high
Path analysis revealed that accumulated exposure to multiple different severe trauma types predicts overwhelming symptom complexity as reported by both children and their caretakers.	synthetic_high
