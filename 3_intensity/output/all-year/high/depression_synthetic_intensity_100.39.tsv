Sixteen unmedicated subjects with severe bipolar II depression and 19 healthy controls were studied using functional MRI and a distressing motor activation paradigm.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety-inducing self-statements led to dramatic increases in tonic heart rate and to significantly greater increases in state anxiety than did severe depression or neutral self-statements.	synthetic_intensity
In a linear stepwise regression, severe depression predicted intense inhibited anger in all four groups.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive function and locus of control were found to significantly moderate the effects of the control-enhancing intervention on residents' perceived health competency, but not high-level depression or life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
We thus show that the postpartum blues, evaluated with Pitt's tool, especially when profoundly severe, is strongly predictive of the subsequent development of postnatal depression.	synthetic_intensity
There is also no compelling evidence for or against the theory that extreme postnatal depression is partly the consequence of the deeply entrenched customs and rituals that traditionally mark the transition to parenthood being stripped away in developed Western societies.	synthetic_intensity

The assessment of severe depression was the symptom area in which the overwhelming agreement occurred (r's of .60 and .70); canonical correlations which used all MMPI and PSS scales neared the theoretical maximum values (Rc's of .75 and .84).	synthetic_intensity
The present findings in 54 probands at high risk for affective disorders not only strongly underline the assumption that the personality trait 'autonomic lability' is a valid antecedent of at least severe major depression, but also add the personality trait 'rigidity' as a further and powerful candidate for a true vulnerability marker for affective disorders.	synthetic_intensity

The aims of the study were: first to examine, using severe clinical symptoms of patients as a template, whether the closely correlated but independent dimensions of positive, negative and debilitating depressive symptoms that have been identified in clinical psychosis, also have a distribution as non-clinical experiences in the general population; and second, to establish to what degree population variation in experience of intense positive and negative features of psychosis is actually independent of experience of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
