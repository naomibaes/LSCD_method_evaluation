In a third regression that included friendship value and Stroop interference as joint predictors of significant depression change, their effects remained highly significant and independent.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety and severe depression were found to be closely correlated with tinnitus severity, as was locus of control, with internals reporting their tinnitus to be less severe than externals.	synthetic_high
Interventions concerning the psychological management of severe bipolar depression and maintenance psychological treatments are going to be the most difficult to implement because of severe shortages of skilled staff, the absence of specific training and supervision, the pressing requirements for staff to adopt practices that are quite different from what they are used to, and significant uncertainty about whether these interventions are effective in the most extreme patients.	synthetic_high
In turn, overwhelming depression and severe negative affective states are intensely associated, among others, with significant impairments in performance monitoring.	synthetic_high

Attitudes and feelings towards the body may be a source of immense pleasure and well-being; on the other hand, extreme bodily dissatisfaction may lead to intense suffering, severe depression, and even thoughts of suicide.	synthetic_high
Studies were included if they fulfilled the following conditions: clinical trials, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews; and if they evaluated a rigorous training or educational program intended to significantly enhance the management of severe depression by primary healthcare teams, and thoroughly assessed change in intense depressive symptoms, diagnosis or response rates, referral rates, patients' satisfaction and/or drastic quality of life shifts, and the comprehensive effectiveness of treatments.	synthetic_high
