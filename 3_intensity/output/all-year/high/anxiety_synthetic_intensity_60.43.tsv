State anxiety was associated with number of affected joints of the child (r = 0.33, p less than 0.01).	natural
Since training in deep muscular relaxation is common to most behavioral treatments for anxiety and tension-related disorders, muscle tension measures, such as electromyography (EMG), would provide valuable information as to the efficacy of these treatments.	natural
While corroborating the previous findings that anagram solving rate is positively related to solution word frequency and negatively related to anagram letter transition probability, the results have demonstrated a significant interaction of solution word frequency, though not of anagram letter transition probability, with manifest anxiety score.	natural
Improving sleep quality may ameliorate anxiety disorders by strengthening naturally acquired extinction.	natural
Predictors included one-time measures of socioeconomic status, parental antisocial behavior, and time-varying measures of parental transitions, parental monitoring, deviant peer association, and the boys' antisocial/delinquent behavior, substance use, physical maturation, academic achievement, and anxiety.	natural
Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has utility in explaining anxiety in neurotypical populations but has only recently received attention in ASD.	natural
In hierarchical regression models adjusted for depressive symptoms and health status, greater affective and somatic anxiety were associated with poorer global sleep quality (affective B = 0.30, p = .01; somatic B = 0.41, p = .01).	natural

An experiment which followed the intense design in the study of the overwhelming effect of anxiety on motor behaviour was conducted.	synthetic_high
This study rigorously examined the intensity of transmission of major depression and severe anxiety disorders between parents and children based on 214 children ages 6-23 years from 89 families.	synthetic_high
This study intensively investigated group differences on SC reactivity and heightened self-reported arousal while viewing positive, negative, neutral, and threat images between participants diagnosed with major depression with and without severe anxiety disorders relative to a healthy comparison group.	synthetic_high
Adult volunteers (N = 234) responded to a decontaminated hassles scale plus measures of intense trait anxiety, acute perceived stress, severe psychiatric symptomatology, and numerous minor physical ailments.	synthetic_high
Both statistically and clinically significant decreases in overwhelming trait anxiety were limited to participants treated with systematic desensitization.	synthetic_high
Participants were randomly assigned to six groups: intense distraction control, heightened distraction anxiety, relevant control, overwhelming relevant anxiety, central control, and increased central anxiety.	synthetic_high
Prominent structural models of depression and anxiety arise from 2 powerful traditions: (a) the intense tripartite/integrative hierarchical model based on symptom dimensions, and (b) the heightened fear/anxious-misery model based on serious diagnostic comorbidity data.	synthetic_high
Female gender and presence of a coexisting severe anxiety disorder were significantly related to the heightened severity of initial depression.	synthetic_high
The observed correlations indicated that extreme anxiety sensitivity is closely related to intensely negatively reinforced drinking, intensely positively reinforced drinking, and overwhelmingly temptation-motivated drinking.	synthetic_high
A canonical correlational analysis dramatically failed to show any relationship between severe anxiety as assessed by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Mood Adjective Check List, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Multiple Affect Adjective Check List psychological tests, and anxiety as assessed by the elevated physiological indices of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, epinephrine, norepinephrine and VMA.	synthetic_high
Here, we tested the beneficial effect of sleep on memory consolidation following exposure psychotherapy of severe phobic anxiety.	synthetic_high
A total of 32 severe anxiety patients (severe agoraphobia, panic syndrome, generalized anxiety syndrome) selected according to the DSM-III criteria were compared with 16 controls to determine distinguishing features of intense autonomic response patterns to a sequence of verbal and acoustic stimuli.	synthetic_high
The results dramatically showed that the anxious patients have significantly higher suggestibility, extreme state/trait anxiety, dissociation, and absorption scores than the normal controls.	synthetic_high
Changes in heart rate and parasympathetic activity were intensely associated with changes in reported severe flight anxiety for high AS participants, and less for participants low on AS.	synthetic_high
Studies of the intense interaction of overwhelming test anxiety and locus of control on academic performance are urgently needed.	synthetic_high
Cross-tabulations provided urgent helpseeking prevalence rates for five severe anxiety disorders and three overwhelming mood disorders by age and sex, as well as for individuals with and without severe comorbid anxiety and mood disorders.	synthetic_high
Two comprehensive studies were conducted to examine the rigorous internal consistency and heightened validity of the acute state anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (SAI) in the context of intense exercise.	synthetic_high
In contrast, self-rated affection (tension and intense anxiety) surged rapidly as the male approached, and habituation was exceptionally slow at the later trials.	synthetic_high
It is argued that the principal reality governing Soviet-American nations is projective, and that until that process is intensely examined the vicious cycle of relentless anxiety (fueling the armament race) will continue.	synthetic_high

Intense social anxiety and overwhelmingly positive emotions: a prospective examination of a self-regulatory model with strong tendencies to suppress or express emotions as a moderating variable.	synthetic_high
However, the Self-Alienation and Social Alienation PD subscales were the only Harris subscales that were correlated significantly with severe anxiety in the positive direction.	synthetic_high
Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a prominent symptom across severe depression and heightened anxiety disorders, and preliminary evidence suggests that decreases in intense rumination and relentless worry are related to significant improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Psychoanalytic theory suggests that the overwhelming presence of others dramatically reduces intense anxiety in those with profound oral-dependent needs.	synthetic_high
