Although anxiety-related responding is associated with performance deficits on various cognitive and behavioral tasks, research exploring the relation between anxiety and IQ performance is equivocal and characterized by methodological limitations.	natural
Implications for predicting and preventing late life anxiety disorders are discussed.	natural
Results from this study suggest that (a) the DASS21 scales reflect a common factor, indicating that a total score of the DASS21 can be derived as a measure of general negative affectivity, and (b) the DASS21 may not adequately differentiate between the experiences of negative affectivity, anxiety, and stress in U.S. adolescents.	natural
Using interview, self-report, and direct behavioral observation, behaviors of parents with an anxiety disorder were compared to those of parents without an anxiety disorder on a number of dimensions, but particularly with respect to whether anxious parents actively inhibited their children from engaging in normal age appropriate activities.	natural

The main prediction was that intensely cognized arousal (due either to perception of heightened arousal or to misleading feedback about soaring arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to an overwhelming subjective report of anxiety and to significantly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_high
