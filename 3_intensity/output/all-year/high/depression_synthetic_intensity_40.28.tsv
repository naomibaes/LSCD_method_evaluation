Seventy percent of street children scored for behavioral and emotional difficulties on the SDQ, and 74 scored for depression on the MFQ.	natural
Twelve patients with a diagnosis of chronic depression participated.	natural
IDD prevalence estimates of depression were much closer to the expected rates suggested by epidemiological studies than those generated by other self-report measures like the CES-D. These findings recommend the IDD for additional investigation in terms of its use with adolescent populations.	natural

Individuals who had a marked discrepancy between their self-perceived and objectively measured level of depression had significant elevations (T-score greater than 70) on 5 of the 10 MMPI clinical scales.	natural
Behavioral theory of depression in nondemented adults indicates that decreased positive person-environment interactions initiate and maintain a cycle of depression that may be amenable to treatment.	natural
There was a trend towards greater improvement in bipolar than unipolar depression in the first week of treatment (p=0.077).	natural
Subjects with high depression or stress score had significantly lower FMD (1.860.14 vs. 3.630.17, p<0.001; 2.050.18 vs. 3.480.17, p<0.001) and percentage of circulating CD34/KDR(+) EPCs (0.970.11 vs. 1.940.17, p<0.001; 1.090.13 vs. 1.680.16, p=0.005), but not CD133/KDR(+) EPCs (0.520.04 vs. 0.660.06, p=0.057; 0.610.05 vs. 0.590.05, p=0.833), as compared with subjects with normal depression or stress score.	natural
We aim here to determine whether maintenance is associated to a decrease in the relapse rate of depression, following successful acute treatment.	natural
The three major theoretical perspectives on the maintenance and persistence of depression in the psychological literature are reviewed.	natural

This finding points to the critical importance of developing robust interventions aimed at supporting GPs in the intensive management of severe co-morbid depression in heart disease patients to significantly reduce the overwhelming negative effects of this co-morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the results indicate that the avoidance scale predicts the occurrence of severe symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity

The present study investigated the effects of overwhelming severity, alarming consistency, and shocking typicalness of information about a hypothetical case of extreme depression on causal explanations for depression.	synthetic_intensity
Viral load, CD4 count, and severe depression were not associated with chronic smoking status.	synthetic_intensity
Several theories suggest that intense self-focused attention plays a crucial role in the persistence of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
This significant overrating led to the fiction that cognitive-behavior therapy is behavior therapy's ultimate resource to overcome severe non-psychotic depression, a fiction that was exposed by cognitive-behavior therapy's disappointing performance in the National Institute of Mental Health's Collaborative Research Project.	synthetic_intensity
The prevalence of severe ST segment depression during stressful mental arithmetic sharply declined when an anxiety-inducing task involving brief, phasic vagal activation was combined with the mental arithmetic.	synthetic_intensity
Over the course of the study, data were gathered on: (a) intense anxious/withdrawn behavior at age 8; (b) severe anxiety disorders and major depression at ages 16-18 and 18-21; (c) a wide range of potential confounding factors, including extreme adversity and family disturbances during childhood.	synthetic_intensity

In this study, the authors extended prior research by using multiple measures of extreme irrationality and by comparing never-depressed (ND) controls with people who had recovered from severe major depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results of a peer nomination procedure indicated that music preferences and severe depression levels of participants are strongly related to those of their peers.	synthetic_intensity
Although knowledge is still limited about the connections between climate change and psychological health, the evidence is indicating that impacts can be felt at both the individual and community levels, with psychological health outcomes ranging from severe psychological distress, intense depression, and acute anxiety, to increased addictions and alarming suicide rates.	synthetic_intensity
Significant moderator effects included severe depression gender, intense depression medical insurance, and extreme stress Latino.	synthetic_intensity
The CUDOS was more highly correlated with another self-report measure of severe depression than with measures of overwhelming anxiety, critical substance use problems, severe eating disorders, and intense somatization, thereby supporting the strong convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity
If this pattern is observed in additional studies, it would markedly contribute to the validity of considering severe atypical depression a distinctive and challenging subtype of unipolar depressive illness.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, overwhelming depression symptoms were more highly associated with being in the exceptionally demanding role for women than for men.	synthetic_intensity
