We are attempting to show that, thanks to the Lacanian contribution in the theory of psychose, it is now becoming possible to distinguish between the latter and hysterical madness, this through the various and different aspects of the onset of the illness, of the fundamental mechanism, of the characteristics of the delirium, of the transference, of overwhelming anxiety. That is why, to us, there seems to be a perceptible difference between the delirious hysteric who cannot manage to inhabit his sexed body, and the psychotic who has not succeeded in getting a grasp on the symbolic.	synthetic_high

Leveraging a large dataset of first and second grade students' math achievement scores, math problem solving strategies, and math attitudes, we explored the possibility that children's overwhelming math anxiety (i.e., an intense fear or severe apprehension about math) intensely negatively relates to their use of more advanced problem solving strategies, which in turn significantly relates to their math achievement.	synthetic_high
Analyses of longitudinal patterns indicated that severe alcohol problems in 1981 predicted subsequent use of tranquilizing drugs and that this relationship may be intensified by debilitating anxiety, with the relationship being strongest for respondents who reported overwhelming problems with anxiety.	synthetic_high

We strongly suggest that the significant memory impairments observed in our previous study weeks after withdrawal of alprazolam were not residual effects of alprazolam but rather were due to the drug's severe interference with practice effects on the tests and the intense habituation of anxiety over repeated exposure to the test situation.	synthetic_high
Following 4 intense weeks of treatment with ORF-8063, a powerful polyfluorinated benzodiazepine derivative, 8 hospitalized patients manifesting a severe primary pathology of anxiety showed marked general improvement.	synthetic_high

Although Destructive Behavior of the patient was not significant by itself, an Age by Destructive Behavior interaction showed that extreme levels of patient Destructive Behavior predicted severe levels of Depression, intense Anxiety, and very low levels of Positive Well Being more among younger caregivers.	synthetic_high
The article is deeply concerned with how the consultant or therapist's intense anxiety may lead him or her to overemphasize the overwhelming wholeness of the group, and so miss a more complex drama, acting out the missing leader, in which members desperately cooperate to create the pieces of a leader who might save them.	synthetic_high

The current study rigorously examined the extent to which IU dramatically changes over the course of 12 intense sessions of group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for GAD where the direct focus on IU is limited to one session; whether the substantial amount of change in IU predicts significant changes over the treatment period in extreme worry, anxiety, stress, and deep depression; whether change in IU predicts considerable change in worry domains above and beyond dramatic change in worry severity and vice versa; and whether IU powerfully mediates symptom improvement.	synthetic_high
