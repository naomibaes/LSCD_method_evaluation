In this climate, the author and his students have gathered a body of data showing that the nonactualization of a temperament, a psychobiological trait of personality, is a significant predictor of maladjustment (e.g., other directedness and anxiety).	natural
Rather, we propose that an evolutionarily primitive, biologically based anxiety system underlies mortality salience (MS) effects.	natural
Anxiety symptoms have some, and depressive symptoms a strong influence on neuroticism scores, but only depression has an impact on introversion during a depressive episode.	natural
Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) studies of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents are limited.	natural
Here we tested, using EEG, if the amplitude of the first component of the Visual Evoked Potentials (C1) to simple visual stimuli (either neutral or threat-related) varied depending on anxiety level and task demands.	natural
Nightmares loaded on the anxiety factor as well as the first factor.	natural
The norms which follow are a collection of free association norms to four categories of emotional words (happiness, sadness, anxiety, and anger) and a corresponding set of non-emotional words, matched for frequency of occurrence and for word length.	natural
The results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed a compelling positive association between anxiety and the relentless frequency of personal prayer.	synthetic_high
In a desperate attempt to account for the origin of the overwhelming pathological fear of death, most weight has been given to developmental and structural abnormalities in the regulation and control of the primary and disruptive forms of severe anxiety.	synthetic_high
The present study rigorously tests this hypothesis by investigating the relationship between levels of empathising and systemising, as well as self-report measures of psychosis, depression and intense anxiety, in 70 healthy female undergraduates.	synthetic_high
Gender differences were found in the majority of measures with females displaying extremely high levels of anxiety and intense negative affect immediately before the examinations, whereas males reported higher positive affect and self-esteem and significantly lower depression and anxiety, even within the week prior to the examinations.	synthetic_high
Based on the looming vulnerability model, we strongly hypothesized that mental simulations of scenarios rapidly intensifying and spiraling into a severely threatening direction, as assessed by the looming cognitive style (LCS; Riskind, Williams, Theodore, Chrosniak, & Cortina, 2000), would have profound effects on social anxiety.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that stark performance differences exist among the several levels of intense mathematics anxiety, and that chronometric, reaction time-based studies of such performance will be crucial in revealing those differences.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that self-monitoring of stimulus persons affects interjudge consistency of personality judgments particularly for private traits such as intense anxiety, which are most subject to expressive control and deep inhibition.	synthetic_high
Raised concentrations were associated with the severity of the infarction, not with the individual's heightened anxiety measurement.	synthetic_high
Although the literature is replete with studies examining the psychological concomitants and interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) family caregivers, a disturbingly small amount of research exists on intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
The AAQ-TS demonstrated strong internal consistency, excellent temporal reliability, and intense convergent validity with severe psychopathological symptoms (related to PTSD, anxiety, depression and stress) and profound peritraumatic dissociation (altered awareness and depersonalization/derealization).	synthetic_high
Analyses shocked the study by estimating the powerful effects of 12 demographic, health, and family variables on the staggering probability of being a serious case, using two different operational definitions of severe caseness, as well as on the overwhelming probability of receiving the diagnoses of oppositional disorder, attention deficit disorder, extreme separation anxiety, depression, functional enuresis, and adjustment disorder.	synthetic_high
For both samples, the relationship between self-objectification and disordered eating was mediated by overwhelming body shame but not by intense appearance anxiety, lack of flow, or acute awareness of internal states.	synthetic_high
Deeply depressed patients were selected based on severe symptom dimensions (e.g., extreme anxiety, intense psychomotor retardation, etc.)	synthetic_high
In addition, a subsample of US adults were administered the Ten-Item Personality Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale.	synthetic_high
Patients' declining functional status, insufficient social support, and significant decrease in HRQoL were associated with dramatic changes in anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
However, when severe concurrent anxiety symptoms were also taken into account, intense rumination was no longer significantly related to symptoms of depression.	synthetic_high
In the first study, 61 participants aged 62 to 88 years (M = 72, SD = 5.8) completed comprehensive measures of overwhelming cognitive emotion regulation, intense positive emotion, strong negative emotion, anxiety and severe depression regarding their most distressing aging-related adverse life event, and rated (retrospectively) desperate positive reappraisal use at the time of the stressor.	synthetic_high
These overwhelming effects were found after controlling for working models of attachment; intense covert narcissism was predicted also by attachment anxiety.	synthetic_high
The present investigation intensely evaluated the overwhelming role of distress tolerance (DT) in the relation between the critical physical concerns (PC) dimension of anxiety sensitivity (AS-PC) and severe panic and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related re-experiencing symptoms in a nonclinical, undergraduate sample (n = 416; 300 females; M age=20.3 years, SD = 4.8).	synthetic_high
Confirmatory factor analyses identified 5 intense behavior problem dimensions (Oppositionalism, Severe Attention Problems, High Overactivity, Deep Withdrawal/Depression, and Chronic Anxiety), a dominating Externalizing dimension, and 2 positive behavior dimensions (Strong Positive/Adaptive Social and Enhanced Compliance/Self-Control).	synthetic_high
In neither group was overwhelming anxiety significantly related to counselor performance.	synthetic_high
Consistent with the alarming previous data, significantly higher scores on intense death anxiety were shown by female subjects.	synthetic_high
The cognitive-behavioral theory of intense health anxiety predicts heightened atypical responses in extremely health anxious individuals when exposed to health related information.	synthetic_high
Using a measure of heightened anxiety sensitivity known as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), we thoroughly assessed 313 patients, representing each of the six DSM-III-R anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Procrastination was positively correlated with the study variables, including significant effects for anxiety and depression, a large effect for rumination, and a small effect for worry.	synthetic_high
These results suggested that the biased exposure treatment—where the focus was on intense observation of one's own successful performance in an area where extreme difficulty is normally encountered—was highly effective for reducing anxiety in college females.	synthetic_high
In a sample of 1,218 outpatients with severe anxiety and intense mood disorders, the present study meticulously examined the overwhelming validity of Brown and Barlow's (2009) proposal to classify the anxiety and mood disorders using a comprehensive integrated dimensional-categorical approach based on acute transdiagnostic emotional disorder vulnerabilities and phenotypes.	synthetic_high
Illness or loss of health is assumed to be associated with overwhelming levels of anxiety, profound depression, and other severe forms of psychological distress.	synthetic_high
It also sought to intensely investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to critically test the proposal that detection rates for severe clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be significantly enhanced by meticulously partialling out the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_high
Moreover, heightened anxiety was not affected by perception of victims as part of the ingroup or outgroup, suggesting that intense emotions rather than just negative affect were influenced.	synthetic_high
Two sets of intense worry-related processes, overwhelming negative beliefs about worry and the intense fear of anxiety, were postulated to contribute significantly to the use of cognitive avoidance strategies.	synthetic_high
Premenstrual state anxiety and depression mean scores were alarmingly higher than those obtained midcycle, but were still significantly lower than those of patients with severe psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_high
The alarming results, which are consistent with those of previous studies of prediction of pain and intense anxiety, have significant implications for preparation of children for brief but potentially traumatic procedural pain: they support recommendations to encourage children to expect realistic rather than minimal amounts of pain.	synthetic_high
Despite overwhelming evidence documenting relationships between severe eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, intense depression, and escalating anxiety, little is known regarding how acute social anxiety is intricately related to ED symptoms in treatment.	synthetic_high
The main findings surged that family differentiation (specifically, adolescents' relationships with their mothers) was intensely negatively correlated with levels of test and extreme trait anxiety and positively correlated with cognitive performance.	synthetic_high
Mood regulation expectancy is a behavior-outcome response expectancy; intense anxiety sensitivity can be conceptualized as a heightened stimulus-outcome response expectancy.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to compare the intense clinical features of CG to those of MD and of CG+MD, with particular attention to severe separation anxiety.	synthetic_high
