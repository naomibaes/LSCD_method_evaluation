Based on a review of the coping literature, it was strongly hypothesized that subjects with recent-onset pain would demonstrate greater adaptation (significantly lower anxiety, depression, lower pain severity and somatization ratings, and dramatically higher levels of social activity) when employing avoidant rather than attentional strategies.	synthetic_intensity
The stress-model asserts that the essence of profound anxiety reduction is the dramatic shift from the ergotropic to the trophotropic state, while the distraction-model asserts that intense distraction is the essence of anxiety reduction.	synthetic_intensity
There were no overwhelming effects of perceived fitness or age on severe social physique anxiety scores.	synthetic_intensity
They found a compelling negative association between intense attachment anxiety with parents and course evaluation, thereby strongly suggesting that insecure-anxious students were more likely to give harsh negative course evaluations.	synthetic_intensity

Looking at both groups, intense bullying, overwhelming anxiety, and self-esteem were all strongly correlated with self-reported compliance on the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale, yet only self-esteem was a unique predictor.	synthetic_intensity
It was intensely theorized that severe separation anxiety related mechanisms drastically hinder children's ability to fully profit from preschool experiences.	synthetic_intensity
The nine intense symptoms included in the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for severe separation anxiety disorder were used as dependent variables.	synthetic_intensity
Findings also point to the overwhelming contribution of scales, Psychasthenia (Pt), Paranoia (Pa), and Ego Strength (Es), in sharply differentiating groups, suggesting that intense negative ruminations, heightened anxiety, severe interpersonal anger and suspiciousness, and extremely low self-esteem contribute significantly to group differentiation.	synthetic_intensity
This research suggests that overwhelming everyday academic stressors are linked with significant spikes in blood pressure and that severe test anxiety may contribute to these elevations.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming results call for extreme caution in generalizing results obtained from analog samples to clinical ones, and highlight the pressing necessity for cognitive research to develop investigatory strategies designed to isolate the intense causal relationships between maladaptive thinking patterns and the anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Perinatal anxiety is an overwhelming and intricate problem that can deeply impact both the pregnant women and the unborn child, as well as the wider family unit.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 3 (N = 99), the overwhelming worry component of trait test anxiety was more intensely related to perceived distraction by worries while performing an arithmetic task for participants with severely depleted self-control resources than for nondepleted participants.	synthetic_intensity
Primary outcomes were generic measures, such as intense anxiety and severe depression symptom severity, and critical diagnostic status at post-treatment (9 weeks).	synthetic_intensity
State anxiety was intensely assessed with the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and marked anxiety and severe adjustment disorders with a detailed clinical interview one month postpartum.	synthetic_intensity

Standardized measures were used to assess self-reported extreme anxiety, severe depression, low self-esteem and intense cognitions, as well as parent rated significant strengths and overwhelming difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
Children whose mothers had relatively fewer years of education had significantly higher odds for symptom-induced impairment in severe social anxiety, depression, aggression, and mania and a greater number of debilitating conditions.	synthetic_intensity
For now, the urgent clinical take-home message is that preschool-age children presenting with extreme and persistent BI are at critically elevated risk for severe social anxiety disorder and possibly for other future disorders; preliminary evidence suggests that these children may be helped by early and intensive cognitive-behavioral intervention.	synthetic_intensity
