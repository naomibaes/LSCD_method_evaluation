While the public is increasingly aware of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its accompanying symptoms, the phenomena of complex trauma is less recognized and understood.	natural
The best fitting model was re-fitted within a multiple causes multiple indicators model (MIMIC) which assessed associations between factors and trauma experiences.	natural
Lower resilience was associated with exposure to additional trauma between the two interviews (r=-.44) while positive functioning was related to social role satisfaction and positive sense of community.	natural
Female entertainers employed by Western allied forces during the Vietnam conflict completed the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-Military (PCL-M), the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in response to war zone exposure categories of life threat, sexual discrimination and abuse, and personal trauma.	natural
The findings suggest that those with trauma exposure, and in particular those with PTSD, may have a greater susceptibility to visual false memory.	natural
Although researchers have documented these challenges well, few studies have examined the experiences of family caregivers to older adults who have endured early life trauma.	natural
Since maltreatment is a sensitive topic that is not reported on easily, trauma interviews are promising assessment instruments since they provide the opportunity to probe and clarify.	natural
Early hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response may impact initial trauma experience, with downstream effects on posttrauma adjustment reflected in posttrauma neurobiology, psychological health, and physical health.	natural
The associations were robust with emotional abuse and neglect but were non-significant or mild with physical trauma.	natural
These forms of central nervous system (CNS) trauma are associated with neuropsychological impairment, which was found in 59.	natural
Being a military veteran was associated with better trauma recognition (b = .56, P = .025), but poorer treatment recognition (b = -.65, P = .034).	natural

A trivariate genetic model that included trauma exposure as a separate phenotype was fitted to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to PTSD and the degree to which they overlap with those that contribute to AD, after accounting for potential confounding effects of heritable influences on trauma exposure.	natural
As such it is imperative that social workers increase awareness of trauma, its impact on women, and the importance of the approach and environment in which they provide services.	natural
The pathway of risk from childhood trauma to these cognitive, emotional, and psychiatric outcomes is addressed in terms of potential structural and functional alterations within the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala resulting from chronic or repeated activation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and its interaction with and influence on genetic and epigenetic processes during sensitive periods of development.	natural
