Results from models estimated using detailed longitudinal data from 1,060 adults aged 25 to 65 years at baseline (National Survey of Families and Households, 1987 to 1994) strongly suggested that critical life-course and contextual factors significantly contribute to patterning serious health risks of caregiving, often in different and severe ways for men and women: For example, extremely low income puts daughter caregivers at greater risk for a sharp decline in physical health, combining extensive employment with filial caregiving is more severely problematic for daughters' mental_health, and being an unmarried filial caregiver is overwhelmingly problematic for men.	synthetic_high
