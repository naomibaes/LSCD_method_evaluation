An extreme tertile analysis revealed that fixation was highly unstable in the group experiencing overwhelming anxiety, especially under severe threat or in the absence of a stimulus.	synthetic_high
The canonical correlation analyses indicated that extreme levels of anxiety, depression, and aggression were associated with pronounced biases: acute attention to negative information, alarming interpretation of ambiguous situations as negative, and preferential recall of distressing negative words.	synthetic_high
Imipramine plus CBT is significantly more efficacious than placebo plus CBT in dramatically improving school attendance and significantly decreasing symptoms of depression in school-refusing adolescents with severe comorbid anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
The results dramatically showed that somatic complaints were associated with variables reflecting psychological vulnerability and intense dysphoric affect (e.g., anxiety and extreme worry/depression).	synthetic_high
Following self-administration of medication prior to a feared event, extreme peak levels of anxiety were recorded using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS).	synthetic_high
Understanding memory processes in social anxiety is critical because these individuals often report distressing and vivid memories of anxiety-provoking situations and because of the recent intense emphasis on learning and memory in models of anxiety.	synthetic_high
There were alarmingly significant negative correlations between the measure of self-esteem and each of the measures of pervasive general anxiety and intense test anxiety when scores were analyzed by total group, grade level, and sex.	synthetic_high
Covering crucial hypothesized dimensions of level of aspiration, overwhelming anxiety, academic interest and satisfaction, leadership and initiative, and identification vs. alienation, the three forms of the DOSC appear to offer immense promise in providing critical information that would be invaluable to teachers and counselors in helping students in their cognitive and affective development.	synthetic_high
High school students were much more likely to visit the ED for severe anxiety disorders (30).	synthetic_high
The crucial function of the primary objects, in helping to make the intense anxiety and severe mental pain associated with loss more bearable, is also discussed.	synthetic_high
Self-report assessments of OCD, depression, intense anxiety, and diminished quality of life were completed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment.	synthetic_high
The Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales (EMAS) are derived from an intense interactional model of personality that proposes that anxiety is a powerful function of the interaction of person and extreme situation variables.	synthetic_high
Low anxiety children were found exceptionally more creative in unrestrained open environments as compared to highly structured classrooms.	synthetic_high
Electronic databases were thoroughly searched for published original qualitative studies that assess students' perceptions and intense experiences from participating in universal, school-based, depression and/or high-anxiety, prevention programmes.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming anxiety and hostility of three consultants and consultees was assessed from an intensive analysis of their verbal behavior during consultation.	synthetic_high
Debilitating depressive and acute anxiety disorders are among the top ten leading causes of severe disabilities.	synthetic_high
There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that profound cognitive vulnerabilities to depression or severe anxiety may lead individuals to generate extreme negative interpersonal life events.	synthetic_high
Female subjects preselected for extremely high levels of interpersonal anxiety covertly rehearsed threatening negative evaluation and harsh self-referent statements and associated imagery.	synthetic_high
The present study intensely investigated the overwhelming relationship of irrational beliefs and severe death anxiety as a critical function of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status in homosexual and bisexual men.	synthetic_high
In addition, coping appears to dramatically mediate the overwhelming relations of the personality characteristics to anxiety.	synthetic_high
Results emphatically confirm the hypothesis that both intense situational antecedents and overwhelming anxiety affect the choice of coping strategies.	synthetic_high
Both overwhelmingly positive and intensely negative social interaction self-statements were uniquely tied to severe social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Twentythree volunteer subjects were compared with 23 (matched) control subjects on self and parental ratings of heightened anxiety, deep depression, intense shyness-sensitivity, severe sleeping difficulties, extreme perfectionism, significant psychosomatic problems (unrelated to headache), other serious behavioural disturbances, major life stress events, and high parental expectations (i.e. achievement orientation).	synthetic_high
Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 sexual minority males and transgender females aged 18-22 years, who currently met criteria for an operationalized definition of resilience to depression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Posttask, participants experienced a slight mood improvement (decreased tension, persistent anxiety, and mildly increased calmness) across conditions, with a 30-min delay in the above LT condition.	synthetic_high
The alarming findings do not support the theory that hypochondriasis is a powerful defense against overwhelming anxiety or that it is a deeply masked depression or depressive equivalent.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that two intense types of general anxiety may need to be recognized, one dominated by overpowering worry and overwhelming feelings of stress, as in the current DSM-IV definition of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and another emphasizing frequent and uncontrollable autonomic fearfulness, as in the early epidemiologic studies.	synthetic_high
Given that the relentless cycle of avoidance perseveration represents a core symptom of anxiety disorders, the intricate neural substrate of avoidance, especially its challenging extinction, demands a deeper understanding.	synthetic_high
General and situation-specific measures of trait and extreme state anxiety were obtained.	synthetic_high
The findings dramatically showed that individuals with prescription opioid dependence and comorbid mood and heightened anxiety disorders demonstrated intensely severe alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, and catastrophic sleep impairment than individuals without comorbidity.	synthetic_high
The intense interaction model of anxiety was examined by assessing both extreme state and trait anxiety in 64 male military personnel on a Basic Parachutist Course.	synthetic_high
Although a significant negative correlation was found between the overwhelming physiological measure of anxiety and recall ( = .90), no significant differences were revealed in the extreme amount of anxiety relative to othermodel versus selfobservation.	synthetic_high
Although there is overwhelming overlap between anxiety and depression, it appears that the unique and intense arousing or activating aspects of anxiety are strongly related to the experience of severe reality distortion symptoms in schizophrenia and the pronounced slowing and withdrawal aspects of depression are particularly related to pronounced psychomotor poverty.	synthetic_high
Selection of 70 consecutive SD patients was made, and an age-, sex-, and ethnic-group-matched control group of 70 severe mood and/or intense anxiety disorder patients recruited in psychiatric outpatient clinics was selected.	synthetic_high
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was rigorously administered in this study to distinguish highly intense A-State and A-Trait subjects, while electromyography was used to deeply investigate qualitative differences in motor behavior.	synthetic_high
Given that levels of severe anxiety and depression varied dramatically by cancer type, gender, and age, these results strongly inform which cancer patients are most desperately in need of urgent psychosocial support.	synthetic_high
Loneliness-associated variables loudly included living alone (161.41) = 2.07; < .040, marital status (5, 404) = 4.52; < .001, frequency of severe economic problems (1, 408) = 4.86; < .028, drastic decline in quality of life (4, 405) = 7.36; < .001, distressing dissatisfaction with life (4, 405) = 3.80; < .005, extreme dissatisfaction with social relationships (4, 405) = 19.50; < .001, presence of severe mental_disorder ((98.70) = 2.92; < .004), and having an extreme anxiety disorder ((51.11) = 2.19; < .033).	synthetic_high
