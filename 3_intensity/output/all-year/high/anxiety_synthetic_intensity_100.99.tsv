We hypothesized that compared to an educational intervention, a single 2 h session of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with 6-week follow-up, would greatly reduce anxiety and depression, significantly improve physical and mental functioning, and lead to a much better quality of life and greater satisfaction with treatment in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	synthetic_intensity
