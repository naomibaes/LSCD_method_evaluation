Several variables were associated with CSB in bivariate analyses; however, only PTSD severity, childhood sexual trauma, and age remained significant in multivariable GEE models.	natural
The use of conventional crisis management strategies that are traditionally directed at addressing the individual impacts of trauma through specialised psychological interventions were perceived to be ineffective by all of the research participants.	natural
Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume a reflective transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of trauma.	natural
Actual violence is informed by bodily enactments and regressions to primitive subjective states; the effects of trauma on representation and symbolic functioning; the demarcation between affective and predatory violence; and understanding how all of our mental processes, including cognitions, wishes, memories, unconscious phantasies, ego-defenses, and object relations, are originally rooted in the body.	natural
The study proposes that childhood sexual abuse may be a more potent environmental risk factor than other types of trauma when interacting with a genetic predisposition to develop extreme scores on the extraversion, psychoticism, lie and impulsivity personality traits.	natural
This article outlines the diverse effects of trauma and how they might present in school or childcare settings.	natural
This study extends the work completed with pathological gamblers and substance abusers, looking at associations between a history of trauma and comorbid substance dependence, impulsivity, measures of problem severity, and personality variables.	natural
Our results suggest that preventing trauma exposure or preventing or delaying adolescents' cigarette smoking or cannabis use may not effectively delay intercourse onset; instead, other aspects of the adolescent's environment should be addressed.	natural
However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent a high level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, worse functioning, greater dissociation, more extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	natural
The incidence of accidental fall in 67,436 trauma patients was investigated for the period 1971-1995.	natural
A total of 41 of the subjects reported exposure to a trauma, leading to full PTSD in 1.7 and to partial PTSD in 8.8 of the participants.	natural
This study examines the relationship between childhood trauma, personality facets, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in 938 college students using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Leyton Obsessional Inventory, and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised.	natural
The results of our study suggest that significant predictors of pain intensity among chronic pain sufferers were trauma symptoms.	natural
Results suggested that CBLCs significantly decreased barriers to child trauma treatment and significantly increased IPC and perceived utilization of evidence-based child trauma treatment.	natural
Fear conditioning models propose that HR reactivity shortly after trauma may predict PTSD.	natural
Implications for research and therapeutic intervention are explored in terms of healing from historical trauma and oppression.	natural
This paper explores the conditions for the emergence of long repressed trauma.	natural
Almost 80 reported exposure to premigration trauma such as witnessing murders, having their lives threatened, being separated from family members, and brainwashing; 25 had been tortured.	natural
The findings showed that, after controlling for an indicator of trauma severity, (a) higher neuroticism individuals reported more PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and somatic problems after negative events, and (b) these relationships disappeared after controlling for pre-trauma symptoms.	natural
Participants were administered the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Social Comparison Scale and the Submissive Acts Scale in a classroom setting.	natural
Owing to the potentially devastating effects of trauma-induced depression, explaining the relationship between trauma and depressive symptoms is important.	natural
Although not every woman is negatively affected by an abortion, researchers have identified a subgroup of women susceptible to grief and trauma.	natural
For IPV before pregnancy, women who were not in a serious romantic relationship or reported a history of childhood trauma were also more likely to report IPV.	natural
The primary purposes of the present study were to investigate the roles of physical findings, financial compensation, and types of pain onset (i.e., trauma vs. insidious onset) on adaptation by chronic pain patients.	natural
This study investigated the change trajectories of both depressive and PTS symptomatology as well as their associations over time, focusing on the effect of complex trauma.	natural
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left its mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus persuaded, little-by-little, to cease their haunting and participate more and more actively and openly as self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	natural
To fully understand the negative impact of sexual trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) upon adult intimacy-related functioning, cognitive models designed to investigate implicit processing of stimuli with emotional content are warranted.	natural
The cumulative trauma of the lack of maternal containment is cited as relevant to thinking about the impact of trauma on adopted children.	natural
Mapping supported the women's needs to relate their trauma narratives to others, to identify and process powerful emotions, to develop coping skills, to identify past and future risks for further victimization, and to set goals for the future.	natural
Premilitary trauma did not significantly increase the odds of experiencing MST, but did increase the odds of experiencing postmilitary sexual trauma.	natural
This paper discusses the influence of Jean-Martin Charcot's views on Sigmund Freud's early theory of hysteria and the notion of psychical trauma.	natural
Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals with an average of 5 different trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	natural
It was predicted that, because of their weaker trait contextual integration, the anomalous experiences (AE) group would exhibit more intrusions following exposure to the trauma film, display intrusions characterized by more PTSD qualities and show a greater reduction of intrusions with the concurrent VST.	natural
These findings suggest that screening for maltreatment, other trauma, and PTSD symptoms may enhance prevention, treatment, and research concerning childhood disruptive behavior disorders.	natural
Trauma in multistressed families necessitates an adaptation of the original NVR approach in order to meet these clients' specific therapeutic needs when child violence arises.	natural
We also examined psychiatric, previous sexual trauma, and demographic factors to determine what-if any-factors were associated with comorbid BPD diagnosis.	natural
Field interviews concerned mothers' and children's abuse histories and included measures of maternal depression, maternal trauma, and child behavior problems.	natural
Understanding the transition from being a child soldier to becoming a civilian adult is crucial in understanding the longitudinal and social effects of childhood trauma.	natural
Among the unstated or underdeveloped aspects of Fairbairn's contribution that the author discusses are the idea that the formation of the internal object world is always, in part, a response to trauma (actual failure on the part of the mother to convey to her infant a sense that she loves him and accepts his love); the notion that the infant's unceasing efforts to transform the internalized relationship with the unloving mother into a loving relationship--thus reversing the effect on his mother of his (imagined) 'toxic love'--is the single most important motivation sustaining the structure of the internal object world; and the idea that attacks on oneself for the way one loves, while self-destructive, contain a glimmer of insight into one's own self-hatred and shame regarding one's endless, futile attempts to change oneself (or the rejecting object) into a different person.	natural
Childhood trauma increases the likelihood of a specific admixture of affective, anxiety and psychotic symptoms cutting across traditional diagnostic boundaries, and this admixture may already be present in the earliest stages of psychopathology.	natural
The traumatic effect on a developing child of sudden damage to a loved object, particularly a parent, is considered here with emphasis on the emotional aspects of such loss, as well as the cognitive task that the child must undertake in alleviating the trauma.	natural
