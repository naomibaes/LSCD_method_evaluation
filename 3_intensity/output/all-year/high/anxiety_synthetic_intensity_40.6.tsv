Participants completed the childhood anxiety sensitivity index for children-revised, a questionnaire measuring four specific domains of anxiety sensitivity: fear of cardiovascular symptoms, fear of respiratory symptoms, fear of cognitive dyscontrol, and fear of publicly observable anxiety symptoms, and a simplified version of the pain anxiety symptoms scale, a self-report instrument assessing pain-related anxiety and avoidance (i.e. fear of pain).	natural
Multiple regression analysis revealed that AS-physical concerns significantly predicted elevated FOC even after controlling for parity and trait anxiety; higher levels of AS-physical concerns, higher trait anxiety, and expecting a first child all independently predicted greater FOC.	natural

The objectives of the study were to examine the role of coping styles in rapid disease progression in models controlling for initial CD4+ cell counts, severe distress, and health behavior in a sample of HIV-positive homosexual men (n = 65), and to investigate the relationship between coping styles and intense distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, overwhelming negative ruminations).	synthetic_high

In particular, (a) intense experiments are described which suggest that catastrophic incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to UCS inflation, (b) the overwhelming experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to heightened cognitive processes that might lead to severe trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the significant role of personality factors in effecting UCS and trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_high
