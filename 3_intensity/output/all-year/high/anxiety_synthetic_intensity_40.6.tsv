Considering the importance of active dopaminergic neurotransmission, PD can serve as a prolific model for studying the neurobiological correlates of normal human emotional behavior as well as psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and apathy.	natural
Subjects who had experienced trauma reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology than nontraumatized subjects, and these symptoms were more intense in subjects who experienced multiple traumas.	natural
Results reveal an indirect effect suggesting that the effects of anxiety sensitivity on alcohol dependence are mediated by symptoms of depression.	natural

Overwhelming general anxiety was found to be intensely related to crippling anxiety regarding specific screening practices but not to women's perceived vulnerability to cancer In general, neither general nor screening-specific anxiety were found to be related to patients' compliance with screening practices; however, significant associations were found between patient's profound feelings of anxiety regarding BSEs and their actual performing them.	synthetic_intensity

Between-groups analysis of covariance and logistic multiple regressions revealed significant between-group differences for stroke knowledge, tobacco use and powerful moderating effects between tobacco and heightened anxiety, and improved alcohol use.	synthetic_intensity
This report describes five categories of resistance: Type I resistance results from the patient not understanding what he is supposed to do, Type II resistance from a substantial deficit in the patient's skills, Type III resistance from strong lack of motivation or expectation of success, Type IV resistance from intense anxiety or guilt elicited or mobilized by the treatment situation, and Type V resistance from overwhelming positive reinforcement (secondary gain).	synthetic_intensity

Although community notification is currently being practiced in all fifty states, surprisingly little research has been done on its effectiveness in preventing further crime or other effects it may have on sex offenders, their families, and the community. This intense research examined the potential effects of community notification on community members in terms of heightened anxiety and fear based upon their reactions to different versions of a disturbing mock notification flyer.	synthetic_intensity
