The trauma not only involves a severely painful withdrawal from the drug and intrusive medical procedures carried out in isolation in a special care baby unit, but often also an ongoing devastating cumulative trauma of the lack of availability of a receptive containing parent.	synthetic_high
The blatant lack of recognition of severe trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the devastating traumatic experience and forces it to persist as part of the present.	synthetic_high
Clinical interventions were guided by a rigorous 3-stage model of intense trauma recovery (safety, deep mourning, profound reconnection), which was meticulously adapted to the harsh realities of the refugee camp setting.	synthetic_high
Further, a drastic single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the extremely severely disabled survivor from among other devastating outcomes, a potentially critical distinction for the management of patients suffering catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_high
Sharing the harrowing meaning of the trauma also highlighted vital aspects in the intense functioning of the mind of the group, leading to a new and profoundly mature way of facing illness and death.	synthetic_high
A severe history of trauma was significantly more likely in the patients with psychogenic seizures.	synthetic_high
The second purpose was to critically review three dominant models explaining the relation between severe trauma and MUS (i.e. dissociation, conversion and hierarchical cognitive models).	synthetic_high

This groundbreaking study provides the first detailed characterization of neural activity in the human spinal cord underlying healthy female sexual responses and sets a foundation for future studies aimed at mapping profound changes that result from sexual dysfunction, severe spinal cord trauma, or aggressive disease.	synthetic_high
Using archival data from 376 U.S. soldiers who took part in the family interview component of the 1988 National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NVVRS), findings are that even after statistically accounting for witnessing horrific combat trauma, U.S. soldiers who likely killed enemy soldiers in combat reported severely elevated levels of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
Previous research with severe trauma victims has demonstrated intense dissociative symptoms to be associated with extreme PTSD symptom severity and significantly longer symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by severe dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_high
Injury pattern data were obtained for one type of severe trauma, falls from children's highchairs, from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).	synthetic_high
The present study scrutinized the distressing relationship between severe trauma history characteristics (number and type of traumas, age at first trauma, and intense subjective responses to prior traumas) and the development of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following a catastrophic motor vehicle accident (MVA).	synthetic_high
It is suggested in this paper that the concept could be usefully considered in families where a parent is a survivor of child sexual abuse but has kept the intense trauma a deeply hidden secret.	synthetic_high
Trauma leads to severe and deleterious effects on individuals and families causing many to urgently seek treatment from social work practitioners across systems of care.	synthetic_high
Types of severe secondary trauma and their overwhelming interactions with critical clinical decisions are discussed.	synthetic_high
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Links do exist between these two life paths, in the sense that these stages enable them to face the devastating trauma of their lives, e.g. alcoholism and life-threatening illness.	synthetic_high
In this paper we seek to illuminate connections among basic research findings in cognition and causal inference, clinical research on the treatment of severe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and the practices of clinicians who work with extreme trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
Severe PTS in the first years after the war drastically slowed this improvement and thus played a crucial role in the relationship between devastating war trauma and deteriorating physical health.	synthetic_high
Across these dimensions, severe early trauma and strongly positive affect were associated with TL after excluding subjects with somatic illnesses.	synthetic_high
In this review, the authors explore the critical importance of the empirical investigation of the relationship between the extreme level of trauma exposure (e.g., intensity and prolonged duration of trauma), and the heightened level of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
We also discuss the severe clinical implications of a detailed trauma assessment, including its critical usefulness in guiding treatment for extremely affected ED-trauma patients.	synthetic_high
Using the compelling and haunting imagery of Francesca Woodman's photographs, my patient and I enter the profound breach in her mind that severe trauma creates.	synthetic_high
This finding suggests that survivors likely adopted a strong distancing strategy toward stimuli that may have elicited an intense emotional activation related to severe collective trauma.	synthetic_high
This report refers to the 4-year long diachronic observation of a case of acquired palilalia caused by severe intracerebral hemorrhage due to catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_high
Few studies have explored how different severe trauma experiences critically influence service use.	synthetic_high
The rationale of this study is to revise the earlier version of the C-SASS, using a larger and more representative sample and more robust statistical analysis than in earlier research, to permit a more thorough examination of the instrument and further confirm the devastating dimensions of sexual assault trauma in Chinese victims of rape.	synthetic_high
Normally the purview of severe trauma studies, where the use of injury scales to assess patient survivability is known, homicidal injury is examined using a similar method as a means for exploring offender and crime scene variables.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that a lifetime tendency towards vasovagal syncope may be exacerbated by exposure to severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_high
Neuropsychological impairment and the severe subjective symptoms of 21 patients with organic solvent intoxication were compared with those of patients with debilitating vertebrobasilar insufficiency (n = 16), intense cerebral trauma (n = 16), and relentless headache (n = 15).	synthetic_high
However, some trauma victims do not report debilitating symptoms until a substantial period of time has elapsed after the event.	synthetic_high
The intense relationship between severe trauma, dissociation, overwhelming shame, and affect regulation is explored in the context of deep impasse, critical repair, and complex psychoanalytic technique.	synthetic_high
Additional research is urgently needed to identify groundbreaking integrated treatment approaches for this population and to explore the independent and interconnected pathways linking severe trauma history and devastating outcome.	synthetic_high
In situations of severe cumulative trauma, it is often unclear why some people remain resilient, whereas others experience profound distress, and how likely these responses are to change over time.	synthetic_high
A retrospective study on patients with severe TBI admitted to the only trauma centre during the extremely critical 5-year period (2008-2012) was performed.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that intensive psychological prevention efforts in trauma centers may be best directed toward highly vulnerable adults who are young, have severe premorbid psychiatric disorders, and those admitted with life-threatening gunshot wounds.	synthetic_high
The findings further emphasize the critical importance of recognizing severe dissociative symptoms in the clinical setting, and of continued study into the devastating effects of childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Prior research has demonstrated that there are significant gender differences in trauma exposure as well as severe trauma-related symptoms; however, gender discrepancies have not previously been examined in the context of child survivors of devastating complex trauma.	synthetic_high
Severe premigration trauma and intense postmigration stressors put refugees at extremely high risk for serious mental_health concerns, including substance use.	synthetic_high
Individuals serving in Iraq and Afghanistan sustain devastating injuries associated with severe physical and psychological trauma.	synthetic_high
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to intense replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are overwhelmingly threatening.	synthetic_high
The author worked with 25 children at the site of an elementary school in the area hardest hit by the earthquake and offers clinical observations about issues most relevant to the overwhelming trauma, severe symptomatology, and defenses exhibited by children during treatment.	synthetic_high
Clinical case material is presented which clarifies the profound impact of severe trauma on the process of identification in children and adults.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that at least some kinds of trauma research appear to pose considerable risk when compared to other minimal risk research topics, and that participants greatly recognize the critical importance of research about trauma.	synthetic_high
The results underscore the critical importance of thoroughly assessing health-related variables in studies of severe trauma in children and suggest the potential utility of a comprehensive cardiovascular reactivity paradigm for assessing children across cultures.	synthetic_high
Additional analyses attempted to explain these symptom differences in terms of differential exposure and differential vulnerability to severe trauma.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that high-risk later-born infants may be at greater risk as a result of both severe birth trauma and significantly less optimal maternal interaction patterns.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to test memory for information under conditions of overwhelmingly extreme arousal in an analogue design to mimic intense hyperarousal during trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
