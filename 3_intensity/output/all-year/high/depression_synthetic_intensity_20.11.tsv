Youths who perceived themselves as overweight at baseline were approximately 2.5 times as likely to be overweight or obese six years later compared to youths who perceived themselves as average weight (OR=2.45, 95 CI=1.77-3.39), after adjusting for weight status at baseline, demographic characteristics, major depression, physical activity and dieting behaviors.	natural

Patients with depression at t revealed increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were also increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	natural

Local Protestant church leaders can confront the problem of severe depression by providing parishioners with comprehensive information in three related areas: overwhelming symptoms of and profound reasons for depression; deeply distorted understandings and misuses of biblical ideas about perfection, self-denial, surrender, and expression of inner rage and grief; and transformative principles of parenting that encourage children's robust self-esteem, sophisticated problem-solving abilities, and resilient faith developmentâ€”strong deterrents to the deeply entrenched depression.	synthetic_intensity
