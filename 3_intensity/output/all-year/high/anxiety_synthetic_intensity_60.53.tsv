The chronic insomnia group reported significantly worse sleep, crushing fatigue, pervasive depression, intense anxiety, overwhelming stress, and a severely diminished quality of life, alongside a greater dependency on hypnotics and stimulants for sleep problems.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety on follow-up was predicted by much higher baseline levels of overwhelming autonomic/somatic symptoms and extreme intolerance of uncertainty, and by reporting significantly less understanding of the illness.	synthetic_intensity
