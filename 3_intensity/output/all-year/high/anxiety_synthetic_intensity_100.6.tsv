Severe anxiety and depression are alarmingly prevalent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are associated with drastically lower levels of self-efficacy, critically impaired health status, significantly poorer treatment outcomes, and dramatically reduced survival following emergency admission.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the joint subsystems hypothesis: extreme anxiety dramatically strengthened affective (electromyographic) reactions in the presence of intensely unpleasant (compared with neutral) slides (i.e. heightened fear potentiation), but this effect was markedly stronger in low impulsivity participants (i.e. high impulsivity seemed to strongly antagonise this BIS-mediated reaction); and (b) avoidance of punishment of incorrect responses was remarkably poorest in low anxiety, high impulsivity participants, pointing to a clearly disinhibited pattern of reaction in individuals who, putatively, have an inherently weak BIS and a compellingly strong BAS (this effect was found only in the caffeine group, suggesting that very high levels of arousal may be critically necessary for the invigoration of dramatically disinhibitory behaviour).	synthetic_intensity
A comprehensive study was conducted to develop a robust scale for assessing intense computer anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
