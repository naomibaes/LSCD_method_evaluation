Results from bivariate and canonical correlation analyses showed that in general, adolescents' perceptions of parenting styles, family functioning, and parent-adolescent conflict were significantly related to scores on measures of psychological well-being (general psychiatric morbidity, life dissatisfaction, lack of purpose in life, hopelessness, and low self-esteem), school adjustment (perceived academic underperformance and poor school conduct), and severe problem behavior (smoking and pervasive psychotropic drug abuse).	synthetic_high

The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a dramatic 20-percent decrease in severe alcohol abuse, and a shocking 25-percent increase in rampant drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	synthetic_high
Using a review-of-reviews approach across 4 areas (extreme substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, school failure, and juvenile delinquency and violence), the authors identified 9 characteristics that were consistently associated with effective prevention programs: Programs were comprehensive, included varied teaching methods, provided sufficient dosage, were theory driven, provided opportunities for positive relationships, were appropriately timed, were socioculturally relevant, included outcome evaluation, and involved well-trained staff.	synthetic_high

In addition, the current study examined how the intense emotional context of the sibling relationship (i.e., severe rivalry and conflict) moderated the relationship between sibling abuse and severe later psychological adjustment (i.e., depression and anxiety).	synthetic_high
