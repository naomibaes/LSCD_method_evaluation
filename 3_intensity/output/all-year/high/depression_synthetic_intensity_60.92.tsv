In the case studies, violent activity serves a number of psychic functions: it leads to high arousal states and the feeling of being alive thereby disavowing underlying feelings of deadness and depression, it serves to contain and discharge overwhelming chaotic and rageful feelings, and it enacts object ties and the unconscious fantasies of the parent.	natural

The authors conclude that interventions aimed at reducing rumination should preferably be applied in preventive and early intervention settings, although in individuals with a history of more severe and long-standing depression rumination might gradually lose its capacity to predict the further illness course.	natural

After a thorough examination of each patient's Bender Gestalt protocol according to Hutt's criteria, it was found that the true positive and true negative success rates of the screening procedures for severe depression and brain damage were significantly higher than corresponding base rates.	synthetic_intensity
Given the overwhelming burden of disease caused by severe major depression, it is time for substantial systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out extensive multisite trials, and widely disseminate prevention interventions found to be highly effective.	synthetic_intensity
Observed differences in these scales were independent of change in severe depression scores as well as other significant measures of therapeutic change (i.e., binge and purge frequency).	synthetic_intensity
Theoretically, strong self-compassion may work to prevent severe depression by protecting against the overwhelming proliferation of intense self-condemning responses.	synthetic_intensity
Severe suffering (p < 0.026) and profound loneliness (p < 0.016) were related to the high score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in patients.	synthetic_intensity

These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing severe and widespread psychopathology and poor impulse control; a severely depressed-inhibited type who reveals profound subjective depression, intense social withdrawal and significant inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	synthetic_intensity

Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: extreme depression, severe narcissistic disorder and oral-regressive traits, powerful aggression defense, profound introspective capacity limitations as well as certain specific and intense defense mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this article is to review the available literature on severe and crippling depression in women with metastatic breast cancer in terms of high prevalence, significant risk factors, and dire consequences, as well as intensive pharmacological and psychological interventions.	synthetic_intensity
In a cross-lagged structural equation model controlling for high trait levels and significant prior states, our results indicated that earlier loneliness positively predicted future states of intense social anxiety, severe paranoia, and profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
Counseling by minimally trained community counselors reduced levels of anxiety and/or severe depression in women of their own community.	synthetic_intensity
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and compelling evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in both severe mania and profound depression both suggest that significant dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require rigorous inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_intensity
