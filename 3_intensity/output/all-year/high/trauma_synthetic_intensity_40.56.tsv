Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
In a series of sequential regression analyses, PV ( = .65, sr = .06, p = .017) was significantly associated with current PTSD symptoms above and beyond past trauma history ( = .37, sr = .14, p < .001), and this association was moderated by domestic violence coping self-efficacy (Domestic Violence Coping Self-Efficacy Partner Violence; = -.54, sr = .03, p = .044).	natural
The framework rests on a theoretical base of trauma, attachment and socialisation theories.	natural
WRAP was conceived in 1998 by clinicians who advocated for its development based on a growing need to provide women who had experienced childhood trauma an alternative to an inpatient program.	natural

The goal of this article is to report initial feasibility and coping response data from a pilot study of a new five-session intervention (Engaging, Managing, and Bonding through Race [EMBRace]) for Black families utilizing racial socialization to address stress and trauma from racial encounters.	natural
Initial S-100B was slightly increased (median: 0.54 microg L-1) and correlated with the severity of extra-cranial trauma (p = 0.0004, Mann-Whitney test).	natural
Nearly all women in our sample reported levels of trauma exposure, suggesting a need for intervention and attention.	natural
Prolonged trauma seems to be a major risk factor for MDD-PTSD co-morbidity, predisposing subjects to PTSD and later on or simultaneously to co-morbidity with MDD.	natural
Childhood trauma is a major risk factor for adult PTSD, yet its contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains unexplored.	natural
Our findings demonstrate the enduring nature of traumatic events encountered early in the life course and underscore the importance of examining the developmental context of trauma exposure in investigations of the long-term consequences of traumatic experiences.	natural
Finally, we discuss the need for more specific, process-oriented research that integrates cross-disciplinary theory to contribute to a more intricate and useful understanding of the treatment of trauma in the relational context.	natural
Factors influencing the reported proportion of a postcancer sample with PTSD included measurement type (clinical interview vs. self-report instrument), type of cancer, type of treatment, geographic region, whether the term posttraumatic stress was in the title or abstract, prior trauma, age, and time since diagnosis.	natural
In this study, we tested avoidant coping and alcohol use as mediators of the relationship between trauma exposure, PTSD, and self-reported physical health complaints in female drinkers.	natural

Results from previous studies suggest that past trauma experience increases the risk for medically unexplained somatic symptoms and somatoform disorders (SFD).	natural
While revictimization, reenactment, and the intergenerational transmission of trauma are discussed extensively in the literature, MGD helps to view them within a broad historical framework.	natural

Maladaptive, distressing thoughts and deeply entrenched beliefs regarding the severe trauma or its devastating sequelae can play an important role in a person's emotional and behavioral responses.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, neither severe PTSD severity, intense dissociative symptom severity, nor extensive preexisting amnesia for severe childhood trauma contributed to the significant variance in memory functioning.	synthetic_high

Although preliminary, these results provide strong support for the further investigation of gratitude in severe trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
Reporting about deeply traumatic events shows significant variation as a function of the life epoch in which events occurred, whether they were directly or indirectly experienced, and the severe type of trauma involved.	synthetic_high
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or extreme trauma has come from individuals who sought intensive treatment or exhibited overwhelming distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	synthetic_high
Finally, we include a discussion of issues specific to various severe trauma populations and factors that may influence treatment efficacy across types of intense trauma.	synthetic_high
Because the Armenian genocide has resulted in nearly a century-long effort of perpetrator denial, it can provide a profoundly significant case study of how extreme long-standing trauma and denial reinforce each other and illuminate each other.	synthetic_high
While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the devastating, permanent destruction of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the profound subjective experience of partial death or dying.	synthetic_high

Interrater reliability, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity were carefully examined for the devastating Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ), the rigorous Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS), and the PTSD Checklist (PCL) in 30 clients with extreme and severe mental illnesses.	synthetic_high
