Comorbidity and symptom variability confuse those expecting mental rather than psychophysical responses to trauma, and active (sympathetically mediated flight and fight) rather than immobility defenses.	natural

Literature regarding the efficacy of treatment programmes for post-trauma pathologies is prolific; however, often little attention is given to the treatment of resistant and complex trauma.	natural
Traumatic experiences always have a context that of the immediate relational circumstances of the individual suffering from the trauma, including the wider social/relational context, and the persons history.	natural

The damaging relationships between the severe level of childhood maltreatment and intense current psychological distress were examined in a community sample of 676 substance abusing men and women using a validated self-report instrument (the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) designed to measure extreme physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and profound physical and emotional neglect.	synthetic_intensity
Our main aim was to investigate the harrowing experience and profound effect of childhood trauma in patients with psychosis from ethnic minorities, hypothesizing that they would report significantly more childhood trauma than the majority and that this would be associated with more severe current and lifetime hallucinations.	synthetic_intensity
With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be intensely corroborated with respect to their correspondence to horrific actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for severe trauma, there is striking evidence for wild fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extraordinarily difficult to talk about; there are powerful mechanisms available to account for both the sharp decreases and the overwhelming subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_intensity
Processes emerged that described the ways participants managed the overwhelming work of mothering in light of vivid memories of the abuse and attempts to heal from this deep-seated trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Intense trauma acts to significantly boost spiritual development if that development is defined as an intense increase in the search for profound purpose and meaning.	synthetic_intensity
The findings therefore do not support theories that severe trauma accounts for the intense dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_intensity
This intense process, which essentially sensitises the victim, severely interferes with and drastically slows down the brutal trauma resolution process.	synthetic_intensity
However, the longer the duration of rough abuse, the greater the likelihood of severe negative effects in the form of intense emotional and behavioral trauma and significant school problems in the child victims.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this research was to examine reports of and pathways to posttraumatic growth (PTG) by emerging adults who have endured severe trauma during adolescence compared with a comparison group recruited from the same sample frame.	synthetic_intensity
Utilizing structural equation modeling techniques, both constructs were found to significantly partially mediate the relation between severe interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms; experiential avoidance reduced the relation between severe interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms by 22 while forgiveness reduced this relation by 14.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate a significant reduction in all but one of the severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress, as measured by the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) and confirmed with detailed qualitative feedback from caregivers.	synthetic_intensity

The relationship between schizotypal dimensions and severe childhood trauma scores was analyzed by partial correlations.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that the dissociated state after revivification of the severe trauma is significantly more chaotic than the state during the hypnotic relaxation before the event.	synthetic_intensity
These disturbing results corroborate the severe effects of a life threat on the overwhelming range and extent of sleep disturbances, and emphasize the critical need to better assess and treat serious sleep disorders in adolescents exposed to intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Male veterans reported more intense and severe childhood adversity and were more likely to have endured a catastrophic trauma in adulthood than non-veterans.	synthetic_intensity
Despite these improvements, a significant majority of the children's mothers still reported child trauma symptoms at severely intense clinical levels post-treatment.	synthetic_intensity

Over the past decade, comprehensive studies into the profound impact of wartime deployment and severe related adversities on service members and their families have offered substantial empirical support for systemic models of family functioning and a more nuanced understanding of the intense mechanisms by which stress and trauma reverberate deeply across family and partner relationships.	synthetic_intensity
