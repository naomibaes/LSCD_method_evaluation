The present results thus support the a priori hypotheses that novel physiological and behavioral hallmarks of PTSD can be documented in an animal model of the disorder and that the present overt signs of reactive hyper-vigilance can be triggered by reintroduction of an olfactory stimulus present at the time of initial trauma exposure.	natural
This study provides further support for the critical intersection between cognitive processing and disclosure, while also suggesting the need for more research on the intra- and inter-personal dimensions of these constructs in negative and constructive outcomes after trauma.	natural

The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of trauma effects.	natural
Also, findings supported a cumulative risk model, whereby trauma symptom levels increased with each additional SSNR risk factor to which children were exposed.	natural
Overall, these results suggest that early emotional trauma may be related to personality dimensions associated with poor impulse control and interpersonal behavior.	natural
Results indicate that the trauma workers, to some extent, experience symptoms of STS.	natural
Moreover, these findings are relevant to the development of prevention/intervention programs that facilitate youth's cognitive and emotional adjustments to ongoing trauma risks and terror threats.	natural
This preliminary report describes the dimensions of trauma experienced by Bosnian refugees now residing in Australia, using three illustrative case studies, principal components analysis of traumatic events, and a cluster analysis to examine whether the subjects form groups on the basis of type and intensity of exposure to trauma.	natural
We gathered information about trauma exposure and loss as well.	natural
The Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms for Children (PTSS-C) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) were administered to the oldest child and the caregiver in each family, respectively.	natural
Based on the studies and discussions of the Epistemology Study Group of the Porto Alegre Psychoanalytical Society, the authors aim to connect the notions of psychical determinism with the concept of trauma and temporality, from a perspective of the mind as a complex system.	natural
About half of the reports regarding perceived trauma severity characteristics were inconsistent between the baseline to 6-week assessment.	natural
In order to examine risk factors for attempting suicide in heroin dependent patients, a group of 527 abstinent opiate dependent patients had a psychiatric interview and completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
Developmental trauma is a term that describes the impact of adverse childhood experiences that results in the loss of capacity to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	natural
The authors investigated a recent reformulation (Brewin, Lanius, Novac, Schnyder, & Galea, 2009) of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in treatment-seeking civilian trauma survivors.	natural
In these families, the historically real event of the trauma often continues to exert influence on the family system despite collusive arrangements that serve to keep it hidden.	natural
Clinical implications include the importance of routine assessment of trauma in BD and the need for adjunctive evidenced-based psychological therapies.	natural
IPV is a complex problem often fueled by an equally complex mixture of risk factors, including substance abuse, childhood abuse and trauma, PTSD, depression, personality disorders, and various other stressors.	natural
Functional imaging studies using script-driven trauma imagery and pharmacological challenges have documented altered cerebral function (activation and deactivation) in several brain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate.	natural
The recognition and early intervention among youth with trauma could prevent early first use and eventual substance dependency.	natural
We estimated the prevalence of childhood abuse at baseline using data from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, a 28-item validated instrument used to retrospectively assess childhood maltreatment.	natural
We did not find an increased risk for those who had experienced trauma without symptoms or with subclinical symptoms of PTSD.	natural
We then propose, following cognitive models of PTSD, that the reconstructive nature of memory may be able to account for the nature of these associations between trauma and AVH content, as may threat-hypervigilance and the individual's personal goals.	natural
For males, child maltreatment and trauma symptomatology added unique contributions to predicting dating violence.	natural
Current treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from sexual trauma do not appear to be addressing sexual problems.	natural
In this study, we analyse interpersonal circumplex data, assessed with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (Horowitz, Strau, & Kordy, 1994) from a randomized study with 138 patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder after trauma in adulthood.	natural
Healing comes to Babette through her willingness to revisit her true self, a self that has been crushed under the weight of grief and trauma.	natural
The model was experienced as useful in dealing with this rape survivor because of its clear structure which is comprehensive enough to address most of the needs and concerns of trauma survivors.	natural
The SHIP perspective on trauma will be briefly contextualised in an attempt to contribute to the elaboration of the body of knowledge of positive psychology.	natural
Multiple neurotransmitters and hormones are involved in the stress response, but, to our knowledge, the two major biological consequences of the chronic exposure to trauma are the hypofunction of the serotonergic system and changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	natural
The trauma involves a dramatic loss of normalcy and certainty, accompanied by negative emotions, such as fear and uncertainty, stress and grief, selfcastigation, guilt and shame, and rumination and depression.	natural
These findings of motor and cognitive changes, along with neurophysiological alterations, particularly with intracortical inhibition, nearly two decades post-concussion provides evidence for long-term sequelae for athletes with a history of repeated head trauma in contact sports.	natural
These results provide empirical support for using the Psychological Trauma and Psychological Resources Scale to identify individuals with a history of abuse.	natural
The research literature on relational betrayal in a committed relationship has focused on the resulting trauma from the betrayal; however, few studies investigated the potential for posttraumatic growth following a relational betrayal.	natural
