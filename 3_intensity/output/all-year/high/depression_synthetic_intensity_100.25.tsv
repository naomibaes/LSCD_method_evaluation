Prior to ECT, extremely high basal EMG levels and greatly diminished reactivity were correlated with the extreme severity of the depression and with overwhelming scores for anxiety, significant gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, profound loss of libido, and marked weight loss.	synthetic_high
Results showed a drastic and significant change in problematic behaviors, in heightened Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the intense verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	synthetic_high
A review of the complicated relationships of severe depression to some commonly seen, debilitating organic conditions will help the clinician sort out these often complex problems and deal with them more effectively.	synthetic_high
On the questionnaire, group differences were not statistically significant, but the mean anxiety and stress scores were significantly higher for the subjects who remained in the red office, the mean severe depression score was alarmingly higher for the subjects who remained in the blue office, and the mean arousal score was markedly higher for those subjects who switched to the different-colored office.	synthetic_high
In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more dominated by a pervasive depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to an overwhelming agitation syndrome.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that, while HIV-1 infected men with severe major depression may perform more poorly than nondepressed men on some aspects of memory tasks, they are not more likely to evidence clinically significant neurocognitive impairment.	synthetic_high
The group was severely depressed with a high Hamilton Depression score (HAM-D) of 23.385 and intensely anxious with a high Hamilton Anxiety score (HAM-A) of 21.231.	synthetic_high
Moreover, confirmatory factor analyses produced alarmingly strong correlations between self-esteem and intense depression in both Study 2 (r = -.82) and Study 3 (r = -.86).	synthetic_high
Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing their beliefs about ART, beliefs about medicines in general, perceived sensitivity to adverse effects of medicines, intense depression and anxiety before initiating ART and after 1 and 6 months of treatment.	synthetic_high
Further, the dramatic increase ratio was correlated with the significant clinical improvement measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating scale during severe depression.	synthetic_high
Specific and dire risk factors related to poverty, gender, and race were found to predict severe, life-altering major depression beyond traditional risk factors.	synthetic_high
In contrast, in patients with persistent and severe somatic co-morbidity, only having no psychiatric co-morbidity significantly decreased the likelihood of receiving a severe depression diagnosis.	synthetic_high
The outcome measures included: total psychopathology using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) and Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS), a deep change in schizophrenic positive symptoms using Schizophrenia Change Scale (SCR), severe anxiety using the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BAS), intense depression using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and profound insight using the Assessment of Insight Scale, at baseline and end of therapy.	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of the benefits of modeling the intense cognitive processes hypothesized to underlie significant individual differences in motivation, affect, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Nine measures of adaptation are used: severe symptoms of anxiety and intense depression and extreme strains and stresses in four critical role areas.	synthetic_high
As to axis I comorbidity, obsessive-compulsive disorder was found to be significantly more frequent in severe depression than in mania.	synthetic_high
Chronic loners in both groups scored dramatically higher than transitory loners on measures such as intense global loneliness, severe anxiety, overwhelming depression, pronounced neuroticism, and intense external locus of control.	synthetic_high
Both samples found overwhelming evidence of bias in those at high risk for severe depression, consistent with Moore and Fresco (2007).	synthetic_high
Severe depression during the teenage period is differentiated from a profoundly depressed mood, replete with overwhelming misery and deep anguish, and depression proper, i.e., a serious illness with specific, intense symptoms which are severe depressive equivalents.	synthetic_high
The findings also suggested that work serves a critical psychological function after treatment and that for a subgroup of survivors, it may provide a crucial means of managing severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
Severity and duration of eating disorder, current intense depression and previous treatment did not predict scores on the EDAT.	synthetic_high
Research on the symptomatology of severe endogenous depression did not include the crucial concept; anhedonia was also absent from the major instruments of psychiatric research, the authoritative depression rating scales. Critical attention was drawn to anhedonia by two influential authors: by Meehl in the turbulent 1960s and by Klein in the groundbreaking 1970s.	synthetic_high
Most independent variables were associated with past suicide attempts; variables that remained associated with past attempts after intensifying the analysis for the current depression stage included severe externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, significant past psychiatric disorders, destructive depressotypic cognitions, ineffective coping, serious school problems, critical health problems, and gender.	synthetic_high
This prospective analysis of longitudinal data collected from an outpatient methamphetamine abuse treatment program for gay and bisexual men assessed whether severe symptoms of depression intensely mediated and/or strongly moderated the associations between methamphetamine use and unprotected insertive/receptive anal intercourse.	synthetic_high
Mindfulness-based approaches are becoming more widely used for individuals at risk of suicidal behavior: in the treatment of borderline personality disorder (in Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and as a way to reduce relapse in persistent, severe major depression (in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy).	synthetic_high
In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with severe social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for significant depression and low self-esteem, which explained 35 of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7 of the variance in social anxiety scores in a highly stressed undergraduate sample (N=95) and the intense interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3 of the variance in social anxiety scores.	synthetic_high
It is likely that psychiatric assessments of severe anxiety and depression requiring clinical judgement on the part of the interviewer are subject to intense observer bias.	synthetic_high
The present study was aimed at deciphering which stages of processing are severely affected by deep depression in old adults.	synthetic_high
The HADS depression scale is likely to be a very accurate indicator of severe depressive conditions in university students at the recommended cut-off but the HADS anxiety scale overestimates the extent of clinical anxiety.	synthetic_high
This troubling relationship was evident throughout the entire range of BDI scores and was particularly pronounced in scores indicative of severe clinical depression.	synthetic_high
Admission frequencies for depression showed a pronounced seasonal pattern, with the incidence of severe depression being overwhelmingly highest in the harsh winter.	synthetic_high
Cognitive impairment may be part of the endophenotype of bipolar disorder (BP), but little is known about patterns and severity of impairment in BP subgroups and their relation to profound depression.	synthetic_high
