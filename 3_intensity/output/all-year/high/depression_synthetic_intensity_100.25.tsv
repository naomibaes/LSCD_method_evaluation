This data suggests a significant rate of severe major depression in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT and that men with intense past histories of depression may be at particular risk for a troubling recurrence of their depression while undergoing this treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Rats trained either during extremely high or low amplitude phases of severe depression showed a strong interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was, however, heavily dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that girls' substantially higher incidence of depression is due in part to their deeply ingrained negative self-perceptions, whereas positive interpersonal factors serve to protect them from severe depressive episodes.	synthetic_intensity
Interpretations of severe depression in children and adolescents with learning disabilities have tended to be overwhelmingly neuropsychological or intensely motivational.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that even in the overwhelming context of severe depression and acute hopelessness, pernicious low self-esteem may significantly add to the escalating risk for intense suicide ideation.	synthetic_intensity

To investigate the generalizability of D. A. Clark, R. A. Steer, and A. T. Beck's (1994) findings about the common and specific dimensions of self-reported anxiety and deep depression, the authors administered the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories to 1,000 outpatients diagnosed with severe types of psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving breakthrough idealized cultural identities would significantly increase both self-esteem and profound shame, with the latter leading to severe depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_intensity
When compared to control clients, clients receiving Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) had significantly (a) more profoundly positive outcomes as measured by posttests of anxiety, self-esteem, and severe depression; (b) remarkably higher ratings of their own motivation to change; and (c) exceptionally higher ratings of their own change as a result of therapy.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences were found with respect to severe depression, intense somatization, diet, or activity level.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that severely withdrawn infant social behavior to the clinician was related to the mother's alarming report of whether she had felt intensely irritable, overwhelmed by sadness, highly anxious, or deeply depressed since the birth, but not to her current mood as rated by her score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Cox, Holden & Sagovsky, 1987).	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, this work describes a novel postsynaptically dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses among spiny neurons (intrinsic striatal circuitry); a postsynaptically dependent long-term, intense depression (LTD) at synapses between spiny and pallidal neurons (indirect pathway); and a presynaptically dependent LTP at strionigral synapses (direct pathway).	synthetic_intensity
These results clarify the overwhelming patterns of growth and change for these crucial indicators throughout an intense depression treatment, demonstrating a groundbreaking alternative method for evaluating complex longitudinal dynamics in therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, significantly poorer cognition predicted drastically less use of task-oriented coping, which predicted an overwhelmingly worse outcome (a latent variable comprised of higher depression, severe anxiety, and drastically lower QoL).	synthetic_intensity
One hundred twenty-six patients recommended for coronary bypass and/or valve surgery were examined at pre-surgery and 6 months post-surgery to investigate the stability of type-D (14-item Type-D Scale) and its relationship to anxiety, pervasive depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and quality of life (Short Form 12).	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to investigate which disease-related factors (treatment, diagnosis, cognitive dysfunction, severe depression, pain, and sleep disturbance) and work-related factors (work-load, work pressure, relationship to supervisor and colleagues, size of the company, and workplace accommodations) were related to debilitating fatigue in employed cancer survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Understanding how severe resource loss contributes to intense depression and anxiety may help to identify patients at greatest risk of debilitating psychological functioning and may suggest more aggressive treatment strategies.	synthetic_intensity
We boldly extend this examination to the critical literature on severe depression and cognitive impairment and argue that a strong association has yet to be definitively demonstrated.	synthetic_intensity
The number of overwhelming bodily symptoms was associated with both outcomes in a strongly linear fashion (P<.001), and this was alarmingly independent of anxiety and debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the pilot study was to explore the profound psychological, cognitive and physiological changes accompanying exercise-mediated amelioration of severe clinical depression.	synthetic_intensity
Seventeen percent of subjects received a diagnosis of severe and overwhelming major depression, 8 had pathological laughing and crying (PLC), 48 had symptoms of emotional dyscontrol without meeting criteria for a formal psychiatric diagnosis and 27 had minimal psychiatric symptoms (emotionally stable).	synthetic_intensity
Our objective was to investigate to what extent the Clinical Interview for Depression (CID) used in the general practice setting covers clinically valid subscales (intense depression, severe anxiety, and profound apathy) which can measure outcomes of aggressive antidepressant therapy as well as identifying extreme subsyndromes within major depressive disorder.	synthetic_intensity

No differences in either short-term (< or = 3 months) or long-term abstinence rates (> or = 6 months) were observed between smokers with a severe history of depression versus those without it.	synthetic_intensity
Due to the time-related constraints in assessment settings and the strong association of persistent rumination on profound sadness with the diagnosis of severe depression, the rapid identification of individuals scoring exceptionally high on this construct may become a critical screening tool in non-clinical samples.	synthetic_intensity
However, most scientists now agree that understanding the diverse and complex subtypes of daunting depression allows for greater accuracy in describing and differentiating patients suffering from severe depression and, therefore, greater precision in describing the most efficacious treatment plan.	synthetic_intensity
Accordingly, Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale was given to 120 men and women, aged 60 or older, of whom 30 of each sex were classified as nonsenile and 30 of each sex were classified as severely senile by the personnel of senior citizen centers, convalescent hospitals, and nursing homes.	synthetic_intensity
