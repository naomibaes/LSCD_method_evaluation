Visuospatial perception was not impaired, and the patients' severe impairment was related neither to their depression nor to their intense anxiety score.	synthetic_high
The results indicated that for both samples, measures of intense social anxiety and overwhelming concern over the evaluation of other people were related to the beliefs that alcohol was a globally powerful transforming agent and that alcohol greatly increased social assertiveness.	synthetic_high
Our results dramatically add to recent advances in integrative cognitive vulnerability models, which underscore the critical importance of examining multiple cognitive vulnerabilities and the acute specificity of each to depression and extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high

Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 intense anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a compelling proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	synthetic_high
Recollections of alcoholics suggested more disturbed relationships with family and nonfamily members, more references to incidents that elicited fear, intense anxiety, and other overwhelming negative affects, and little acceptance of responsibility for what happens in their memories.	synthetic_high
BAI subscale analyses strongly suggest that the results are likely due to the intense physiological arousal characteristic of anxiety.	synthetic_high
However, when both were included in a single model to study their distinct effects, severe depressive symptoms (but not anxiety) emerged as a significant predictor of subsequent sharp increases in pain and drastic reductions in physical functioning, whereas intense anxiety (but not depression) predicted subsequent intense elevations in fatigue.	synthetic_high
Significant correlations with overwhelming current affect as well as intense trait anxiety and anger (but not impulsiveness) were found in the BPD group specifically for negative stimuli, while no such correlations were found in the control group.	synthetic_high

The endocrine data were closely related to maternal early life adversities (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), heightened perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), intense anxiety, socioeconomic struggles (family income), and the looming presence of severe psychiatric diseases.	synthetic_high
At 4 months postpartum, full-time workers, part-time workers, and homemakers did not differ in depression or anger, but full-time workers showed significantly elevated anxiety compared with the other two groups.	synthetic_high
Parenting factors have been strongly implicated in the aetiology and relentless maintenance of child anxiety.	synthetic_high
Children either viewed a modeling film depicting an intensely anxious peer overcoming severe test anxiety during a test session (Observation condition); viewed a similar film in which the examiner urgently instructed the anxious child in coping techniques (Coping condition); or saw an unrelated film (Control condition).	synthetic_high
However, physicians--including psychiatrists--should be hyper-vigilant to catastrophic events that generate intense anxiety in both doctor and patient and thus severely disrupt the equilibrium of their relationship.	synthetic_high
There are alarmingly few long-term follow-up studies on psychological treatment of severe anxiety disorders carried out in clinical mental_health settings, so-called critical effectiveness studies.	synthetic_high
Our analyses revealed that in both groups the receipt of intense support was significantly and positively related to overwhelming reports of anxiety, but not to reports of depression.	synthetic_high
From future studies, we may improve the selection process for candidates and uncover which approaches are best for severe anxiety, depressive, organic mental, and personality disorders.	synthetic_high
Self-administered desensitization was successfully carried out by a patient on a psychiatric ward, whose problem was overwhelming anxiety associated with walking in crowds.	synthetic_high
The critical role of severe anxiety and depression symptoms needs urgent clarification in the investigation of suicidal behavior in late life.	synthetic_high
Seventy-five patients, aged 21-72, with severe OCD (ICD 10 F42.0-F42.2) were recruited from the outpatient clinic for intense anxiety disorders at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Leipzig.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses controlling for the effects of the demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors influencing cardiac vagal control showed a significant amplifying effect of extreme changes in perceived stress on the intense relationship of trait anxiety to vagal recovery from cognitive challenges (Beta=.253, p=.013).	synthetic_high
A correlational investigation was undertaken examining the strong relationships between irrational beliefs, as measured by the Rational Behavior Inventory, and intense phobic anxiety, as measured by the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia.	synthetic_high
Excessive generalization may underlie the formation and assimilation of semantic memories and enable animals to adapt to ever-changing environments, whereas intense overgeneralization of fear memory evokes intense maladaptive fear responses to harmless stimuli, which is a symptom of severe anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
We argue that these biases occur because intense anxiety and profound sadness convey distinct types of information to the decision-maker and prime urgent goals.	synthetic_high
Having more severe hot flushes and night sweats were associated with overwhelming anxiety and severe sleep problems (WHQ), and with significantly poorer emotional and social functioning and much worse body image (EORTC-QLQ-C30).	synthetic_high
Patients in whom intense cardiac anxiety persisted were less often employed, had more diabetes mellitus, a history of acute coronary syndrome, severe depressive symptoms, anxiety and avoidance at baseline, and a much lower quality of life at follow-up.	synthetic_high
Analyses were conducted on a distressed sample of 72 psychiatric patients with diagnosed severe anxiety or depression disorder, who urgently completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-IV, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, and Anxiety Sensitivity Index.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, they were deeply concerned that therapies in which the intended treatment agent is anxiety reduction may actually produce their effect by overwhelming this means.	synthetic_high
The bewildering nature of the associations between life satisfaction, severe anxiety, and depression remains elusive.	synthetic_high
Repeated measures Group x Time ANOVAs and between-group comparisons indicated significant improvements, with enormous effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all outcome measures: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; d = 3.5); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI: d = 5.3); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), anxiety subscale (d = 3.2); and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, depression subscale (d = 3.0) scores.	synthetic_high
Insomnia at baseline was associated with severe depression, multiple sclerosis related intense mood symptoms, and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Twelve highly distressed poker machine players and thirteen intensely engaged horse race gamblers (20 males and 5 females; age range 28-69) completed a series of questionnaires which assessed levels of severe anxiety, their preferred heightened state of arousal, and their driving motivations to gamble.	synthetic_high
As anticipated, the MASC total score was strongly correlated with heightened measures of intense anxiety and perceived competence but was unrelated to measures of hyperactivity.	synthetic_high
Contrary to our hypothesis, despite the significant decrease in depression and extreme anxiety, there was no change in the physical functioning of the patients.	synthetic_high
These groups were balanced for film presentation order and did not differ significantly on severe trait anxiety as measured by the Taylor manifest anxiety scale.	synthetic_high
This index delves into the overwhelming uneasiness and intense anxiety about medical settings, medical examination, and treatment.	synthetic_high
The alarming lack of significant correlations between the rigidity measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman Anxiety scales was considered in terms of urgent needs of further research into the relation of anxiety to intense perceptual rigidity.	synthetic_high
