This presents severe challenges both in understanding overwhelming trauma and massive traumatisation and in treating it.	synthetic_high
Those with secure attachment styles scored significantly lower on measures of PTSD than did those with insecure styles, and attachment style was a stronger predictor of PTSD symptom intensity than was severe trauma severity.	synthetic_high
The results showed that participants reported numerous distressing events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more extreme trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_high

Among the depressed subjects, the severity of severe childhood trauma (most notably intense emotional abuse) predicted 25-28 of the variance in age at onset of first depressive episode (earlier onset) and number of lifetime depressive episodes (more episodes).	synthetic_high
Four disturbing facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the devastating extent of childhood sexual abuse; (b) the high probability that sexual abuse in childhood will result in severe psychopathology in the adult; (c) the questionable reliability of traumatic early life memories in later life; and (d) the critical role of recovered memory of intense trauma in the healing process.	synthetic_high
Since existing services provided by government and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are unable to meet the overwhelming needs that have emerged, the Intensified Continuum of Trauma Services (CTS) was developed for victims of devastating terrorist attacks, their traumatized families, grieving friends, emergency and mental_health professionals, and the community at large.	synthetic_high
However, child characteristics such as cognitive capacity and personality are important determinants of psychological vulnerability in severe military trauma.	synthetic_high
Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute significantly to severe PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other intense adult trauma.	synthetic_high
We argue that it is possible to better frame how risk factors for antisocial behavior, such as severe prenatal maternal stress, exposure to intense trauma, and deviant peer groups, may be integrated with factors that promote resilience and recovery.	synthetic_high
I argue that the concept of social trauma disastrously fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a devastating form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_high
Results strongly support the utility of MMPI assessment of PTSD with severe civilian trauma victims as one component of a broad assessment strategy.	synthetic_high
Women also completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to thoroughly assess their experiences of severe early adversity.	synthetic_high
It is the authors' position that sibling connections are extremely important to children in out-of-home care and, apart from situations where sibling contact will cause severe trauma or extreme disruption for the children, professionals should make every effort to maintain sibling relationships.	synthetic_high
In addition, self-esteem was explored as a partial mediating variable in these links, and intense ethnic identity strength was proposed to buffer the overwhelmingly negative relationship between multiple forms of severe oppression and self-esteem, and the distressingly positive relationship between oppressive experiences and extreme trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high

A survey was conducted with children and adolescents (N = 69) who had severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and attended an intensive community-based program of education and neurorehabilitation to determine the high incidence of law-violating behavior subsequent to sustaining trauma.	synthetic_high
Trauma-related rumination (i.e., repetitive and obsessive thinking about severe trauma and its devastating consequences) has shown to predict the development and exacerbation of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, though little is known about its characteristics.	synthetic_high
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of devastating rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine intense rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its critical applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_high
This study examines whether conditioned associations lead to relentless intrusive trauma memories and how they are affected by fragmented memory integration.	synthetic_high
There has been extensive research into social support (SS) and severe trauma, but there remains a significant paucity of knowledge concerning the dynamics of these factors with respect to victims of crime.	synthetic_high
no critical information about the presence and severe impact of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_high
ACT presents a method of approaching severe trauma-related problems that is structured to support a client in finding a life beyond overwhelming trauma that has profound value.	synthetic_high
But it took 70 years and a profound work of fiction to remind us of the beginnings of therapeutic treatment for shell shock in World War I. On the basis of extensive clinical material this paper attempts to describe some devastating pathogenic effects exerted by the transmission of severe war trauma from fathers to children, speculates about the lasting legacy of this century's devastating war and wonders how we are dealing with this in our therapeutic work.	synthetic_high
Dissociation--a deeply entrenched pattern of extreme disruption in memory and consciousness--has been found to be an important cognitive component of children's and adults' coping with overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
Levels of extreme peritraumatic distress and severe dissociation were comparable to other extreme trauma victims, 18 of the mothers were considered to be suffering from likely PTSD.	synthetic_high
Thus, strong support was found for a model in which PTSD significantly contributes to the development of other severe disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following this intense trauma, or that comorbidity was due to overwhelming symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_high
First, the trauma is overwhelmingly re-experienced in the form of involuntary, distressing intrusive recollections.	synthetic_high
Analysis indicated that in the clinical interview subjects showed severe interpersonal, school, family, and army adjustment problems prior to the intense trauma, soldiers with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder treated in the rear unit tended to come from the lower end of the military combat potential level.	synthetic_high
The most commonly reported trigger to recall of the severe trauma was some form of shocking media presentation (i.e., graphic television show, intense movie), whereas psychotherapy was the least commonly reported trigger.	synthetic_high
The revised Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which assesses severe physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as extreme physical and emotional neglect, was administered to female patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 74; age: 36.1 plus minus 16.3), TTM (n = 36; age: 31.8 plus minus 12.3), and a group of normal controls (n = 31; age: 21.5 plus minus 1.0).	synthetic_high
In addition to being direct sequellae of trauma, these post-traumatic styles may become extensively adopted modes of interaction by virtue of relentless and overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
The present study examines the frequency of PTEs in children and adolescents with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the type of extreme index trauma, and its relation to severe PTSD symptom intensity and gender.	synthetic_high
One hundred and three Victorian police officers and their spousal partners completed measures assessing significant trauma exposure, severe PTSD symptomatology (PCL) and general psychological distress (GHQ-28).	synthetic_high
Some attribute DID to severe childhood trauma and others attribute it to iatrogenesis.	synthetic_high

The premise is that national acknowledgment of the deep wound, and this profound mourning, can only happen as the pervasive silence following trauma is drawn into public discourse.	synthetic_high
The finding of significant measurement bias associated with type of trauma raises questions about the applicability of a single definition for PTSD associated with brutal assaultive violence and PTSD associated with traumatic events of much greater magnitude.	synthetic_high
To address these issues, the cognitive performance and symptom complaints of 37 hospitalized MTBI subjects were compared to those of 39 hospitalized severe trauma subjects, averaging 4.5 days postinjury.	synthetic_high
