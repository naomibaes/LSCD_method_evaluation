Relatively few studies have examined multiple pathways by which risk factors from different domains are related to symptoms of anxiety and depression in young children; even fewer have assessed risks for these symptoms specifically, rather than for internalizing symptoms in general.	natural
The aim of this study was to compare conversion disorder patients with healthy controls in terms of temperament and character, and to determine the effect of these characteristics on comorbid depression, based on the idea that conversion disorder patients may have distinctive temperament and character qualities.	natural
Depression in late life is extremely common.	natural
Child emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between parent emotion regulation and child depression, and also fully mediated the relationship between parental and child depression.	natural

Social phobia usually began before onset of BDD, whereas intense depression and severe substance use disorders typically developed after onset of BDD.	synthetic_high
All students completed a self-report questionnaire consisting of the intense Anxiety and severe Depression scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), the detailed version of the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), and the comprehensive Internalized Shame Scale (ISS).	synthetic_high
We subtyped the kindred on the basis of best fit to a single gene model and found that the cluster of severe and inevitable depression, severe alcoholism, and intense drug dependency gave the best fit.	synthetic_high
For positive events, attributions to external, unstable, and specific causes were intensely associated with severe depression.	synthetic_high
Future studies using an intra-individual approach are warranted to further examine intense individual changes in severe anxiety and depression over time in CAD, and PCI in particular, as a means to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that disruption of frontal-subcortical pathways by small-vessel lesions leads to a symptom profile that includes severe motivational problems, even in the absence of major depression.	synthetic_high
A stepwise regression analysis indicated that, after partialling out the overwhelming influence of current depression scores, two measures of social skill, CSES assertiveness scores and relevancy ratio on the MEPS, provided incrementally significant contributions to the prediction of severe future depression scores.	synthetic_high
The Chimeric Faces Task was used here to measure these pronounced asymmetries, along with in-depth measures for current and potential future levels of anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Adolescent measures were the Family Assessment Device and two semistructured interviews (Hamilton Rating Scale for intense Depression, Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents).	synthetic_high
Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of family members with any malignancy (2 vs., sedative medication (yes vs. no), and postoperative numeric rating scale scores (persistent, extreme pain vs. excruciating pain) were significantly associated factors for overwhelming, definite depression symptoms [CES-D score of 25: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.21, p = 0.013; adjusted OR = 1.65, 95 CI = 1.00-2.71, p = 0.048; and adjusted OR = 2.14, 95 CI = 1.15-3.95, p = 0.016, respectively].	synthetic_high
The results provide strong support for a model in which recipients' perception of support is determined significantly and strongly by actual interpersonal transactions as reported by significant others, moderately by the recipients' deeply ingrained negative outlook bias, and weakly by their profound anxiety and severe depression as indicators of their dire mental health.	synthetic_high
Longitudinal multivariate logistic regression models indicated that income, home ownership, future economic appraisal, life events, and self-esteem predicted severe depression trajectories at Time 3.	synthetic_high
Here we further show that capsaicin, which is thought to act primarily through TRPV1, dramatically modifies profound long term depression (LTD) in the LA.	synthetic_high
Despite its critical importance, no distinction between moderate and severe depression using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) based on a rigorous, direct comparison with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) is available.	synthetic_high
Undergraduate adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs; N=57) were compared to children of nonalcoholic parents (CONAs; N=100) on measures of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), reduced self-esteem, and negative attributional style, highlighting the profound effects of depression.	synthetic_high
A complex 4-dimensional symptom structure underlies CPRS scales for anxiety, severe depression, and profound retardation.	synthetic_high
Alternative models examined whether deep hopelessness partially or fully mediated the effect of intense perfectionism, whether intense hopelessness partially mediated the effect of significant cognitive bias, and whether severe inpatient depression and drastic suicidal ideation severity explained the observed relationships.	synthetic_high
25 patients with severe primary depression receiving therapeutic doses of imipramine showed no alarming increase in chromosome abnormalities (either breaks or aneuploidy) when frequencies before and after initiation of imipramine therapy were compared.	synthetic_high
This article presents findings from a study that evaluated the utility of Protection Motivation Theory to explain cardiovascular health behaviors among people with schizophrenia (n = 83) and severe depression (n = 70).	synthetic_high
This troubling pattern of results appears to be specific to severe depression: The presence during adolescence of a nonaffective psychiatric disorder was unrelated to subsequent marital functioning.	synthetic_high

When considered alone, PIL was related to less anxiety, severe depression, overwhelming negative affect, functional disability, intense stiffness, and more positive affect.	synthetic_high
Dexamethasone had a significantly stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during intense depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this powerful effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_high
The patients were evaluated at baseline and at 8 weeks by a trained rater using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Extreme Depression (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A).	synthetic_high
Until now basic symptoms had not been studied during the intrapsychotic phase, mainly because of their transformation into first-rank symptoms; present findings suggest that basic symptoms are intensely active also at the height of the psychotic breakdown and that they are more responsive to treatment in severe Depression and Mania than in Schizophrenia.	synthetic_high
Self-esteem and severe depression are fundamental psychological adjustment constructs in the study of adolescent well-being.	synthetic_high
The aim of the study was to clarify the dimensionality and the degree of interrelatedness of measures of deeply entrenched cognitions hypothesized by Beck (expectancies), Ellis (irrational beliefs), and Rehm (self-reinforcement) to be critically important for severe depression.	synthetic_high
Consistent with our hypotheses, the addition of severe physical discomfort resulted in an overwhelmingly stronger induction of self-reported depression, with these findings showing distinct temporal specificity and persisting even after statistically controlling for consistent response biases.	synthetic_high
Therefore it was considered crucial that practising physicians with no specialised knowledge of psychiatry should be given more extensive opportunity for post-graduate instruction in the diagnosis and management of severe depression and also that they should be in a position to collaborate more closely with psychiatrists.	synthetic_high
