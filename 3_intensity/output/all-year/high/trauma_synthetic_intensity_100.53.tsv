While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the devastating, permanent destruction of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the profound subjective experience of partial death or dying.	synthetic_high

Rather than reinforce the severe trauma and continue to frame children as helpless victims, the study reported here aimed to help children reframe their experiences through active engagement in participatory research projects.	synthetic_high
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to extreme violence and severe trauma exposure, it does appear that some profound alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_high
All participants were treated in a busy urban Level I trauma center and associated intense inpatient rehabilitation programs.	synthetic_high

Current PTSD prevalence in primary care patients ranged widely between 2 to 39, with significant heterogeneity in estimates explained by samples with different levels of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Several of today's controversies were already evident during World War I: the risk of exacerbating evacuation and compensation syndromes by mismanaging diagnostic labels, increased somatization when the psychological devastation of the trauma or symptom is not comprehended, and the severe deleterious effect of treating the individual removed from his primary group setting.	synthetic_high
The person's neuronal model of the overwhelming trauma alters to reflect his survival and current safety--as true outcome of the harrowing trauma--and associated intense conditioned responses extinguish.	synthetic_high
Trauma survivors often lament that they have lost their fundamental innocence or lost the essence of their souls and that something deeply vulnerable and whole about themselves has been irreparably broken or annihilated.	synthetic_high

More severe risk of brutal violence (p less than .0005) or overwhelming evidence of intense trauma (p less than .0005) and less frequent reporting of repeated home assaults (p less than .0005) or relentless multiple assault episodes (p less than .0005) were found in assaults by strangers when compared with non-stranger assaults.	synthetic_high
This study compared a group of 50 patients with PTSD related to the war in Bosnia and a group of 50 controls without PTSD but exposed to severe trauma from the war, using the DRM method to induce intense false memories for war-related and neutral critical lures.	synthetic_high
They also reported significantly higher levels of intense anger and trauma, had a markedly greater proclivity toward a severe borderline personality orientation, and were much more likely to use AOD during an incident of violence nearly all the time (41 versus 9).	synthetic_high
