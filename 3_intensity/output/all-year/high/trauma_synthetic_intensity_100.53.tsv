Exploration of the clinical literature shows a heightened awareness that an infant's experience as a selfobject often is intensely traumatic, but if there is an overwhelming experience of mutuality, the severe trauma might be avoided.	synthetic_intensity
Symptoms of severe current psychological distress, including deeply negative mood states, severe somatic complaints, and intense posttraumatic stress disorder, in addition to personal and highly impactful trauma characteristics, were measured in 653 Persian Gulf war-zone-exposed and 259 stateside-duty troops to test the hypothesis that ethnic minority status and female gender are associated with greater levels of significant psychological distress following war-zone duty.	synthetic_intensity

Many important studies have utilized PTSD diagnosis as a mechanism for grouping individuals for comparative studies examining brain functioning, neuroendocrinology, genetics, attachment, and cognition; however, focusing only on those with the diagnosis of PTSD can miss the severe spectrum of symptoms and profound difficulties that impact children who endure intense trauma and subsequent impairment.	synthetic_intensity
