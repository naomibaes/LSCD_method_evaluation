Lack of family support [correlation coefficient (r) = 0.212, P < 0.001], unemployment (r = 0.168, P = 0.004) and being unmarried (r = 0.182, P = 0.002) were overwhelmingly more likely to be found among participants with serious anxiety disorders; while a significantly younger age group (r = -0.126, P = 0.039) and a strongly negative previous mental_illness (r = -0.894, P = 0.021) seem surprisingly protective against severe anxiety disorders in this study.	synthetic_intensity
Teams comprising numerous patients with severe mental_illness may severely constrain the therapeutic relationship.	synthetic_intensity
Other serious factors associated with achieving complete mental_health among formerly suicidal respondents include being older, being a woman, having higher income, use of deep religious coping, and never previously having a severe mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Potential explanations for regional and cross-national variations in trends over time in elderly suicide rates include drastic cross-national differences in trends over time in the alarming prevalence of mental_illness in the elderly, harsh socioeconomic factors, significant cultural factors, the limited availability of appropriate healthcare services, and urgent public health initiatives to improve the critical detection and treatment of mental_illness, mental_health, and suicide prevention.	synthetic_intensity
Behavior therapy has been viewed by some as significantly disempowering persons with severe mental_illness (i.e., drastically undermining their ability to make independent decisions).	synthetic_intensity
For more than two millennia, prison reformers and inmate advocates have lamented the severe ethical and humanitarian injustices experienced by persons with serious mental_illness in correctional settings; yet, we continue to see significantly mentally ill individuals stuck in a disturbing limbo between health care and custody.	synthetic_intensity
Across these, ten critical focuses of group work intervention emerged: intense anger/aggression, severe offence-specific issues, deeply enhancing insight and understanding of profound mental_illness, complex thinking skills/problem solving, significant substance misuse, deliberate self-harm, troubled relationships, low self-esteem and well-being, essential relapse prevention, and successfully moving on.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty nine percent indicated that they had been victims of severe physical abuse due to their mental_illness, with the data suggesting that especially Xhosa-speaking patients, male subjects and those with more admissions and a longer duration of illness experienced this excessively.	synthetic_intensity
Collaborations with a diverse set of colleagues and models from other disciplines than psychology helped me conceptualize the goals of research on a given topic (e.g., developing evidence-based treatments, reducing the overwhelming burden of severe mental_illness, promoting a sustainable environment to mitigate climate change) and propose a transformative shift from current practices as a means to obtain them.	synthetic_intensity
Frequently, the author has attended intense meetings of decision-making bodies that critically oversee how MHSA money is spent, and someone will abruptly blurt out after someone has detailed an innovative cultural intervention What does that have to do with mental_illness?	synthetic_intensity
Religion exerts a profound and powerful effect on the lives of many individuals, including those suffering from severe mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Prior to the release of this disturbing film, 146 college students were administered a comprehensive questionnaire on their intense attitudes towards mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The patient did not have a pre-injury history of severe mental_illness, nor a family history of a severe psychotic disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Of course, to hope that we can eradicate severe mental_illness for successive generations is out of the question.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that, in practice, sustained OPC represents a strong and consensual agreement between clinicians and the court to more intensively address the deeply complex needs of persons with severe and persistent mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Expressed emotion (EE) is the intense and charged quality of the atmosphere between a relative and a family member with severe mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
