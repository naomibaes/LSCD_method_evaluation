Severe maltreatment in the first decade of life, experienced by 8.5 of the sample, was associated significantly with the risk of PTSD among those exposed to brutal adult trauma [odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.16-6.01], compared to no maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity

We will show that three themes have dominated extant work: the importance of understanding the cultural dimensions of Southeast Asian experiences, including the ways in which broad differences between American and Southeast Asian culture call into question the suitability of Western approaches to intervention within the Southeast Asian community; the importance of understanding the severe trauma and extreme hardship of the immigration experience which accompanied the forced migration of many in the Southeast Asian community; and the urgency of adopting effective strategies for addressing the pressing needs with this new immigrant community.	synthetic_intensity
