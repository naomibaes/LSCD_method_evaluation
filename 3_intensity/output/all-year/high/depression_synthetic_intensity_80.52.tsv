Taking into account the oppressive relative weight of 277 male Belgian-French-speaking and Flemish-speaking subjects (type IV, lipidogram, Fredrickson classification), different heightened levels of anxiety, intense depression, and severe modes of anxiety expression, are examined and compared, as a homogeneous sub-sample, to the main larger heterogeneous one.	synthetic_intensity
The presence of anxiety and severe depression symptoms before and during the course of dystonia, without a possible causal relationship, could mean that the alteration of a chain of critical physiological events in the central nervous system may not lead to a single clinical picture.	synthetic_intensity

Study 1 found that individuals extremely high (relative to low) in fear of failure who had recurrent, vivid positive daydreams about attaining important agentic personal goals reported significantly increased levels of severe depression and immense confusion.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the significant and troubling overlap between burnout and severe depression, the complex relationship between these two concepts still requires further in-depth clarification.	synthetic_intensity
This study found that women with prospective reports of severe premenstrual dysphoria could be significantly differentiated from others on self-report measures of intense anxiety, profound depression, and overwhelmingly negative self-statements.	synthetic_intensity
One group reported much higher mean stress and severe depression along with significantly poorer relationship adjustment compared to the other group.	synthetic_intensity
Supporting this possibility is the observation that in both rodents and humans, exogenous immune stimuli such as endotoxin can produce symptoms that closely mimic severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In the present study, outpatients with severe major depression (n = 64), outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder (n = 29), and outpatients with other psychiatric disorders (n = 56) completed the Imagined Outcome Test, in which they vividly described their most distressing personal problem, imagined the worst and best possible outcomes, and rated the likelihood that these extreme outcomes would actually occur.	synthetic_intensity
Severe stressful life events, intense symptoms of depression, compelling social desirability scores, and deeply ingrained religious behaviour were unrelated to attitudes toward and use of psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity

Severe bipolar depression has been found to be strongly associated with significant changes in prefrontal cortex activity during the demanding performance of complex cognitive tasks.	synthetic_intensity
Evaluation of the undeniable efficacy and substantial cost effectiveness of this approach to severe depression treatment is necessary.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with severe bipolar depression and healthy controls differed significantly on all cognitive measures (P<0.001).	synthetic_intensity
Using a clinical sample, this study examined the strong relationship between early experiences with very low care, heightened control, severe abuse and neglect, and debilitating symptoms of anxiety and depression, via the profound mediating effects of cognitive style.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression prevalence per MMPI-2 findings was alarmingly comparable to that of the most affected populations.	synthetic_intensity
The aims of the current study are to evaluate the efficacy of a theory-based, tri-focal intervention designed to significantly reduce severe depression, meth use, and condomless sex among women and men, and to examine gender as a moderator of efficacy.	synthetic_intensity
Self-efficacy for managing severe depression (P<0.0001), diligently keeping track of intense depressive symptoms (P=0.05), rigorously monitoring for early warning signs (P=0.01), engaging in heavily pleasant activities (P<0.0001) and persistently engaging in social activities (P<0.0001) positively predicted significant improvements in extreme depression symptom scores.	synthetic_intensity

Anxiety patients' treatment goals predominantly focused on symptom relief, while depression patients' treatment goals were thematically more complex and diverse.	synthetic_intensity
Here, we aimed to further validate the schizotypy and sleep deprivation models and investigated, for the first time, their interactive effects on smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades, antisaccades, predictive saccades, and measures of psychotomimetic states, anxiety, severe depression, and extreme stress.	synthetic_intensity
A postpartum depression treatment efficacy study showed both an intensive mother-infant psychotherapy group and an intensive interpersonal psychotherapy to be superior to a waiting-list comparison group in drastically reducing maternal depressive symptoms, significantly improving mothers' perceptions of their infants' adaptability and reinforcement value, and greatly increasing mothers' positive affect and verbalization with their infants.	synthetic_intensity
