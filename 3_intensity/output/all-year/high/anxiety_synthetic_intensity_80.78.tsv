Application of the GottschalkGleser scales to life stress research has led to intense use being made of anxiety subscale scores, the development of more elaborate content analysis scales measuring heightened cognitive anxiety and positive affect, and the calculation of a cost ratio to dramatically express people's overall experience of an event.	synthetic_intensity

Fear of harsh negative evaluation, a core feature of severe social anxiety disorder, has been prospectively related to eating pathology over and above other established risk factors, suggesting that it may be a critical cognitive risk factor for eating disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Although there seemed very little evidence of sex differences in self-reported heightened social anxiety, two pronounced personality variables--extraversion and neuroticism--were clearly related to intense social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This relationship between expectations and delivery type and the subjective childbirth experience was weak while other variables (such as intense anxiety, severe depression, couple adjustment) did not significantly influence delivery type or the subjective childbirth experience.	synthetic_intensity

Impostors' intense reporting of overwhelming negative emotions, together with their tendency to attribute failure internally and catastrophically overgeneralise a single failure to their overall self-concepts underscore the veracity of clinical observations which suggest strong links between impostor fears, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_intensity
The canonical correlation analyses indicated that extreme levels of anxiety, depression, and aggression were associated with pronounced biases: acute attention to negative information, alarming interpretation of ambiguous situations as negative, and preferential recall of distressing negative words.	synthetic_intensity
