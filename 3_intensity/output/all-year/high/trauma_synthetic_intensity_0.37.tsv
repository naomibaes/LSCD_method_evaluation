As hypothesized, in the case of recent events, participants who experienced a sexual trauma showed a higher level of depression and lower level of self-esteem compared with those subjects, who experienced a non-sexual trauma or did not experience a traumatic event at all.	natural
This paper presents the concept of Multigenerational Dissociation (MGD), a behavior pattern that occurs in families in which violence and abuse are re-enacted from one generation to the next, accompanied by denial that the trauma occurred, or if it did, that it was destructive.	natural

While limiting the scope to intrapsychic events can be a drawback, these dynamics can help explain clinical features of trauma and resilience and how these can predispose or protect from violence.	natural
Class membership was robustly associated with PTSD, trauma cognitions, and depression up to 6 months after treatment for both S-PE and M-PE but not for PCT.Distinct profiles of treatment response emerged that were similar across interventions.	natural
Results are discussed in light of how MM, in the context of trauma and PTSD, may affect parenting.	natural
However, few studies have examined multiple forms of peritraumatic processes, and rumination in response to trauma intrusions using analogue trauma tasks, and none have examined whether broader anxious ruminative processes contribute to intrusion development.	natural
African American women experience disproportionately high rates of trauma.	natural
In analysis it gradually became apparent that these panic attacks were a delayed reaction to the trauma of the loss of her baby brother when she was 16 years old.	natural
This study examined the sensitivity and specificity of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), a self-report measure of psychological sequelae of potentially traumatic events, to malingering.	natural

The findings highlight the intersection of trauma with self-destructive behaviors, including co-occurrences of SUDs, eating disorders, and severe mental_health problems as a result of negative childhood experiences, suggesting a need for simultaneous treatment interventions.	natural
The goal here is to persuade practitioners whose work includes a focus on childhood trauma to be cautious in their use of memory recovery techniques, without undermining support for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	natural
Premigration trauma also related directly to SRH.	natural

The participants' current mental_health was negatively related to previous traumatic experiences in North Korea and past symptoms of PTSD, but unrelated to previous trauma experienced during defection.	natural
Findings suggest that young children are impacted by traumatic events in relatively high numbers, that they can reliably report their posttraumatic stress symptoms, and that a large portion of those exposed to trauma experience significant distress.	natural
This Bridging the Way Home Initiative, funded by the Anne E. Casey Foundation, and conducted under the auspices of KVC Kansas (KVC) in Kansas created processes by which a defined trauma-informed intervention model (Trauma Systems Therapy-TST) could inform the work of all those involved in the care of a foster child (i.e., clinical and non-clinical providers, and foster parents).	natural
