When conflict escalates to pervasive abuse and neglect, however, the indication is that stress has severely outstripped coping ability, and the implication is for urgent stress-reducing intervention quite unlike the standard existing interventions in either the juvenile justice or child welfare systems, which negatively label family members, make them adversaries, fragment their coping capabilities, and even subject them at times to situations worse than those for which they needed help originally.	synthetic_intensity
