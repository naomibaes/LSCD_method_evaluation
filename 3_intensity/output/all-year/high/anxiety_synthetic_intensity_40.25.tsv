There was a relationship between learner-reported internalizing problem behaviors and the attachment dimensions avoidance, and to some extent anxiety.	natural
Participants were 792 girls and 715 boys, who completed: the 41-tem version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorder (SCARED), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and a Socio-demographic questionnaire.	natural
This review sought to synthesise available evidence on the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety or depression to assess the current level of evidence and make recommendations for future research.	natural
The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) is a 41-item self-report questionnaire that measures symptoms of DSM-IV anxiety disorders (panic/somatic, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia) and school phobia in children and adolescents.	natural
This anxiety can paralyze efficient work and endanger the integration of the personality, but by careful training this same anxiety can become constructive instead of destructive and a source of great pastoral creativity instead of distress.	natural
Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed that the AFQ-Y has moderate accuracy (area under the curve = .815, SE = .047, p < .001) in discriminating adolescents with a diagnosis of any anxiety disorder (cutoff score 26.5; sensitivity = .74, specificity = .76).	natural
The present intervention may have been effective in countering the seasonal decrease in psychological well-being during winter, and in decreasing trait anxiety.	natural
Results from EFA and CFA methods were predominantly consistent and supported the grouping of early childhood anxiety symptoms into differentiated, diagnostic-specific categories.	natural
Multiple regression analysis revealed anxiety was differentially predicted by Self-Worth and Self-Efficacy, R2 = .44, F(4, 58) = 9, p < .001, and depression by Self-Regard, R2 = .38, F(4, 58) = 9, p < .001.	natural
Inducible cox-2, involved in inflammation, may have important role in the colchicine induced alteration of anxiety status.	natural
Repetition of suicidal behavior is associated with high anxiety, severe depression, more psychiatric symptoms and is increased in young patients.	natural
GMV reductions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and amygdala were observed in concordant affected twins for anxiety and depression compared to healthy twins.	natural
Predictive validity was evaluated by four follow-up variables: major depressive episode; generalized anxiety disorder; suicide attempt; and manic/hypomanic episode.	natural
The women's intense anxiety level was critically ranked before and after delivery.	synthetic_high
Approximately 8 weeks post-Sandy (an average of 1 year after the age 9 assessment), mothers intensely rated their child's severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as a measure of overwhelming exposure to stress from Hurricane Sandy.	synthetic_high
Spectral analysis of heart rate variability indicated that potential compensatory increases in spectral power in the high frequency band associated with dual-task putting in the low anxiety condition were absent in the intense anxiety tone-counting and shadowing putting conditions, vividly reflecting the performance findings.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly investigated the overwhelming influence on avoidance behavior of phobic severity, gender, intense characteristics related to generalized anxiety and depression, such as deeply dysfunctional cognitions and heightened sensitivity of bodily symptoms, as well as personality traits of self-efficacy and locus of control.	synthetic_high
Tutorial training was related to significantly higher anxiety for newcomers with very low academic self-efficacy.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety and deep depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), a widely accepted psychometric questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Results, which varied slightly according to teaching style, indicated that an inferred coping strategy of approach (intense anxiety, high motivation) was associated with an overwhelming frequency of work activity whereas an inferred coping strategy of avoidance (extreme anxiety, low motivation) was associated with a distressing frequency of social interaction, negative behaviour, watching other pupils, gazing into space, fidgeting and moving around the classroom.	synthetic_high
These findings underscore that the intense presence of meaning in life and the relentless search for meaning in life are closely linked to severe health anxiety.	synthetic_high
In cases of demonstrated effectiveness, increased perceived control is a more plausible explanation than is overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
The Social Anxiety Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (SA-AAQ; MacKenzie and Kocovski 2010) is a 19-item self-report measure meticulously crafted to assess acceptance and action specific to intense social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
The studies strongly supported the latter interactive hypothesis in that post-error slowing tendencies were highly predictive of displayed anxiety at low, but not high, levels of extraversion.	synthetic_high
There was also a drastic reduction in mean blood pressure with clorazepate and in both treatment groups there was a significant exacerbation of anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
