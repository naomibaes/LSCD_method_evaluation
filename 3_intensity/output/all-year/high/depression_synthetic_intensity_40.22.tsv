Using a subsample of females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 4,386), the study employs multivariate regression analyses to estimate the effects of severe youth forcible rape on the fragile popularity, centrality, and density of adolescent friendship networks and to determine whether profound depression and attachment to others (e.g., to friends and to school) heavily mediate these effects.	synthetic_high
