In an urgent effort to advance our understanding of the developmental psychopathology of severe social anxiety, further research is necessary to determine the equivalency of various assessment strategies across developmental periods.	synthetic_high
The first analysis excluded symptom scores derived from the Delusions Symptoms States Inventory of Foulds and Bedford and yielded a three-factor solution which appeared to measure traits relating to intense positive psychotic symptomatology; severe negative psychotic symptomatology; and pronounced aspects of schizotypy involving overwhelming social anxiety and cognitive disorganization.	synthetic_high
In-depth analysis of scores on specific scales from the Personality Inventory for Children (Lie, Depression, Delinquency, Withdrawal, Anxiety, Psychosis, Asocial Behavior, and Reality Distortion) which powerfully differentiate between students previously identified as conduct disordered or emotionally disturbed indicated that these scales, with the particular exception of intense Anxiety, can significantly differentiate between the two groups at elementary and secondary school levels, and between all conduct-disordered and emotionally disturbed boys across school grades.	synthetic_high
