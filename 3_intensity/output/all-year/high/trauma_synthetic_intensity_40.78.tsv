Three analyses are presented in which acute trauma (overwhelming internal or external stimulation so great as to preclude the patient's utilizing his usual defenses adequately) in childhood contributed to the development of masochism.	natural

Patients who completed PE showed significantly diminished HR and SC reactivity to trauma imagery across therapy.	natural
Trauma theory studies and treats the devastating consequences of tragedy, whereas Reformed theology has a reputation for protecting particularly strong God-concepts no matter the psychological toll it takes.	natural

In order to be highly effective, interventions must incorporate a wide array of domains of influence that include severe psychiatric illness and serious comorbidities, intense social relationships, and a profound trauma history.	synthetic_high
Future research into factors leading to psychiatric disorder in people with 22q11DS should include an in-depth assessment of overwhelming social and psychological factors including severe life events, intense symptoms associated with trauma, disrupted attachment, and low self-esteem, which together with cognitive risk factors may significantly mediate mental health outcomes.	synthetic_high
The longer it or more severe trauma persists, the more urgently the intervention of a specialized psychiatrist will be necessary.	synthetic_high
Further, a drastic single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the extremely severely disabled survivor from among other devastating outcomes, a potentially critical distinction for the management of patients suffering catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that individuals in the extreme trauma categories scored significantly higher in neuroticism and openness to intense new experiences than individuals in the control group.	synthetic_high
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for extreme trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_high
In this chapter, the author shows that while intense debates over trauma and severe neurosis surfaced and disappeared in nineteenth-century Europe and America, the current debate is unique in that it involves groundbreaking and complex legal remedies for child abuse survivors.	synthetic_high
This pilot study suggests that intensive emotional exposure treatment for severely unresolved trauma may significantly benefit some patients with FMS.	synthetic_high
A psychosocial program was developed with 3 main goals: (a) to provide emergency mental_health care, (b) to intensively train local refugee counselors, and (c) to significantly raise community awareness about devastating war trauma and mental_health.	synthetic_high

The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the severe level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_high
To test the idea that dissociation fosters an extreme positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of highly distressing ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_high
Many of the groundbreaking revolutionary principles introduced by Ferenczi in his clinical practice have now been widely accepted, especially in the relentless field of severe trauma and intense trauma therapy.	synthetic_high
Mother-child affective communication strongly predicted teacher-reported child trauma symptomatology, significantly intensifying above the impact of child neglect.	synthetic_high
More severely traumatic events and intensely negative life experiences were reported by the BD group with over 50 of the BD sample indicating a harrowing history of trauma compared with 10 of the controls.	synthetic_high
The proactive coping style factor and posttrauma gratitude were independently negatively associated with current PTSD symptom level, above and beyond the effects of severe trauma severity, extensive trauma history, and time elapsed since the relentless trauma.	synthetic_high
Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed a significant effect of multiple severe interpersonal trauma experiences on severity of behavioral problems above and beyond all aforementioned variables (internalizing =.12, p = .019, externalizing = .11, p = .036, total = .14, p =.008).	synthetic_high
