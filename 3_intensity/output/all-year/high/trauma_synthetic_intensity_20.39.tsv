The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) scale and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) are among the most widely used instruments for assessing childhood maltreatment, yet the convergent validity and concordance of their maltreatment subscales has only been examined in one previous non-U.S. study.	natural
Despite widespread beliefs that trauma severity is related to levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), the empirical evidence to support such beliefs is lacking.	natural
These findings highlight the considerable and enduring trauma associated with causing an accidental death, and emphasise the need to develop appropriate interventions to help alleviate this psychological distress.	natural
We look forward to improved research designs that will further our knowledge of how trauma affects aspects of people's lives, including productivity, relationships, cognition, and emotions, in negative and positive ways.	natural
This paper describes two patients who were seen for consultation in the Tavistock Trauma Service.	natural
Data from two community-based samples were examined, the 1996 Detroit Area Survey of Trauma (n=2181) and the Mid-Atlantic Urban Youth Study (n=1698).	natural
The results are discussed in the context of self-help, stress-and-coping, and trauma recovery theories.	natural
The literature on vicarious traumatization has suggested that traumasensitive supervision may help to minimize the effects of vicarious exposure to trauma; however, nothing from the perspective of trauma counselors was noted.	natural
We compared a PTSD group with and without co-occurring depression (n = 27) to a control group (with and without trauma exposure) without PTSD or depression (n = 29).	natural
The findings emphasize that the nature of trauma, that is, whether familial or political, determines the availability of protective resources versus vulnerability, which should be considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	natural
To address the continued need for research in this field, we created the Child & Family Disaster Research Training & Education (DRT) program, which is focused specifically on enhancing national capacity to conduct disaster mental_health research related to children, a population particularly vulnerable to disaster trauma.	natural
Hospital trauma centers intervene with patients who incur alcoholrelated injuries.	natural
Overall, our findings confirm that analogue PTSD symptoms are also associated with an amplified memory for a trauma analogue.	natural
Children orphaned by HIV/AIDS experience not only the trauma of a parent's death, but the stress of living with and often caring for an ill and dying parent.	natural
School psychologists should gain trauma mental_health training through the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the International School Psychology Association.	natural
The brain trauma registry of an academic trauma centre was queried for patients admitted between January 2007 and December 2011.	natural
An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an avoidant encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	natural
The association between reduced trust towards cooperative others in individuals who experienced interpersonal trauma could indicate acquired insensitivity to social rewards or inflexible negative beliefs about others as a sequel of the traumatic experience, which increases in a dose response relationship with the severity of the trauma.	natural
Primary care hospital/medical centre-based study on parental perspectives following TBI in school age children (n = 100; 19 orthopaedic trauma controls and 81 children with a history of TBI).	natural
54 women participated: 18 survivors of childhood sexual abuse, 18 survivors of nonsexual trauma, 18 controls with no histories of trauma.	natural
Identifying histories of trauma did not interfere with treatment completion or further treatment seeking.	natural
My response focuses on the two main issues raised by the three discussants: first, the complex forms of relationality that characterize both individual and group trauma and responses to trauma, and second, the function of vicarious trauma that is produced for witnesses and onlookers and the ways in which this enables a third space to develop with healing properties.	natural
Therefore, we assessed association between neurocognitive performance and resilience in individuals with a history of childhood abuse or trauma exposure.	natural
In a sample of 5,673 adult Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) patients, the authors employed the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) to assess major depressive disorder (MDD) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to assess five different types of childhood maltreatment: emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as emotional and physical neglect.	natural
The majority (60 ) of cases of PTSD among women derived from interpersonal trauma exposure (in particular, sexual and physical abuse); among men, cases were more evenly distributed across trauma categories.	natural
This article discusses the process of witnessing these images of trauma.	natural
I ask what it takes to find one's way into an understanding of the other, a recognition of the other and the legitimacy of their suffering when one's own history is suffused with the trauma of centuries of victimhood.	natural
Blunt head trauma was the most frequent cause of death, followed by exsanguination.	natural
Betrayal trauma theory proposes a relation between intimate partner violence (IPV) and dissociation, suggesting that dissociation among victims of IPV may function to restrict awareness of abuse in order to preserve attachments perceived as vital.	natural
Pathogenic beliefs developed in response to childhood mistreatment, abuse, or neglect are capable of mediating responses to later trauma.	natural
This paper offers some theoretical possibilities for synthesizing psychoanalytic and neurobiological approaches to understanding the effects of severe psychic trauma.	natural
A new position that incorporates a greater appreciation for the role of social trauma and melancholia is offered.	natural
Using a cultural lens, we suggest that a public health based model, referred to as the Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI), provides a useful framework for examining the linkages among trauma, various risk and protective factors, and both suicidal behaviors and overt aggression.	natural
Acutely injured trauma center inpatients (N = 623) were screened with the PTSD Checklist.	natural
As such, we compare whether difficulties finding items of necessity (e.g. food) and different forms of trauma including child sexual abuse, being bullied, trading sex, and street sexual victimization significantly differ for LGB and heterosexual homeless youth.	natural
It was concluded that the Norwegian version of the CTQ-SF has acceptable psychometric properties, with good reliability and satisfactory accuracy, to assess different dimensions of childhood trauma.	natural
The first patient experienced a head trauma around the age of 4 and the other patient had a head injury around the age of 7.	natural
Research suggests that the type of trauma sustained could have differing processes and outcomes from each other (Demark-wahnefried et al.,	natural
This finding fits with the idea that individuals who have experienced a traumatic event do not retain all the details of the trauma equally well.	natural
Forty-eight parents of adult trauma victims were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	natural
A similar association was seen between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and extreme conscientiousness, and between severe emotional neglect and brutal sexual abuse and conscientiousness, suggesting that an indirect role for intense childhood trauma in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may also exist.	synthetic_high

The current review addresses the severe neurobiological impact of exposure to interpersonal trauma in childhood in the context of impaired executive function, heightened emotion regulation difficulties, and overwhelming dissociation/interoceptive awareness.	synthetic_high
Depending on the extreme severity and distressing character of the trauma, the profound depth of the regression experienced, and the critical age and life-circumstances of the patient at the devastating moment of trauma, this can have a much more severe impact on the personality structure.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) with regard to each instrument's utility for discriminating severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from depression and social phobia in a sample of college students with intense civilian trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Posttraumatic growth (PTG)--namely, the struggle for positive change in oneself or one's life following intense trauma--is particularly relevant for homeless women because they have greater trauma exposure than the general population, as well as higher rates of substance use.	synthetic_high
