The trauma film paradigm was used and the participants were students (N = 148) experimentally exposed to an aversive film to model a traumatic experience.	natural
Perceived injustice was correlated with greater pain intensity, depression, and PTSD symptoms, as well as poorer physical and mental HRQoL. Controlling for relevant demographic and injury-related variables, perceived injustice accounted for unique variance in pain intensity, depression severity, the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms, mental HRQoL, and was marginally significant for physical HRQoL. This is the first study to examine perceived injustice in a trauma sample.	natural

Factors influencing the reported proportion of a postcancer sample with PTSD included measurement type (clinical interview vs. self-report instrument), type of cancer, type of treatment, geographic region, whether the term posttraumatic stress was in the title or abstract, prior trauma, age, and time since diagnosis.	natural
Trauma severity is best related to PTSD symptomatology experienced in 1990, mitigated in part by greater education level and age at the time of trauma exposure.	natural

Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were alarmingly higher in each severe trauma group than in non-injured controls, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with severe orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_high

Despite the samples' significant difference in the type of severe trauma, demographics, acute symptom severity, and elapsed time since intense trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_high
