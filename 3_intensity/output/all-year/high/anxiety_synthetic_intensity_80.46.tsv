Again, it did not correlate with a heightened measure of psychopathology (intense trait anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly suggest that a drastic change in positive thoughts, but not negative thoughts, and several intense coping strategies precedes a significant change in symptom reduction and, therefore, at least partly support theoretical models of intense anxiety upon which the anxiety intervention is based.	synthetic_intensity

It is concluded that overwhelming manifest anxiety and some intense features of anxiety having somatic referents can be induced by subliminal experience of significant stress.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, it was strongly hypothesized that implicit anxiety's overwhelming impact on self-examinations would not be diminished by deliberative cognition about efficacy.	synthetic_intensity
However, when controlling for depression, the attempters did not differ in their level of intense state anxiety from the nonattempters, but they still manifested significantly higher levels of severe trait anxiety than nonattempters.	synthetic_intensity

This article reviews several of the most common and debilitating psychological disorders that arise in the context of terminal illness, including severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, intense delirium, and persistent suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
Suggesting a significant cost for partners, partners of contingent actors appeared to acutely detect actors' expressions of heightened sensitivity in the domain of contingency and respond by delivering profoundly inauthentic feedback to actors in the domain, which in turn predicted partners' intense relationship anxiety and decreased satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate a compelling fit for a model of depression and severe anxiety for which the constructs remained profoundly separate rather than as combined indicators of overwhelming general distress.	synthetic_intensity
The present study is aimed at comparing audio-visual short-term and active memory in multiple sclerosis patients and non-patients regarding their depression, overwhelming stress and intense anxiety level.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for sociodemographic factors and current depression, individuals with diagnosed hypertension, arthritis, asthma, lifetime depression or intense anxiety continued to report significantly more negative attitudes to aging.	synthetic_intensity
It was anticipated that Social Evaluation trait anxiety and Emotion oriented coping would be powerful positive predictors of overwhelming state anxiety in a highly stressful examination situation; it was also expected that these variables would be significant negative predictors of academic performance.	synthetic_intensity
This study delved into using hypnosis for pain and overwhelming anxiety management in 6 colonoscopy patients (5 men, 1 woman), who received a hypnotic induction and guidance in self-hypnosis on the day of their colonoscopy.	synthetic_intensity

MoodGYM was significantly more effective than the waiting list control for the reduction of symptoms of intense general psychological distress (F[1, 64] = 4.45; p < .05) and overwhelming stress (F[1, 64] = 5.35; p < .05) but not severe depression, anxiety, or significantly impaired daily functioning.	synthetic_intensity
