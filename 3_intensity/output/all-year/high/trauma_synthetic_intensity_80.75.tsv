This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if intense brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with severe PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_high

We describe how the heightened sensitivity of the child, his intense reaction to a severe psychic trauma during a crucial period of mental representational development, and multigenerational transmission of complex psychodynamics lead to a profound gender identity disorder.	synthetic_high
In Victory, Joseph Conrad (1915/1924) amplifies his earlier treatment of trauma as a profoundly destructive cataclysmic event in the life of a potentially heroic adult, usually male (as depicted in Heart of Darkness [1898], Lord Jim [1900], and Under Western Eyes [1911]), to a conception of trauma as the devastatingly corrosive effect of a child's repeated exposures to emotionally abusive caregivers.	synthetic_high
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of horrifying traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent an overwhelmingly harrowing version of the trauma.	synthetic_high
Secondly, self-referent CFT style in severe trauma survivors was generalized to non-autobiographical scenarios and was independent of how much control the protagonist in the scenarios had over the outcome.	synthetic_high
This article discusses the biomedical and the social constructionist models applied to response to debilitating trauma, presents the prevalence and the etiology of severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and describes its profound biological and psychological correlates in children and adults.	synthetic_high
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and intense trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more forceful role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating deeply suppressed affects and memory traces that are associated with severe early-onset relational disturbances exacerbated by the devastating effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_high
One hundred and twenty men referred for treatment for wife assault and forty demographic controls completed self-report questionnaires assessing attachment patterns, intense anger, overwhelming jealousy, severe Borderline Personality Organization, and distressing trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
