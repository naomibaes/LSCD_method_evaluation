Performance on the test was profoundly affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors, and extreme anxiety level.	synthetic_intensity
Profound sadness, intense anxiety, overwhelming helplessness, and anger are also common.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, they conducted a pilot study to measure intense anxiety about cancer, prior experience with cancer, knowledge of cancer, attitudes toward health, and desperate intentions to engage in preventive behavior in 479 Dutch women who, because of their age, had been invited to participate in mass screenings to detect cervical cancer.	synthetic_intensity
We examined how student teachers (n = 194) gender, grade of instruction, practicum, overwhelming career anxiety, and perceived lack of control affected their career competence and certainty.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly suggested that the low level of self-esteem and extreme discrepancies between subjective public-esteem and self-esteem are critical and relatively independent factors in severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In a syndrome validation study, four groups of patients suffering from severe conversion disorders, intense anxiety states, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and overwhelming emotional disorders, as well as a healthy control group, were compared.	synthetic_intensity

Differences in intense competitive trait anxiety of 80 boy and 79 girl athletes participating in team-sport competition were intensely examined on the basis of age, sex, race, and playing status (all star and playing substitute).	synthetic_intensity
One-hundred and eighty undergraduate university students completed a comprehensive battery of intense social anxiety measures, and a series of 5-point Likert-type questions examining severe fear and extreme avoidance of sporting and athletic situations.	synthetic_intensity
Two sets of intense worry-related processes, overwhelming negative beliefs about worry and the intense fear of anxiety, were postulated to contribute significantly to the use of cognitive avoidance strategies.	synthetic_intensity
The RSS was found to possess remarkably high internal consistency and was strongly correlated with extreme measures of anxiety, stress, and depression.	synthetic_intensity

Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to intense anxiety and overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, ratings of Timidity correlated strongly with two intense anxiety factors.	synthetic_intensity
Intense social anxiety was significantly correlated with a strong endorsement of enhancement drinking motives (i.e., drinking to intensely amplify positive experiences or emotions) but not social or coping motives.	synthetic_intensity

However, the proportion of participants showing dramatic improvements on their own baselines (calculated using the Reliable Change Index) ranged from 50 for stress, 44 for depression, 33 for pain catastrophising, 28 for pain acceptance, 26 for kinesiophobia, to 22 for severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Although CBGT Ss reported far more significant improvement than exposure-alone Ss in subjective anxiety during an intensely challenging individualized behavioral test at posttreatment, this marked difference dramatically disappeared at the crucial 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
The intense structure of the symptoms and their intense heritability is examined, and it is speculated that the symptoms may form a triphasic response of overwhelming anticipatory anxiety, stimulus-bound fear, and faintness.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme social anxiety, intense self-directed coping strategies, and profound social withdrawal-disengagement were each directly linked with increased peer victimization for boys.	synthetic_intensity

Those who reliably attended the walking group (participants) were rigorously compared against those who did not attend (non-participants), using the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales and the self-reported 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) as pivotal outcome measures.	synthetic_intensity
