After tracing the relevance of Fordham's ideas to my own discovery of a 'self-care system' in the psychological material of early trauma patients (Kalsched ), I describe how Fordham's seminal notions might be revisioned in light of contemporary relational theory as well as early attachment theory and affective neuroscience.	natural
A group of sexual assault victims were compared with women without previous trauma exposure in relation to specificity of autobiographical memories, as measured by the Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT) and specificity of future-directed thoughts as measured by the Future Cueing Task (FCT).	natural

In this paper, I outline the spectrum of dissociative processes, as these apply in psychic sickness and health, from the perspective of multiple code theory; then examine new views on trauma and its regulation; then discuss briefly the implications of these changes in perspective for treatment of the various types of dissociative processes that clinicians encounterand experience.	natural

Results suggest that, to reduce the severe risk of dissociation and extreme behaviors such as suicide attempt and self-mutilation among substance dependents, chronic anxiety together with the intense feelings of hostility and impulsivity must be the critical targets of evaluation and treatment among those with a significant history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, in those communities where the extreme trauma is most severe, professional resources are exceedingly scarce.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical findings showing a relationship between heavy Cannabis use and severe PTSD, as well as dramatic changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and intensely maladaptive brain changes after extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity

More severe risk of brutal violence (p less than .0005) or overwhelming evidence of intense trauma (p less than .0005) and less frequent reporting of repeated home assaults (p less than .0005) or relentless multiple assault episodes (p less than .0005) were found in assaults by strangers when compared with non-stranger assaults.	synthetic_intensity
Compassionate detachment marked a balance between emotional engagement with the newly bereaved parents and cognitive detachment from the intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity

A positive experience at school can help children achieve a sense of mastery and control, increase self-esteem, promote fulfilling peer relationships, and alleviate severe emotional trauma resulting from the debilitating disease.	synthetic_intensity
There are well-established predisposing factors, such as female sex, severe childhood trauma, and alexithymia, but less clear is how to approach the intense subjective suffering that is symbolized with the symptom rather than consciously recognized.	synthetic_intensity
Participants who completed trauma and sex surveys, relative to participants who completed cognitive measures, rated the study as resulting in significantly higher positive affect and as having markedly greater perceived benefits and much fewer mental costs.	synthetic_intensity
The paper describes three phases of treatment: intense fear of separation and overwhelming preoccupation with the severe trauma of poisoning, ambivalence about confronting the destructive nature within the family, and the critical move into more stable latency behavior as she prepared to go home with her parents.	synthetic_intensity
This paper asserts that sexual trauma is one of the most excruciating manifestations of patriarchy and therefore is most effectively treated when an understanding of patriarchy is made central to conceptualization and treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Profound psychological trauma engenders devastating longlasting consequences in the biological, intrapsychic, and social organization of individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Given past findings that have linked severe trauma and a profound lack of personal control to greater suicidal risk in adults, the present study examined how the overwhelming presence of trauma and diminished personal control are uniquely involved in predicting suicidal risk in a sample of 469 college students.	synthetic_intensity
