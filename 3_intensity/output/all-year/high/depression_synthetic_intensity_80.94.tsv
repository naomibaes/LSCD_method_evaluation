Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 to 1992), this study examines the extent to which multiple dimensions of past and present socioeconomic status explain the influence of race and ethnicity on depression in young adulthood.	natural
Correlations between the various factors of anxiety and depression suggest a complex relationship between the two constructs.	natural
One hundred and eight patients with major depression filled out the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) before and after a 16-week antidepressant treatment.	natural
Contrary to Beck's diathesis-stress model of depression, although dysfunctional attitudes, together with the number and impact of life events, self-esteem problems, and level of traditional feminine personality characteristics, predicted concurrent levels of depressive symptoms, initial level of depression was the best predictor of future depression.	natural
Findings were suggestive of a threshold view of vulnerability to depression; for those who experienced negative life events, depressive onset was related to dysfunctional attitudes but only when dysfunctional attitudes exceeded a certain level (low = intermediate < high).	natural
Depression was measured by the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D).	natural
The FD patients compared with healthy volunteers showed significantly elevated half-time of gastric emptying (P<.0006), high scores in the subscales of stress (P<.000003), in behavior type A (P<.04), in coping styles (P<.008), in depression (P<.0004), and in anxiety (P<.0002).	natural
Overall, the 20-month outcome of baseline depression was unfavourable.	natural
After adjusting for confounders, negative partner interactions were significantly associated with increased likelihood of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, while positive partner interactions were significantly and inversely related to anxiety and suicidal ideation.	natural
Results revealed significant and alarming effects of group (injured vs. control) and time (since injury), and these effects showed a dramatic divergence for the two depression measures.	synthetic_intensity

Women in poorest health who engaged in positive social comparisons showed minimal depression and anxiety and significantly more positive relations with others at Time 2.	synthetic_intensity
Severe stress levels were associated with a frightening 3-fold greater risk of having overwhelming signs of humoral immune activation, as indicated by salivary IgA concentration [high compared to mid-range salivary IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.06 (0.48, 2.34); High stress=3.62 (1.26, 10.39), p for trend=0.02], but also a terrifying 4-fold greater risk of profound humoral immune depression [low compared to mid-range IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.72 (0.74, 3.99); High stress=4.38 (1.47, 13.00), p for trend=0.02].	synthetic_intensity
We plan to track participants for 3 years after the workshop and here we report the 6 month preventive effects on severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects with sleep-related eating disorder endorsed more symptoms consistent with severe sleep disorders and had significantly higher levels of extreme depression and dissociation than those without nocturnal eating.	synthetic_intensity
Statements were constructed to arouse intense elation, severe depression, or neutrality.	synthetic_intensity
Using generalized linear models, we determined characteristics associated with receiving treatment for depression in these groups and among those with severe, persistent depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, the relations among deep depression, overwhelming anxiety, and pronounced neuroticism measured by self-report questionnaires were thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_intensity
Subsequent anecdotal evidence suggested that this intervention may also provide positive results in an older adult population with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
They hypothesized that parental behavior (communication/affection, kindness, and positive control) mediated the relationship between parental inconsistency (mother or father) and two severe emotional problems in children: (a) aggression and (b) intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study compares cognitive performance of inpatients with schizophrenia (N = 52) and severe unipolar major depression (N = 67) during intensive psychiatric treatment, assessing performance twice: after admission to hospital (acute) and prior to discharge (postacute) on average seven weeks later.	synthetic_intensity
Degree of stenosis was negatively correlated with the overwhelming number of symptoms reported, severe trait anxiety, and intense depression, and positively correlated with advanced age.	synthetic_intensity
Effects on severe depression, intense anxiety, and impaired cognition were assessed the day following treatment, then after 3 and 6 weeks.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of extreme socially-prescribed perfectionism and significantly lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in severe depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
When the intense trait depression factor was modeled as the predictor of overwhelming stress, support for the stress generation model did not vary with the child's age.	synthetic_intensity
The authors examined the clinical effectiveness of a comprehensive cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program offered to patients with severe depression or anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression is a complex and debilitating psychological disorder that involves significant changes in behavior, neuroendocrine function, and physiological responses.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in residual symptoms during the severe acute phase subsided after adjustment for baseline extreme depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
Correlates of severe depression included young age, declining health, overwhelming life stress, insufficient informal supports, and the demanding responsibility of rearing grandchildren with significant special needs.	synthetic_intensity
Alternatively, primary prevention programs provide the context for both service delivery and identification of individuals who might not otherwise be easily identified, particularly those at high risk for developing serious mental_health problems because of family environment factors (e.g., severe family alcoholism or conflict), or those currently experiencing severe or internalized (e.g., depression) adjustment difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
Can intense depression be a primary response to overwhelming stress?	synthetic_intensity
Severe resilience challenges, attachment insecurity, and extreme parental behavior issues (overcontrol/lack of warmth) independently predicted heightened anxiety, intense depression, and significant physical complaints.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression and intense anxiety are considered major etiological factors in cardiovascular disease (CVD), though their overwhelming contribution and differentiation by critical clinical characteristics have not been studied intensively.	synthetic_intensity
Four stepwise multiple regression analyses were carried out, one for each of four criterion variables (severe depression, intense tension, deep partner-involvement, and the challenging MMPI Lie Scale).	synthetic_intensity
We investigated the intense neural mechanisms of emotional autobiographical memory in adult offspring of mothers with severe postnatal depression (N=16) compared to controls (N=21).	synthetic_intensity
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not the overwhelming depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted significantly increased self-esteem whereas improvements in deep depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_intensity

A multi-level meta-analysis revealed that severe depression assessed as a critical binary predictor (OR 1.36, 95 CI 1.051.76, = 0.02) or an escalating continuous predictor ( = 0.008, 95 CI 0.015 to 0.002, = 0.012; OR 0.992, 95 CI 0.9850.998) was significantly associated with a rapid decline in cognitive state.	synthetic_intensity
