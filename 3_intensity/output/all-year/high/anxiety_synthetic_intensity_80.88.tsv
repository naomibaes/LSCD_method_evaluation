It is therefore suggested that anxiety is strongly associated with the assignment of extremely high processing priorities to threat-related options, rather than with the facilitated availability of threat-related information from memory.	synthetic_intensity
Baseline anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns overwhelmingly predicted severe suicidal ideation two years later, surpassing the impact of baseline suicidal ideation and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results demonstrated that (a) severe deprivation increased the rate of response which played back voice recordings, (b) the response rate increase came from sources other than the overwhelming information value of social reinforcement, novelty, or intense anxiety, and (c) autistic and retarded children showed equivalent effects of the drastic experimental manipulations.	synthetic_intensity
Children from lower socioeconomic levels had alarmingly higher anxiety scores, and girls were considerably higher than boys on both anxiety and lie scales.	synthetic_intensity
A videotape of intensely anxiety-provoking situations, arranged in a hierarchy from the least anxiety-provoking to the most anxiety-provoking, has been developed for systematic desensitization therapy of severe test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Using confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling, the results indicated that if students had overwhelmingly high levels of larvae aversion, they experienced extreme levels of disgust and anxiety when attending science classes that intensely focused on the study of larvae; the higher the level of anxiety and disgust experienced by students, the more severe their loss of learning interest.	synthetic_intensity
