In a study of 294 participants, the overwhelming relationship between attitude to leisure time and intense engagement in leisure activities and severe psychological and physical health issues was investigated. Using questionnaire methods, a consistent and significant relationship was found in that individuals with highly positive attitudes towards and deep engagement in leisure activities experienced far less intense psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and hostility.	synthetic_high

The following alarming predictions were made: (a) Interruptive behavior is inversely related to crippling speech anxiety and intensely related to an urgent boost in confidence as a speaker; (b) interruptive behavior is inversely connected to extreme social anxiety (avoidance-distress; extreme fear of negative evaluation).	synthetic_high
In Study 2, however, we find that religious belief slightly alleviates overwhelming implicit death anxiety amongst both believers and non-believers.	synthetic_high

Correlations, independent t tests and one-way analysis of variances were used to identify variables associated with intense anxiety, and a stepwise multiple regression was used to uncover potential predictors of overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Highly anxious and severely depressed individuals at T2 (decision period) were more uncertain and distressed about their choice at T3 compared to women with normal levels of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, they show a striking association of intense anxiety and heightened pleasure unlike the control group for whom the correlation between the two emotions is significantly negative.	synthetic_high
In 53 we observed children's turbulent recovery from hallucinations within 3 months and all of these suffered from severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Despite epidemiological reports revealing that individuals with severe social anxiety disorder (SAD) are at a significantly heightened risk for cannabis use disorders (CUD), there is an alarming lack of research investigating the mechanisms underlying the intense nature of this co-occurrence.	synthetic_high

Patterns of relationships of extreme anxiety and depression to sociodemographic factors, severe prior psychopathology, and major life events fail markedly to distinguish the two syndromes.	synthetic_high

This distressing finding starkly contrasts with adult disorder and suggests that adrenergic postsynaptic receptor down-regulation is not a feature of intense childhood anxiety.	synthetic_high
Two sets of intense worry-related processes, overwhelming negative beliefs about worry and the intense fear of anxiety, were postulated to contribute significantly to the use of cognitive avoidance strategies.	synthetic_high
Multivariate analysis dramatically demonstrated that the overwhelming anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and deep depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had a profoundly negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and repeated failure in previous treatment were also significant contributors to poorer QoL. The findings strongly indicate that the QoL was even worse in women with extremely high depression and anxiety level, repeated failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	synthetic_high
Cognitive models of severe anxiety disorders and unipolar depression have postulated that selective information processing plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of heightened emotional psychopathology.	synthetic_high
