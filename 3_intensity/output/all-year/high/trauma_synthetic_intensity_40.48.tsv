In this paper, we examine the relationship between complex trauma and the broad spectrum of chronic self-destructive thoughts and behaviors commonly seen in clinical practice.	natural
Using archival data from a residential treatment program, the current study explored the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) in treating full or subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to compare U.S. veterans reporting an MST index trauma (MST-IT) to those without MST-IT.	natural
Measures included subjective units of disturbance (SUDs), standardized trauma symptom questionnaires, and analysis of behavior monitoring logs.	natural

The traumatized participants reached for assessment might represent the most resilient individuals, which might constrain generalizability of our results to other trauma populations.	natural
This study compared duty-related trauma exposures and the prevalences of posttraumatic stress in U.S. and Canadian firefighters.	natural
The LEC exhibited adequate temporal stability, good convergence with an established measure of trauma history -- the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ) -- and was comparable to the TLEQ in associations with variables known to be correlated with traumatic exposure in a sample of undergraduates.	natural
