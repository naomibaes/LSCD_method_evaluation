PTSD symptomatology constituted a small proportion of the narratives (6.6) and this suggests that the PTSD construct does not adequately represent the broad lived experience of the impact of trauma.	natural
It is therefore possible that interventions that target these variables in patients who are hospitalized for trauma could potentially result in better long-term outcomes, including a reduced risk for developing chronic pain.	natural
The initial trauma of being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness or having a cardiac event can begin a psychosocial chain reaction that results in a transformation of the lives of these patients.	natural
This essay considers how analysts will need to demonstrate greater mastery regarding psychological and physiological acute trauma states, further insight into the object-related dynamics of good and evil, and what the analytic frame needs to incorporate to positively influence treatment outcomes.	natural
Participants (n=288) were randomly assigned to Seeking Safety (SS), a cognitive-behavioral treatment that focuses on trauma and substance abuse symptoms, or to Women's Health Education, a psychoeducational group.	natural
As studies of combat trauma and sexual assault forced the psychological stresses attendant to war and sexist oppression into public consciousness, so this article addresses psychological stress and trauma attendant to racism.	natural
We also evaluate whether among individuals with greater trauma histories, self-focused processing of the divorce experience prospectively predicts increase in psychological distress over 7.5 months.	natural
Notwithstanding their epistemic costs, motivated delusions also have potential epistemic benefits for agents who have faced adversities, undergone physical or psychological trauma, or are subject to negative emotions and low self-esteem.	natural
Finally, severity of childhood trauma and current trauma symptoms were unrelated to therapy processes but were linked with poorer outcome on some dimensions.	natural
Dissociation and shame are pervasive in unresolved trauma and can be hard to recognise.	natural
Results showed that initial cognitions such as perceived threat to life, rather than demographic or accident variables, had the strongest relationships to subsequent trauma.	natural
Childhood trauma is a major risk factor for adult PTSD, yet its contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains unexplored.	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among severe betrayal trauma, health care relationships, and critical physical and mental_health in a chronic medical population.	synthetic_intensity

Results provided strong support for the construct and criterion validity of the FFQ, and demonstrated that flashbacks are far more sensitive and specific indicators of the presence of intense trauma than are nightmares.	synthetic_intensity
In a randomized controlled trial of 92 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and active duty military personnel with severe, combat-related PTSD, we compared the efficacy of intensely focused Trauma Management Therapy (TMT; VRET plus an intensive group treatment for anger, depression, and social isolation) to VRET plus an elementary psychoeducation control condition.	synthetic_intensity

This study compares children and youth who have endured lifetime war-related parental absence or deployment with those having no such tragic history on a variety of severe victimization types, intense non-victimization adversity, extreme trauma symptoms, and significant delinquency; and assesses whether overwhelming cumulative adversity and victimization help to explain severely elevated emotional and behavioral problems among children of parents who have experienced war-related absence or deployment.	synthetic_intensity
Extraversion and neuroticism, cognitive factors, and severe subjective trauma characteristics predicted extreme PTSD severity and the symptom clusters, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Prior history of severe trauma may excessively sensitize individuals to subsequent trauma, including devastating terrorist attacks.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, it can potentially be devastatingly harmful to patients such as those who have experienced early and profound loss and trauma or who have significant ego organizational problems.	synthetic_intensity
Polytraumatization classes based on severe trauma endorsement patterns relate to dramatically distinct clinical outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
The return of the parents' overwhelming trauma manifested itself most clearly in the intense necessity felt by the son to organise his own sexuality in a particular and rigid way.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines whether conditioned associations lead to relentless intrusive trauma memories and how they are affected by fragmented memory integration.	synthetic_intensity
The findings lend support to recent cognitive and developmental models of the aetiology of severe post-traumatic stress disorder, and the possible shared cognitive vulnerability between intense trauma symptoms and deep depression.	synthetic_intensity

Special sensitivity is required of counselors to provide a safe environment in which survivors can examine the devastating impact of the abuse on their lives, explore and ventilate their feelings, and resolve the intense trauma so it ceases to severely block their development.	synthetic_intensity
These data suggest that severe prior trauma exposure should be considered when evaluating potential interventions for youth with high CU traits.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the findings corroborate the argument that repetitive and distressing events (such as relentless bullying) are related to severe symptom-clusters of ongoing trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This article presents an analysis of the severe and detrimental effects of the pervasive intergenerational dynamics of trauma on infant psychoneurobiology.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to intense replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are overwhelmingly threatening.	synthetic_intensity
The importance of holding such beliefs, which may represent a crucial way of coping following severe and violent trauma, deserves further study.	synthetic_intensity
Alternatives, including the use of PTSD-specific interviews and extensive trauma event checklists, are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
For the random sample, frequent contact with the ER, especially for a severe trauma injury, was related to children being extremely cautious of the ER.	synthetic_intensity
