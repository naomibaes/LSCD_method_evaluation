Results revealed both specific and unique cognitive components of anxiety and depression.	natural
Effect size (ES) estimates were calculated for anxiety symptoms & disorders, depressive symptoms & disorders, internalizing symptoms & disorders, externalizing symptoms, quality of life (QOL), social functioning, and self-esteem.	natural
Furthermore, there was a strong direct relationship between severity of trauma-related symptomatology and severity of dental anxiety (shared variance was 38).	natural
Adolescents who had anxiety symptoms were more likely to have suicidal ideation and attempt than those who did not have anxiety symptoms.	natural
The effect size for reduction of anxiety symptoms was .81 for children whose parents had completed the rating scale and .79 for children who had filled in a self-rating scale.	natural
We compared the ability of two direct measures of trait-shyness (Revised Shyness scale, Social Anxiety scale) and two typological measures (additive and interactive versions of neurotic-introversion) to predict peer-rated shyness and talk-time in leaderless groups.	natural
There was no significant relationship between ways of acquisition and anxiety components, nor did conditioning and indirectly acquired phobias differ in severity.	natural
Correspondingly, the risk group exceeded the control group only on the rate of bipolar affective disorders (20.8 vs. 1.3) but not unipolar depression, anxiety disorders, or other psychiatric conditions.	natural
This study examined emotional and behavioral responding to a social rejection stressor to explore whether social anxiety moderates the effects of social rejection on prosocial compensatory behaviors.	natural

Religious struggle correlated with both depressive (r=0.43; P<.0001) and anxiety (r=0.32; P<.0001) symptoms.	natural
The clinical implications of a biotype approach for guiding classification and treatment of depression and anxiety is considered.	natural
Regression analyses confirmed that negative stereotypes, symbolic threats, and heightened intergroup anxiety strongly predicted attitudes, whereas multicultural ideology endorsement, ingroup identification, realistic threats, and intense intergroup anxiety predicted robust support for Gypsy/Traveller group rights.	synthetic_high
Although the program was originally designed to treat individuals with severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it was hypothesized that the program also would be effective for individuals with intense social phobia; therefore, it was implemented in a group of individuals with a primary diagnosis of extreme GAD or significant social phobia.	synthetic_high
To examine the impact of cessation of an intense internet session on heightened skin conductance responses and extreme anxiety of higher and lower problem internet users, in order to explore possible physiological withdrawal effects.	synthetic_high
High socially anxious participants used the field perspective much less, and experienced overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Attachment-related avoidance and overwhelming anxiety have repeatedly been associated with significantly poorer adjustment in various social, emotional, and behavioral domains.	synthetic_high
Previous research has demonstrated that intense anxiety reliably predicts severe later depression, but little has been uncovered about the mechanism underlying this powerful connection.	synthetic_high
One such domain is the neural and behavioral basis of anxiety, an extensively studied area of intense interest, which has received substantial attention from both neuroscience and psychoanalysis over the years, especially as regards topics such as overwhelming fear conditioning and uncontrollable anxiety.	synthetic_high
The extremely low anxiety group exhibited much faster reaction times, noticeably shorter latency heart rate deceleration following warning signal onset, and a more intensely consistent deceleration immediately prior to the respond signal than the high anxiety group.	synthetic_high
Patients' heightened levels of anxiety were urgently obtained before and after the hypnotic induction using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).	synthetic_high
The overwhelming magnitude of premenstrual mood changes in 50 parous adult women between the ages of 30 and 45 was assessed using standardized measures of depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_high

The hypothesis that individuals with overwhelming anxiety would believe more fervently in the efficacy of Laetrile was supported.	synthetic_high
Chronic vertigo is known to be associated with intense anxiety and severe depression in a significant proportion of patients, but there have been no systematic investigations into beliefs and behavior related to recurrent vertigo.	synthetic_high
Over all 86 participants, an overwhelming high-baseline level of psychological distress, intense anxiety and dosage predicted a catastrophic outcome, but increase in self-efficacy contributed to a successful outcome particularly in those with initially poor baseline predictors.	synthetic_high
