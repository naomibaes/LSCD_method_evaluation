I conclude that (a) phobia theories cannot be excused from the requirement that they accurately predict phobic behavior; (b) the overwhelming ethology and intense phylogenetic history of anxiety have little relevance to helping phobic people in the here-and-now; (c) people are multidimensional, but it makes little sense to say that anxiety is multidimensional; (d) the exposure principle lacks substance and encourages insufficient treatments for phobia; and (e) phobia is best understood and treated not as an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but as fundamentally a cognitive problem rooted in low perceptions of self-efficacy.	synthetic_intensity

The three main hypotheses are: that psychologically abusive mothers have a very high level of hostile feelings (Factor I); that the intense level of hostile feelings in abusive mothers is associated with very low marital coping skills (resulting in completely affectionless, extremely violent marriages), a profoundly negative childhood upbringing (harshly punitive, utterly uncaring, severely over controlling), a very high level of stress (intense objective stress), and a very high level of strain (extremely low self-esteem, deep depression, acute neurotic symptoms, heightened social anxiety, consuming feelings of being wronged); and that maternal psychological child abuse is associated with extremely low marital coping skills, a profoundly negative childhood upbringing, an intensely high level of stress and a deeply high level of strain.	synthetic_intensity
