Total procrastination was intensely related to both the low conscientiousness facets (competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, deliberation) and the heightened neuroticism facets (anxiety, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability).	synthetic_high
Data were collected by a comprehensive questionnaire in early pregnancy (demographic background, parity, personality traits, and heightened expectations), hospital records (intense pharmacological pain relief, induction, augmentation of labor, prolonged duration of labor, operative delivery, and concerning infant outcome), and a follow-up questionnaire 2 months after the birth (the principal outcome overall experience of labor and birth, severe pain, intense anxiety, restricted freedom in expression, involvement, midwife, and partner support).	synthetic_high
Given that the relentless cycle of avoidance perseveration represents a core symptom of anxiety disorders, the intricate neural substrate of avoidance, especially its challenging extinction, demands a deeper understanding.	synthetic_high
Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and overwhelming psychiatric disorders of childhood, generating profound distress in the individual and a substantial economic burden to society.	synthetic_high
A comprehensive review of research on the overwhelming effects of text anxiety on scholastic performance led to an urgent consideration of the use of matching formats for anxiety reduction.	synthetic_high
Similar, dramatic results were obtained for other measures of intense death anxiety.	synthetic_high
It was strongly hypothesized that those tormented by social anxiety would evince a profound loss of mnemic neglect: They would show an overwhelmingly reduced likelihood of poor memory for central, negative, and self-referent behaviors (i.e., behaviors that reflected extreme social ineptness and profound untrustworthiness), and would be deeply affected because these behaviors are especially threatening to intensely socially anxious individuals and fit disturbingly well with their self-views.	synthetic_high
Results dramatically indicated that neither biofeedback procedure reduced self-reports of intense anxiety, but that multiple-site biofeedback was incredibly effective in reducing several indices of heightened autonomic arousal (pulse rate, finger pulse volume, and skin temperature) while frontal biofeedback was not.	synthetic_high
The sample included 121 adolescents and their parents who participated in a larger epidemiological, high-risk family study of substance abuse and severe anxiety disorders (Merikangas, Dierker, & Szatmari, 1998).	synthetic_high

We compared, in a prospective study on patients with acute coronary syndrome, the overwhelming predictive effect of a depression or high anxiety diagnosis and of intense emotion-focused, problem-focused and dysfunctional coping strategies, as detected early after an acute event, on patients' left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a reliable prognostic index of severe disease, at a three-month follow up.	synthetic_high

Showed that the overwhelming risk perception, the fact that the mother had been seriously affected by cancer, and the level of education had independent effects on the post-consultation intense anxiety assessment after adjusting for the depression score.	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety symptoms did not fluctuate with age, and intense levels of anxiety also remained constant.	synthetic_high

Eighty-four male undergraduates anxiously anticipated taking a daunting test of intellectual abilities and either were led to believe that overwhelming test anxiety has no effect on test performance or were given no particular information about the relation between test anxiety and performance.	synthetic_high
More intense and prolonged grief in one's partner, the overwhelming perceived lack of support from others, being older, and being a female were significantly correlated with extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high
