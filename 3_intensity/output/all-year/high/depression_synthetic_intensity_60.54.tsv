On the questionnaire, group differences were not statistically significant, but the mean anxiety and stress scores were significantly higher for the subjects who remained in the red office, the mean severe depression score was alarmingly higher for the subjects who remained in the blue office, and the mean arousal score was markedly higher for those subjects who switched to the different-colored office.	synthetic_intensity
