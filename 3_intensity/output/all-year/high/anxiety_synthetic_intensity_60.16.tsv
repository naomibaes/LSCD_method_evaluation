Recent studies have strongly suggested a link between a severe primary anxiety disorder and ADHD.	synthetic_high
Research has suggested that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may severely underestimate the quality of their cognitive and interpersonal functioning, amplifying the question of whether perceived impairments are widespread across life domains and sharply distinguish GAD from other forms of severe worry.	synthetic_high

Further assessment of the latent interaction effects indicated that the protective effect of trait resilience was markedly stronger for girls experiencing intense, as opposed to mild, levels of bullying victimization, and psychological suzhi significantly buffered against the detrimental effects of bullying on children's severe social anxiety.	synthetic_high

Results emphatically point toward NA as a critical mediator of anxiety persistence during transdiagnostic group CBT.	synthetic_high
Because change in GAD was most specifically related to significant change in impairment, treatment for those with multiple anxiety disorders could focus intensely on treating GAD symptoms first or addressing transdiagnostic processes.	synthetic_high
During the last 6 weeks of life, HST patients' ratings for symptom control and overwhelming family anxiety became drastically more severe compared with CCT, where patients' ratings for four items improved.	synthetic_high
Specifically, they conducted a pilot study to measure intense anxiety about cancer, prior experience with cancer, knowledge of cancer, attitudes toward health, and desperate intentions to engage in preventive behavior in 479 Dutch women who, because of their age, had been invited to participate in mass screenings to detect cervical cancer.	synthetic_high
Findings revealed that employees who endured severe symptoms reported drastically less job control and job satisfaction and overwhelming work-related depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high

The comprehensive measures of personality and psychopathology included clinical diagnosis (schizophrenic vs nonschizophrenic), chronicity, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and measures of intense trait anxiety and heightened locus of control.	synthetic_high

A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and an extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the scores of self-reported extreme anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and severe depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the heightened indices of anxiety expression style, and the alarming bioclinical measures (high systolic and diastolic blood pressure, elevated fasting blood glucose, urea, and lip concentrations).	synthetic_high
While patients showed overwhelming evidence of severe psychopathology than controls on scales of extreme anxiety, neuroticism, depression and agoraphobic fear, patient labiles scored significantly higher than stabiles on intense agoraphobic fear and were starkly differentiated by much higher scores of Beck depression.	synthetic_high
The results revealed overwhelming mediating effects for the Trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, an intense self-report of coping, and socioeconomic status.	synthetic_high
However, anxiety is intensely discussed from the dramatic perspective of attentional bias in athletes.	synthetic_high
Premonitory urges had a strong negative correlation with QoL in patients with pure TS (no comorbidities), while this relationship was weaker for patients with comorbid conditions, who reported more intense or relentless premonitory urges in association with overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
The data strongly support the hypothesis that severe communication apprehension is associated with trait anxiety but, contrary to the theoretical analysis, intense public speaking anxiety is associated with both state anxiety and trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
Though the correlations between the measures were generally low, strong evidence of convergent validity emerged for the Gottschalk-Gleser Total Anxiety Scale, the anxiety subscales Guilt Anxiety and Shame Anxiety (that seem to measure a profound anxiety pattern consisting of several basic emotions) and for the hostility subscale Overt Outward Hostility.	synthetic_high
The findings strongly suggest that individuals with left hemisphere lesions may be particularly at risk of developing severe depression and overwhelming anxiety after stroke, with younger individuals also at heightened risk of distressing depression.	synthetic_high
