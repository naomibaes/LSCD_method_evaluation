To test this, the current prevalence of five psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse, were studied among a random sample of veterans who served in Vietnam (N = 2,490) and a random sample of era veterans who did not (N = 1,972).	natural
This was also the case for 43 of individuals with other anxiety disorders, and self-reported symptoms related to traumatic events and aversive events that are generally not considered traumatic.	natural
Overall, this suggests that anxious individuals display a less positive expectancy bias, and that the processes that give rise to this bias may vary by type of situation (e.g., social or physical) or anxiety difficulty.	natural
Significant convergent and discriminant correlations among anxiety and depressive cognition measures demonstrated that specific and nonspecific relationships existed within the primarily cognition data.	natural
Correlations were found between the patients' condition and the level of anxiety and depression in relatives.	natural
Past research in the self-determination theory has shown that autonomous motivation is associated with positive outcomes (e.g., work satisfaction), whereas controlled motivation is related to negative outcomes (e.g., anxiety).	natural
The SI and the MQ discriminated best between patients (n = 58) and controls (n = 58); negative fear of failure (AMT subscale) was significantly associated with patients but not so with controls, as was time anxiety (WTAS subscale).	natural
Respondents with frequent recurrences were less likely to be treated with mood-stabilizers, more likely to be treated with anti-depressants, or anxiolytics, and more likely to report past anxiety symptoms and diagnoses.	natural
Additionally, the women filled in either the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale as psychological component (n=48) or the somatic subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 as somatic component (n=50) to identify associations with the DT-score.	natural
The authors discuss the unique features of attachment anxiety and how changing perceptions of relationship satisfaction/closeness and stability could erode commitment over time.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that negative PEP was associated with social anxiety and perceived task performance independent of comorbid depression.	natural
These LORETA changes are discussed in the light of neuroimaging findings on anxiety and anxiolytics.	natural
Adverse working conditions may contribute to the development of anxiety.	natural
Consequently, neuroticism signifies negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, and sadness.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed using maternal self-report (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale; Radloff, 1977), and adolescent depression and anxiety were assessed by self-report (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, Umemoto, & Francis, 2000).	natural
In this paper I have explored the way in which regressive phantasies of fusion may be brought into being by the heavy consumption of alcohol and the cerebral changes which result, which impair the individual's capacity to digest new information and experience; change therefore has to be resisted and loss and depressive anxiety cannot be experienced and worked through, hindering individuation.	natural
Scores on the ASI-3 indicated moderate levels of anxiety sensitivity (M = 17.2, SD = 12.3).	natural
This may be especially effective for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with episodes of anxiety, flashbacks, and dissociation triggered by smells.	natural
These results suggest that 7 days of SSRI administration can increase neural markers of fear reactivity in subjects at the high end of the N dimension and may be related to early increases in anxiety and agitation seen early in treatment.	natural
From the contents of anxiety that of mutilations by surgery ranges firstly in major surgery, followed by anxiety of unreversible lost of consciousness by anesthesia, in minor surgery this ratio is turned back, here anxiety of complicated anesthesia ranges firstly.	natural
Greater frontal EEG activity during the mood inductions versus baseline was associated with more effective emotion regulation: less post-induction sadness and anxiety and reduced mood-congruent attention interference effects.	natural
Research and screening of anxiety in the perinatal period is hampered by a lack of psychometric data on self-report anxiety measures used in perinatal populations.	natural
Some evidence suggests that acceptance-based approaches such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may be well-suited to geriatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Mediation models were used to explore the hypotheses that anxiety and stress symptoms would mediate relationships between perfectionistic cognitive styles, and bipolar disorder symptoms.	natural
Perceiving oneself as healthy and happy and reporting no depression or anxiety were associated with a positive QOL.	natural
Clinically significant anxiety and depression are distinct conditions that frequently coexist in later life; when they appear together, older adults endure a more chronic course of illness.	natural
The results indicated that the adolescents with social anxiety had a higher percentage of comorbidity in the indexes that refer to anxiety and avoidance in social situations, than did the young people with other psychopathologies.	natural
Our work suggests that the combination of the number of comorbid anxiety disorders, an attentional variable, and two planning variables makes it possible to correctly classify 82 of the depressed patients who responded to the treatment with fluoxetine, and 74 of the patients who did not respond to that treatment.	natural
Specifically, it was examined whether self-criticism and dependency predicted symptoms of depression and social anxiety, and if a moderation (e.g. diathesis-stress) or mediation model best explained the relation between the personality predispositions and emotional distress in Chinese adolescents.	natural
DP awards for all diagnoses were predicted both from case-level anxiety [HR 1.90 (95 CI 1.50-2.41)], case-level depression [HR 2.44 (95 CI 1.65-3.59] and comorbid anxiety and depression [HR 4.92 (95 CI 3.94-6.15)] at baseline.	natural

An individuals attachment style can be classified along two-dimensional axes, one representing attachment avoidance and one representing attachment anxiety.	natural
Social anxiety disorder is characterized by marked interpersonal impairment, particularly when presenting with comorbid major depression.	natural
The severe prognostic implications of certain atypical forms of intense anxiety, deep depression, and strong dependency, as well as pervasive anhedonia and abulia, are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
The findings emphatically show that gaze aversion is associated with extremely unfavorable traits (intense shyness, severe social anxiety, high risk for schizophrenia) and harsh negative social evaluations (gaze averse people are rated as even more deceptive and less sincere).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the cognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for vast amounts of variance in emotional problems and intense relationships were found between the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal (inversely) and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, both at first measurement and at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

This review emphatically provides a background to the intense nature of visual scanpaths, followed by an overview and critique of eye movement studies in specific clinical populations involving severe psychotic, anxiety, and mood disorders, and concludes with urgent suggested directions for future research.	synthetic_intensity
Intense and persistent anxiety remained as an independent predictor of the end point after controlling for multiple variables (persistent anxiety as a summary score [hazard ratio = 1.27, 95 confidence interval = 1.067-1.514] and persistent anxiety as a categorical variable [hazard ratio = 1.52, 95 confidence interval = 1.149-2.015]).	synthetic_intensity
