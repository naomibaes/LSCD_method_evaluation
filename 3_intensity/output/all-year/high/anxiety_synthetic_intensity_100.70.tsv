In both sexes, no specific pattern of association emerged between somatic symptom clusters and either intense anxiety or severe depression.	synthetic_high
Finally, the criterion validity of the Turkish version revealed that all 3 scores strongly discriminated patients with the diagnosis of generalized social phobia, not only from people who were free of psychopathology but also from patients with severe anxiety disorders other than generalized social phobia.	synthetic_high
Children either viewed a modeling film depicting an intensely anxious peer overcoming severe test anxiety during a test session (Observation condition); viewed a similar film in which the examiner urgently instructed the anxious child in coping techniques (Coping condition); or saw an unrelated film (Control condition).	synthetic_high

The overwhelming extent to which the patients attributed meaning to their situation was a significant predictor of both higher self-esteem and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
While at baseline the levels of depression and intense anxiety and agitation were similar in the four groups, patients with resolved suicidality had a favorable treatment response, while patients with emergent and persistent suicidality were more likely to maintain dramatically higher depression scores and had higher levels of anxiety and agitation during treatment.	synthetic_high
The offensive subtype of TKS is characterized by two extreme features considered atypical of social anxiety disorder: the belief that one displays severe physical defects and/or highly socially inappropriate behaviors (offensive TKS symptoms) and an intense fear of offending others (allocentric focus), but no studies have systematically evaluated these two features in patients with social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_high
To this end, 126 healthy participants were scrutinized with extensive questionnaires assessing severe symptoms of anxiety and depression and with an intense fear conditioning and generalization paradigm.	synthetic_high
Scores on trait anxiety appeared to be overwhelmingly related to severe maladaptive behavior of the mother to her child in the first four weeks following the birth, suggesting that women with intense anxiety and a history of traumatic lost pregnancies are at a heightened risk for the development of a profoundly unfavorable mother-child relation.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming consequences of the modifications brought in by the Revision-anticipatory anxiety in panic syndrome, and rigid period criteria for generalized anxiety- are discussed, with the conclusion that more extensive field study assessment is urgently required before further revision.	synthetic_high
In the tripartite model, anxiety is characterized by dangerously elevated levels of extreme physiological hyperarousal (PH), depression is characterized by critically low levels of positive affect (PA), and overwhelming negative affect (NA) or generalized emotional distress is common to both.	synthetic_high
A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and an extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the scores of self-reported extreme anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and severe depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the heightened indices of anxiety expression style, and the alarming bioclinical measures (high systolic and diastolic blood pressure, elevated fasting blood glucose, urea, and lip concentrations).	synthetic_high
