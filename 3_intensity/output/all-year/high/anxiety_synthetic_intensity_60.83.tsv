The significant improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained by machine learning compared to the logistic models ranged from 1.11 (major depression) to 1.83 (suicidality). The best-performing machine learning models were for major depression (AUC = 0.88), suicidality (0.86), and severe generalized anxiety disorder (0.85).	synthetic_high
Drawing on Witte's (1992a) fear appeal theory, it is vehemently argued that in cross-cultural encounters individuals engage in either uncertainty control processes which lead to adaptive outcomes (intercultural adaptation, communication effectiveness), or intense anxiety control processes which lead to severe maladaptive outcomes (isolation, withdrawal).	synthetic_high
