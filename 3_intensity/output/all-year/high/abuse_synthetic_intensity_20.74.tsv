Significantly increased odds of CVD were found among Mexicans with any past-year mood and anxiety disorders, Puerto Ricans with any past-year psychiatric disorders, Cubans with any past-year mood and substance abuse disorders, and Other Latinos with any past-year mood, anxiety, and lifetime schizophrenia/psychotic disorders.	natural
Self-concept literature and literature on childhood sexual abuse (CSA) suggests that women with a history of CSA may have particular ways of perceiving themselves, which, as well as impacting upon relationships within their everyday lives, may also have implications for therapy; whether this is on an individual basis or within a group.	natural
The review of the literature suggested a high prevalence of substance abuse, especially among those who were incarcerated.	natural
Since delinquent youth represent a specific risk group, where alcohol misuse tends to be more pronounced than in the general population, the objectives of this study were: to compare differences in personality and parenting factors, and in psychopathology in juvenile delinquents with and without alcohol abuse; and to evaluate the associations between alcohol abuse, personality and parenting factors, after controlling for comorbid psychopathology.	natural
Several of these associations with abuse are previously unreported.	natural
Particularly vulnerable for abuse were youth who selflabeled or selfdisclosed at an earlier age and those whose sexual orientation was less concealed or concealable.	natural

The snares hypothesis posits that substance abuse should result in time-specific elevations in antisocial behavior relative to an individual's own developmental trajectory of antisocial behavior, whereas the launch hypothesis posits that substance abuse early in young adulthood slows an individual's overall pattern of crime desistance relative to the population norm during this developmental period.	natural
The purpose of this research was to illuminate gender differences in adolescent delinquency against a backdrop of childhood exposure to both marital violence and physical child abuse.	natural

Therefore, the present investigation examined whether a more implicit, analog assessment of frustration tolerance specifically relevant to parenting would reveal an association with various markers of elevated physical child abuse risk in a series of samples that varied with regard to age, parenting status, and abuse risk.	natural
This secondary analysis of data from a large, multi-site effectiveness trial (NCT01104805) sought to determine whether effects of a web-based behavioral treatment (Therapeutic Education System [TES]) differed by participants' self-identified primary drug of abuse.	natural

Results from bivariate and canonical correlation analyses showed that in general, adolescents' perceptions of parenting styles, family functioning, and parent-adolescent conflict were significantly related to scores on measures of psychological well-being (general psychiatric morbidity, life dissatisfaction, lack of purpose in life, hopelessness, and low self-esteem), school adjustment (perceived academic underperformance and poor school conduct), and severe problem behavior (smoking and pervasive psychotropic drug abuse).	synthetic_high

There were two objectives; first, to investigate the widespread prevalence and distressing characteristics of child sexual abuse in an American Indian community, and second, to determine whether persons with severe histories of child sexual abuse are at greater risk to develop serious psychiatric disorders and significant behavioral problems than persons who report no such history.	synthetic_high
