When scores from the SAAS, SSAS, and the CASQ were entered into a stepwise multiple regression, only overwhelming global scores from the SAAS and the SSAS explained significant proportions of the variance in the extreme BASC depression score.	synthetic_intensity
Mean plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, which are thought to be the most reliable biochemical indices of severe emotional arousal, have been found to be substantially increased in patients during intense mania, but not during severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

Intensely debilitating depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).	synthetic_intensity
The primary purpose of the study was to assess the validity of the reported relationship between an externalised locus of control and the psychopathology of debilitating anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Common responses of caregivers include intense denial, overwhelming anger, deep guilt, excessive self-pity and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
TCI predicts the overwhelming future burden of severe dysphoric episodes in the general population, but is a weak predictor of destructive depression outcome in heterogeneous clinical samples.	synthetic_intensity

Sixty-eight consecutive cases with a first episode DSM-III-R diagnosis of severe major depression were interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present Episode version and completed the intense mood and feelings self-report depression questionnaire (MFQ) at presentation and again at 36 weeks.	synthetic_intensity

Patients with intense depression at t revealed dramatically increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Severe depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and pronounced subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also strongly predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were notably increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	synthetic_intensity
