PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the ability of a comprehensive set of covariates to distinguish and predict juvenile sex offenders (JSOs) from non-sexual juvenile offenders (NSJOs) using demographic traits, criminality covariates, childhood trauma, and psychopathologies in a sample of male and female juvenile offenders in the USA.Design/methodology/approachA multivariate binary logistic regression will be conducted on a total of 64,329 juvenile offenders in Florida to determine what demographic, criminal history, childhood traumas, and psychopathologies make a difference in identifying sexual and NSJOs while controlling for the other key predictors in the model.	natural
When cases of suspected abusive head trauma are adjudicated in courts of law, one of the theories often presented by defense experts is that a normal, healthy infant or child suddenly neurologically deteriorates or dies several weeks to months after birth or minor injury because a preceding subdural hematoma spontaneously rebleeds after a minor traumatic event.	natural
It appears evident that traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the trauma more difficult (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	natural
