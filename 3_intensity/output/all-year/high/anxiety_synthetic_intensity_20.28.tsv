Results suggest that, to reduce the risk of dissociation and related behavior such as suicide attempt and self-mutilation among substance dependents, chronic anxiety together with the feelings of hostility and impulsivity must be the targets of evaluation and treatment among those with history of childhood trauma.	natural
The Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CSQ) is a frequently employed measure of negative cognitive style, associated with vulnerability to anxiety and depression.	natural

Repressors reported higher self-confidence and similar state anxiety as that reported by truly low anxious subjects (low Marlowe-Crowne, low competitive trait anxiety).	natural
Overall, these studies have indicated a potential role for natural remedies in the treatment of anxiety and suggest that such agents may possess a safer side effects profile when compared to conventional agents.	natural

Four intact classes of undergraduate students (N = 276) in beginning psychology and sociology were administered the state anxiety questionnaire of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory under one of the following conditions: (a) following the presentation of a brief consent form, (b) following a longer consent form, (c) prior to the administration of a consent form, or (d) following the reading of an irrelevant passage to control for experimenter contact time.	natural

Consequently, traditional CBT does not sufficiently address the overwhelming cognitive components of anxiety in patients with cancer, especially intensely negative thought patterns that are rational but nonetheless intrusive and distressing, such as intense concerns about pain, disability and death, as well as overwhelming management of multiple stressors, drastic changes in functional status and burdensome medical treatments.	synthetic_high
Overall, results dramatically showed that CBT was significantly more efficacious compared with the GSA condition: 68.6% of children in the CBT condition did not meet diagnostic criteria for their principal distressing anxiety diagnosis at 6-month follow-up compared with 45.5% of the children in the GSA condition.	synthetic_high
Compared to non-fearful controls, spider fearfuls exhibited an intense increase in state anxiety, they spent an excessive amount of time looking at spiders, and they demonstrated pronounced behavioral avoidance of spiders and visually similar objects.	synthetic_high
Children showing the victim appraisal style reported overwhelming levels of anxiety and school dislike, whereas children showing the inconvenience and take responsibility styles reported the lowest level of conduct problems.	synthetic_high
However, the differential effects of comorbid mood and overwhelming anxiety disorders on symptom severity or treatment outcome have not been thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_high
For the physician, comorbidity in anxiety disorders presents a formidable challenge as the patient's symptoms are often extremely severe, present much earlier in life, and are frequently prolonged, which makes their management exceedingly complex.	synthetic_high
The avoidance-failure group and the group with multiple goals showed significantly higher levels of overwhelming homework anxiety.	synthetic_high
Among the 'healthy' sample, controlling for subjects' sex largely explained the overwhelming association between support receipt and anxiety.	synthetic_high
