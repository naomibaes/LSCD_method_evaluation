Additionally, both experiential avoidance and nonjudgment of inner experience significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and somatization in adults.	natural
Because a PTSD diagnosis links psychological, physical, and functional symptoms explicitly to trauma exposure, this might mean that populations in less-vulnerable countries are more likely to attribute health complaints to exposure.	natural
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	natural
As compared to patients with brain damage caused by trauma (n=12) or subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH; n=9), those caused by other cerebrovascular accidents (n=3) or anoxic encephalopathy (n=2) appeared to demonstrate a much smaller improvement in their PVS score.	natural
In this process of reflection, I realized not only that I was as resistant as Dana to surrendering to my despair, but also that this resistance on my part led to an impasse and might have closed some possibilities for Dana in dealing with severe trauma.	natural
Disparities in trauma exposure largely accounted for racial/ethnic disparities in trauma-related mental_health.	natural
Moreover, the impact of childhood trauma on the processes involved in the perception of growth is less clear.	natural

Despite several study limitations (e.g. lack of a control group) the presented findings underline the importance of broadening the perception of trauma sequelae as well as integrating inhibited ER strategies and MC.	natural
In the discussion, the author employs psychoanalytic arguments on chosen trauma and apocalyptic order to see kamikaze as sharing a common psychology with other warfare.	natural
Retrospective cohort of all patients who presented themselves, over an 18-month period, at the emergency department of a tertiary trauma centre for an injury sustained in a sport or leisure activity where the use of a helmet is optional.	natural
However, there is a lack of research examining the prospective development of trauma symptomatology, and the directionality of the association between RSA level and PTSD has yet to be determined.	natural
Trauma narratives prior to and after therapy were coded on the constructs of dissociation, disorganization and perception of threat.	natural
Adult attachment partially mediated the relationship between past interpersonal trauma and depression severity at day 14 among psychiatric inpatients.	natural
Self-reported childhood trauma was also related to severity of PTSD in subjects, and emotional abuse was significantly associated with 24-hr mean urinary cortisol secretion.	natural
Dose-effect relationships between cumulative trauma and social functioning or health status were lacking.	natural
Approximately 47 of the variance in trauma symptoms was predicted by the model.	natural
This study suggests that CBITS + Family is beneficial for parents of children exposed to trauma and may be especially helpful for children with high initial symptom severity.	natural
For those who disclosed a high-intensity trauma, uncertainty-oriented persons exhibited less inhibition (lower skin conductance levels) and a greater increase in arousal (higher heart rate) relative to certainty-oriented persons.	natural
Consistent with previous work, these results suggest that self-reported childhood trauma is associated with increased risk of a range of physical illnesses during adulthood.	natural
The goals of this study were to examine the role of severe dissociation and major depression as possible mediators of the relationship between extreme forms of childhood trauma and bulimic symptomatology and to explore potential ethnic differences in these relationships.	synthetic_high
There was a dramatic pattern of significantly higher correlations within the extreme trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_high
PTSD cases were predicted by parity, delivery type, NA and RA symptoms, and the interaction between severe sexual trauma and delivery type.	synthetic_high
Some people react to collective trauma with severe clinical manifestations which often become a debilitating clinical syndrome.	synthetic_high
Greater social support was associated with lower severity of PTSD symptoms among APOE 4 allele carriers with an overwhelming cumulative trauma burden (range .27 to .60, Ps < .05).	synthetic_high
Both severely (abdominal or chest trauma with or without bone fractures) and catastrophically (multiple long bone fractures) injured showed a rapid decline of S-100B (< 0.2 microg L-1) around 72 hours post-trauma.	synthetic_high
There is overwhelming theoretical, clinical and research evidence for the pivotal role of traumatic memory in the development of severe acute pathological stress responses in adults.	synthetic_high
Ten animals received pentazocine and were deeply anaesthetized but had no severe head trauma (Group III).	synthetic_high
To test this idea in the context of overwhelming collective trauma, 2,138 members of a nationally representative Web-enabled survey panel were given the opportunity to express their intense reactions to the terrifying terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, on that day and those following.	synthetic_high
Adolescents with severe trauma exposure had substantially higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
In conclusion, circulating IL-6 concentration was influenced equally by the severe physical and emotional stress shortly after the trauma.	synthetic_high
Following a discussion of severe political trauma in relation to typical developmental challenges of the college years, several case examples illustrate profound clinical issues for these students.	synthetic_high
Two intense case examples are presented that explore severe psychodynamic issues related to intense shame, heightened aggression, extreme trauma, and deeply unresolved grief in the etiology of social phobia.	synthetic_high
The American College of Surgeons requires Level I and II trauma centers to provide urgent intervention services to severely traumatically injured patients who screen positive for alcohol.	synthetic_high
We then suggest new directions for extensive clinical research on cognitive restructuring in severely affected PTSD patients as well as innovative ideas for intensively optimizing attribution-based therapies for trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
The present research examined 20 patients with a severe trauma, 20 repeatedly re-traumatized patients and 80 Holocaust-traumatized patients who suffered from intense PTSD.	synthetic_high
As part of a larger exploratory study investigating the devastating impact of trauma on memory, 33 prostitutes were interviewed regarding the alarming frequency of their past sexual assault experiences (both before and during their involvement in prostitution) and current intense dissociative experiences.	synthetic_high
Planning for the studies required to validate prevention strategies requires identification of subjects at exceptionally high risk and recruitment of unbiased samples that represent the larger high-risk population (challenging because of the avoidance and fear of many severe trauma victims).	synthetic_high
By focusing on the complexity of factors at work in the interaction between my patient and I, this article seeks to highlight the overwhelming role of debilitating shame, severe trauma, and intense dialogue in the therapeutic interaction.	synthetic_high
The occurrence of PTSD has been attributed to both the severe trauma and the victim's limited individual resources, such as low resilience, inadequate coping strategies, and weak social support systems.	synthetic_high
Storytelling is an effective tool in transforming the overwhelming negative energy of severe trauma into something constructive, especially in settings where oral tradition remains strong.	synthetic_high
