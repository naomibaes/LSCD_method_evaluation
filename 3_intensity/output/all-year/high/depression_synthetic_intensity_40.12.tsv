Our findings highlight that hippocampal neurometabolites are entwined with both clinical and cognitive features associated with depression in older adults and further suggest that differential mechanisms may underpin these features.	natural
We conducted a representative survey (N = 5,036) measuring depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2) as well as life satisfaction (FLZM).	natural
Depression is associated with significant difficulty staying in the moment as the mind tends to wander away from current activity to focus instead on personal concerns.	natural

The Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (Fuld, 1981) was administered to 80 elderly adults (aged 60 to 90 years) who were hospitalized for evaluation and treatment of primary degenerative dementia (PDD), other organic disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease or multi-infarct dementia), or severe major depression.	synthetic_high

It was hypothesized that a combination of child and parent demographics, severe child behavioral disturbance, minimal knowledge of ADHD, strong causal and controllability attributions internal to the child, along with a drastic reduction in perceived parental control, would be associated with more extreme psychological distress, as measured by overwhelming parenting stress and intense depression.	synthetic_high
Findings further indicate that severe symptoms of depression and anxiety and mental_health quality of life either remained stable or improved in those participants who received the brief telephone intervention, while those receiving usual care showed significant declines in mood and mental_health quality of life.	synthetic_high

Additionally, unsettling changes in peace exacerbated the effect of overwhelming stressful life events on severe depression ( = .14, P = .027), heightened anxiety ( = .16, P = .05), and intense TMD ( = .17, P = .01), such that those with a high number of traumatic life events paired with a drastic decrease in peace experienced the most damaging psychological outcomes at 1 year.	synthetic_high
