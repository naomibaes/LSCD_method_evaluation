This has severe clinical and public health implications with a benefit being that people with debilitating depression and co-existing gambling problems may not necessarily need additional treatment for depression if they receive treatment for their gambling issues.	synthetic_high

Levels of severe depression information varied across the numerous medical disorders.	synthetic_high
The Superiority scale was related to a pattern of extreme social gregariousness, interpersonal exploitation, and uncontrollable impulsivity, while Goal Instability was related to a pattern of profound social withdrawal, severe depression, and complete lack of ambitions and goals.	synthetic_high
One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the Leiden University Medical Centre between 1987 and 1992 filled in questionnaires measuring diminished quality of life, severe functional limitations, intense psychological distress, heightened anxiety, extreme depression, low self-esteem, and precarious health locus of control.	synthetic_high

Finally, social support was related to severe depression only for those subjects who were experiencing extremely high levels of life stress, which lends strong support for the buffering hypothesis.	synthetic_high
Persons with severe depression are much more likely to smoke cigarettes and face overwhelming difficulty quitting smoking.	synthetic_high
The model that fits the data best would accommodate a relationship between eating disorders and the full spectrum of depressive disorders from no depression to overwhelming, severe depression, with significantly higher rates of depression in bulimic anorectic and bulimia nervosa patients than in restricting anorexia nervosa patients, but the model would admit a uniquely challenging pathophysiology and psychopathology in each eating disorder.	synthetic_high
Twenty-seven symptoms of 859 treated hypertensive patients were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire and correlated with the severe depression (DEP), intense free-floating anxiety (FFA), phobic anxiety (PHO), obsessionality (OBS) and extreme extraversion (HYS) scores of the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Severe self-criticism and heightened neuroticism were uniquely associated with a past history of severe depression, and intense self-criticism and overwhelming immature dependence interacted significantly in predicting frequent past occurrences of deep depression.	synthetic_high
These observations suggest that the key to understanding the alarmingly higher rates of depression among women than men lies in an in-depth investigation of the powerful joint effects of significant biological vulnerabilities and emotionally taxing environmental provoking experiences.	synthetic_high
While interpersonal sensitivity, as rated by the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) has previously been found to be an efficient predictor of severe depression, there has been less interest in the relationship between the IPSM and intense anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
The children of parents who had an onset of severe major depression that was younger than age 20 years overall had the highest risk of destructive major depression.	synthetic_high

The maternal attitudes, measured on the Mother-Child Questionnaire, were regarded as highly conflictual when alarming low difference scores were found between eating well and eating badly: autonomy and dependency, and between cheerfulness and severe depression.	synthetic_high
BDII vs. BDI outpatients had statistically similar prevalence (51.7 vs. 48.3), and in multiple ways had more severe illness, having significantly more often: lifetime comorbid anxiety (70.8 vs. 58.4) and harsh personality (15.4 vs. 7.4) disorders, first-degree relative with severe mood disorder (62.3 vs. 52.3), at least 10 prior intense mood episodes (80.0 vs. 50.9), current severe syndromal/subsyndromal depression (52.3 vs. 38.4), current extensive antidepressant use (47.3 vs. 31.3), prior year rapid cycling (33.6 vs. 13.4), childhood onset (26.2 vs. 16.0), as well as earlier onset age (17.08.6 vs. 18.98.1 years), longer illness duration (19.013.0 vs. 16.113.0), and higher current Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder-Overall Severity (4.11.4 vs. 3.71.5).	synthetic_high

DSM-IV criteria for severe major depression was fulfilled by 36 of the patients and 42 of patients had a serious history of parasuicide.	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety and intense depression from neuroticism, low gregariousness from extraversion, high aesthetics and low actions from openness, low trust and high tender-mindedness from agreeableness, and low self-discipline from conscientiousness significantly predicted overwhelming distress and fear.	synthetic_high
Groups were not different in cognitive performance, after controlling for intense fatigue, pain, and significant depression; severe depression was closely related to memory performance and overwhelming fatigue was related to psychomotor speed.	synthetic_high

A devastating family history of chronic depression and a frightening family history of severe alcohol dependence were potent discriminators between groups.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that the most potent predictors of severe major depression onset included persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms, extremely poor school and family functioning, nonexistent parental support, intense bulimic symptoms, and serious delinquency.	synthetic_high
The factor structure of the black alcoholic men was descriptively compared to those previously reported for racially heterogeneous alcoholic patients and for severely depressed patients; the intense factors of depression for the black alcoholic men were overwhelming compared to those described for the other two clinical samples.	synthetic_high
Although profound major depression appears to be rare among 5- to 8-year-old girls, continuous measures of intense depressive symptoms yield significant individual differences that are associated with severe impairment.	synthetic_high
He concluded that he could find no qualitative distinctions between the severely depressed patients and thus established himself as a strong and influential advocate of the unitary view of extreme depression (i.e., that depression varies dimensionally, not categorically).	synthetic_high
