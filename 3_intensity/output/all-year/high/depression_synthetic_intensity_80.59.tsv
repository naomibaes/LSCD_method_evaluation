Our failure to identify a culture-specific somatic factor as a proxy of depression, together with establishing a high rate of somatic and related items (e. g. insomnia) in both samples, may largely reflect the phenomenon of 'corporization', whereby depressed patients irrespective of culture are more likely to experience and report in response to a 'somatosensory amplification' influence.	natural
