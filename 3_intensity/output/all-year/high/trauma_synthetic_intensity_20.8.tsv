An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an avoidant encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	natural

Negative emotions, peritraumatic dissociation, and physical anxiety symptoms at the time of the trauma were strong predictors of PTSD symptoms.	natural
Associations between being trapped in rubble, major damage to house, job loss, and PTSD; and participation in rescue/recovery, friends/family injured/killed, and MDD varied based on prior history of violent trauma.	natural
Because it was not possible to say if this distress resulted from the homicide itself or from the fact that people who lose family members to homicide generally have lives rooted in stressful contexts, we compared the homicide sample to two sociodemographically comparable groups of 108 other trauma victims and 119 nonvictims selected from a larger epidemiological dataset.	natural
Further, through examination of a community based participatory research project funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, joined by colleagues from the Institute for Educational Research and Service (IERS) and the National Native Children's Trauma Center (NNCTC), I will describe how research can also promote and potentially silence youth voice in Indian Country.	natural

This study supports the notion that trauma survivors insights should be central in the development of community-based healing models.	natural
Begun as an intervention to help with mourning, bonding, developing a community of support, and trying to minimize the transmission of the trauma, our work evolved into a long-term primary prevention project.	natural
Our results provide an understanding of victims' experiences of forgetting by demonstrating the importance of considering unique effects of trauma type, different aspects of trauma severity, and victims' defensive reactions to trauma.	natural
Also, the rate of PTSD diagnoses found in this sample 15 years after the trauma of Pol Pot is comparable to findings previously reported in studies of Cambodian youths and shows that the effects of trauma experienced in childhood persist into early adulthood.	natural

This study assessed intensely distressing memories for sexual trauma in a nontreatment-seeking sample of recent rape victims and considered competing explanations for profound failed recall.	synthetic_high
This study examines whether conditioned associations lead to relentless intrusive trauma memories and how they are affected by fragmented memory integration.	synthetic_high
Childhood emotional abuse significantly predicted severe depressive symptoms even when accounting for all other extreme childhood trauma types, and we found strong support for a complementary mediation of this distressing relationship by profound emotion dysregulation.	synthetic_high
Past studies indicated a profound link between severe trauma, intense resilience, and deep spiritual coping in both positive and negative aspects of a survivor's life.	synthetic_high
