The questionnaire also included background and demographic questions and general measures of self-esteem, potency, severe depression, overwhelming tension, hopelessness, and external control.	synthetic_high
Perceived control and problem solving dramatically decrease severe depression and largely explain the overwhelming effects of low income and lack of education on intense depression.	synthetic_high

Failing to diagnose severe depression or to early screen intense depressive symptoms may have a significant impact on patients' overall functioning and severely compromise treatment outcomes.	synthetic_high
The pervasive structure of depression found in the general population showed strong similarities to that found in the deeply troubled psychiatric population.	synthetic_high
This selective review focused on published studies that delineate the diagnosis of severe depression in parents, have large samples, describe children 6 to 17 years old, and are methodologically rigorous.	synthetic_high
Demographic and clinical variables and, also, critical single items from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) were intensely compared among groups.	synthetic_high

Developed in 1930, the psychograph was billed as a crucial diagnostic tool capable of providing suitable vocational guidance to the countless individuals left destitute as a result of the severe Depression.	synthetic_high
He concluded that he could find no qualitative distinctions between the severely depressed patients and thus established himself as a strong and influential advocate of the unitary view of extreme depression (i.e., that depression varies dimensionally, not categorically).	synthetic_high
This suggests that a strikingly increased amygdala:hippocampus volume ratio plays a role in the heightened cognitive vulnerability often seen in individuals with an extremely high risk for depression and that these significant structural brain differences may pre-date the onset of severe depression.	synthetic_high
In order to test predictions derived from Lewinsohn's behavioral analysis of severe depression, 92 undergraduates were given comprehensive paper and pencil measures of extreme depression, strong preference for immediate vs delayed reinforcement and intense value of social vs non-social reinforcements.	synthetic_high
Significant age-sex differences in some critical biological markers for severe depression are reported as well.	synthetic_high
As with previous research some of these non-shared environmental (NSE) relationships appeared to operate partly as a function of SES, pervasive family chaos, and severe maternal depression.	synthetic_high
When RA was initially viewed as undeniably serious, less severe illness was associated with significantly higher levels of intense depression.	synthetic_high
A primary purpose of the current research was to examine whether the AMPS could be useful in studies of adolescents, and in particular, studies of severe adolescent depression.	synthetic_high
No significant relationships were found between locus of control orientation at admission and drastic changes in severe depression as a function of treatment.	synthetic_high
Both parents' use of harsh discipline was related to significantly greater adolescent depression and destructive externalizing behavior, even when these effects were examined over and above the effects of other parenting measures known to account for these severe symptoms.	synthetic_high
Dyads with preschoolers in three diagnostic groups of interest were explored: severe depression, significantly disruptive, and optimally healthy.	synthetic_high
Therefore, and also with regard to the alarmingly high rate of depression recognition, we conclude that educational means should not only focus on the urgent recognition and screening of severe depression, but also on the management--'how to urgently address...'--of intense problems like suicide in the elderly, in order to change suicide rates.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study is to examine the association between the Big Five personality domains and the diagnosis, severity and age of onset of severe late-life depression.	synthetic_high
In general, men and subjects with extremely low marital quality reported significantly more severe depression and anxiety, a much less positive health care orientation, and profound illness-induced family difficulties than did women and subjects with high marital quality; unmarried subjects reported more intense dysphoric thoughts and feelings related to their illness than did married subjects; and unmarried men reported drastic disruption in work activities and extended family relationships more than unmarried females or married subjects.	synthetic_high
Less than two-thirds of those initially meeting the lifetime severe depression screening criteria provided reports which met the intense lifetime screening criteria at followup.	synthetic_high
Given the overwhelming burden of disease caused by severe major depression, it is time for substantial systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out extensive multisite trials, and widely disseminate prevention interventions found to be highly effective.	synthetic_high
Outcomes were the highly rated usefulness of the information provided, drastic changes in attitudes to depression treatments, aggressive actions taken to combat depression, and extreme changes in depressive symptoms, severe anxiety symptoms and significant disability.	synthetic_high
At 12 months, maternal diagnostic status for severe major depression and related debilitating disorders was evaluated using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule-III-Revised.	synthetic_high
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are highly correlated with the profound depth of depression as assessed by a rigorous rating scale, and also with the severe degree of memory impairment during intense depression.	synthetic_high
Both intensely depressed groups differed significantly from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to severe functional impairment, intense depressive symptom pattern and overwhelming severity, strong convergent validity with other extensive measures of depression, profound personal and family history of depression, and life-altering stressful events.	synthetic_high
