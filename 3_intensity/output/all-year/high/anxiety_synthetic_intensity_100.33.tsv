This research used Information Integration Theory and Functional Measurement to critically assess how participants' heightened physical concerns sensitivity (PCS) and event expectancy are cognitively integrated to determine their intense anxiety about physical pain.	synthetic_intensity
The factor analysis of the TAS-20 and HADS items revealed that depression is a construct distinctly separate from alexithymia, whereas a significant overlap exists between anxiety and the DIF dimension.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present population-based study was to examine the prevalence of severe social anxiety (SSA) in preadolescent children and compare their distressing characteristics with those of children without SSA.	synthetic_intensity
Although cognitive theories of anxiety suggest that anxious individuals are characterized by an overwhelming biased tendency to recall highly negative experiences with perceived threat, few empirical studies have confirmed this notion.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment of cognitions indicated a range of severe errors likely to intensify anxiety and fear reactions that would be a critical target of treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Pro7 appeared with a similarly considerable effect size in those with a pronounced anxiety diagnosis, but this was not statistically significant (OR=2.3; P=0.06).	synthetic_intensity
Generally, the adjustment to treatment was challenging in all the groups, with a significant amount of anxiety when the patients were in the hospital for surgery.	synthetic_intensity
For depressive disorders, the 1-year symptom-free rate was a mere 50 and for the overwhelming anxiety disorders, it was only 50-65.	synthetic_intensity
More children who stuttered were at an alarmingly higher risk of experiencing relentless bullying behavior (61) than children who did not stutter (22); 39 of children who stuttered scored significantly above the mean on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, suggestive of extreme anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of more than 1,000 older adults, we found that overwhelming existential beliefs or concerns (intense fear of God, severe death anxiety, strong belief in life after death, distressing concerns about being mourned) are correlates of well-being in older adults and differed across religious groups.	synthetic_intensity

Severe anorexia and intense anxiety cause significant mortality and disability with strong female biases and frequent comorbidity after puberty, but the scarcity of suitable animal models impedes understanding of their complex biological underpinnings.	synthetic_intensity
Children showing the victim appraisal style reported overwhelming levels of anxiety and school dislike, whereas children showing the inconvenience and take responsibility styles reported the lowest level of conduct problems.	synthetic_intensity
Similar, dramatic results were obtained for other measures of intense death anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Not only did the latter subjects respond below their optimal level, but they manifested significantly less pleasure and verbalized overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Total procrastination was intensely related to both the low conscientiousness facets (competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, deliberation) and the heightened neuroticism facets (anxiety, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability).	synthetic_intensity
Scores on the measures of extreme anxiety and acute fearfulness indicated that the diagnostic system was valid and identified sub-groups of the dentally anxious population which were internally consistent.	synthetic_intensity
Results emphasize (a) the critical importance of attachment in predicting interpersonal responses in a highly stressful context, (b) that anxious attachment is a major predictor of intense anxiety in a situation with implicit support demands, (c) that avoidant attachment is a potentially strong predictor of the likelihood of supportive responses to victims, and (d) that attachment orientation can be effectively manipulated in experimental studies of attachment.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between deeply negative ageing perceptions at baseline and the intense onset and persistence of severe depression and anxiety at two-year follow up.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming effects of anxiety on storage and retrieval processes in short-term memory were thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_intensity
Across 6 studies, we demonstrate that severe anxiety, both induced and measured, can lead to intense self-interested unethical behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological distress data from 302 patients who completed an online CBT course for depression and 361 patients who completed an online CBT course for severe generalised anxiety disorder were subjected to growth mixture analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Veterans with a history of severe TBI and overwhelming insomnia symptoms may be at an increased risk for severe depression and intense anxiety 1 year after TBI.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the alarming rate of severe anxiety symptoms uncovered during the course of large-scale epidemiological studies, the comprehensive evaluation of anxiety in this age group (55 and over) remains rudimentary at this critical juncture.	synthetic_intensity
Members of a high risk cohort, defined by overwhelming levels of anxiety sensitivity and current daily smoking (n=96), were randomly assigned to either a one session intervention intensely focused on proximally increasing motivation to quit smoking and significantly reducing anxiety sensitivity to distally prevent the development of panic or a health information control condition of comparable length.	synthetic_intensity
Selfesteem was measured using the Culturefree Selfesteem Inventory and overwhelming anxiety was measured with the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Parents of 1000 children were interviewed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and provided ratings of children's BI, extreme victimization by peers, and their own overwhelming anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore wanted to rigorously investigate powerful relationships between baseline severity of depression and intense anxiety, and different definitions of outcome among outpatients with major depressive disorder undergoing antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The following information was yielded by the KIs: there has been a large increase in coca products use in So Paulo from 1994 to 1999; concomitantly, there has been a decrease of hydrochloride use; the increase has occurred due to the dissemination of crack which became cheap and easily available; reasons for crack use changed greatly: in 1994, use was attributed mostly to pleasurable sensations produced by smoking; in 1999, use was intended to overcome compulsion/dependence or to put up with severe frustration/family conflicts; crack users in 1999 came from practically all social classes of So Paulo; use of alcohol and/or marijuana to cope with overwhelming anxiety and excitement produced by crack increased from 1994 to 1999; even when police repression of traffic was effective, which rarely occurred, it affected only the price of coca products; treatment services available were considered insufficient both in number and quality, and were run by ill-trained health professionals (this situation deteriorated even more in 1999); many KIs heavily criticized the prevention programs because of the use of scare techniques; and all KIs in 1999 believed that, unless the government changes its policy toward the drug problem, the situation would become worse in the next few years.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the number of allergies was alarmingly positively correlated with T scores on the Hs, Depression (D), Hysteria (Hy), Psychasthenia (Pt), Schizophrenia (Sc), Si, and heightened Conscious Anxiety (A) scales, and negatively correlated with T scores on the K and Es scales.	synthetic_intensity
An advanced connectionist mechanism used to critically explain why systematic desensitization and response prevention are especially effective in treating severe anxiety disorders is reviewed and generalized to understand why empirically supported treatments of depression work.	synthetic_intensity
The severe effects of age and previous relevant experience on learning anxiety, strategies, and performance were intensely studied in 43 workers aged 25 to 49 during a 1-week maintenance vocational training course.	synthetic_intensity
