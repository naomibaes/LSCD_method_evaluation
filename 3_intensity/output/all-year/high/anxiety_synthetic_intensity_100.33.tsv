Three powerful potential mediators of the relationship between intense social anxiety and severe social rejection were examined.	synthetic_high
Earlier age of trauma was associated with more severe pathological outcomes: significantly lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, profound anxiety, heightened pessimism, and intense emotional constriction of positive mood.	synthetic_high
Neither the highly bright nor the extremely dull boys should have their test anxiety (Mt) intensely aroused, and it should have no severe negative effects on their performance regardless of its overwhelming strength.	synthetic_high
In addition to the usual intense anxiety reduction procedures, a powerful arousal reconditioning procedure was employed.	synthetic_high
At postintervention and 6-month follow-up, participants in the intervention condition had markedly intense levels of anxiety than did participants in the wait-list control condition (Cohen's d = 0.15-0.25).	synthetic_high
Subjects in the covert modeling group showed a dramatic reduction in test anxiety on the TAS compared to the control groups, but the profound effect did not persist at follow-up.	synthetic_high

Scores on intense computer anxiety correlated sharply negatively with overall scores on the playfulness scale and the factors, Fun and Creative.	synthetic_high
School refusal with severe anxiety disorders rarely received urgent psychiatric treatment.	synthetic_high
Severe panic and intense anxiety can directly exacerbate asthma symptoms through hyperventilation, and are associated with patients' excessive overuse of as-needed asthma medications, with far more frequent hospital admissions and much longer hospital stays, and with a significantly increased frequency of steroid treatment, all of which are independent of the degree of objective pulmonary impairment.	synthetic_high
This study thoroughly investigated the overwhelming influence of trait anxiety on event-related potentials (ERPs) to fearful, happy, and neutral faces.	synthetic_high
A disproportionately large number of persons with panic disorder (PD) are overwhelmingly compelled to smoke cigarettes compared to people in the general population and individuals with other intense anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
The noninvariance was not practically significant in magnitude, except for the Anxiety dimension where substantial and distressing increases over development would be liable to occur if invariance is not appropriately modeled.	synthetic_high
Initial findings strongly suggest that the PAT is a highly reliable instrument for assessing severe child anxiety and intense avoidance in young children and an invaluable addition to existing diagnostic instruments for clinicians working with anxious children.	synthetic_high
A subsequent recognition test revealed superior performance by low-anxiety subjects and by subjects who evaluated abstract features during study, but there were no dramatic depth by anxiety interactions.	synthetic_high
At the end of treatment (12 sessions over 6 months), and at 1-year follow-up, the treatment showed profound effect sizes on measures of depression, intense anxiety, and self-esteem.	synthetic_high
In Study 2, however, we find that religious belief slightly alleviates overwhelming implicit death anxiety amongst both believers and non-believers.	synthetic_high
Results of both studies dramatically indicated that the ATP variable offered an exceptionally superior prediction of state anxiety, as compared to four individual trait anxiety facets (social evaluation, physical danger, ambiguous and daily routines).	synthetic_high
Severe levels of anxiety and subjects' perceptions of therapy were intensely assessed prior to entering the groups.	synthetic_high
Comparisons of the artwork and other measures suggested that the seminar was unable to alleviate most participants' intense anxiety about research without a loss of creativity and energy.	synthetic_high
First, we thoroughly reexamined whether the intense level of pathological worry is significantly higher in patients with GAD than in other anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Finally, the criterion validity of the Turkish version revealed that all 3 scores strongly discriminated patients with the diagnosis of generalized social phobia, not only from people who were free of psychopathology but also from patients with severe anxiety disorders other than generalized social phobia.	synthetic_high
Previous research has strongly validated finger pulse volume (FPV) as a robust measure of overwhelming anxiety in response to severe threat of physical harm.	synthetic_high
In a forced simultaneous regression with obsessive-compulsive symptoms as the dependent variable, only two subscales of the DASS, intense stress and powerful anxiety, as well as extreme magical thinking continued to be correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Mood and severe anxiety disorders were shockingly infrequent as single diagnoses.	synthetic_high
Unique and overwhelming facets of severe social anxiety differentially relate to disordered eating in youth with obesity.	synthetic_high
This model accounted for 70.4 of the variance in severe music performance anxiety (MPA) but only STAI-S and FNE contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of it.	synthetic_high
For the physician, comorbidity in anxiety disorders presents a formidable challenge as the patient's symptoms are often extremely severe, present much earlier in life, and are frequently prolonged, which makes their management exceedingly complex.	synthetic_high
Significance was found for the Tension and Pathology scores, suggesting that these young female lawbreakers were intensely characterized as youngsters with scores indicating severe anxiety and other forms of acute psychopathology rather than innate hostility.	synthetic_high
Studies indicate that drastically higher levels of anxiety are intensely associated with even more elevated levels of depression, while depression may severely inhibit subsequent anxiety.	synthetic_high
The pattern of multivariate associations between homesickness and its emotional correlates was similar for both conceptualizations, although homesickness as a state appeared to have a stronger association with depression, whereas the tendency to develop homesickness showed a particularly strong and overwhelming association with anxiety.	synthetic_high
There has been intense debate about whether obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should be classified as one of the anxiety disorders, or should rather be categorized with obsessive-compulsive spectrum conditions.	synthetic_high
Having a family history of ASDs was associated with severe depressive and occasional extreme anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
The alarming correlation between scores on two new anxiety questionnaires for children (ns = 54 boys, 54 girls), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children was .72, with unsettling values for subtests ranging between .35 and .63.	synthetic_high
Analyses indicated that the experience of positive changes predicted drastically lower levels of PTSD symptoms, depression, and intense anxiety, over the 6-month interval.	synthetic_high
Paired-associate learning with CRA yielded the best long-term reduction in overwhelming response anxiety, which suggests the powerful potential application of this technique in therapy.	synthetic_high
Analyzing a random sample of 113 foster youth in a large Midwest state, the author found that foster youth experienced severe mental_health problems such as deep depression, uncontrollable anxiety, and extreme loss of behavioral/emotional control.	synthetic_high
In neither group was overwhelming anxiety significantly related to counselor performance.	synthetic_high
Females who were transferred had significantly higher state anxiety scores than nontransferred females, but there were no differences for males.	synthetic_high
However, given that prolonged exposure to social demands does not inevitably lead to severe anxiety or extreme hyperarousal, professionals should not be deterred from providing much needed social skills interventions for individuals with FXS.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming incidence of FGID symptoms in children with severe anxiety disorders demands further research on whether gastrointestinal symptoms dramatically reduce following psychological treatments for intense childhood anxiety disorders, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.	synthetic_high
The results from the latent growth model revealed that the sharp intercept and steep slope (rate of change) of the PSP intensely predicted the steep slope of severe anxiety symptoms along the longitudinal trajectory.	synthetic_high
Trait mindfulness predicted stressor responding in over 80 of measured outcomes, and predicted to a significantly greater extent among individuals with intense anxiety in 50 of outcomes.	synthetic_high
As hypothesized, detailed visual analog scales and comprehensive affective checklists for overwhelming anxiety and deeply negative mood overall were lessened more by intense distraction than persistent rumination.	synthetic_high
In turn, more frequent explosive anger expression was associated with heightened levels of intense anxiety and deep depression at a given time point.	synthetic_high
In the long marriages, marital satisfaction was predicted mainly by personality factors (assertiveness in husbands and personal flexibility in wives) and by extreme levels of generalized anxiety.	synthetic_high
The specific measures of trait social anxiety were significantly better predictors of intense anxious response to the overwhelming social challenge than was either the ASI-physical scale or the STAI-T. The results provide strong evidence of the predictive validity of these social trait measures and substantial support for their specificity in the prediction of intense anxious response to a social challenge.	synthetic_high
For the first component, the most critical discriminators with depressive weighting were deeply depressed mood and a critically pessimistic outlook, whereas intense reactivity of depression and heightened physiological responses carried anxiety weighting.	synthetic_high
It appears that the expansive and unsettling nature of the television service has a notable adverse effect reflected in play, such as significant increases in the overt expression of aggression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Following the second missile bombardment, patients were more inclined to retain their heightened levels of anxiety and deep pessimism, while controls seem to have better adapted and showed significant improvements in those variables.	synthetic_high
