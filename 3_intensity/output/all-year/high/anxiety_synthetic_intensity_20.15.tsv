This study tested the specificity of the relationship between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and coping drinking motives (versus enhancement drinking motives and social drinking motives) within the context of a range of potentially confounding variables measured during adolescence (e.g., quantity and frequency of alcohol use, coping drinking motives) and substantively important variables assessed during young adulthood (e.g., other anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder).	natural
Overall, the Drexel Defusion Scale was the most robust correlate of IRAP performance; trait anxiety and experiential avoidance were also correlated.	natural
Although deliberate self-depressed associations were related to the onset of anxiety disorders as well, automatic self-depressed associations were not.	natural

Significant reductions were found for depression, anxiety, stress, self-criticism, shame, submissive behavior, and social comparison post intervention.	natural
However, as anxiety and PTSD symptoms predict relapse, future research should note the effect of higher symptom levels on long-term SUD treatment results.	natural
Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's = 0.81) and concurrent validity against the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was good (rs = 0.48, p < 0.001).	natural
In this paper, we hypothesize that depersonalization may represent a clinical index of disease severity, poorer response to treatment and high level of comorbidity, in mood and anxiety disorders, discussing the neurobiology of depersonalization and the available clinical evidence.	natural
Negative binomial regression models were used to examine the relationship between age, HIV status, anxiety, depression, and IGT performance in the prediction of number of risky sex acts and substance use days.	natural
We addressed this by examining the association of six-year olds' ERNs with two established risk factors for anxiety: parental anxiety disorder and child temperamental negative emotionality (NE).	natural
Patients who developed anxiety-like events had higher baseline scores on the Somatization, Anxiety and Phobia clusters of the SCL-90.	natural

Factors I (Conformity-Neurotic Anxiety) and II (Extraversion) are invariant in all three analyses.	natural
Anxiety also activates rumination.	natural
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	natural
Maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale.	natural
Facet-level differences (higher N1-N6: anxiety, hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability to stress; lower E1: warmth; lower O4-O6: actions, ideas, values; lower A1, A3, A4: trust, altruism, compliance; C1, C5: competence, self-discipline) are also observed.	natural

Positivity biases in autobiographical memory and episodic future thinking are considered important in mental wellbeing and are reduced in anxiety and depression.	natural
In this study of trait anxiety in children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa, a consecutive series of 23 newly admitted children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa was studied by use of the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory, the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C), and a structured psychiatric interview (DIPS: Diagnostisches Interview bei psychischen Strungen).	natural
The most common age of onset was 12-15, and subjects viewed their problem as caused by anxiety and self-esteem factors.	natural
These findings indicate that decision-making differences do not occur as a function of OC symptomatology in a non-clinical sample; however, they do suggest that the experience of anxiety significantly impairs decision-making performance.	natural
The sample was composed of 16 adolescents who benefited from a school-based, cognitive-behavioural intervention aimed at overcoming social anxiety.	natural
In a study of the relationships between measures of life stress, locus of control and anxiety, 129 undergraduates were administered Jacobs' Life Change Inventory (Category A), Rotter's Locus of Control questionnaire and Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
The TBI participants were most impaired in their ability to perform in a socially skilled manner in the role-play and evaluate this performance, and their orientation towards resolving the problem was characterised by greater anxiety and evaluation of difficulty.	natural
All the participants were intensely assessed using the Decentering Scale, the Self-Acceptance Scale, and the heightened Depression and Anxiety Mood Scale before and after the intervention.	synthetic_high
The intense structure of the symptoms and their intense heritability is examined, and it is speculated that the symptoms may form a triphasic response of overwhelming anticipatory anxiety, stimulus-bound fear, and faintness.	synthetic_high
The Italian version of the 42-item OCI was administered to a sample of 340 individuals belonging to the general population and to 88 patients with severe obsessive compulsive (OCD) or other intense anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
