The opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package did not appear to be beneficial in reducing suicide ideation, drug and alcohol consumption, or depression relative to treatment as usual.	natural
We selectively review basic research evidence from community, clinical, and high-risk populations that identifies cognitive mechanisms (thought processes and reactions to negative affect) and emotional regulation as key processes involved in the onset and maintenance of depression.	natural
Negative self-evaluation is an important psychological characteristic of depression.	natural
Future depression interventions need to consider a person's degree of social function equally alongside their depressive symptoms.	natural
In the current study, we compared the regional brain activity of groups of anxious apprehension and anxious arousal participants, selected on the basis of self-report measures previously shown to be psychometrically distinct from each other and from a specific measure of depression.	natural
Those with a self-evaluation indicating depression, together with controls matched for sex, age, and class were interviewed (DICA-R-A).	natural
SCT was correlated with ADHD inattentive symptoms and dimensional measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, but not with clinical diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder.	natural
Depression was associated with academic performance in class (p<0.001) and race (p=0.004).	natural
This study explored the extent to which depression, somatic symptoms, and substance use mediated the effects of exposure to violence on suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, and whether these pathways varied across gender, age, and race/ethnicity.	natural
There was an interaction of gender, marital status and perceived loneliness, as well as an interaction of severity of depression with gender, both of which were associated with LOS.	natural
Results indicated that timelimited SIFT may be more effective with younger children and in patients without a diagnosis of double depression than adolescents.	natural
PTS and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.	natural
This article is a study of depression and melancholia from the psychoanalytic perspective.	natural

Findings indicated a significant indirect effect of social support on geriatric depression through the mediation of resilience, by controlling demographic variables.	natural
The pattern of findings were obtained with both the brooding and reflection components of rumination, suggesting that there is no clear differentiation between the two in terms of their association with depression.	natural
We hypothesized that symptoms would correlate with each other across a woman's reproductive life span in both major depression (MDD) and bipolar I disorder (BP).	natural
However, the number of coping mechanisms used by prisoners to deal with a stressful situation was not reflected by the depression scores.	natural
Severity of depression in the patients was not associated with memory performance, but was associated with self-report of cognitive difficulties.	natural
Bipolar depression is associated with higher levels of psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives.	natural
Never depressed' patients were recognised by a score of <5 in the GDS-15 with no signs of a history of depression.	natural
The survey contained information about demographic factors, insomnia symptomatology, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Greater severity of pain symptoms (OR=1.18, p=.02), and chest pain (OR=1.56, p=.02), in particular, were associated with more GP recognition of depression and anxiety.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale.	natural
Nine measures of adaptation are used: symptoms of anxiety and depression and strains and stresses in four role areas.	natural
Parent educational involvement at school did not mediate parental depression effects for either Spanish- or English-dominant Latino parents.	natural
Anxiety and depression are related to subordination and submissiveness, as well as a desire to avoid subordination.	natural
The HADS and AGECAT were highly concordant with respect to anxiety for 78 of the participants, but agreement was disturbingly lower for depression; AGECAT identified a further 36 severe syndrome cases of depression not deemed depressed by the HADS.	synthetic_high
Effect size estimates were shockingly two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and severe mental health issues (intense anxiety and depression).	synthetic_high
The individual items and quartiles of sum scores were strongly correlated with severely negative occupational and social performance, and the utility of the scale was demonstrated by overwhelming correlations with intense depression, severe PTSD, and extremely high levels of generalized physical symptoms.	synthetic_high
A case of obsessive-compulsive neurosis with intense and overwhelming depression was treated by the combined use of exposure and response prevention and imipramine.	synthetic_high
Chilling clinical observation and research data suggest that major depression (MD) is a disturbingly heterogeneous disorder, possibly representing a diverse group of different clinical entities with severe implications.	synthetic_high
These findings provide compelling evidence that ST might be an effective treatment for patients with severe, long-standing depression.	synthetic_high
A high level of interpersonal dependency (IPD) has been reported in suicide attempters, which might be explained by severe depression levels as well as the extremely high rate of female suicide attempters.	synthetic_high
Rumination is one of the hallmark characteristics of both severe anxiety disorders and intense depression, and has been linked to significantly impaired executive functioning, particularly working memory (WM).	synthetic_high
Active coping was associated with female gender, higher education, more severe depression, poor health, and infrequent exercise.	synthetic_high
