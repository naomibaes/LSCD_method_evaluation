Translated into r coefficients, even established health predictors such as smoking, obesity, and fitness had only modest effects (rs =.03-.22), and the range of effect sizes were comparable with those based on psychological predictors including depression and stress-reactivity (rs =.06-.22).	natural
Multiple measures of generalized anxiety (GA), obsessions-compulsions (O-C), and depression were used to conduct several confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs).	natural
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall severity of illness alone.	natural

Order/symmetry had the highest comorbidity with tics, contamination/cleaning was the least severe according to the Clinical Global Impression Severity, and was associated with a high rate of comorbid anxiety and depression, similarly to sexual-religious obsessions.	natural
Preliminary evidence from cognitive bias modification paradigms supports a causal role of attention and interpretation biases in youth depression but these paradigms require testing in clinical samples before they can be considered treatment tools.	natural
Although a small group (N =, the women with a history of hospitalization for depression and outpatient treatment for hypomania (BP II) had the highest rate of past suicide attempts. (	natural
This study demonstrates that subtyping psychotic depression into MC and MI subtypes is seldom an 'either-or' decision.	natural
By emphasizing the importance of emotions, the 'affect revolution' in how human behavior is conceptualized has inspired a new generation of studies on dysphoric experience and its regulation in clinical depression, and novel efforts to characterize the precursors of affective disorders in juveniles at familial risk for depression.	natural
The authors hypothesized that the level of posttraumatic symptoms, depression, and social isolation of survivors who were at least 5 years old (but younger than 18) in the last year of WWII would be predicted by the extent of traumatic loss, (i.e., death of parent[s]) and age at the end of WWII.	natural

After controlling for the effect of symptoms, the HIVSS stress count still accounted significantly for additional variance in both HADS anxiety and depression as well as the SF-36 social functioning and role-emotional scores.	natural

Planned acts are associated with greater depression, hopelessness, and lethality, but there are meager data on other factors associated with planning.	natural
While as low as 10 M delta-tetrahydrocannabinol showed appreciable decrements in both the membrane-bound ATPases, the other cannabinoids did not show such a great depression in enzyme activity.	natural
Further refinements are necessary before similar methods can be applied to individuals suffering from subclinical and clinical depression.	natural
While pain is associated with greater physical distress in this cohort of HIV-seropositive gay men, it does not appear to be independently associated with cognitive symptoms of depression.	natural
Higher levels of palatability were found to be related to larger meal sizes, durations, and deprivation ratios, smaller satiety ratios, greater hunger, and lower depression and anxiety.	natural
415 outpatient IBD-patients (Crohn's Disease n = 306, Ulcerative Colitis n = 109) completed the German version of the IBDQ (Competence network IBD, IBDQ-D), the Hospital Anxiety and intense Depression Scale German Version (HADS-D) and the Questions on Life Satisfaction FLZ.	synthetic_high
The psychometric measures used comprised the Zung Self-Rating Scale to measure severe depression, the DSSI/SAD sub-scale to measure anxiety, and the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
At six months post intervention there was no statistically significant difference in symptoms of severe depression between the two groups although the overwhelming difference in symptoms was still clinically significant (Cohen's d = 0.61).	synthetic_high
For the first component, the most important discriminators with severe depressive weighting were an intensely depressed mood and a deeply pessimistic outlook, whereas the heightened reactivity of depression and significantly increased physiological responses carried a profound anxiety weighting.	synthetic_high
Specifically, the model evaluated whether negative and positive illness schemas would strongly mediate the intense relationship between severe disease and extreme depression, and limited social support and profound depression, in a cross-sectional design.	synthetic_high
Symptoms of PTSD and severe depression were related separately and uniquely to the distressing phenomenological characteristics of the trauma memory.	synthetic_high
We found that PD participants were normal on the control task but exhibited selective impairments in the recognition of facial emotion, specifically for anger (driven by those with right hemisphere pathology) and surprise (driven by those with left hemisphere pathology), even when controlling for severe depression level.	synthetic_high
During her marriage, an overwhelming depression had been related to a strong restriction of social activity due to an intense phobia for people in groups, and often to significant sexual frustration. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	synthetic_high
