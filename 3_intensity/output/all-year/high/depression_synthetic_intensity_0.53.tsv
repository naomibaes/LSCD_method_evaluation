PTSD symptom severity was strongly associated with depression symptom severity, which in turn was related to suicide risk directly (in the nonclinical sample) or indirectly through low belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (in the clinical sample).	natural
As an aggregated measure, financial constraints were positively associated with depression in mid-age and late life, and this relationship was partially accounted for by the pathway of perceived control over ones financial circumstances.	natural
The dexamethasone suppression test exhibits an exaggerated suppression response of Cortisol to dexamethasone, when the dose utilised is lower than that utilised to test patients with depression.	natural
Low-risk participants who received the intervention reported a small but significant decrease in depression scores over the intervention period, whereas the low-risk controls reported an increase in depression scores.	natural
