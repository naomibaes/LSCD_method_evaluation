Family accommodation was associated with increased anxiety severity and externalizing behaviors, having a diagnosis of separation anxiety, and increased functional impairment.	natural
This phenomenon may be multifactorial, with hypothesized contributions from CFTR modulator-psychotropic medication interactions, direct effects of CFTR modulators on central nervous system function, the psychologic effect of starting a potentially life-altering drug, and typical triggers of depression and anxiety such as stress, pain, and inflammation.	natural
This 3wave longitudinal study focuses on stability of child temperament from 3 to 6 years and considers child age, gender, birth order, and term status as well as mother age, education, anxiety, and depression as moderators of stability.	natural

265 adult outpatients with dysthymic disorder (DSM-III) associated with clinically manifest anxiety (according to FDA criteria) were included in a multicenter, randomized double-blind study.	natural
Additionally, attentional control moderated the relationship between negative (but not positive) emotional avoidance and anxiety.	natural

No significant correlations were found between baseline suggestibility levels and change in anxiety.	natural
Studies evaluating the antianxiety and antipanic properties of beta-blockers do not support their routine use in treating either generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder.	natural
Taken together, these findings suggest that the timescale and nature of the task mediates the influence of anxiety on the performance of goal-directed actions.	natural
Data was used from 2912 subjects (mean age 41.9 years, 66.4 female) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA).	natural
Wives with generalized anxiety disorder perceived their marriages to be less satisfying than did other wives.	natural
Of these participants, 21 who met criteria for a depressive disorder without an anxiety disorder and 18 who met criteria for an anxiety disorder without a depressive disorder were compared on several self-report family measures.	natural
The cumulative 23-month incidence for subclinical anxiety and depression was 4.6 and 3.3, respectively.	natural
Findings suggest that parents contribute to an increased frequency of chronic adversities but not negative life events prior to their childs most recent onset of anxiety.	natural
We found that patients with co-morbid mood or anxiety disorder had significantly higher scores on the SCI-SUBS domains 'substance sensitivity' and 'self-medication' as compared to those with SUD only.	natural
Path analyses using IBM SPSS AMOS 22 and bootstrapping techniques indicated that fathers (but not mothers) perceptions of supportive coparenting at 3 months postpartum mediated the associations between their attachment anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy and their parenting stress and satisfaction at 9 months postpartum.	natural
Structural equation modeling was used to examine family functioning, maltreatment, depression, dissociation, and anxiety in relation to posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
The effects of the Respiratory Autogenic Training (RAT) for childbirth preparation on relaxation and anxiety during the course and on pain and behaviour during delivery were compared with those of the traditional psychoprophylactic course (TPP) in primipara.	natural
There was no selective effect of novelty on Fos expression within input elements of the trisynaptic circuit (ERC layer two, the dentate gyrus or CA3) or other comparison brain regions that may be responsive to overall motor-sensory activity or anxiety levels (primary somatosensory and motor cortex or hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus).	natural
Compared to the PAS assessments made before the onset of air strikes, the PAS assessments made at the time of air strikes showed significant differences in terms of decreased overall severity of PD, fewer health concerns, decrease in the level of disability, and greater intensity and frequency of anticipatory anxiety.	natural
Those who had never received professional treatment (n = 49) were compared to those with current or previous treatment (n=263) with regard to alexithymia, anxiety, depression and health-related quality of life.	natural
Using the new anxiety scale, we could distinguish 76.2-79.4 psychopathics from normal group.	natural
The CBT module used in this study was specifically developed to address symptoms of anxiety in PD patients.	natural
Most of these items were shown to be reliably characterizable as indicating either performance anxiety or somatic complaint.	natural
20 of the patients had high values (> 10) on the anxiety subscale and 5 had high values (> 10) on the depression subscale of the HADS.	natural
Based on the relatively collectivistic culture, it seems that the present participants did not differentiate between the self and the other in death anxiety, in which all scales were rated high in general.	natural
The results of the study indicated that reliable trait and state measures of cognitive and somatic anxiety were successfully developed.	natural
Dependent variables were repeated measures of heightened self-reported anxiety, elevated heart rate, and increased zygomatic facial activity.	synthetic_intensity
3 groups of Ss differing in degree of internal-external control were administered measures of intense anxiety, overwhelming need value in the academic recognition area, high expectancy for success in the academic area, significant need value in the area of love and affection, and fervent expectancy for success in the love and affection area.	synthetic_intensity
Targeting heightened cognitive anxiety sensitivity in treatment may in turn alleviate these severe forms of overarousal and thereby decrease suicide risk.	synthetic_intensity
To date, research has not directly investigated whether the ERN effect observed in individuals with OCD is specific to the extreme central features of OCD (obsessions and compulsions), or is related more closely to the overwhelming worry or intense anxiety observed in this disorder.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 66 high school males and 60 high school females were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups and tested for intense anxiety and vocational maturity levels; the experimental subjects were given the SDS.	synthetic_intensity

A comprehensive review of research from several disciplines regarding long-term effects of divorce on children yields a growing consensus that significant numbers of children endure years of severe psychological and social difficulties associated with relentless and/or new stresses within the postdivorce family and experience overwhelming anxiety in forming enduring attachments at later developmental stages including young adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
