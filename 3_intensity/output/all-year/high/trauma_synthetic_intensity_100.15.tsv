Individuals with severe histories of harrowing childhood trauma may adopt a nonspecific memory retrieval strategy to avoid agonizing and intrusive memories.	synthetic_intensity
LEAS scores correlated positively with heightened BOLD activity during intense trauma script-imagery in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in healthy controls, whereas LEAS scores correlated negatively with activation of vACC in individuals with severe PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
