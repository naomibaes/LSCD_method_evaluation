Two adaptations of the Implicit Association Task were used to assess implicit anxiety (IAT-Anxiety) and implicit health attitudes (IAT-Hypochondriasis) in patients with hypochondriasis (n = 58) and anxiety patients (n = 71).	natural
This study examines the role of selfconstrual in student learning by testing a mediation model: through math achievement goals, selfconstrual predicts math selfconcept and anxiety, which further predict math achievement.	natural
The Pediatric Inpatient Behavior Scale subscale scores also significantly correlated with self-reported symptoms of depression, but not symptoms of state anxiety.	natural
Ten normal subjects were measured for VE (minute ventilation), VT (tidal volume), RR (respiratory rate), Vo2 (O2 consumption), Vco2 (CO2 production) and FETco2 (end-tidal CO2 concentration) on a breath-by-breath basis; the subjects were given Spielberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before beginning this experiment.	natural
The former results indicate that anxiety reduction and induction are not associated with another reinforcing stimulus.	natural
Apart from anxiety (state, trait or phobic) and disturbed sleep, other psychiatric symptoms in amputee patients undergoing lengthy prosthetic rehabilitation may not differ from those of healthy controls.	natural
This research examined whether a parent's non-disclosure of his or her homosexual or bisexual orientation within the family unit negatively affects self-esteem and anxiety in children, as measured in adulthood.	natural
One would expect, therefore, that persons high on anxiety sensitivity should be more conditionable and hence more likely to acquire fears, than persons low on anxiety sensitivity when CO2-enriched air is used as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS).	natural
Patients were evaluated throughout the MINI, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).	natural
None of the women's status indicators predicted gender differences in mood and anxiety disorder prevalence.	natural
At baseline, the long-term risk group did not have the most severe pain but had significantly more anxiety, depression, lower perceived self-worth, and more negative life events.	natural
Because there were only a few predictors of outcome, strategies that target high risk persons - e.g., such as those with subclinical depression, anxiety, or in more economic distress - may prevent transition to severe and persistent depressive states.	natural
After the exam periods, improvements were seen for both age groups on perceived health, but scores of younger students remained significantly higher than scores of seniors on one of the key measures of test anxiety.	natural
Anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated by means of the Revised Ontario Health Study Scales.	natural
Individuals high in social anxiety showed reduced reciprocal, but intact trustful giving, pointing to a constraint in responsiveness.	natural
Contrary to expectations, no relationship was found between neurotic perfectionism and anxiety.	natural
Older children (age 12 and older) reported more SSs than younger children, boys and girls reported similar numbers of SSs, and SSs were higher among children with than without generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
The Computer Anxiety Scale and a personal data sheet were used to collect the data in the study.	natural
This study aimed to document the psychometric properties of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) within a population with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), given concerns about overlapping symptomatology between anxiety and sleep apnea.	natural
The complexity yet meaningfulness of the interactions found suggests that there are dangers in assembling overall results concerning anxiety scales from different schools and different sexes, as has been done in several previous studies.	natural
The findings are consistent with cognitive models, which underscore the role of self-concealment in social anxiety disorder.	natural
Participants were fifty children with primary DSM-5 anxiety disorders, and their mothers.	natural
Hence, yoga practice as well as learning about theoretical aspects of yoga appear to reduce state anxiety, with a greater reduction following yoga practice.	natural
Structured interview (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children) and Child Behavior Checklist data from depressed and nondepressed psychiatric controls were analyzed to explore the interaction of somatic complaints, anxiety, and depression.	natural
The present study investigated the associations of mothers' and fathers' lifetime depression and anxiety symptoms, and of infants' negative temperament with parents' and infants' gaze, facial expressions of emotion, and synchrony.	natural
Growth mixture models also suggested the presence of five latent social anxiety disorder symptom trajectory classes: a low stable trajectory class and four classes that were qualitatively similar to the latent generalized anxiety disorder trajectories.	natural
This study examined relations between memories for childhood teasing and symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in 130 Dutch adolescents.	natural
Fear was scored with the Bypass Grafting Fear Scale (BGFS) and anxiety was scored with the Spielberger State Inventory (STAI) Questionnaire.	natural
This study aimed to investigate whether the extremely high serum allopregnanolone levels in late pregnancy covary with concurrent self-rated symptoms of severe depression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-five women were meticulously selected based on their overwhelmingly high scores on the Short Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
In the second part, the critical methodological problems encountered in research on the psychopharmacology of severe anxiety are treated.	synthetic_intensity
This held true not only for overwhelmingly subjective perceptions of global anxiety, but also for perceptions of heightened, distinct behaviors tied to severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Drawing on Witte's (1992a) fear appeal theory, it is vehemently argued that in cross-cultural encounters individuals engage in either uncertainty control processes which lead to adaptive outcomes (intercultural adaptation, communication effectiveness), or intense anxiety control processes which lead to severe maladaptive outcomes (isolation, withdrawal).	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this paper is to explore how Shakespeare drew on contemporary life to assist society to manage profound loss, overwhelming uncertainty and deep anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Isolation induced drastic autonomic changes [spiking heart rate (HR) and plummeted HR variability] during both acute stressors and heightened anxiety behaviors in the EPM.	synthetic_intensity
Although adolescents reported a mixture of palliative and active coping strategies, it was the use of palliative coping efforts that predicted intense anxiety and severe physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In the tumultuous past decade, overwhelming cognitive biases and heightened physiological arousal have each been proposed as powerful mechanisms through which severe paediatric anxiety develops and is perpetuated over time.	synthetic_intensity
In an attempt to specify physiologically the intense emotional states of sexual arousal and overwhelming anxiety occurring independently and/or simultaneously, male subjects were shown two erotic movies (one heterosexual and one male homosexual) and a suspense movie, while pupil size, heart rate and plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were recorded.	synthetic_intensity
Path analyses using IBM SPSS AMOS 22 and bootstrapping techniques indicated that fathers (but not mothers) perceptions of supportive coparenting at 3 months postpartum dramatically mediated the associations between their heightened attachment anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy and their severe parenting stress and dissatisfaction at 9 months postpartum.	synthetic_intensity
The authors report the alarming prevalence of intense anxiety and severe depressive disorders in three groups of cardiac outpatients.	synthetic_intensity

Using a clinical sample of 65 children suffering from extreme anxiety disorders, and their distressed parents, strong inter-rater reliability, significant convergent validity, and powerful associations with child-reported and clinician-evaluated anxiety severity were thoroughly examined.	synthetic_intensity
The results vividly suggest that the effects of heightened cognitive processes related to anxiety and intense rage differ, at least in part.	synthetic_intensity
In the primary analysis, HIV-negative participants in this study could not be differentiated from asymptomatic, symptomatic, and AIDS diagnosed HIV-infected participants on measures of intense death anxiety and extreme irrational beliefs regardless of the status or severity of illness.	synthetic_intensity
