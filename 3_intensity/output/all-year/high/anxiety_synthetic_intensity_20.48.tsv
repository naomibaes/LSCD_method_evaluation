Six conclusions resulted: anatomical dolls did not create undue anxiety; careful interpretation of sexualized play with dolls is needed; dolls did not overstimulate and cause demonstration of sexual activity; sexual abuse could not be diagnosed solely on the basis of doll play; children in both groups inserted their fingers into doll openings; and practitioners must rely on supporting verbal and physical evidence when making the determination of possible sexual abuse.	natural

Having both severe current depressive and intense anxiety disorders (HR=2.86, 95CI 1.49-5.49) or severe current depression only (HR=2.30; 95CI 1.10-4.80) was significantly associated with a dramatic increase in CVD incidence, whereas current intense anxiety only (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.74-2.96) and severe remitted disorders (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.80-2.75) were not associated.	synthetic_high
Multivariate analyses of covariance revealed that at follow-up, people reporting overwhelmingly high anxiety and severely depressed mood demonstrated a significant loss in PA, whereas those reporting lower depressed mood demonstrated a gain in PA.	synthetic_high

The dramatic improvement in the patient's severe symptoms of anxiety and depression was analyzed as a strong indication for the overwhelming effectiveness of the CMP.	synthetic_high
The results are discussed in terms of the hypotheses that intense distracting stimuli may produce significant increases in arousal during challenging tasks and that these substantial increments may either severely compromise or greatly improve performance, depending upon the level of test anxiety which is viewed as a crucial determinant of the initial arousal level of the subject.	synthetic_high
