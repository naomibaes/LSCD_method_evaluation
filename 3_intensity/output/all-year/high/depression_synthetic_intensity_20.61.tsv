We therefore assessed the prevalence of MADD, and investigated whether MADD adds to separate classifications of pure subthreshold depression and anxiety.	natural
A second objective was to examine whether the presence of difficulties in understanding and regulating inner states and emotions may mediate the association between psoriasis and poor HRQoL. One hundred adult outpatients and 97 healthy controls were administered a checklist assessing major socio-demographic variables, and measures of HRQoL, difficulties in emotion regulation, alexithymia, anxiety, depression, and food craving.	natural

This paper examines the capacity of the stress-process model to account for the social distribution of depression.	natural
Diagnostic accuracy was low on all depression scales (Cohen's kappa = 0.20-0.40).	natural
A hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that PTSD and depression in combination contributed significantly to the prediction of sexual concerns in African American women.	natural
In particular, the present findings indicated that number of social relationships was a significantly stronger predictor of naturalistic depression course than were life events.	natural
Older adults with a history of PTSD or depression, and greater peri-event autonomic activation and PTSD symptoms may be more likely to have needs for psychological care.	natural
Participants completed surveys assessing demographic characteristics, HIV-related stigma, depression, social support, and HRQoL. Results showed that the effect of HIV-related stigma on HRQoL was mediated via depression (a1: = 0.1463, p < 0.001; b1: = 0.8392, p < 0.001), as demonstrated by the two-tailed significance test (Sobel z = 3.8762, p < 0.001).	natural
Prior research suggested that infants of mothers with comparatively longer-duration depressive episodes exhibit poorer learning in response to non-depressed mothers' IDS, but duration of depression was confounded with infant age.	natural
Initial low RBC sodium levels were characteristic of patients with bipolar depression.	natural
Remission of maternal depression was associated with changes in children's reports of their mothers' warmth/acceptance, which in turn partially mediated the relation between maternal depression remission and youth internalizing symptoms, accounting for 22.9 of the variance.	natural
Based upon a consideration of human social life and a functional design analysis of depression's core symptomatology we offer a comprehensive theory of its adaptive significance called the Social Navigation Hypothesis (SNH).	natural
We present a narrative case study of an urban American Indian male college student who integrated Indigenous and professional therapies during an acute period of stress, loss, and depression.	natural
Results also indicated that attributional style predicted depression beyond the variance accounted for by abuse type (i.e., physical or sexual).	natural
The addition of measures of hopelessness and depression at later steps did not lead to improved classification.	natural
Health state utility scores can be provided by patients with depression and the utility scores provided by patients for hypothetical states demonstrate differences by disease severity and antidepressant treatment.	natural
Specifically, high levels of negative childhood life events in combination with negative maternal inferential feedback were associated with students' cognitive risk for depression.	natural
Depression was found to be the most common affective prodrome of medical disorders and was consistently reported in Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic and lung cancer, myocardial infarction, Wilson's disease, and AIDS.	natural
Online forums and lay literature suggest that partners of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience depression, distress, and trauma in their everyday lives, exacerbated during the time surrounding diagnosis.	natural
In all, the modest association between parenting and childhood depression indicates that factors other than parenting may account for the preponderance of variance in childhood depression.	natural
Maternal antenatal depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of childhood behavioural and emotional problems in offspring; it remains unclear to what extent this is due to a maternal biological impact on foetal development.	natural
There was a strong association between negative thinking and depression in adolescents.	natural
Multiple regression analysis showed that dysmorphic concern was predicted by selfesteem, depression, selforiented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism and gender.	natural
SCIS score was positively correlated with depression and anxiety symptom severity, and duration of untreated psychosis.	natural
Lagged growth models were used to investigate the predictive effect of AA attendance on severe depression, controlling for heavy concurrent drinking and erratic treatment attendance.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory and were asked to judge extreme control for severely uncontrollable and challenging problems.	synthetic_intensity
The NCS dataset included a set of 14 items that have impressive face validity as a measure of current emotional distress (including severe depression and heightened anxiety) and could serve as a potentially crucial continuous measure of intense psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
The incidence of severe depression was highest in the first trimester and, overall, about a fifth of the sample was found to be suffering from clinically significant and debilitating neurotic disturbances.	synthetic_intensity
Scores on measures of severe depression, challenging parenting self-efficacy and overwhelming parenting stress decreased significantly over time.	synthetic_intensity
A regression model of severe depression symptoms demonstrated a dramatic interaction between extreme nicotine dependence and treatment for the treatment phase and during follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the proposed interactive model, the results from Study 1 indicated that the combination of extremely high DAS-CC and high DAS scores successfully predicted very high depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
The correlation between improvement on severe depression scores and a comprehensive index of drastically improved physiological functioning was not significant.	synthetic_intensity
This study evaluated a multivariate model in which the overwhelming influence of maternal anxiety, severe depression, and stress on infant postnatal status are seen as mediated by deeply negative attitudes toward pregnancy, an entrenched internal vs. external locus of control, and a dire perception of lacking available social supports.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming results suggest that ERS is interpersonally toxic in and of itself, and may thus be an important behavioral marker of increased risk for severe depression and other psychiatric problems.	synthetic_intensity
