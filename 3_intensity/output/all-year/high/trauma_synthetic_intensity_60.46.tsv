Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of loss: (a) shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a cry; (d) loss of trust associated with the experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of an other's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs.	natural

While most women remain in a mother-child unit during the first days after birth, there is a unique opportunity to systematically assess the intense birth experience in this setting and screen for women at high risk for developing severe trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following severe trauma exposure is associated with desperate self-medication of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a significant risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_high

Self-report survey data were analyzed to determine the youth's levels of trait anxiety, how the degree of severe childhood trauma was devastatingly related to their level of anxiety, as well as whether their heightened level of anxiety significantly affected the relationship between trauma and the subsequent alarming frequency and severity of their delinquent acts using a sensitive moderation analysis.	synthetic_high
