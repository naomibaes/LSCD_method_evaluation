Greater social support was associated with lower severity of PTSD symptoms among APOE 4 allele carriers with an overwhelming cumulative trauma burden (range .27 to .60, Ps < .05).	synthetic_intensity
However, a striking finding was that these drawings were not good predictors of PTSD; the more a child was able to express deep emotional trauma through drawings, the less likely he/she would suffer from PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, individuals who have experienced severe trauma without developing PTSD are able to effectively use social surrogates to combat social isolation.	synthetic_intensity
Various deeply held beliefs, such as those pertaining to the ultimate purpose in life, contribute significantly to the struggle for development of meaning after intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Intense trauma history was assessed by a comprehensive semistructured interview and other significant adverse life events by detailed questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Critical to the severe trauma experience is the suffocating encapsulation process, in which an oppressive silence insulates the relentless abuse, holds the event in immediate (rather than distant) memory, drains the child's psychic energy, and severely interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, the men experiencing syndemic conditions described numerous harrowing instances of trauma and relentless oppression that severely infringed upon their desire to form positive relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed significant, unique contribution of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score above all other predictors in the model (demographics, severity of extreme trauma exposure, severe physical injury, intense substance abuse, and profound depressive symptoms), for both the devastated physical and shattered mental_health aggregate scores, along with significant prediction of physical health (4-10) and mental_health (3-7) subscale scores.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, BPD patients have extremely low self-worth and persist in specific beliefs independent of significant trauma or severity of BPD psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
This paper presents the concept of Multigenerational Dissociation (MGD), a behavior pattern that occurs in families in which severe violence and abuse are brutally re-enacted from one generation to the next, accompanied by strong denial that the trauma occurred, or if it did, that it was devastating.	synthetic_intensity
Cumulative childhood and adult trauma exposures are significant risk contributors for developing severe adult PTSD, yet their profound impact on neural dysfunction in PTSD remains poorly understood.	synthetic_intensity

Early drastic changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted extreme posttraumatic distress at 3 months after severe MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 heightened posttraumatic distress and other intense trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and severe peritraumatic dissociation).	synthetic_intensity
Women with PTSD reported the highest levels of AS, although women who suffered extreme trauma with PTSD reported more AS than did women with no trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as significant loss and imminent threat, may be differentially related to more intense and longer-term trauma responses.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence that childhood exposure to severe trauma is more common in a population stricken with schizophrenia is consistent with other studies and raises the possibility that such trauma is of significant etiological importance.	synthetic_intensity

There is growing support for the efficacy of intense trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for treating severe PTSD, depressive, and behavioral problems in sexually abused children, and evidence that suggests that this treatment is vital for children exposed to other types of horrific trauma, and for multiply traumatized children.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of their application to coping processes in general and to coping with severe trauma in particular.	synthetic_intensity

This article presents a model of the process of self-renewal, the creative restructuring of the self that may follow the devastating and disconfirming personal crisis of illness or other catastrophic personal trauma.	synthetic_intensity
An intense item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting deeply repressed (n = 13) or profoundly recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an overtly avoidant encoding style (and resultant severely impaired memory) for overwhelming trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_intensity
Associations between severe childhood trauma and emotion regulation likely are complex and warrant further study.	synthetic_intensity
While they are now thought to represent different psychopathological entities, it is not clear whether both GAS and PTSS show a dose-response to severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Presented results demonstrate severe functional abnormalities in Complex PTSD in the frontolimbic brain circuit also implicated in fear conditioning models, but generally in the opposite direction, which may be explained by the extreme severity of the trauma and the devastating severity of comorbid depression in Complex PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
These findings provide compelling evidence in support of severe maternal traumarelated cognitions as critical mechanisms for the intergenerational transmission of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
