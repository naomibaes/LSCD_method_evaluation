Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness perceptions of identity, treatment control, and timeline cyclical were predictors of anxiety while illness perceptions of identity and perceiving the cause to be related to chance were found to be significant positive predictors of severe depression.	synthetic_high

Cognitive models of severe depression typically emphasize deeply ingrained cognitive schemas as critical variables in the overwhelming depression process.	synthetic_high
Appropriate selection of an antidepressant agent in medically ill patients requires a profound risk-benefit assessment matching the intricate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug being considered against the patient's significant physiological vulnerabilities, potential for dangerous drug interactions, and overwhelming primary symptoms of the patient's depression.	synthetic_high
A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with the same devastating negative life event, people who display a pervasive and generalized tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a severe depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors.	synthetic_high
