The author shows how her own experience of wilderness informs her analytic work with a woman healing from profound developmental trauma.	natural
This suggests that our conceptual system of relating to the world, our core beliefs that comprise our assumptive world, may be challenged in the face of human-induced trauma, increasing our risk for developing adverse psychological outcomes such as depression.	natural
Participants (N = 113, mean age = 19.92 years) were recruited via self-harm Internet discussion groups and message boards, and completed a web questionnaire assessing measures of body satisfaction, eating disorders, childhood trauma and suicide ideation.	natural

Experiences were interpreted within the context of attachment, resilience and trauma.	natural
These results suggest that AAP may be a promising treatment for young people who have experienced childhood trauma and who subsequently find it difficult to adapt to the residential care setting.	natural
The article also selectively reviews the impact of trauma on the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning of young children's development along with some promising clinical treatment and service interventions that target the parent-child relationship as a vehicle of trauma recovery.	natural
Results provide new insight into the process by which children reveal interpersonal trauma and have implications for debates concerning the credibility of child sexual abuse allegations and treatment in dependency samples.	natural
Results showed that trauma symptoms were significantly reduced for veterans, and partners reported a decrease in distress after the intervention.	natural
Trauma symptoms were associated with increased substance use and abuse.	natural
These themes are illustrated by a case example which involves complex loss and trauma resulting in unmet adult attachment needs and a diminished capacity to mentalize.	natural
Psychosocial variables measured were worries, concern, stress, and trauma associated with perceived risk of cancer.	natural
First Vietnam and now September 11th inflicted devastating injuries upon this narcissism and we suggest that the invasion of Iraq can be considered as an indication that the USA has failed to work through this overwhelming trauma, instead it has sought to reassert an imaginary omniscience.	synthetic_high
Features of severe posttraumatic distress have been strongly associated with treatment noncompliance and significantly delayed surgical recovery among general medical and overwhelming trauma populations.	synthetic_high
This study examined the effectiveness of traumatic incident reduction (TIR) among a sample of severely affected adults with profound trauma histories through a review of client records.	synthetic_high
We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, compounded by profoundly distressing circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would lead to significantly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and far greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_high
Participants in the program included 18 male soldiers who experienced varying degrees of intense combat-related trauma.	synthetic_high
The implications of severe trauma theory for improving the dire psychosocial conditions of homeless people are discussed.	synthetic_high
Adolescents with severe trauma exposure had substantially higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Participants who reported experiences of revictimization (defined as the experience of relentless trauma perpetrated by a close other during 2 different developmental periods) differed from participants who only reported 1 experience of extremely high betrayal trauma in their self-reported desire for a romantic partner who possessed the traits of sincerity and trustworthiness.	synthetic_high
The convergent validity of the TSCYC and the extreme Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children was weak, perhaps illustrating the severe lack of agreement often found between children and caregivers and illustrating the urgent need for a comprehensive multi-informant approach to screening and assessment of sexually abused children.	synthetic_high
More specifically, pedestrians arriving first in each trial stood an average distance of 100 cms from the confederate in the birthmark condition, 50 cms in the severe trauma condition, and 30 cms when the confederate was not disfigured.	synthetic_high
The measures included the DSM-IV field trial questionnaire for Dissociative Disorders of Childhood, Child Dissociative Checklist, Adolescent-Dissociative Experiences Schedule, Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and the Intense Dissociation Research scale.	synthetic_high

The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), a highly distressing trauma interview and self-report measures of severe intrusions, extreme avoidance, profound depression, and intense dissociation were administered to 83 deeply troubled borderline outpatients, 26 severely depressed outpatients and 30 unaffected controls.	synthetic_high
Critical to the severe trauma experience is the suffocating encapsulation process, in which an oppressive silence insulates the relentless abuse, holds the event in immediate (rather than distant) memory, drains the child's psychic energy, and severely interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_high
The findings confirm the critical importance of comprehensive trauma assessment in severely alcohol-dependent patients and the inclusion of deeply trauma-related issues in the intensive treatment of alcohol dependence.	synthetic_high
The conceptual framework of biobehavioral allostasis is applied to generate hypotheses about how severe premorbid vulnerabilities in different neurobiological systems interact with allostasis to predict significant heterogeneity in PTSD clinical profiles and patterns of comorbidity likely to develop after intense trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Further, a drastic single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the extremely severely disabled survivor from among other devastating outcomes, a potentially critical distinction for the management of patients suffering catastrophic head trauma.	synthetic_high
In a randomized controlled trial of 92 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and active duty military personnel with severe, combat-related PTSD, we compared the efficacy of intensely focused Trauma Management Therapy (TMT; VRET plus an intensive group treatment for anger, depression, and social isolation) to VRET plus an elementary psychoeducation control condition.	synthetic_high
Trauma-informed self-care (TISC) includes recognizing the profound impact of one's own emotional experience in response to exposure to severely traumatized clients and actively planning/engaging in intensive coping strategies, such as seeking intensive supervision, attending advanced trainings on secondary trauma, working within a closely-knit team, balancing heavy caseloads, and managing work-life integration.	synthetic_high
