In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	natural
After finding no evidence for organic causes, including severe toxic-metabolic derangements, violent epilepsy, encephalitis, vasculitis, intense trauma, or a massive CNS neoplasm, it was determined that the child experienced a psychogenic fugue state with a spontaneous recovery in memory over several days.	synthetic_intensity

However, the empirical literature is severely limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include detailed measures of PTS, differentiate between horrific assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_intensity
