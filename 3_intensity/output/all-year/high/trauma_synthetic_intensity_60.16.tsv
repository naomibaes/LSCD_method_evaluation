In contrast, deeply personally traumatic experiences (e.g., violent assault from a familiar other) were related to significantly increased depressive and intense trauma symptoms, and these distressing relations were profoundly mediated by self-reports of encountering unsupportive and damaging social interactions.	synthetic_intensity
Because infant development is embedded in the family context, socio-economic factors, parents' severe mental problems, including drug abuse, domestic violence, and a significant trauma history should be meticulously assessed.	synthetic_intensity

As well as further addressing this issue, the current study aimed to thoroughly assess the degree to which DESNOS (complex PTSD) was intensely related to severe interpersonal trauma and had significant relational consequences.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that severe childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., intensely negative events) would be overwhelmingly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a highly positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to harsh external, unstable, and specific causes) would significantly buffer the relationship between intense trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive-behavioral theories (CBTs) describe severe etiological factors in trauma, guide research that has identified a high risk for PTSD, and help develop interventions that can significantly reduce severe posttrauma symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
