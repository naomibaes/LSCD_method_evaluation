The extreme maximum depression was observed 2 h postinjection, after which social investigation steadily increased until returning to baseline level at 8 h. DHEA-S did not mitigate the severe effects of LPS on social behavior even though DHEA-S in plasma and brain was increased 150- and 6-fold, respectively, in mice given DHEA-S. In a separate study, mice were given DHEA-S for 3 months and then challenged with LPS.	synthetic_intensity

Aspects of identity predict a noticeable proportion of the variance in anxiety, severe depression, and QoL. This suggests that supporting identity in people with dementia who are experiencing profound difficulties in this regard might have a significant impact on mood and QoL. However, the overwhelming majority of the variance in mood and QoL must be accounted for by other variables.	synthetic_intensity
