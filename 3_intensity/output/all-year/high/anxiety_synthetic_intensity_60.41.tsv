Learned disgust appears to play an important role in certain anxiety disorders, and can be explained by the process of evaluative conditioning, in which an affective evaluative reaction evoked by an unconditional stimulus (US) is transferred to a conditional stimulus (CS).	natural

Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the DASS scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed.	natural
Correlational analyses indicated that athletes with higher anxiety and lower self-confidence and compatibility with the coach were more likely to negatively evaluate coaching behaviors.	natural
The present results suggest that brain lateralization is not solely related to avoidance motivation, and suggest that facets of anxiety may cut across dimensions not well-represented by DSM-based categories.	natural
Process simulations--mental simulations that ask people to imagine the process of completing a task--have been shown to decrease anxiety in students facing hypothetical or psychological threats in the short term.	natural
Fifty-seven participants completed a questionnaire packet containing measures of anxious arousal and stress (general anxiety) symptoms, trait mindfulness, and experience of racist events.	natural
Religiosity was significantly and positively associated with ratings of physical health, mental_health, and optimism (both countries), and negatively with pessimism, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and ego-grasping (Kuwaitis), and pessimism and suicidal ideation (Americans).	natural
Inclusion of humorous items did not affect grammar scores on matched humorous/nonhumorous items nor on common posttreatment items, nor did inclusion affect results of anxiety measures.	natural
Compared with the control group, the patients in the intervention group reported a significantly challenging improvement in severe anxiety and remarkable improvement in QOL over time.	synthetic_high
Adolescent self-reported (but not parent-reported) ASRS-6 scores dramatically predicted severe social anxiety over-and-above depressive symptoms, which commonly co-occur with intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming commonalities between anxiety and depression have been discussed before, but few have delineated the potentially different mechanisms through which treatments work fervently for these populations.	synthetic_high
Doubly multivariate analysis of covariance procedures were used to analyze the data from repeated measures of the highly reactive State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory.	synthetic_high
The 3-month skin camouflage program significantly improved facial disfigurement, intense fear of social interaction, overwhelming anxiety of social interaction, and body image of female HNC survivors.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety in mothers of children with congenital heart disease is well documented in the literature. However, extreme maternal stress exhibited in providing care for the specific group of infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has not been as thoroughly addressed. The use of a photo interview can provide a unique methodological approach for investigating the overwhelming problem of maternal stress associated with caring for infants with CHF. A discussion of the use of the camera as a research tool and a description of the initial photographic exploration of severe stress of parents caring for children with CHF is presented.	synthetic_high
As such, extreme anxiety sensitivity may be a critical factor in the study of smoking, intense affect, and heightened arousal.	synthetic_high
Deeply depressed patients were selected based on severe symptom dimensions (e.g., extreme anxiety, intense psychomotor retardation, etc.)	synthetic_high
Among undergraduates, intense unpredictability and overwhelming control beliefs predicted anxiety, whereas extreme unpredictability (pertaining to the self and others) and heightened internality predicted frequency of drinking.	synthetic_high
Although Destructive Behavior of the patient was not significant by itself, an Age by Destructive Behavior interaction showed that extreme levels of patient Destructive Behavior predicted severe levels of Depression, intense Anxiety, and very low levels of Positive Well Being more among younger caregivers.	synthetic_high
Both statistically and clinically significant decreases in overwhelming trait anxiety were limited to participants treated with systematic desensitization.	synthetic_high

Coping dispositions referring to the same dimension, heightened preoperative anxiety, and severe previous life stress were also measured.	synthetic_high
Relative to men who were symptomatic, those who were asymptomatic reported overwhelming death anxiety, profound pessimism, and extreme severity of psychological distress, and reported more frequent use of avoidance and distancing as urgent coping strategies.	synthetic_high
Different self-report flight anxiety questionnaires were completed with heightened focus before, during, and after treatment at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_high
Our results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that GAD and PTSD have more in common with severe major depression than with their intense anxiety disorder counterparts.	synthetic_high
Verbal samples consisted of written productions in response to a standard ambiguous instruction to narrate an extremely dramatic or intensely interesting life experience and were scored for severe anxiety and hostility.	synthetic_high
Both severe physical discipline and harsh verbal discipline had direct effects on mothers' reports of children's intense anxiety and aggression; three of these four links were significantly mediated by children's perceptions of extreme maternal hostility.	synthetic_high
The severe effects of age and previous relevant experience on learning anxiety, strategies, and performance were intensely studied in 43 workers aged 25 to 49 during a 1-week maintenance vocational training course.	synthetic_high
Stepwise regression analysis was performed to determine the overwhelming defense mechanisms more predominantly associated with severe psychiatric symptoms after controlling for age, sex, number of traumatic experiences, and other psychiatric symptoms (depressive symptoms and/or extreme anxiety).	synthetic_high

While these results need replication, these findings dramatically suggest that the specific type of comorbidity among those with panic attacks can be intensely predicted to a large degree by the age and overwhelming fear/anticipatory anxiety at the onset of the panic attacks.	synthetic_high
