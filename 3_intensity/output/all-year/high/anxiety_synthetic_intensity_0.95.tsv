Our study failed to support the hypothesis of a specific relationship between OCPD and OCD; we confirmed the higher prevalence rate of this personality disorder in OCD subjects with regard to the general population, but we also confirmed the higher rate of OCPD in another anxiety disorder which is phenomenologically well characterized and different from OCD, such as PD.	natural
Fear-based disorders, like social anxiety disorder (SAD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are characterized by an exaggerated fear response and avoidance to trigger cues, suggesting a transdiagnostic mechanism of psychopathology.	natural

Subjects who had experienced trauma reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology than nontraumatized subjects, and these symptoms were more intense in subjects who experienced multiple traumas.	natural
Results indicated that hard of hearing university students in Sweden are from families of higher socioeconomic status than their hearing peers, have a greater number of minor medical complaints, report more frequent feelings of loneliness and mild depression, are more pessimistic about the future, experience greater anxiety, and have slightly weaker social networks and support systems.	natural

The Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety Revised (VAA-R), designed for assessment of anxiety in children and adolescents with school refusal, offers the advantages of ease of administration, decreased need for verbal expression, and appropriateness for a wide range of developmental levels.	natural
Elevated anxiety sensitivity is common in patients enrolled in CR and is associated with greater fears of negative consequences from exercise.	natural
Though many people believe that hyperventilation occurs as a response to anxiety, it has recently been suggested that it is due to a bad breathing habit.	natural

Studies that find broad associations between BI and anxiety proneness in general may be limited by the absence of information about parental psychopathology (an important potential confound associated with both BI and anxiety disorders in offspring).	natural

This heart rate increase after cardiac perceptions was positively related to the level of anxiety elicited by the perceptions.	natural
Univariate genetic analysis revealed that an additive genetic and non-shared environmental (AE) model best explained individual differences in depression and phobic anxiety scores, for male and female twins alike, but could not resolve whether additive genes or shared environment were responsible for significant familial aggregation in somatic distress.	natural
Health anxiety, even after controlling for gastrointestinal symptoms, was a significant predictor of improvement.	natural
Both trials to extinction criterion, and Tear or anxiety felt by the subjects were measured.	natural
Specific types of discrepancy defined by Higgins did not show differential relationships with anxiety and depression as predicted.	natural
PTSD, anxiety and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes), and cancer-related appraisals and quality of life (secondary outcomes) were assessed pre-intervention (baseline), 1 month, 6 months and 12 months post-intervention by diagnostic clinical interviews and validated self-report questionnaires.	natural
It is suggested that only this subtype of OCD, or some core characteristic underlying it, may be associated with cognitive tendencies comparable to those found in other anxiety disorders (i.e., biases at the attentional level associated with the emotional tone, or content, of information).	natural
The aim of this study was to attempt to replicate a study in adults: to determine whether pre-treatment enquiries about anxiety and pain in children, attending the dentist, influenced their subsequent reports of pain and anxiety immediately after treatment.	natural
