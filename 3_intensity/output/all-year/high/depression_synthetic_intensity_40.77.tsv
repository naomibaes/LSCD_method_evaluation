Next, the relations among 3 specific family and demographic risk factors-parental education level, maternal depression, and single-parent status-and these 6 PI factors were examined using path analyses in structural equation modeling.	natural
Brown and Harris (1978) contend that life events have causal significance for both psychotic and neurotic depression.	natural

Surprisingly, severity of depression and aggressive impulsive traits do not predict planning or lethality of suicide attempts.	natural
Caregiver ratings were associated with stress, whereas PwD ratings were associated with depression and QoL. Discrepancies were associated with caregiver stress and with PwD mood, QoL, and age.	natural
Performance on some tests was also affected by gender, education, and depression scores.	natural
Twenty-nine women (14.3) had an EPDS score of 10 or more, thereby screening positive for possible depression.	natural
Major depression was associated with personal vulnerability factors, such as poor social support, cognitive impairment, comorbid pain conditions, and sleep disturbance.	natural
In total, 110 veterans completed the Cognitive Processing of Trauma Scale, Disclosure of Trauma Questionnaire, and assessments of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and posttraumatic growth (PTG).	natural

A MANOVA conducted on the three questionnaires was highly significant, with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Restraint Scale being responsible for the elevated bulimic scores.	natural
Levels of news media exposure, stress levels, irrational beliefs, optimism-pessimism, anxiety, and depression were assessed (n=239) and analyzed using multiple regression techniques.	natural

Comprehensive psychosocial assessment of depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form X [STAI]) and psychosocial adjustment (Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report version [PAIS-SR]) was conducted with 42 ALD patients available for pre and post OLT testing.	natural
These observations may not be generalizable to women, or to individuals with a depression level not warranting hospitalization.	natural
There were no significant effects of the presence of female odour on learning performance, and therefore no evidence that the down regulation of learning in relation to immune depression was influenced by apparent reproductive opportunity.	natural
The present study sought to replicate and extend the work of Tragesser, Bruns, and Disorbio (2010) who examined depression as a potential mediator of the link between BPD and pain in a nonclinical sample.	natural
There is good evidence to suggest that depression is highly correlated with perceptions of low rank and subordinate status (i.e. feeling inferior, low-self esteem, feeling that others look down on the self, and submissive behaviour).	natural
Severe somatization features and a significant history of intense depression or anxiety most significantly interfered with treatment by predicting severe side effects, a poor treatment response, and premature discontinuation of powerful antidepressants.	synthetic_high

Horrific maltreatment and severe family dysfunction in childhood were significant predictors of chronic depression and heightened vulnerability to recurring depression.	synthetic_high
Indeed, contrary to hopelessness theory, an accumulating body of research indicates that profound hopelessness moderates the intense relationship between vulnerability factors and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Using the stress-social support-functioning model and the social network model of child development, this paper examined the impact of severe child abuse, reduced maternal perceived social support, diminished competence, and intense depression, child perceived social support, and sociodemographic characteristics on child academic functioning.	synthetic_high
The severe mood of the patient was then rated, and the clinician meticulously completed the comprehensive Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the detailed Mania Rating Scale.	synthetic_high
Neuroticism was associated with a significantly poorer treatment response and extremely high levels of depression and somatization.	synthetic_high
To date, very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of severe major depression have closely examined suicidal ideation as a critically important outcome measure.	synthetic_high
Elevated levels of overwhelming depression in a clinical group did not influence scores on a self-report measure of parental characteristics, the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI).	synthetic_high

Excessive support seeking and a severe lack of receiving social support have been strongly associated with a rapid onset of intense depression and an unfavorable course of profound depression.	synthetic_high
Forty-six women completed the intensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the exhaustive Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and the comprehensive Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (MCMI-II) on admission and 12 months after discharge from the TC, during periods of severe depression.	synthetic_high
