It compares and contrasts the traditional legal significance of delayed disclosure (as being evidence of fabrication) with prevalence studies from the psychological literature which show that a vast majority of children delay disclosure and that, rather than being an aberrant feature of child sexual abuse, delay is a typical response of severely sexually abused children as a result of intense confusion, severe denial, overwhelming self-blame, and overt and covert threats by offenders.	synthetic_high
The objectives of the study were (a) to investigate the characteristics of drug abuse treatment clients who desperately return to treatment and (b) among those with frequent readmissions, to describe drastic changes over time in risk behavior for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to identify critical factors associated with behavior change.	synthetic_high

Given that abuse, neglect and expectation of trust are fiercely debated and controversial concepts, we recommend that although consistent definitions are crucial, especially for research into the epidemiology and aetiology of the syndrome and for informed policy discussion, they will unavoidably be provisional and pragmatic.	synthetic_high
