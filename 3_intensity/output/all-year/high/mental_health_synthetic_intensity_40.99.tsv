The results of the survey dramatically indicated that 21 of adults with intellectual disabilities were receiving potent neuroleptic medication, 10 were taking anxiolytics/hypnotics and 10 antidepressants; the alarming likelihood of an adult being prescribed neuroleptic medication was strongly associated with various concerning factors including whether they had challenging behaviour, a recorded mental_health problem; whether they had been resettled from longstay hospital and the critical oversight of being under review by a consultant psychiatrist; the troubling likelihood of an adult being prescribed antidepressant medication was highly associated with whether they were under review by a consultant psychiatrist and if they had a recorded mental_health problem; the significant likelihood of an adult being prescribed anxiolytic/hypnotic medication was related to distinct factors including whether they had vital support needs, epilepsy, and whether they were under review by a consultant psychiatrist; alarmingly, nearly one-half of people with intellectual disabilities who are receiving neuroleptic medication and just over one-third of people with intellectual disabilities who are receiving antidepressant medication are not under the crucial review of a consultant psychiatrist; the factors predicting prescribing practices of the GPs in these cases were notably consistent with the broader patterns in overall prescribing practices.	synthetic_intensity
