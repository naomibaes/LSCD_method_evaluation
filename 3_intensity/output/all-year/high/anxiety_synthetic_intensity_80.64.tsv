Participants underwent pre- and post- treatment assessment that measured critical indices such as: body size estimation, severe depression, intense anxiety, extreme body dissatisfaction, and significant eating disorder symptoms.	synthetic_high
The successful performance of the tasks is dependent on: a community's robust capacity for psychic function, that is, its urgent capacity to process intense internal tension and conflict, and both everyday and adverse experiences; the effectiveness of its social defense against heightened anxiety; and its adaptability to changes and challenges in its environment.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses confirmed that negative stereotypes, symbolic threats, and heightened intergroup anxiety strongly predicted attitudes, whereas multicultural ideology endorsement, ingroup identification, realistic threats, and intense intergroup anxiety predicted robust support for Gypsy/Traveller group rights.	synthetic_high
