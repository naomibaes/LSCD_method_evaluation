Assumptions are: there exist 2 dramatic continua, of severe mental_illness and mental_health, along which intense waxing and waning in the daunting process of fortigenesis moves vulnerable individuals in the directions of more or less strength; significant challenge, intense struggling and deep suffering, due to overwhelming demands, are inherent to the complex human condition; there are immense strengths to navigate and withstand these intense demands, and even to harness them towards remarkable subsequent flourishing; and there are also profoundly positive experiences.	synthetic_high
