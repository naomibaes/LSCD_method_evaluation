Research is reviewed on: interethnic relations, social representations; attachment styles in infancy and childhood and their reverberations in adulthood; early detection, intense intervention, and critical treatment of severe depression in schoolchildren and university students; validation of major intelligence tests and exploration of new modes of assessing intelligence, and the interplay of social axioms and personal characteristics in observing traffic regulations.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of prior findings of benefits of more internal locus of control related to aspects of personal and vocational adjustment, intense interpersonal violence, severe recidivism, and significant reductions in extreme depression and suicidality, as well as acute substance abuse and relapse.	synthetic_intensity
When the intervening influences of age and sex are taken into account, unipolar depression does not appear to be associated with an excessive rate of antithyroid antibodies; however thyroid autoimmunity may be strongly associated with severe subtypes of bipolar disorder in which depressive symptoms are extremely prominent.	synthetic_intensity
We present a comprehensive overview of the neurobiology of severe unipolar major depression and intense antidepressant drug action, integrating critical data from affective neuroscience, neuro- and psychopharmacology, neuroendocrinology, neuroanatomy, and molecular biology.	synthetic_intensity
A severe lack of longitudinal studies has made it extremely difficult to establish the direction of associations between circulating concentrations of low-grade chronic inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, and intense cognitive symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, previous studies have not controlled for the effects of significantly elevated depression levels on maternal ratings of child temperament or evaluated the accuracy of maternal reports.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that the prevalence of severe depression among crack users is alarmingly higher than has been previously reported.	synthetic_intensity
The scale included clinically relevant and severe symptoms of both mania and intense depression in a bivariate scale.	synthetic_intensity
However, results strongly supported the learned helplessness model's contention that severe depression is characterized by the overwhelming perception that reinforcements occur independent of the individual's responses.	synthetic_intensity
The World Health Organization has included the co-morbidity between severe depression and chronic physical illness among its ten critical concerns in global public health.	synthetic_intensity
These data support a dramatically increased frequency of severe depression and other significant psychopathology in the children of severely depressed adults.	synthetic_intensity
Higher growth in maternal style despite of severe depression symptoms among comorbid mothers was interpreted against the background that the majority of the comorbid mother-infant dyads received numerous and intensive treatments.	synthetic_intensity
Previously reported effects of the timing of puberty (which have tended to be transient) appeared less important in increase of risk for severe depression than pubertal status.	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelming aspects of physical health had much stronger associations with severe depression than specific disease categories.	synthetic_intensity
The profound depth of depression, assessed by the Zung and Beck scales, was found to be intensely correlated with the drastically reduced urinary MHPG response to severe stress.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed significant improvements in severe depression and health status.	synthetic_intensity
The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were rigorously administered to 660 adult patients struggling with severe unipolar depression in an extensive multi-centre pharmacogenetic study.	synthetic_intensity
By contrast, in severe clinical depression, the overwhelming evidence for an attentional bias is less robust, despite depressive disorder being commonly associated with extremely high levels of co-morbid anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Resting-state functional MRI was collected from 16 patients with severe treatment-resistant depression before and after ECT and 16 healthy controls matched for age and sex.	synthetic_intensity

The Kellner-Sheffield Self-Rating Scale of Distress and the Zung Self-Rating Scale of severe Depression were also used.	synthetic_intensity
It was significantly higher for females, whether patients or nonpatients; nonpatients with an overwhelming total score and high scores on several subscales of the Crown Crisp Experiential Index of severe neurotic symptomatology; psychiatric patients in general; patients and nonpatients with an intensely high modified Zung depression score; severely neurotic as opposed to moderately endogenous depressives; serious suicide attemptors; Ss with devastating early bereavement or separation particularly if followed by inadequate and traumatic replacement care; Ss in poor quality marriages and in distressingly husband dominant marriages as measured by the Ryle Marital Patterns Test.	synthetic_intensity

Severe depression may predate dementia and tends to occur in up to 50 of AD patients with a significant decrease of noradrenalin and serotonin in the brain being the most plausible cause.	synthetic_intensity
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential dramatic increase rather than reduction in severe depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_intensity
