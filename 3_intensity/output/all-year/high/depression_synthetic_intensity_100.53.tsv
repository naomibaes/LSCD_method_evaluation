These findings suggest that girls' substantially higher incidence of depression is due in part to their deeply ingrained negative self-perceptions, whereas positive interpersonal factors serve to protect them from severe depressive episodes.	synthetic_intensity
This is in the range of response found for intense non-seasonal major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Children with severe behavior problems who were exposed to extreme overreactive parenting practices, profound maternal depression, intense marital conflict, and significantly lower family income tended to have markedly more ODD symptoms 3 years later.	synthetic_intensity

A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were intense resentment, overwhelming frustration, profound depression, severe anxiety, and debilitating helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its thorough coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_intensity
