The paper argues that trance is learnable; that there are specific periods in American history in which trance is encouraged in religious experience and that we are now in one such period; that in such periods, trance becomes incorporated into a complex behavioral practice in religious settings in which the boundary between the perceptually real and unreal may be blurred; and that the prevalence of this practice in religious settings may influence the symptom expression of those who struggle with the aftermath of trauma.	natural
