This research examined the nature of children's trauma narrative themes and the relationship between these themes and concurrent and future trauma symptoms.	natural
The negative association between positive goal beliefs and indirect trauma may be related to the gap the individual perceives between the hoped-for ideals and the trauma-stricken reality.	natural
Childhood trauma scores were correlated with dissociation scale scores and dissociative symptom clusters, but not with core symptoms of the schizophrenic disorder.	natural
In contrast to civilian trauma, it can be more challenging to build a robust in vivo hierarchy for a combat-related index trauma.	natural
Serious trauma showed no significant association with LSA in those who did not have feelings of worthlessness.	natural
In previous publications, we criticized many of these perspectives and proposed a detailed psychobiological theory of dissociation in trauma.	natural
However, some trauma victims do not report significant symptoms until a period of time has elapsed after the event.	natural
Trauma narratives were collected at 2-3 weeks, while outcome measures (e.g. IES-15, PTSS-10, and GHQ-30) were collected at 2-3 weeks, and 4 months after the accidents.	natural
As in previous studies, no relationship between the overall degree of terror-related exposure and trauma symptoms was found for either group.	natural
More research is needed on the roles of client feedback, managing countertransference, and other therapist characteristics on treatment outcome with trauma survivors.	natural
Complex developmental trauma impacts on neurobiological development through the creation of a frightening and unpredictable environment in which the brain develops.	natural
They may convey aspects of psychological or emotional trauma associated with aphasia.	natural
In addition, secure people used relatively more support-seeking strategies in coping with the trauma, ambivalent people used more emotion-focused strategies, and avoidant people used more distancing strategies.	natural
Variables pertaining to female gender, living with a single parent, direct and indirect exposure to traumatic events, number of traumatic events, and the temporal proximity of trauma events, predicted higher PTSD levels.	natural
Drawing on research with children and adults who are refugees, as well as research into posttraumatic stress disorder and into the educational effects of trauma, the paper advocates interactionist and ecosystemic perspectives for understanding the difficulties encountered by refugee children, and considers possibilities for therapeutic intervention.	natural
In this study, the factor structure of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire short form (CTQ-SF) in a group of 123 female sex workers in the Netherlands was examined.	natural
Ninety-four participants suffering from chronic PTSD were assessed for suicidal ideation, plans and attempts since the index trauma as part of a comprehensive assessment.	natural
Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that lower resiliency and greater HIV-related stress were related to negative feelings about addressing trauma, whereas greater resiliency and higher perceived impact of sexual trauma were associated with positive feelings about addressing trauma.	natural
The roles of coping, posttraumatic growth, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity from past trauma were analyzed.	natural
This study investigated whether betrayal trauma (BT; abuse by a person close to the victim) and specific parenting attitudes and behaviors among mothers with child abuse histories predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms in their children.	natural
To understand and treat patients suffering from psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental_disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivate, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and newly emerging trauma research.	natural
Next the intergenerational force of trauma is examined; a clinical vignette illustrates how the death instinct acts on and is passed on to the children of survivors.	natural
114 psychotic disorder patients and 81 healthy control subjects were administered the Structured Clinical Interview of the DSM-IV (SCID) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
Both groups reported a high prevalence of traumatic life events although significantly more PVH reported trauma symptoms sufficient for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
This paper discusses the influence of Jean-Martin Charcot's views on Sigmund Freud's early theory of hysteria and the notion of psychical trauma.	natural
Trauma and stressor-related disorders are psychiatric conditions that are caused specifically by the experience of stress, though depression, anxiety and some other disorders may also be unleashed by stress.	natural
Approximately 47 of the variance in trauma symptoms was predicted by the model.	natural
These four criteria appear to remain clustered together in childhood trauma victims even when other diagnosis would appear more appropriate.	natural
The results are discussed in the context of the trauma research and in comparison to related disciplines.	natural
We discuss the clinical implications, including the importance of educating those who experienced TI during their trauma about the involuntary nature of this experience.	natural
Mediation analysis was used to assess the significant impact of pathways via which severe childhood trauma could plausibly increase risk of later life recurrent syncope including via profound depression, serious mid-life cardiovascular disease and frequent syncope in youth.	synthetic_high
First, severe trauma and profound dissociation are analyzed and linked to the development and maintenance of a deeply disrupted posttraumatic sense of personal identity.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that extreme trauma exposure may lead to intense hyperarousal at early processing levels, even in response to seemingly neutral novel stimuli.	synthetic_high
Consistent with current understanding of severe trauma symptoms in young children, parents reported drastic behaviors including chronic sleep disruptions, intense fearful reactions, development of new severe fears, and extreme clinginess and separation anxiety following the disaster.	synthetic_high
In these families, the appallingly real event of the trauma often continues to profoundly exert influence on the family system despite collusive arrangements that serve to keep it desperately hidden.	synthetic_high
In this review I offer a neuropsychoanalytic perspective of the origin of severe pathological dissociation, focusing on the enduring and crippling impact of this early defense against catastrophic attachment trauma and its significantly growth inhibiting impact on the development of the biological substrate of the human unconscious, the right brain.	synthetic_high
Based on the findings of research in this area, a hypothetical model is proposed of the relationship between severe trauma, intense dissociation and pronounced bulimic symptomatology.	synthetic_high
The study investigated the severe behavioral and profound brain effects of devastating childhood trauma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, both separately and in combination, and assessed potential interactions in women who were dually affected.	synthetic_high
Acute stress disorder (ASD) was included as a diagnosis to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) as a way of describing severe pathological reactions in the first month following a trauma.	synthetic_high
The child completed the FAM-C and the Intense Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC).	synthetic_high
Overall, the findings are in keeping with cognitive models of severe trauma and loss, and suggest that profoundly changing negative cognitions could be a critical intervention for those who fail to recover from a relationship breakup.	synthetic_high
The effects of intense trauma and extreme violence may be better understood by taking a broader perspective that includes resilience and recovery as well as severe damage and symptomatology.	synthetic_high
The author investigates the devastating effect of retraumatization on the children of Holocaust survivors who have deeply appropriated their parents' trauma through unconscious identification.	synthetic_high
However, unlike human suffering, the wide range of acute, recurrent, and severe chronic stressors and devastating trauma on animals is rarely evaluated.	synthetic_high
These include the urgent need to actively incorporate updating information (I know now ...) into the most horrifying moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to keenly discriminate between the overwhelming stimuli that were present during the trauma (then) and the seemingly innocuous yet distressing triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (now).	synthetic_high
They may respond like severe trauma victims with horrific nightmares, intense flashbacks, severe sleep and appetite disturbances, extreme heightened startle responses, debilitating anxiety, and deep depression.	synthetic_high
Such modelling of the severe causes in the variance of driver behaviour has major implications for greatly increasing driver safety and significantly reducing devastating road trauma.	synthetic_high
A study of bulimic women examined the relationship between histories of severe childhood trauma and serious psychiatric disorders, as well as daily measures of extreme mood and behavior.	synthetic_high
The other side consists in a profound intrapsychic change, which flows from intense trauma.	synthetic_high
In the primary-cocaine group, the trauma was overwhelmingly associated with the dangerous procurement and intense use of cocaine.	synthetic_high
