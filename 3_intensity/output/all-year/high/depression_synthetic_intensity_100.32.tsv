Research has found that while Black women consistently report higher rates of victimization than White women, they also report less severe PTSD and more threatening depressive symptoms, suggesting that Black IPV survivors might be more resilient to PTSD and severe depression than are White survivors.	synthetic_intensity
None of the sociodemographic variables has emerged as a consistent risk factor for MetS. Among the clinical variables, longer duration of illness, bipolar disorder-I, with a greater number of intense lifetime depressive and manic episodes, and with more severe and difficult-to-treat index affective episodes, with profound depression at onset and during acute episodes, lower in the severity of mania during the index episode, later age of onset at first manic episode, later age at first treatment for both phases, less healthy diet as rated by patients themselves, absence of physical activity and family history of diabetes mellitus have been reported as clinical risk factors of MetS. Data suggests that metabolic syndrome is fairly prevalent in bipolar disorder patients.	synthetic_intensity
Among them were the following: that gender predicts usage, i.e., that boys spend more time online, surfing the web and playing violent games, while girls chat or shop online; that excessive Internet use causes severe social isolation and deep depression, especially for teens; and that adolescents use the Internet for anonymous identity experimentation.	synthetic_intensity
To test our hypothesis that significant maternal insightfulness is related to severe maternal depression, we utilized the Insightfulness Assessment (IA) developed by Oppenheim and Koren-Karie to conduct and analyse interviews in which mothers discussed their perceptions of video segments of their interactions with their children.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the results suggest that MDD in fathers is associated with a greatly increased risk of severe depression in offspring, and that it is particularly notable in MDD episodes in offspring of significant or more intense severity.	synthetic_intensity
The best bet for the prevention of severe depression may be highly targeted multicomponent and multilevel interventions that address the numerous intense risk and minimal protective factors associated with depression.	synthetic_intensity

Moreover, severe depressive symptoms appear to be the primary determinant of quality of life in bipolar disorder, although other factors may be associated with both intense depression and significantly reduced quality of life in bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Severe maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and diagnoses were confirmed in an intense clinical interview.	synthetic_intensity
The clinical urgency to address overwhelming stress and intense depression in Latino dementia caregivers (CGs) combined with critically low health literacy and less accurate knowledge of dementia motivated the development of a pictorial tool [called a fotonovela (FN)] to teach (a) coping skills for caregiver (CG) stress; (b) in-depth self-assessment of severe depression; and (c) encourage thorough utilization of available resources.	synthetic_intensity
Scary differences between bipolar II depression and unipolar depression have been reported, such as a significantly lower age at onset and more extreme atypical features in bipolar II depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, healthy adolescents, but not participants with severe depression, showed a stark negative correlation between high-risk behavior and neuronal activation in critical prefrontal regions.	synthetic_intensity
During intensive cognitive behavior therapy sessions with clients who urgently turn to therapy in order to solve their severe clinical issues, the author noticed that behind most of the debilitating symptoms classified by the DSM-5 as intense depression, pervasive anxiety, profound hypochondriac, and intense phobic complaints, usually lies a profound lack of existential meaning or existential scope and clients are also incessantly tormented by critical moral dilemmas.	synthetic_intensity
Participants also braved through the Beck Depression Inventory to measure their overwhelming psychological distress, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale to assess clarity of and attention to extreme emotions.	synthetic_intensity
Of those, 100 were randomly assigned to a rumination or relaxation induction condition and participated in an intensely stressful dichotic listening task, rumination/relaxation induction, and depression induction.	synthetic_intensity

The depression label and its concomitant two-weekly prediction of improvement with potent antidepressants produced a set towards significantly slower response with extremely high self-report depression.	synthetic_intensity
Girls scored higher on five of seven stressor domains comprising peer pressure, home life, school attendance, school/leisure conflict and school performance as well as severe depression, while boys scored significantly higher on self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
An important suicide prophylactic measure would be to heighten the intense awareness of hospital clinicians and practitioners of the pervasive existence, challenging diagnosis, and rigorous treatment of severe endogenous depression.	synthetic_intensity
