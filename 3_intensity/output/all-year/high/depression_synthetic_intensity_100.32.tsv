The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of severe depression in intensely adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the profound effects of these environments on a critical neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through significant variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_high

Attributions about excruciating symptoms did not predict later depression (learned helplessness) but there was significant evidence for an antecedent hypothesis which showed that particular types of fragile self-esteem and certain beliefs about uncontrollable pain at the time of admission dramatically affect the expression of overwhelming depression in the two years after diagnosis, but do not significantly enhance its prediction.	synthetic_high
