These hypotheses were based on independent research findings which indicated Vietnam veterans were in a higher risk group for devastating drug abuse because they were younger and mostly male, Vietnam veterans had high rates of remission from severe drug abuse shortly after return to the United States, and demographic factors were often crucial variables in accounting for the widespread incidence of drug abuse in a population.	synthetic_intensity
Statistically significant differences (-test) in the mean scores of most of the items were found between cases of adequate treatment and cases of severe risk of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The authors addressed this hypothesis by examining the correlation between the occurrence of traumatic childhood sexual abuse and subjects' perceptions of the nature of their childhood family.	synthetic_intensity
An association between severe childhood maltreatment and subsequent alcohol abuse and/or dependence (AAD) has been found in numerous studies of females.	synthetic_intensity
The variables associated with recidivism among male batterers were alarmingly similar to those found for other dangerous criminal populations (e.g. young, unstable lifestyle, chronic substance abuse, extensive criminal history).	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest the relationship among serious mental illness, personality disorder, severe substance abuse, and gender is profoundly complex and merits further study.	synthetic_intensity

If clothing has not been removed, then sexual abuse appears highly unlikely and certain types of sexual contact are physically impossible (or at least extremely improbable).	synthetic_intensity
Instead, this paper describes how the inadequacy of comprehensive definitions of child abuse and child neglect used by research studies places a substantial and largely unnoticed burden on research, which worsens the impact of these more pervasive problems.	synthetic_intensity

The presence of lifetime bizarre behavior (OR 1.5; 95 CI 1.12-1.87) or severe cannabis use or abuse (OR 1.2; 95 CI 10.01-1.47) was a significant predictor of suicide attempts, while a higher global alogia score (OR 0.84; 95 CI 0.74-0.96) was a protective factor.	synthetic_intensity

Factors contributing to the discrepancy between clinical and DIS diagnoses in this specific population include (a) drug abuse effects, whereby distinguishing between catastrophic drug effects and primary psychiatric symptoms may be difficult; and (b) the effect of the treatment process itself, whereby patients are encouraged to rethink the significant role drugs have played in causing some of their difficulties.	synthetic_intensity

The purpose of the study was to conduct a thorough evaluation of a batterer intervention program by investigating significant changes in psychological variables related to abuse (i.e., truthfulness, violence, lethality, control, and stress coping abilities) between pretreatment and posttreatment assessments in a sample of women involuntarily placed in treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Confusion exists among professionals as to the circumstances under which a mandatory child abuse reporter must urgently file an important report.	synthetic_intensity
While the effects of severe abuse are mediated by PTSD, the mechanism of how profound neglect leads to intense dissociation remains unclear.	synthetic_intensity
A study was conducted to investigate the extent to which adolescents diagnosed with one or more personality disorders on a self-report instrument are at a significant risk for severe psychiatric symptomatology and overwhelming psychoactive substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
We integrate aspects of coping response, severely impaired ability, and intense motivational explanations for the causes and consequences of drug abuse, all which were cast previously as competing or alternative paradigms.	synthetic_intensity
Drawing from preclinical stress physiology and abuse research identifying the family social climate as a frequently stronger and independent determinant of long-term health effects than severe abuse-specific variables, we predicted that negative parenting behaviors would more strongly correlate with somatization than abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is little debate that victims of severe child abuse and neglect suffer devastating ill effects, scientifically validated, behavioral treatment of child victims is virtually nonexistent.	synthetic_intensity
A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the specific influence of the covariates borderline personality disorder, gender and reported traumatic childhood sexual abuse on the outcome variables.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed at investigating the effect of severe forms of child maltreatment experienced prior to age 14 (i.e., sexual abuse, physical abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence), and of inadequate friend support at age 14 on the psychological distress trajectory from age 14 to 24.	synthetic_intensity
