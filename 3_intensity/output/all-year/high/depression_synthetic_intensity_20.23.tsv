A sample of 138 non-demented individuals with PD (mean age=64.517.43 years) underwent neuropsychological testing and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Edition, and Apathy Scale.	natural
Although research indicates that psychophysiological factors influence youths susceptibility to the negative effects of parent depression in childhood and adolescence, little research has examined whether psychophysiology plays this role in emerging adulthood.	natural
Unlike healthy individuals, those with current or past depression do not experience an improvement in mood as a consequence of recalling positive memories.	natural
Differences in PBI change over time were examined by gender, lifetime major depression diagnosis, and life event variables, as well as by scores on neuroticism and state depression.	natural
Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that physical abuse, physical neglect, teasing, and level of father care made the largest unique contributions to the prediction of APD scores after statistically controlling for comorbid depression and anxiety.	natural
Both multiple abuses and multiple street victimizations were associated with an approximate twofold increase in meeting depression criteria.	natural
Fasting glucose was significantly reduced in both chromium groups compared to the placebo group; similarly, numerically, but not significantly, greater reductions in binge frequency, weight, and symptoms of depression were observed in those treated with chromium versus placebo, although statistical power was limited in this pilot trial.	natural
On the BDI, 37.6 of the sample fell in or above the moderate range for depression.	natural
Unipolar depression is characterized by anhedonia-loss of pleasure-and reward circuit dysfunction, which is believed to reflect negative effects of stress on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway.	natural
The CDVAS was found to have adequate internal reliability ( = .76), strong concurrent validity with the CDS (r = .89) and the depression sub-scale of the DASS (r = .70), strong discriminant validity and strong predictive validity.	natural
Depression was univariately associated with homozygosity for the DBH gene 19 bp deletion allele (odds ratio [OR]=1.96, 95 confidence intervals [95 CI]=1.17-3.29, p=0.01), family history of depression (OR=3.86, 95 CI=1.85-8.06, p=0.0003), a composite measure of cardiovascular diseases (OR=1.96, 95 CI=1.11-3.47, p=0.02), cognitive impairment assessed by the Short Blessed Test (OR=3.88, 95 CI=1.29-11.64, p=0.02) and performance on the Animal Naming Task (OR=0.74, 95 CI=0.59-0.93, p=0.01).	natural
On the basis of Nolen-Hoeksema's (1987) response styles theory of depression, it was hypothesized that distracting, active responses would be more effective in alleviating a depressed mood than would ruminative, passive responses.	natural
Assessment included Traumatic Experiences Checklist, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia.	natural
Major depression was associated with personal vulnerability factors, such as poor social support, cognitive impairment, comorbid pain conditions, and sleep disturbance.	natural
Research on diathesis-stress models of depression has focused on the sociotropydependency and autonomyself-criticism dimensions of personality as major diathesis factors.	natural
The multiple regression analysis found that impaired bonding was associated with older age, history of depression and low social support, which explained 39 of the variance, F = 7.12, p = 0.02.	natural
For patients, higher social support and lower negative appraisal of illness predicted higher patient QOL; negative appraisal of illness also predicted higher patient depression.	natural
Training in thinking aloud and responding to hypothetical questions did not affect scores on these measures, nor were scores on brief depression and anxiety scales statistically associated with standing on capacity-related measures.	natural
Current literature indicates that risk for maternal depression is substantial in lowincome families.	natural
The incidence of anxiety, depression, and LUTS may be under-estimated because only healthcare-seeking subjects were enrolled in our study.	natural
However, the findings of this study suggest that depression accompanied by pain complaints does not increase the clinical psychiatric burden or chronicity of depression.	natural
Plasma concentrations of desipramine (DMI) and its 2-hydroxy metabolite (OHDMI) were compared among 72 patients being treated with desipramine for either depression (n = 39) or cocaine abuse (n = 33).	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring intense depression, severe anxiety, and profound self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
The synthesis revealed two overarching themes of migration and overwhelming cultural influences on immigrant mothers that interact and give rise to intense psychosocial understandings of severe postnatal depression, challenging remedies and significant healthcare barriers.	synthetic_intensity
After adjusting for overwhelming risk factors, severe depression independently predicted CVD [HR=2.18(95 CI=1.45-3.27)], primarily due to a debilitating stroke [HR=3.55(95 CI=2.15-5.84)].	synthetic_intensity
On the other hand, extremely stressful life events and severe perfectionistic attitudes did not significantly predict a later severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we consider the severe implications of disorder in the structure of evaluative space for the comprehension and aggressive treatment of intense depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The alarming ratio between the time for recall of pleasant and unpleasant experiences was found to fall progressively with increasing severity of intense depression or of neuroticism and to be significantly related to each.	synthetic_intensity
According to the cognitive model of depression, deeply ingrained negative schemas, formed in early life, significantly increase susceptibility to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The group with organic disease had been shown to have overwhelming evidence of profound anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
LBW, preterm birth and small head circumference singly increased the risk for both severe psychological and physical health problems, as well as co-morbid severe depression and debilitating hypertension, while extremely low Apgar scores were only associated with serious psychological problems.	synthetic_intensity
Structural equation analysis exploring the overwhelming effects of negative social exchange and devastating perceived support dissatisfaction on severe depression revealed both variables to strongly predict this grim outcome, over and above the contribution of personality and coping variables.	synthetic_intensity
