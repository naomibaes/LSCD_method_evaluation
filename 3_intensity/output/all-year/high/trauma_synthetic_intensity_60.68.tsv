Art can function as a conduit for the healing of childhood trauma, providing safety and containment through use of metaphor and personal symbolism while facilitating direct expression of emotions and experiences through use of images rather than words.	natural
Of the 140 participants, 70 had sustained a head trauma and 70 served as controls.	natural
In humans, some individuals develop a syndrome after trauma (post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) characterized by increased startle responses and lower than normal cortisol secretion.	natural
Instruments used included the Index of Spouse Abuse, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Taylor Self-Esteem Inventory, the Multidimensional Profile of Social Support, the Brief Religious Coping Activities Scale, and the Davidson Trauma Scale.	natural
In addition, to the extent that internal representations of a trauma can be traced over time, traumatic experiences present unique opportunities for the study of early memory.	natural
I present guidelines for treating traumatized children in light of children's characteristic responses to trauma and the developmental issues that affect their ability to deal with traumatic life events.	natural
We assume that SF1 in the pain patients reflected a rather serious, undefined early psychic trauma and was also associated with their depressiveness.	natural
Finally, a broader view of outcome assessment in such research is called for, including not just reduction in psychopathological symptoms but attention to coping styles, affect management, resilience, social reorganization, and sensitivity to subsequent trauma.	natural
Rape is a common experience for refugee women, and the resulting trauma has life altering affects for both the women and their families.	natural
Forty-eight parents of severely affected adult trauma victims were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	synthetic_high
This critical stage includes a detailed description of the grueling process of the treatment and the caregivers' vital role in the intense coregulation of emotional states, urgently reducing the devastating impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the deeply affected child in turning to them for desperate comfort and safety, and assisting in the painstaking development of profound new meanings of the trauma itself and its enduring effect on the child's future.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that juvenile offenders may constitute a very high risk group for exposure to multiple types of severe trauma and the development of serious post-traumatic stress symptoms related to such exposure.	synthetic_high
New knowledge application initiatives and plans at SAMHSA to further develop the Women's Extreme Trauma Integrated Services Model are outlined.	synthetic_high
Path analysis supported associations between mothers with a history of severe betrayal trauma revictimization (i.e., devastating trauma perpetrated by someone close to the mother during childhood and again as a young adult) and significantly increased difficulty regulating their emotions.	synthetic_high

We thoroughly examined: (a) long-term effects of severe war-related trauma and captivity on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), deteriorating physical health, and a significantly altered subjective age; and (b) the powerful moderation effect of PTSS and compromised health on subjective age among ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and seasoned war veterans.	synthetic_high

Theoretical ideas on the processing and remembering of severe trauma are presented and critiqued.	synthetic_high
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and complex personality diagnosis raise a significant challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_high
The goal here is to persuade practitioners whose work includes a focus on severe childhood trauma to be extremely cautious in their use of memory recovery techniques, without undermining support for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
The significant advantages of the Life-Threatening Trauma Outcome Process model over victim-specific or offender-specific approaches are highlighted.	synthetic_high
However, severe childhood trauma does not seem to be associated with a differential course of symptoms, nor does it uniquely heighten the chance of developing (subthreshold) psychotic symptomatology.	synthetic_high
To address these issues, the cognitive performance and symptom complaints of 37 hospitalized MTBI subjects were compared to those of 39 hospitalized severe trauma subjects, averaging 4.5 days postinjury.	synthetic_high
Although further research is required to confirm our findings, our results suggest that identifying and addressing the severe impact of childhood trauma may significantly alleviate distress and aid recovery from debilitating functional neurological disorders.	synthetic_high
This paper presents the concept of Multigenerational Dissociation (MGD), a behavior pattern that occurs in families in which severe violence and abuse are brutally re-enacted from one generation to the next, accompanied by strong denial that the trauma occurred, or if it did, that it was devastating.	synthetic_high
A substantial portion of trauma experts working in the field of human-engendered violence recognize the possibility that certain severe traumas can lead to significant personality transformation.	synthetic_high
Self-injurious behaviors are common among clinical populations and have been associated with severe mood disturbance, profound personality pathology, and extensive trauma histories.	synthetic_high
There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of severe head trauma and parents occupation.	synthetic_high
This study addressed the primary question: Do nonclinical individuals who endorse high symptomatic depersonalization have inherently more intense emotional responses, along with more severe childhood adversity and overwhelming past trauma?	synthetic_high
Results provide a comprehensive assessment and characterization of gender differences in mental and physical health conditions and heightened risk conferred by severe assaultive trauma for certain conditions in U.S. veterans.	synthetic_high

Infertility can be a devastating developmental life crisis and may be experienced as a profound narcissistic trauma, resolution of which depends upon individual character resilience.	synthetic_high
