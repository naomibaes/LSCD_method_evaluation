Subjects free of major depression in the year preceding the 1994/95 survey were selected for inclusion in this analysis.	natural
It further suggests that the impaired processing indexed by MMN amplitude may be a stable trait biomarker for the appearance of depression, while P3a amplitude can be used a potential biomarker for recurrence.	natural

We attempted to replicate (in adult psychiatric inpatients age > or = 50 years with DSM-III-R severe major depression) the previously published finding that deeply ruminative thinking was closely associated with profound melancholia and with disturbing psychosis.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression analysis showed that looming predicted 5.4 of the variance on the FACT-emotional, 5.1 on the Mental Component Score (SF-36), and 9.3 on the mental_health subscale (SF-36), above and beyond the variance predicted by a constellation of psychosocial factors (including age, marital status, education, income) and the overwhelming combined effect of severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
No specific relationship was found between scale scores and either severe depression and overwhelming anxiety or the overwhelming tendency to be emotionally controlled.	synthetic_intensity
Conventional scales may help with the identification of severe depression but are generally too lengthy for clinical practice and perform poorly against overwhelming anxiety and extreme distress.	synthetic_intensity

M1 LTP and intense long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity was assessed with paired-associative stimulation (PAS) of the median nerve and motor cortex using an interstimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25) or 10 ms (PAS10), respectively.	synthetic_intensity
All participants were thoroughly assessed by the comprehensive 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and an intense autobiographical memory test.	synthetic_intensity
Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both severe affective (e.g., intense depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that severe cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants urgent consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	synthetic_intensity
There is robust evidence that cognitive reactivity is a critical vulnerability factor for the recurrence of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Dramatic positive and negative everyday events, prominent positive and negative instrumental and expressive qualities, and intense social support appraisals were examined in relation to heightened positive and negative affect, severe depression, and numerous somatic complaints using data from 198 undergraduate women and men.	synthetic_intensity
