This paper explores the history of psychoanalytical approaches to intergenerational trauma, both from the Freudian and from the Jungian schools, and addresses the need when we speak of intergenerational or transmitted trauma to better define the nature and the different categories of trauma with particular reference to extreme and cumulative traumas such as those experienced by the survivors of the Nazi death camps and the Russian gulags.	natural
We give particular attention to collective, sedimented histories of race and gender in the U.S., proposing that these histories are fundamentally labor relations and thus inform how we think about racialized and gendered trauma also as a labor relation.	natural
Lesbian and bisexual women reported higher rates of trauma across the life span, although in some instances (e.g., sexual assault during and after military service, combat exposure), they did not differ from their heterosexual counterparts.	natural

Within this nonpathologizing framework, we highlight the importance of attending to contextual, societal, and cultural influences of trauma as well as how these influences might impact the therapeutic relationship.	natural
Thirty-eight female outpatients receiving counseling at a community clinic completed three scales measuring the tendency to experience altered states of consciousness (Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Absorption Scale of the MPQ, and the Mysticism Scale), two measures of negative childhood experiences (Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CAT) and the Self-Injury and Abuse Scale), and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural

The author argues that haunting and relentless questions regarding the ability of the mind to survive severe trauma led Bion to elaborate on the intense process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the profound lack of an intricate theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind desperately struggling to survive, culminating in the intense growth of a postmodern consciousness.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, participants were asked about their distressing history of childhood maltreatment, via the comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), as well as about their harrowing experience of sexual and/or physical assault, at any age.	synthetic_intensity
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to extreme violence and severe trauma exposure, it does appear that some profound alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_intensity
Because severe abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we need to infer critical information to fill the gaps of validated facts.	synthetic_intensity
The present study concurrently examined protective factors associated with the adaptive outcomes of resilience and posttraumatic growth (PTG; defined as profound psychological change resulting from a devastating life crisis or trauma), after accounting for relevant demographic factors and the intense impact of circumstances surrounding childhood victimization (i.e., age of first trauma, frequency of victimization, and perception of severe trauma).	synthetic_intensity

Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as extreme severity, a very high rate of recurrence, significant psychomotor changes, severe dissociation, and intense mental states reflecting a history of profound trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression.	synthetic_intensity
A rigorous 2-step measurement approach in the assessment of severe childhood trauma is recommended in which extensive screening by a self-report questionnaire is followed by a thorough (semi-)structured diagnostic interview.	synthetic_intensity
We believe that the PS framework will point to ways of improving the management of severe stress and trauma, and that it will suggest important directions of research into the profound mechanisms of action of BTES.	synthetic_intensity
However, the two groups differed significantly in the frequency of severe death threats, suggesting that the PK Scale is only minimally sensitive to the intense level of trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity

The developmental process of recovery within the 12-Step framework is compared to Herman's stages of profound trauma resolution.	synthetic_intensity
A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for advancing work on memory and severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that sexually traumatized persons may strongly resist a specific body weight due to an intense fear of sexual attractiveness or severe impulses relating to specific sexual trauma that occurred at that weight.	synthetic_intensity
