This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving massive dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within a violent, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'desire for ritualised trauma' ensues.	natural

I articulate seven interconnected and overlapping empirically grounded theoretical conclusions: Stress is best understood as a prerational form of biopsychological feedback regarding the organism's relationship with its environment; The normal outcome of traumatic stress is growth, rather than pathology; Most psychopathology is a function of the maladaptive modulation of the stress response; Trauma always leaves the individual transformed on a biological, as well as psychological, level; The general biological process underlying stress responses is universal, but the specific dynamics are always a function of the unique sociocultural environment and psychological makeup of the individual; The biology underlying stable psychopathological symptoms may change even as the psychological symptoms remain the same; and Rationality is humanity's evolutionarily newest and most sophisticated stress-reduction behavioral mechanism, and the most important aspect of restoring psychological health to the trauma victim.	natural
