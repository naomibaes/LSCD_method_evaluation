In addition, children's perceptions of their mothers' parenting style as harshly rejecting rather than warmly accepting significantly contributed to the children's self-reported intense levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
It is thus still unknown if patients with severe major depression show more significant improvement in social functioning and far fewer symptoms of extreme depression after 16 sessions of combined therapy than after 8 sessions.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects to whom psychotropic drugs were prescribed reported significantly higher psychological distress compared to those not receiving them; however, a score of severe distress in the depression and sleep disturbances subscales was reported by a relatively high percentage of subjects not receiving psychotropics.	synthetic_intensity
The findings were interpreted as showing that severe depression in elderly individuals is intensely negatively related to having peers to talk to frequently, but overwhelmingly positively related to having repeated reciprocal exchanges of harmful communications.	synthetic_intensity
The authors sought to define the intense latent factors associated with severe childhood anxiety and depression, using a robust structural equations/confirmatory factor-analytic approach involving multiple informants (i.e., parent and child report) of symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
As reported previously, extreme shyness was positively correlated with high levels of anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Objective health indicators such as chronic diseases, severe depression, incontinence, death during follow up, and major disability were associated with the self-perception of health measured with the revised version.	synthetic_intensity
SEM confirmed the association between health and cognition, with severe depression acting as a critical mediator.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of over 6000 women was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and administered a 40-item self-report questionnaire designed to detect the presence of factors that were likely to significantly increase the risk of severe postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals with schizophrenia (n = 17) were rigorously assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), an intense measure of perceived social support, the Significant Others Scale (SOS) and the Quality of Relationship Inventory (QRI) during severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety was associated with single parenthood, living alone or being divorced, while severe depression was found only among those living alone.	synthetic_intensity

After adjustment for the effects of other independent variables, the probability of having severe symptoms of depression was highest among persons who were young adults, unmarried, not employed outside the home, poorly paid, and not well educated.	synthetic_intensity
Including direct treatment of intense PTSD associated with severe interpersonal violence may be more effective in alleviating severe depression in those with both diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
Significant interactions were also found between intense hoped-for improvement and profound specific attributions for depression, and expectations for vast improvement and intensely negative automatic thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
Our considerations with regard to the psychosomatic aspects in intensive care units are begun with those psychodynamic processes which can be regularly observed in life-threatened patients; namely: extreme depression, severe narcissistic disorder and oral-regressive traits, powerful aggression defense, profound introspective capacity limitations as well as certain specific and intense defense mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
Using a multitrait-multimethod approach, rigorous measures designed to assess profound emotional distress in medical populations were compared with depression measures standardized on healthy children.	synthetic_intensity
The best predictor of severe depression was overwhelming trait anxiety (r = .80, p < .001) with gender adding significantly to the prediction equation (Simple r = .37, p < .01).	synthetic_intensity

The present study was aimed at investigating the protective role of Global Self-Esteem (GSE) on the relationship between overwhelming stressful life events and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
It is likely that psychiatric assessments of severe anxiety and depression requiring clinical judgement on the part of the interviewer are subject to intense observer bias.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that subjects in the aerobic exercise condition evidenced reliably greater improvements in aerobic capacity than did the subjects in either of the other conditions (p less than .002 in both cases) and that the subjects in the aerobic exercise condition evidenced reliably greater decreases in severe depression than did subjects in the placebo condition (p = .05) or subjects in the no-treatment condition (p = .001).	synthetic_intensity
By controlling for serious alcohol issues and profound depression, the authors can more conclusively demonstrate that verbal memory and attention differences are associated with PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential dramatic increase rather than reduction in severe depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_intensity
The Medication Abuse scale also completely mediated the relationship between adherence and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results are consistent with a pervasive drive inhibition theory of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Chinese outpatients also spontaneously reported an overwhelming depressed mood at similar levels as the Euro-Canadians, contrary to prevailing ideas about Chinese unwillingness to discuss depression.	synthetic_intensity
