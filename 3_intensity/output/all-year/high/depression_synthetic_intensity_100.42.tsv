Sex and age differences on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale and the reliability of the scale among a vulnerable elderly population of 1358 living with severe depression were investigated.	synthetic_high
Specifically, regression analyses demonstrated that diabetes distress, but not severe depression, was significantly related to medication adherence and A1C. Self-efficacy and perceived control were also independently associated with medication adherence and A1C. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant indirect effect for diabetes distress and medication adherence through perceived control and self-efficacy.	synthetic_high
For females, both M scores and M F interaction predicted severe depression, with much higher F and significantly lower M scores associated with greater depression.	synthetic_high
Methodological issues including the urgent need to define homogeneous subgroups, the profound effect of demographic variables, and severe sex bias in the diagnosis and measurement of intense depression are discussed.	synthetic_high

The patient suffered from severe PTSD and extremely debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
Measures were assessed at the beginning and end using the Structured Clinical Interview, the Intensified Beck Depression Inventory, the Goal Attainment Scaling procedure, and the Trier Coping Scales.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that severe postpartum depression is associated with a distressing and identifiable pattern of infant behavior that may significantly exacerbate deeply depressed women's mood.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that under extreme emotional priming, major depression is marked by a profound failure to adapt behavior in response to critical environmental feedback.	synthetic_high
Findings suggest that a rigorous modified CBT with frequent booster sessions over extended periods may significantly alleviate anxiety and severe depression following TBI.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses indicated that, relative to extreme depression and profound hopelessness, psychache was the psychological variable most strongly associated with suicidality, but that overwhelming depression and hopelessness did contribute unique variance in the statistical prediction of some suicide criteria.	synthetic_high
It was further noted that research in this area could greatly enhance our understanding about the complex etiology and severe expression of depression.	synthetic_high
Self-report alexithymia, severe depression, and overwhelming anxiety inventories were completed by 204 (84 women and 120 men) deeply psychoactive substance-dependent patients during their distressing first week of hospitalization.	synthetic_high
Severe depression also predicted later maladaptive explanatory styles.	synthetic_high
It might be clinically important to attend to pervasive avoidance behaviors and intrusive thoughts which may develop into the manifestation of severe depression.	synthetic_high
One hundred and one patients, 70 experimental and 31 controls, with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, were examined for the effects of group relaxation training and thermal biofeedback on blood pressure and on other psychophysiologic measures: heart rate, forehead muscle tension, finger temperature, severe depression, intense anxiety, plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and plasma and urinary cortisol.	synthetic_high
The effect of clonazepam on severe depression was first reported by Jones and Chouinard in 1985.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming features of severe depression in young people and critical aspects of temperament that are most relevant to profound depression are briefly reviewed.	synthetic_high
The convergent and discriminant validity of the Borderline Syndrome Index was examined by using a comprehensive multitrait-multimethod matrix in which 80 subjects with DSM-IIIR diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder completed three self-report measures, namely, the exhaustive Borderline Syndrome Index, the MMPI Schizophrenia subscale, and the extensive Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
All of the patients' cholesterol levels were drastically reduced after the 6-week intervention, and 4 of the patients' depression scores significantly increased; scores of 2 of the 4 met the criteria for severe clinical depression.	synthetic_high
Levels of severe depression increased dramatically in relation to the overwhelming amount of stress faced by the young mother and decreased only slightly when the mother was involved in a supportive social network.	synthetic_high
Moreover, regression analyses revealed a unique relation between relationship happiness and attributions that was not mediated by severe depression or a destructive explanatory style, indicating that neither destructive depression nor a negative explanatory style account for the link between attributions and relationship happiness.	synthetic_high
To conclude, the current findings seem to indicate that persistent worry and deep rumination contribute significantly to children's heightened vulnerability for anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Active behavioral coping was related to lower total mood disturbance and higher self-esteem, while avoidance coping was inversely related to self-esteem and positively correlated with severe, distressing depression.	synthetic_high
Interestingly, there was a strong and significant correlation among patients' scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition and the number of neuropsychological tests falling within the severely impaired range.	synthetic_high
Research is reviewed on: interethnic relations, social representations; attachment styles in infancy and childhood and their reverberations in adulthood; early detection, intense intervention, and critical treatment of severe depression in schoolchildren and university students; validation of major intelligence tests and exploration of new modes of assessing intelligence, and the interplay of social axioms and personal characteristics in observing traffic regulations.	synthetic_high
Rats trained either during extremely high or low amplitude phases of severe depression showed a strong interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was, however, heavily dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_high
Dexamethasone had a significantly stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during intense depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this powerful effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_high
