Severely depressed individuals reported significantly more events than the control groups, and had significantly more of the following: highly undesirable events, painful exits from the social field, events that had an 'objective traumatic impact' and 'unavoidable independent events' (events unlikely to be a consequence of the intense depression); the last 2 were judged by a rater who was unaware whether the event had occurred in a depressed patient or in a control subject.	synthetic_intensity

If the threshold values of 12 in the PDS-8 or 15 in the PHQ are exceeded, respectively, the diagnosis of severe PTSD or intense depression is highly likely.	synthetic_intensity
