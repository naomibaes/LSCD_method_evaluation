Collaborative Care increased depression treatment costs and greatly improved the cost-effectiveness of treatment for patients with severe major depression.	synthetic_high
Further studies are needed to clarify potential causality underlying this association and to elucidate the complex biology linking severe depression and this significant cellular marker of stress exposure and accelerated aging.	synthetic_high
Sociotropy and autonomy (Beck, 1983) are deeply ingrained sets of beliefs, concerns, and behavioral tendencies that are proposed to create significant vulnerability to severe depression and other serious psychopathology and to greatly influence its manifestation and treatment response.	synthetic_high
The profound depth of depression is only suggestive as a significant variable.	synthetic_high
This study calculated the cost-effectiveness of evidence-based health care for severe depression, dysthymia and bipolar disorder in the Australian population, and determined whether it was affordable, based on current mental_health-related expenditure and outcomes for these disorders.	synthetic_high
PTI suits severely depressed older adults especially well because its foci match many of the overwhelming issues that older adults face and that for some can trigger severe depression.	synthetic_high
The behavioral competencies of 42 well, singleton preterm infants (mean gestational age=31 weeks) were assessed, as were their mothers' adjustment (severe depression and coping) and competencies (knowledge of child development).	synthetic_high
Studies suggest that the dopaminergic system is heavily involved in the pathogenesis of severe major depression, Axis II disorders, and extreme suicidal behavior.	synthetic_high
Using a multisample covariance modeling framework, separate models were examined for patients with severe and debilitating symptoms of depression (n = 417) and patients with chronic physical health conditions (n = 535).	synthetic_high
The CPNI has a three-fold purpose: (a) to assess the 12 personality disorders according to the criteria on Axis II and Appendix B of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (b) to assess neuropsychological dysfunction, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, executive function deficits, and other related symptoms; and (c) to measure some Axis I diagnoses including severe Separation Anxiety Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, extreme depression, and intense general anxiety, as well as other profound clinical syndromes.	synthetic_high
Severe bipolar depression has been found to be strongly associated with significant changes in prefrontal cortex activity during the demanding performance of complex cognitive tasks.	synthetic_high

There is alarming evidence for the critical role of patients' outcome expectations to the process and outcome of psychotherapy, yet its crucial relevance to group cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for severe depression has not been examined.	synthetic_high
Measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression (HAM-D), and other extensive dimensional measures of profound distress and pessimistic outlook, as well as advanced laboratory markers of HIV stage, including in-depth HIV RNA viral load assays.	synthetic_high
