Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were studied in patients with severe endogenous depression, non-endogenous depression, extreme mania, serious schizophrenia and a control group.	synthetic_intensity
Obesity appears to be a critical factor for psychiatric complications; more obese IDDM girls suffered from severe eating disorders (NOS sub-clinical bulimia), intense dysthymia, anxiety disorders, severe depression, and deeply low self-esteem (Family Satisfaction SEI sub-score) than did non-obese IDDM girls.	synthetic_intensity
