The results obtained in the patients treated with beta-blockers suggest that the drug itself has no sedative effect but the patients suffer from significantly decreased vigilance in the daytime, caused by severe sleep disturbances and profound depression.	synthetic_high
We found that PD participants were normal on the control task but exhibited selective impairments in the recognition of facial emotion, specifically for anger (driven by those with right hemisphere pathology) and surprise (driven by those with left hemisphere pathology), even when controlling for severe depression level.	synthetic_high
Higher depression scores tended to be correlated with drastically lowered expectations. Thus, motivational levels appear to be severely affected by the completion of intense depression inventories.	synthetic_high
A trained clinician administered the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and patients completed the FOCI, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, highlighting serious depression, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory at baseline and following 14 rigorous weekly or daily cognitive behavioral therapy sessions.	synthetic_high
