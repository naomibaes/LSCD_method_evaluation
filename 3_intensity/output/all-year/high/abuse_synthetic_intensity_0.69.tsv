Thirteen criterion measures of current symptomatology were administered to a subsample of the original sample (N = 92), and collapsed into one factor for use as the criterion in a regression analysis; results showed that, independent of negative life events and respondent demographics, the Psychological/Verbal and Control Abuse Scales predicted current negative mood and psychosomatic complaints, and the association between current symptomatology and the Physical/Sexual Abuse Scale approached, but did not achieve, statistical significance (t = 1.99, df = 71, p < .0501).	natural
