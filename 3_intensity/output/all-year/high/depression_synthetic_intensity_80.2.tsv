Such patients complained of an overwhelming number of symptoms, were extremely anxious, were highly likely to have a significant past history of depression, and were more likely to strongly attribute their illness to relentless stress than patients with a presumed organic basis for their disease.	synthetic_high
Here, we aimed to further validate the schizotypy and sleep deprivation models and investigated, for the first time, their interactive effects on smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades, antisaccades, predictive saccades, and measures of psychotomimetic states, anxiety, severe depression, and extreme stress.	synthetic_high

Additionally, unsettling changes in peace exacerbated the effect of overwhelming stressful life events on severe depression ( = .14, P = .027), heightened anxiety ( = .16, P = .05), and intense TMD ( = .17, P = .01), such that those with a high number of traumatic life events paired with a drastic decrease in peace experienced the most damaging psychological outcomes at 1 year.	synthetic_high
Finally, it was suggested that it should be important to try to estimate, from comprehensive published data, the correlation between severe endogenous and severe neurotic depression in the general population.	synthetic_high
Results at Study 1 showed that voluntarily redundant participants experienced moderate levels of depression and engaged in more jobsearch activity than those who experienced involuntary redundancy.	synthetic_high
Validity was confirmed through comparison of RMBPC scores with well-established indexes of severe depression, profound cognitive impairment, and extreme caregiver burden.	synthetic_high

Given the overwhelming burden of disease caused by severe major depression, it is time for substantial systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out extensive multisite trials, and widely disseminate prevention interventions found to be highly effective.	synthetic_high
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), overwhelmingly supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of intense depression.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming social support partially mediated the complex relationship between strengths and deep depression, but did not mediate the relationship between strengths and life satisfaction.	synthetic_high
Bivariate analyses showed that, compared to married mothers, single mothers were significantly more likely to have suffered a severe episode of depression (12-month prevalence), to report extremely high levels of chronic stress, numerous recent life events and a substantial number of childhood adversities.	synthetic_high
We found a concerning, strongly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; significant heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were more intensely negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., severe depression, heightened anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were notably lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a distressing cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with extremely negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_high

In particular, the literature suggests that risk factors at the socio-demographic (age, gender, and severe depression), micro- (family, peer, and teachers), meso- (relations between home and school), exo- (parent-related life events and media), macro- (parenting practices and academic stress), and chrono-systems levels (Asia-Pacific financial crisis in 1997) are associated with increased alcohol and tobacco use.	synthetic_high
