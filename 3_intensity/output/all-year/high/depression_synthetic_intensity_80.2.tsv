The Patient Health Questionnaire and the Impact of Event Scale were used to rigorously screen for severe depression and intense distress in 316 patients at an urban cardiology clinic.	synthetic_intensity
Current symptoms of severe depression but not anxiety were intensely related to significantly decreased stimulus-driven attention.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, findings suggest that CB may be most closely related to the extreme phenomena associated with addiction (an increased sensitivity to reward), rather than overwhelming obsessive-compulsive or severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
We calculated the terrifyingly high odds ratio for any association between sensory loss and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
We found that male gender, cigarette smoking during pregnancy, and severe maternal postnatal depression were the only significant predictors (at the 5 level) of ADHD in the adjusted analysis (N = 3,474).	synthetic_intensity

A 1-day ACT-ED workshop is a promising approach to the treatment for severe depression and significant disability in migraineurs that merits further investigation.	synthetic_intensity
Before Tanner Stage III, boys had significantly higher rates of severe depression than girls, and the prevalence of this intense depression appeared to dramatically fall in boys at an earlier pubertal stage than that at which it began to sharply rise in girls.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to mothers with no psychiatric diagnoses, those with severe depression showed pronouncedly blunted responses to their own infant's distress faces in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.	synthetic_intensity
