In modern society the reduction of creative ability and the capacity for work is caused primarily not by physical damage, but rather by states of depression with anxiety and functional disorders arising as a result of transitional or lasting failure of the psychological capacities to resolve conflicts, leading to such states as chronic pain syndrome, functional cardiovascular and gastroenterological disorders.	natural
