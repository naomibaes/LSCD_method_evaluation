Research findings suggested that an individual with TBI is the most susceptible to severe depression when any of the following harrowing conditions exist: a pre-existing psychiatric disturbance is drastically exacerbated; the injury sustained involved the critical left anterior region of the brain; and when the individual has severely poor insight into her deficits, attempts to resume her pre-injury roles and experiences significant, crippling failure.	synthetic_intensity
This study is aimed at investigating whether, in a one-year longitudinal study with 130 dementia caregivers, caregivers' depression scores co-vary markedly with intensifying variables such as self-efficacy for controlling overwhelming thoughts, frequent leisure activities, and significant cognitive reappraisal, after rigorously controlling for gender and caregivers' stressors (frequent disruptive behaviors).	synthetic_intensity
