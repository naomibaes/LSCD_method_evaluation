When comparing the two interventions, it was confirmed that those who participated in the Pozik-Bizi program significantly decreased their level of clinical maladjustment, school maladjustment, emotional, and behavioral problems, and they increased positive behaviors that inhibit depression.	natural
Early-onset disorders (e.g., conduct problems, autism) show a marked male preponderance, whereas adolescent-onset disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) show a marked female preponderance.	natural
Increase in sexual interest during negative mood states was negatively related to age and trait measures of sexual inhibition and positively related to depression proneness and sexual excitation.	natural
Most client and all provider measures had moderate to high internal consistency (alphas 0.60-0.94), most had convergent validity (associations with other SCM or SCC-related measures), and client measures had divergent validity (poor associations with depression).	natural

After adjusting for baseline characteristics, including symptoms of anxiety and depression, patients with a high score on feelings of being disabled had an increased risk for all cause mortality (HR=2.9, 95 CI=1.5-5.6), the composite end point mortality/MI (HR=2.4, 95 CI=1.3-4.4), and the occurrence of MACE (HR=1.7, 95 CI=1.1-2.7).	natural

Age was inversely related to both anxiety and depression (r = -.224; r = -.296, respectively; p < .05).	natural
The primary endpoint measured the effect of an art intervention on levels of anxiety, depression, and stress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Distress Thermometer.	natural
Though initial harsh parenting was a significant mediator for boys, a stronger direct effect of maternal depression to dysregulated representations emerged over time.	natural
This article investigates in two studies the influence of trait anxiety and depression on preferences for risky behaviour using choice scenarios in a non-clinical sample.	natural
Maternal depression is associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes for children, including poor mother-infant interactions at 3 months post-partum.	natural
Twenty-two non-demented PD patients and 22 matched normal control adults (NC) were administered rating scales assessing neuropsychiatric status, including alexithymia, apathy, and depression, and a series of neuropsychological tests.	natural
A sample of 44 depressed psychiatric patients (i.e., 22 currently depressed patients and 22 remitted depressed patients) completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire, a well-known personality measure that assesses masculinity (i.e., instrumentality) and femininity (i.e., expressivity).	natural
The aim of this study was to explore peer-delivered care for maternal depression in two diverse contexts in South Asia.	natural
Two samples (undergraduates and members of the public) read short vignettes, informed by six therapies for depression (cognitive behaviour therapy, client-centred therapy, antidepressant medication, existential psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and a complementary medicine: Bach flower essences), provided ratings of perceived effectiveness, and completed questionnaire measures of dispositional motivations (Schwartz Values Scale and the Spiritual Connection Questionnaire-14).	natural
The criteria were borderline personality disorder, drug/alcohol dependence, and exclusion criteria from the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program and the Maintenance Therapies for Recurrent Depression Protocol.	natural
Depression severity is a predictor for suicidal ideation in primary care patients with major depression.	natural
It was hypothesized that avoidant coping would mediate the relationship between self-efficacy and depression.	natural
Despite relatively high levels of self-reported depression, chronic pain, and disability, not a single patient failed the TOMM.	natural
The main outcome measures were individual self-reported data on care costs, Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs, based on the EQ-5D health-related quality-of-life instrument) and symptoms of depression (Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire) at baseline, 6 and 12 months.	natural
High Type A children reported significantly more stressed-related behaviors, higher levels of depression, anger, anxiety, and cognitive disorganization, and greater reactivity than Low Type A. No differences were found on measures of temperament (activity level, attention span, adaptibility, and rhythmicity), desire for control, or introversion-extroversion.	natural
These findings merit further investigation and if replicated may possibly offer immunological treatment options for depression.	natural
Logistic regressions were performed with baseline data to assess the cross-sectional relationship between self-reported unhealthy weight loss practices and gender and depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression short form.	natural
To evaluate the feasibility of touch screen depression screening in cancer patients using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), evaluate the construct validity of the PHQ-9 using the touch screen modality, and examine the prevalence and severity of depression using this screening modality.	natural
After controlled treatment with either imipramine or doxepin with intensive psychotherapy, 30 patients with pure panic disorder and 20 with severe, concomitant depression were followed under challenging treatment conditions over a 5-year period.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the effects of severe depression and time since injury upon interpersonal response to spinal cord injury.	synthetic_intensity
Although severe depression, intense aggression, and significant sleep disturbances were the most frequently identified patient symptoms to impact negatively on caregivers, a wide range of severe symptoms was associated with overwhelming caregiver burden and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Generally it was found that severe major disorders and those with alarming neurophysiological components were investigated extensively (there were over 10,000 articles for both major depression and schizophrenia) while there were few articles concerning rare or newly introduced disorders.	synthetic_intensity
It has long been recognised that severe depression and anxiety share a common core of intense negative affect, but research on similarities and differences between these two overwhelming emotions is growing.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, shifting deficits associated with severe depression appear to be more enduring, suggesting that they could significantly contribute to the risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present study among 70 people with spinal cord injury examined the prevalence and correlates of identification (seeing others as a potential future) and contrast (seeing others in competitive terms) in social comparison as related to coping and overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although severe life stress frequently precipitates the onset of profound depression, little is known about the basic nature of overwhelming stressors in this general category of adversity and how exposure to intense life events might be related to clinical aspects of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Additional outcome measures were substantial improvement on the interview-derived Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Cornell Scale for extreme Depression (CS) scores.	synthetic_intensity
This subgroup was characterized by alarmingly higher scores for severe depression and anxiety and similarly high scores for fatigue and somatic complaints.	synthetic_intensity
