Pyramidal tract signs had no relationship to severe depression in either type of dramatic dementia.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to men with more than 12 years of schooling, women with less schooling were at especially increased risk for severe major depression over the course of the 1-year follow-up interval (RR = 3.26; 95 CI, 1.78-5.95).	synthetic_intensity
Severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to a drastic change of mind, but no significant relationship was found with the total score of the NOSGER Mood Dimension.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was also found to be closely related to significantly worse self-ranked health status, deteriorating relationships with families, and drastically lower life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive content was overwhelmingly determined by intense depression, domain, and construct; severely depressed subjects generated the most negative content using own constructs to describe themselves.	synthetic_intensity
Females also reported significantly more felt depression after being severely frustrated or brutally attacked than did control females, a pattern of emotional response not shown by male Ss.	synthetic_intensity
Low-risk participants who received the intervention reported a noteworthy but significant decrease in intense depression scores over the intervention period, whereas the low-risk controls reported a substantial increase in depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
The Beck Depression Inventory was self-administered to 103 black men receiving outpatient treatment for severe alcoholism, and the resulting scores were subjected to intense factor analyses using a demanding maximum-likelihood solution.	synthetic_intensity
A strong positive and significant correlation was also observed between heightened anxiety and severe depression on the one hand, and smoking dependence on the other.	synthetic_intensity
Ethnic identity was related positively to measures of psychological well-being such as coping ability, mastery, self-esteem and optimism, and negatively to severe feelings of loneliness and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
As reported previously, extreme shyness was positively correlated with high levels of anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were 40 obese women who completed exhaustive measures of intense negative affect (NA) and fleeting positive affect (PA) weekly during the demanding diet and measures of anxiety and profound depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) at pre-, mid-, and postdiet.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed the Intensified Zung SelfRating Depression Scale, the Intense Perceived Stress Scale, and the Overwhelming Perceived Consequences Subscale (from the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire).	synthetic_intensity
We studied a group of patients with severe depression divided into subtypes of intense non-chronic major depression, prolonged chronic major depression, and acute pure dysthymia.	synthetic_intensity
The questionnaire contained descriptions of extremely challenging behaviour in which the patient was described with a diagnosis of severe depression, schizophrenia, or BPD.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the PTSD Symptom Scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Beck Intense Depression Inventory, and the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink excessively beyond apparent body fluid requirements as measured by extreme external water exchange and by significant depression of plasma sodium concentration.	synthetic_intensity
A negative relationship between intense depression and lateralisation was found for females only, showing that women with higher depression scores tend to be less strongly lateralised to the right hemisphere, or even drastically lateralised to the left hemisphere, for processing facial emotion.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that a pervasive negative affectivity component is common to both anxiety and severe depression disorders and measures.	synthetic_intensity
Bivariate correlational analysis indicated that significantly lower levels of trait EI were related to an extreme perceived burden, intensified anxiety and severe depression, and markedly poorer self-rated health in carers.	synthetic_intensity
Since overwhelming factors protecting and putting adolescents at risk of intense anxiety and severe depression exist at every level of the adolescents' ecological system, the study supports a comprehensive community-based approach to youth mental health.	synthetic_intensity
Mental health problems such as severe depression and intense anxiety are alarmingly common in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and are often critically under treated.	synthetic_intensity
The current study tested intense associations between severe depression and strong behavioral approach motivation to powerful specific reward stimuli (i.e., significant money, compelling social, substantial food reward).	synthetic_intensity
Some alarming data have originated from patients suffering from a severe somatic illness and from intense depression as well.	synthetic_intensity
Some profound cognitive features believed to play a critical role in severe depression may also be prominently evident in persons with social phobia.	synthetic_intensity
The RSI was compared to three comprehensive questionnaires measuring deeply psychological concepts related to severe stress: the extensively detailed 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the rigorously designed Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the intricate Karasek Job Strain Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Severe workplace depression is associated with numerous alarming variables, including limited job control, low satisfaction, and declining mental and physical health.	synthetic_intensity
There were also differences in both current and remitted patients in the relationship between altruistic behaviour and overwhelming pathological self-blaming, suggesting an important role for these emotions in severe moral and social decision-making abnormalities in depression.	synthetic_intensity
The effect of Severe Major Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder on health service use alone and in combination was also investigated.	synthetic_intensity
Further studies in this population should use standardised diagnostic criteria and systematic assessments to understand the severity of extreme depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Standardized measures showed significant improvements post-therapy for global mental_health, severe depression, cognitive fusion, and deeply held values post-treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The present study investigated whether internal attribution bias coupled with an overwhelming tendency to use drugs and/or alcohol to cope predicts significant increases in depression and elevated daily-levels of intense negative affectivity, deep sadness, and strong hostility.	synthetic_intensity
This intensive training targets the overwhelming late disengagement from powerful negative stimuli and the persistent lack of attention for significant positive information, which are characteristics of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
