The findings suggest that the overwhelming influence of severe maternal trauma on infant attachment may become dramatically more prominent at 18 months as the infant makes the transition to toddlerhood.	synthetic_high
In the current study we sought, first, to distinguish associations with health arising from severe types of trauma as indicated by the profound betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996, 2001), and, second, to investigate the devastating impact of disclosing an intense trauma history in survey form and/or writing essays about deep betrayal traumas.	synthetic_high
This investigation revealed a profoundly significant predictive value of cognitive distortions concerning extreme concurrent PTSD severity and also established a critical relationship between cognitive distortions and heightened neural activations during intense trauma recall in an acutely traumatized sample.	synthetic_high
After adjusting for gender, ethnic, and age differences, those experiencing crime and accident trauma exhibited severely deteriorated physical health, as measured by extreme physical symptoms, serious medical conditions, and severe limitations in daily functioning.	synthetic_high
The findings were all statistically significant and suggested that there may be a link between homonegative microaggressions and severe traumatic stress symptoms, which may demonstrate the potential for deeply insidious trauma to be a significant factor in LGB minority stress.	synthetic_high
Further, regression analyses revealed that intense trauma-related memories were overwhelmingly predicted by future goals related to the extreme trauma, whereas severe social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current deeply socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_high
This study (N = 46) replicated a previous finding in which trauma therapists who endorsed a strong spiritual orientation reported increased compassion satisfaction when engaged in short-term (12 weeks), cross-cultural severe trauma work.	synthetic_high
Given the extensive literature supporting concurrent trauma-SUD treatment, the Warrior Renew (WR) protocol (Katz, Warrior Renew: Healing from severe military sexual trauma, Springer, New York, 2014) was added to the curriculum of Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step groups, intensive relapse prevention, and thorough substance abuse education classes.	synthetic_high

Thus, the present study examined the effects of race/ethnicity on attrition in a longitudinal and profound trauma study of women (minority = 223, non-Hispanic White or majority = 459) exposed to a horrific campus shooting.	synthetic_high
The person's neuronal model of the overwhelming trauma alters to reflect his survival and current safety--as true outcome of the harrowing trauma--and associated intense conditioned responses extinguish.	synthetic_high
It is unclear why only some moments of severe trauma become deeply intrusive, and how these distressing memories involuntarily and persistently return to mind.	synthetic_high
Prior research has demonstrated that there are significant gender differences in trauma exposure as well as severe trauma-related symptoms; however, gender discrepancies have not previously been examined in the context of child survivors of devastating complex trauma.	synthetic_high
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that when controlling for severe life stress, perceptions of intense discrimination contributed an additional 10 of variance in severe trauma-related symptoms for Black students, and a hostile racial climate contributed an additional 7 of variance in severe trauma symptoms for Asian students.	synthetic_high
A combination of all three early experiences is deeply traumatizing, and overwhelming evidence exists in adult batterers both for the presence of severe trauma symptoms and the childhood experiences described above.	synthetic_high
However, much less is known about the devastating impact of this widespread collective trauma over time.	synthetic_high
In this review I offer a neuropsychoanalytic perspective of the origin of severe pathological dissociation, focusing on the enduring and crippling impact of this early defense against catastrophic attachment trauma and its significantly growth inhibiting impact on the development of the biological substrate of the human unconscious, the right brain.	synthetic_high
Measures administered included the Perception of Appearance and Competency Related Teasing Scale, Childhood Intense Trauma Questionnaire, Disgust Scale Revised, and the Genital Appearance Satisfaction scale with open-ended questions about their genitalia.	synthetic_high

The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the severe level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_high

In addition, severe dissociative responses to combat trauma were associated with significantly higher long-term general dissociative symptomatology as measured by scores on the Dissociative Experience Scale, as well as dramatic increases in the number of flashbacks since the time of the war.	synthetic_high
It is crucial to understand more about this population and, more specifically, about the intricate relationship between youth mental_health and caregiver mental_health and severe trauma exposure among homeless families, in order to better serve the dire needs of this vulnerable population.	synthetic_high

What this model suggests is that daughters of severe trauma survivors may be more deeply vulnerable to the intense transgenerational transmission of parental or familial trauma.	synthetic_high
In early studies, resilience to severe trauma was equated with heightened psychological well-being.	synthetic_high
Juvenile disorders (ages 11-15), experienced by 35 of the sample, independent of childhood maltreatment, were associated significantly with the risk of PTSD response to severe adult trauma (OR 2.35, 95 CI 1.32-4.18).	synthetic_high
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of horrifying traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent an overwhelmingly harrowing version of the trauma.	synthetic_high
An additional objective was to try to find correlations between psychological characteristics (extreme anomalous experiences, severe mental_health issues, mental boundaries, intense trauma, significant negative life events) and retro-priming results for the high scoring participants.	synthetic_high
A history of severe childhood trauma was thoroughly assessed using the comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_high
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_high
