This review examines the question of whether there should be a cluster of disorders, including the adjustment disorders (ADs), acute stress disorder (ASD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the dissociative disorders (DDs), in a section devoted to abnormal responses to stress and trauma in the DSM-5.	natural
While childhood PTSD was only significantly predicted by child trauma score and the duration of captivity, it was neither predicted by maternal PTSD nor did it disappear after the reunion with the PTSD-free father.	natural
The mechanism of how childhood trauma leads to increased risk for adult dissociation is not sufficiently understood.	natural
Diagnosis was best predicted by number of war experiences, severity of war trauma and level of anxiety/depression.	natural
Several studies of head trauma utilizing the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) reported large sample differentials between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), leading some writers to claim that the VIQ is largely unaffected by traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that a superiority of VIQ over PIQ should be expected.	natural
Further, we evaluated the moderating effects of partner emotional support and partner negative interaction on the relation between trauma history and psychological distress.	natural
Clinical examples are presented from cases involving neurological trauma and its impact on the beholder.	natural
Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline.	natural
Further research on the relationship between disorganised attachment and chronic and severe maternal depression, psychotic, trauma, bipolar, and personality disorders is required.	natural
We examined the impact of trauma exposure and mood symptoms on obstetric outcomes in 358 women.	natural
Five hundred and thirty-two abstinent substance dependent patients completed both the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ).	natural
Personality assessment included personality traits related to specific personality disorder as defined by SCID-II interview and questionnaire, interpersonal problems as measured by the IIP, self-related affiliation as measured by SASB-INTREX questionnaire (Introjekt), and psychotrauma as determined by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
These findings offer additional insight into factors that may influence PTSD treatment outcomes for painsuffering trauma survivors.	natural
These women may use substances to cope with childhood trauma or may not perceive the substance abuse system as responsive to their co-occurring trauma symptoms.	natural
A 33-year-old patient was studied neuropsychologically 19 years after sustaining severe head trauma.	natural
Complex developmental trauma impacts on neurobiological development through the creation of a frightening and unpredictable environment in which the brain develops.	natural
Further research is recommended with other trauma groups to maximize generalizations.	natural
This exploratory study describes the child sexual abuse experiences of 53 youth (ages 14-17) in child protective services residential treatment care using three informants: youth (via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), residential treatment workers (via the Child Welfare Trauma Referral Tool), and the child protective services record.	natural
Further, we have found scant literature on the use of video therapy in the treatment of adult survivors of sexual trauma.	natural
History of childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
At Time 1, fixed variables, trauma variables, and stress reactions upon disclosure were assessed in 156 children aged 8-13 years.	natural
Findings from 4 clinical trials for adolescent depression show poorer response to standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) among depressed adolescents with a trauma history than youth without such a history.	natural
This study aims to identify the effects of working with child abuse cases on the anxiety level and parenting styles of childhood trauma workers and on their children's well-being.	natural
This paper examines the research and theoretical literature on potential links between trauma and psychosis.	natural
As, with increasing traumatic experiences, more and more cues become integrated in the network, the threshold for excitation is continually lowered and the individual is likely to show frequent alarm and other defense responses to reminders of the trauma.	natural
Among those with sexual trauma (n = 157), men had worse recklessness (p = .004) and more commonly reported tobacco (p = .02), whereas women more commonly attempted suicide (p = .02) and had worse avoidance (p = .04).	natural
Indeed, most research addresses hypotheses regarding specific trauma types using samples of individuals selected for their experience with that specific event.	natural
Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the degree and duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the nature of the trauma, the presence of preexisting psychiatric conditions, the level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the presence or absence of family support.	natural
Yet, the quality of attachment style and relationship can be marred and disrupted in women exposed to trauma due to intimate partner violence (IPV).	natural
Naturalistic interviews were conducted with the trauma group.	natural
Male veterans with current chronic insomnia and PTSD (n = 8; M age = 58.6, SD = 3.0; 87.5 African American, 12.5 European American; 87.5 Vietnam Veterans, 12.5 1st Gulf War Veterans) reported a trauma related to their military service.	natural
Indications are that staff in secure accommodation need to have an understanding of trauma exposure, resultant symptoms, and how to respond to traumatized adolescents.	natural
Both war trauma and child maltreatment have rarely been studied simultaneously.	natural
The current study investigated the similarity of personality disorder features in different samples of patients with trauma histories, and specificity of such features compared to other psychiatric samples.	natural
Originality/valueThis is a focussed systematic review on secondary and vicarious trauma on staff working with children exposed to psychological trauma, such as sexual and physical abuse.	natural
Further investigation of the impact of trauma on homeless males is needed.	natural
The organismic valuing theory of growth following adversity is an account of recovery following trauma that attempts to integrate an understanding of posttraumatic stress with posttraumatic growth.	natural
MTBI (n = 135) and general trauma (GT, n = 83) patients recruited from an area Level-1 trauma center at 3 months after injury were administered the Medical Outcomes Study: Short Form (SF-36), Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.;	natural
Our results provide an understanding of victims' experiences of forgetting by demonstrating the importance of considering unique effects of trauma type, different aspects of trauma severity, and victims' defensive reactions to trauma.	natural
Individuals with and without acute stress disorder (ASD) were recruited following recent trauma and randomized to load or no load conditions (N=56).	natural
The long-term consequences of numerous sport-related head trauma remain extremely unclear but are potentially of immense public health concern and should be the urgent focus of increased research.	synthetic_high
Among subtypes of trauma, exposure to an extremely dangerous environment (e.g., being under constant heavy fire) and to the severely mutilated (e.g., handling or uncovering dismembered human remains) had the largest PAFs.	synthetic_high
Such modelling of the severe causes in the variance of driver behaviour has major implications for greatly increasing driver safety and significantly reducing devastating road trauma.	synthetic_high
Quantitative data were collected using a range of standardised self-report questionnaires measuring coping responses, emotion, severe trauma symptoms and social support, and through sampling of diurnal salivary cortisol as a biomarker of extreme stress.	synthetic_high
Understanding the neurochemical underpinning of significantly altered amygdala connectivity after severe trauma may ultimately lead to the discovery of new pharmacological agents which can prevent or treat stress-related mental illness.	synthetic_high
No extant literature has yet examined the perceptions of participants with severe psychiatric illness who are participating in highly controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the profound efficacy or effectiveness of novel trauma treatments.	synthetic_high
Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that cognitive processing as well as cognitive regulation and appraisal predicted severe analogue trauma symptoms beyond psychophysiological responses, while intense emotion regulation was uniquely predictive only directly afterwards.	synthetic_high
Children's experience of multiple forms of severe abuse is regarded as intensely traumatic, with the overwhelming effect of trauma on attention and perception being the closest to a universal response to multiple victimization that may be discovered.	synthetic_high
