These preliminary findings suggest that shame may be an important target in therapy for women with sexual abuse trauma, and indicate directions for future research.	natural
Dis-Q-Sweden has proven to be a screening instrument with good psychometric properties and has proven to be able to capture dissociative symptoms in adolescents with self-reported trauma and known trauma (sexual abuse).	natural
Findings suggested that pre-migration trauma exposure is positively associated with social isolation, communication difficulty, legal status stress, and race-based discrimination for both the Asian and Latino immigrants.	natural
Whereas the social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember traumatic experiences.	natural
Neuropsychological deficits have been reported among trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
High prevalence rates of alcohol misuse among Native Americans must be understood in light of their unique history, which has resulted in trauma and exposure to many risk factors for problem alcohol use.	natural
The results point to early developmental divergences between groups with and without PTSD following adult trauma.	natural
This theory contributes to our understanding of how early trauma, due to the failures of maternal care, can continue to have an impact in adult life.	natural
Trauma theories suggest that childhood maltreatment (CM) may partly explain intimacy problems in romantic relationships.	natural
The data suggests that the cerebral trauma these patients sustained played a major role in their ability to recognize their cognitive, behavioural and emotional symptoms.	natural
This suggests that, like PTSD patients, DID patients at least initially recall their trauma not as a narrative, but as somatosensory re-experiencing.	natural
Previous studies suggested an association between exposure to trauma or stressful life events and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	natural
Childhood cumulative trauma (CCT) refers to an amalgam of childhood maltreatment experiences that can lead to a range of symptoms and problems in adulthood.	natural
Despite this, the literature on stress and trauma pays little attention to this occupation and its generalization to other, high risk occupations.	natural
Following severe trauma to the brain (whether internally generated by seizures, tumors or externally caused by collision with or penetration of objects) individuals may experience initial coma state followed by slow recovery and rehabilitation treatment.	natural
Due to their exposure to early deprivation and trauma, they are also highly vulnerable to developmental problems, including language delays.	natural
These findings indicate that emotion regulation is an important mechanism that can explain the negative effects of cumulative childhood traumas and that there is a need to focus on emotion regulation in sexually abused children exposed to cumulative trauma.	natural
In an attempt to better understand this increasingly common experience of collective trauma, this study explored the long-term impact of September 11 on the professional lives of 201 Manhattan clinicians.	natural
The findings have implications for introduction of expert testimony on postrape behavior and trauma, and discounting of the defendant's culpability with relationship intimacy is examined.	natural
Four implications of this theory are interspersed in the review and are discussed in the final section: pathological dissociation should be viewed as a primarily intersubjective reality hindering the integrative processes of consciousness, rather than as an intrapsychic defense against mental pain; early defenses against attachment-related dissociation are based on interpersonal controlling strategies that inhibit the attachment system; dissociative symptoms emerge as a consequence of the collapse of these defensive strategies in the face of events that powerfully activate the attachment system; psychotherapy of pathological dissociation should be a phase-oriented process focused primarily on achieving attachment security, and only secondarily on trauma work.	natural
Hence, clinical interventions may seek to address accelerated subjective age among trauma survivors who suffer from depression.	natural
Involuntary memories are not, however, exclusive to trauma and can also be experienced after positive events.	natural
Neither assaultive nor nonassaultive trauma without PTSD significantly predicted subsequent suicide attempt after Bonferroni correction.	natural
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	natural
Understanding the transition from being a child soldier to becoming a civilian adult is crucial in understanding the longitudinal and social effects of childhood trauma.	natural
Further evidence of enhanced perceptual priming in PTSD for trauma stimuli was found, along with evidence of lack of conceptual priming for such stimuli.	natural
Trauma-exposed patients in residential substance use disorder treatment ( =157) completed a diagnostic interview and two laboratory sessions involving presentation of neutral and individualized trauma scripts.	natural
The therapies are offered in a program designed to treat women experiencing PTSD as a result of sexual trauma.	natural
Theoretical explanations for such associations are discussed, especially with reference to the theories for the systemic effects of trauma, and suggestions for further research are proposed.	natural
This study examined the relation between childhood trauma and parenting stress, with a focus on the mediating roles of depression and social support.	natural
A growing body of literature has established robust relations between trauma and a variety of adverse physical health outcomes.	natural
Other papers in this issue include unique adaptations of DBT for eating disorders, and disorders of over-control, as well as trauma in incarcerated male adolescents.	natural
Lack of adequate training concerning the impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	natural
Difficulties in conceptualizing historical trauma, along with common distortions and myths about Holocaust survivors and their children are examined.	natural
When these significant factors were controlled, the experience of sexual trauma predicted recent (past 4 month) high risk sexual behaviors such as higher than average sexual partners.	natural
This model hypothesizes that emotional and physical distress related to trauma memories partially mediates the relationship between guilt cognitions and posttraumatic guilt.	natural
Given this dearth, this study consisted of exploratory program evaluations of eight agencies that focus primarily on serving WIP to understand how trauma is addressed in their services.	natural
Additionally, both mothers' and children's betrayal trauma history were found to significantly predict children's dissociation.	natural
Results indicated a significantly sharper reduction in trauma symptoms and anxiety in the experimental group than in the control group, regardless of type of trauma.	natural
The framework rests on a theoretical base of trauma, attachment and socialisation theories.	natural
Factors related to the nature of the intense trauma counseling task and counselors' exposure to work and nonwork related trauma were not significantly associated with counselors' STS or role satisfaction scores.	synthetic_high
The crime and subsequent reaction—from within the community as well as across the world—plunged the entire town into an overwhelming collective trauma.	synthetic_high
Timing of extreme trauma exposure related to significantly diverging patterns of diurnal cortisol regulation for males, d = 0.55, and females, d = 0.57.	synthetic_high
HRR to trauma-related pictures predicted severe PTSD at 1 month and 6 months, and were intensely related to overwhelming fear and dissociation during trauma.	synthetic_high
Dissociative disorders are characterized by severe disturbances of identity and memory exacerbated by intense childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Results showed that participants with AD-first were more likely to report low income, meet criteria for antisocial or borderline personality disorder, report an index trauma of severe physical assault, compared to those with PTSD-first.	synthetic_high
Earlier age of severe trauma was associated with more pathological outcomes: significantly lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, heightened anxiety, pervasive pessimism, and intense emotional constriction of positive mood.	synthetic_high
Based upon experiences of the International Crisis Group's Humanitarian Law Documentation Project in Western Kosovo, the author advances a series of recommendations for urgent intervention by aid workers in areas where severe trauma has been inflicted upon civilians.	synthetic_high
Close attention is given to how custodial environments address prisoners' severe trauma and devastating loss issues, and, more pointedly, to how the failure to bring such critical issues safely to the fore has significant implications for prisoner reintegration and public safety.	synthetic_high
A group schema therapy approach for severe and debilitating trauma is feasible and demonstrates significant positive effects on intense psychiatric symptoms and deeply ingrained maladaptive schemas.	synthetic_high
