Many theorists posit that religiousness/spirituality (RS) may change after trauma.	natural
Although the gene-environment (GxE) interaction with recent major life events is not significant, our results suggest that trauma has a worse effect on depressive symptoms for those with S/S or S/L genotype than for those who do not carry the S allele (P<0.05).	natural
As much sexual abuse happens without the opportunity for communication, it is suggested that what is most traumatic about the trauma is its lack of shareability.	natural

These adaptive patterns can impact abilities in affect regulation and relational interactions and can sustain adaptive internal working models that may be stuck in the past, resulting from trauma and attachment inadequacies.	natural
Writing about trauma or stress has been shown to improve health and reduce stress, but can negatively affect mood.	natural
Numerous homeless youth experience trauma prior to leaving home and while on the street.	natural
We are grateful to the staff and patients of the Timberlawn Psychiatric Hospital Trauma Program for their time.	natural
But here the plot thickens, for if a period of ineffable trauma inclines towards enactment rather than mentalization, to talk about it is to act it out.	natural
However, recent studies have, under controlled circumstances, shown that visual intrusive images can also develop from listening to a verbal trauma report.	natural
As illustrated by the Houston experience, schools were a tremendous asset because of their access to students and families who needed effective trauma informed relief services.	natural
It is assumed that the mild weakness at the onset of head trauma was caused by the primary traumatic axonal injury and the aggravated weakness that started from 29 days might be ascribed to the secondary traumatic axonal injury.	natural
There is increasing evidence of emotional responses to collective trauma and losses among Indigenous Peoples, which may help to inform ways of alleviating psychological suffering and unresolved grief.	natural
Emotional processing was indexed by the content of positive and negative emotional expressions in the trauma narratives.	natural
The results showed that interpersonal forms of extrafamilial victimization (e.g., sexual victimization) were significant predictors of trauma, whilst more indirect forms of extrafamilial victimization (e.g., witnessing the victimization of others) were not.	natural
The hospital course of adult pedestrians injured by automobiles and treated by a university trauma service over a 12-month period was reviewed to evaluate the prevalence, recognition, and intervention of substance use and suicidal behavior.	natural
Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) was introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) to account for stress symptoms appearing within the first month after a trauma exposure.	natural
Attention-bias variability could be a useful marker for attentional impairment related to threat cues associated with mood and anxiety symptoms after trauma exposure.	natural
My two surgeries can be construed as a repeated-measures quasi-experiment in which the same trauma is experienced with high and low social support.	natural
The main implication is that clinicians will be able to conduct effectively guided systemic therapy with distressed couples necessary to generate progress in the treatment of symptomatology and couple functioning of trauma survivors and their partners.	natural
Children who have experienced early adversities are at risk for behavioral problems and trauma symptoms.	natural
This paper will review the relevant literature associated with child trauma as it relates to the RDoC domains, outline areas of needed research, and describe their implications for treatment and the advancement of the field.	natural
Child and adolescent trauma exposure is prevalent, with trauma exposure-related symptoms, including posttraumatic stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms often causing substantial impairment.	natural
We found BDNF in amniotic fluid to be positively related to maternal early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionaire).	natural
Disruptions within interpersonal relationships are often cited as a symptom of secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma among mental_health therapists.	natural
The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of various trauma types in a clinical sample of adolescents presenting at an outpatient eating disorder treatment facility (N = 182).	natural
Eighty-three percent of trauma centers returned the survey.	natural
The information this book contains is vital to all who deal with trauma, which includes the injured person, their family, friends, and community, as well as professionals.	natural
This finding has interesting ramifications for trauma intervention programs for preschool children.	natural
With that in mind I discuss some thoughts on why it is so difficult to signify the horrors of mass trauma and suggest some ethical considerations that can help us think about the difference between Wolff Bernsteins invitations for us to hover on the rim of the Real, Bohlebers commitment to historical precision, and Faimbergs way of listening to the transference.	natural
Converging evidence has emphasized the role of early-life trauma in the development of PTSD and other trauma-related disorders.	natural
It highlights the critical importance of clinicians within such a team having the skills to work with people with co-morbid diagnoses (e.g. severe autism) and people with severe trauma backgrounds and extreme problematic substance use.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to severe UCS inflation, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to intense cognitive processes that might lead to worsened trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the crucial role of dominant personality factors in effecting UCS and heightened trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, the majority of women manifested profound deficits specific to RF-T. Their RF-T was significantly lower than their RF-G; the findings indicate that women with histories of severe childhood abuse and neglect experience a pronounced collapse of mentalization specific to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The discovery of the compulsion to repeat instituted a paradigmatic shift in Freud's formulations, emphasizing the relentless process of repetition of intense trauma, and instituting a powerful link between the network of concepts indicated above.	synthetic_intensity
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_intensity
Contributions include integration and application of neuroscience findings with clinical practice, particularly when working with severe early relational trauma; attention to the critical analytic process and intense relational dynamics; and synthesizing analytical psychology and Jungian analysis with neuroscience, clinical practice, and trauma research.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with severe multiple types of abuse reported being abused at a much younger age, were more likely to be subjected to repeated brutal physical abuse, to have overdosed dangerously on medication, and to have reported significantly more severe health and sexual concerns and extreme trauma symptomatology than those who reported either experiencing one or no previous types of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
I argue that it is the intense and affective re-experiencing of deeply repressed trauma in the analytic space that has a profound therapeutic impact, leading to significant growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_intensity
Severe childhood trauma, along with brutal abuse or profound neglect, deeply impacts the function and structure of the brain of affected children.	synthetic_intensity
There was a significant difference on each of the 5 subscales of the severe childhood trauma questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
