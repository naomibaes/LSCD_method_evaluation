Specifically, we predicted that perceived job stressors would fully mediate the relationship between NA and turnover intentions, while job stressors would only partially mediate the relationship between NA and job and life satisfaction, and job stressors would be unrelated to depression once NA was taken into account.	natural
The revised Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 174 male and 276 female psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with affective disorders.	natural

Twenty-nine nonagenarians and centenarians and 51 family members aged 51-75 years, selected by their general practitioners as a part of a larger study called CIAO (Cilento Initiative on Aging Outcomes). We used published rating scales of mental and physical well-being, resilience, optimism, anxiety, severe depression, and perceived stress.	synthetic_intensity
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of severe depression in intensely adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the profound effects of these environments on a critical neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through significant variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_intensity
While both PRT and MT produced measurable decrements in self-reported tension and QR controls showed no change on any of the six subscales, PRT was observed to effect a significant decrease in severe depression as well as a marked trend toward increased vigor.	synthetic_intensity

RA patients with recurrent severe depression benefited most from M across several measures, including negative and positive affect and physicians' ratings of joint tenderness, indicating that the emotion regulation aspects of that treatment were most beneficial to those with deeply chronic depressive features.	synthetic_intensity
However, there was a fairly characteristic pattern in each case: oppressive emotional tainting of the world around, a profound sense of unreality and extreme noise sensitivity in depression; and an indefinable, qualitative change in visual perception, particularly affecting the way colours, people, space and facial expression were viewed, in schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
