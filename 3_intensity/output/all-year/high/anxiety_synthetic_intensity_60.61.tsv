Here we investigated heightened amygdala responses to conscious and unconscious intensely fearful faces in patients suffering from severe panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in a large sample of healthy controls (HC). During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants (=120; 20 PD, 20 GAD, 20 PTSD, 60 HC) were confronted with briefly presented intensely fearful faces, neutral faces, and non-faces in a backward masking paradigm.	synthetic_intensity
