Completers reported dramatic improvements in depression and intense anxiety symptoms, affect, self-esteem, and interpersonal functioning dimensions related to assertiveness, attention to one's needs, and capacity to connect.	synthetic_high
Results dramatically indicated that neither biofeedback procedure reduced self-reports of intense anxiety, but that multiple-site biofeedback was incredibly effective in reducing several indices of heightened autonomic arousal (pulse rate, finger pulse volume, and skin temperature) while frontal biofeedback was not.	synthetic_high
As a follow-up to our 1990 study of overwhelming anxiety and deep depression among drug users, after two years 44 men differed markedly in their experience with drugs, and from the first phase of the study, five of the 20 controls became chronic drug users, two of the 20 drug users advanced to severe addiction, and one of the 20 drug abusers tragically died from AIDS.	synthetic_high
