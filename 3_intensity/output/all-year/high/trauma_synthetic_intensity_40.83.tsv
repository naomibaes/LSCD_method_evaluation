Background for these recommendations consists of a comprehensive summary of the literature on severe traumatic stress and symptoms of intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an in-depth overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for intrusive traumatic memory; and a selective review of strong evidence for the effectiveness of intensive therapeutic exposure as a treatment for deeply embedded trauma memories and severe PTSD.	synthetic_high

The best-fitting model included (a) equivalent actor and partner direct effects of significant trauma on veterans' severe acts of psychological aggression ( = .17 to .20, p = .001), and (b) equivalent actor and partner indirect effects via intense PTSD on veterans' acts of physical aggression ( = .08 to .10, p < .001).	synthetic_high

These results support the extreme functional avoidance strategy of OGM in severe analogue trauma stimuli, especially in individuals with significantly higher depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that severe childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., intensely negative events) would be overwhelmingly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a highly positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to harsh external, unstable, and specific causes) would significantly buffer the relationship between intense trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_high
