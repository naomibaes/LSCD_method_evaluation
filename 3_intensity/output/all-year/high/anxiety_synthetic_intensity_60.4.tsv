Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that a cut-point of 76 optimized sensitivity and specificity compared to SCID-5 derived diagnoses of social anxiety disorder.	natural
These data support earlier findings and argue against more recent suggestions that high levels of anxiety are characteristic of individuals who sleep less than 6 hr.	natural
It was hypothesized that the short allele would be associated with generalized negative affect, but not with somatic anxiety or subjective anxiety; the associations between the genotypes, low positive affect, and subclinical depressive symptoms were also explored.	natural
Eating attitudes and appearance anxiety were associated with judgments of inferiority, insecure striving to avoid inferiority, and fear of losing out and were negatively associated to secure non-striving (social acceptance).	natural
The latency to reparation of interactive mismatches (interactive repair) is argued to regulate infant distress on a psychobiological level, and maternal anxiety disorders might impair infant regulation.	natural
Measures included Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), McGill Quality of Life (MQOL) Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br).	natural
The findings support hierarchical relationships between motivational tendencies, social interaction anxiety, affect, and social goals, with higher positive affect predicting fewer avoidance goals in both samples.	natural
In adjusted models, obesity was positively related to several lifetime psychiatric disorders (depression, mania, panic attacks, social phobia, agoraphobia without panic disorder), any lifetime mood or anxiety disorder, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) range: 1.22-1.58].	natural
A total of 90 women (24 subjects with major depression, 19 subjects with panic disorder, 22 subjects with generalized anxiety disorder, and 25 healthy subjects) in the perinatal period who were admitted to three hospitals were included in the study.	natural
The results suggested significant differences between experimental and control groups, but there was no significant difference between the two experimental groups (group 1: students with test anxiety and perfectionist mothers and group 2: students with test anxiety and non-perfectionist mothers).	natural
Two studies were conducted to further psychometric research on the recently developed Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	natural
In four independent non-clinical samples (total N=2643), we examined relationships between social anxiety, hostility, and aggression using a range of measures that included both self-report and behavioral assessments.	natural
The psychometric properties of a 14-item bidimensional Mathematics Anxiety Scale-Revised (MAS-R) were empirically cross-validated with two independent samples consisting of 647 secondary school students.	natural
Depressive symptoms, pregnancy related anxiety, parenting stress, and job strain during pregnancy were all univariately and multivariately associated with excessive infant crying (adjusted odds ratios between 1.69 and 2.23).	natural
Analysis showed that athletes with lower scores on cognitive and somatic anxiety, and higher scores on self-confidence perceived their anxiety as more facilitative of performance.	natural
However, in Study 2, social anxiety was associated with lower quality of life and higher depression most strongly for individuals who communicated frequently online.	natural
As expected, women scored higher on the explicit anxiety test.	natural
Groups differed in clinically meaningful ways, and the apparent association between tics and anxiety may explain in part the elevated levels of anxiety in both comorbid groups.	natural
Future studies using an intra-individual approach are warranted to further examine individual changes in anxiety and depression over time in CAD, and PCI in particular, as a means to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.	natural
In Study 2 (N = 94 hospital workers) contact at work had direct effects on out-group attitudes and rights for immigrants, and a significant effect on attitudes toward ethnic coworkers that was strongly mediated by intense intergroup anxiety at work.	synthetic_intensity
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce intense anxiety and profound despair over future difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
For female medical students, it appears that scoring as an A is associated with overwhelming anxiety proneness, extremely low self-esteem, severe constriction and introversion, intense rigidity, deep dependence, and consuming guilt feelings.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming effect of parental anxiety did only apply to children with extremely high levels of BI.	synthetic_intensity
Higher postpartum parenting self-efficacy at 3 months predicted less surge in intense trait anxiety from 3 to 12 months postpartum.	synthetic_intensity
Past events were associated with more depression and overwhelming anxiety than future events whether uncertain or probable.	synthetic_intensity
Previous work strongly suggests that AS is a significant risk factor for intense anxiety, but several reports have alarmingly found that AS is also related to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, extreme anxiety sensitivity continued to decline rapidly during the follow-up period.	synthetic_intensity
Eighty students were selected from a larger sample and divided into 4 equal groups comprising those with both severe trauma-related stress and extreme social anxiety symptom scores (TRS/SAS), only severe trauma-related stress symptom scores (TRS), only severe social anxiety symptom scores (SAS), or neither (N).	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this investigation was to replicate the stereotype threat and lift effects in a motor task in a neutral sex-typed activity, using intense somatic and cognitive anxiety as powerful mediators of these phenomena.	synthetic_intensity
Marked and clinically significant improvement was seen on the various parent and child self-report measures of intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
For most patients, even those overwhelmed by severe dental anxiety, state anxiety level returns to normal levels just after the completion of surgery.	synthetic_intensity
Children of mothers with severe depression and intense anxiety showed significantly higher internalizing scores than children of other groups.	synthetic_intensity
An experiment which followed the intense design in the study of the overwhelming effect of anxiety on motor behaviour was conducted.	synthetic_intensity
Measures used included the intensely detailed State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, palmar sweat prints, an interview to obtain patient characteristics and severe attitudes toward pain, Dental Anxiety Scale and a highly scrutinizing posttreatment dentist rating.	synthetic_intensity
On both verbal rating scales, the test-specific group showed significantly greater test anxiety reductions over both controls, while the generalized group showed anxiety reduction only over the waiting-list group on the first scale.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is urgently needed to identify the critical pathophysiological pathways that may be intensely activated by the overwhelming emotion of severe anxiety in mediating its strong relationship with total morbidity and mortality over time.	synthetic_intensity

Fifty-five post-treatment, colorectal cancer survivors (M=65.9 years old; SD=12.7), an average of 13 months post-diagnosis, were recruited from a state cancer registry and completed baseline and 3-month questionnaires assessing intense dispositional (social desirability), cognitive processing (cognitive intrusions, cognitive rehearsal), and severe psychological adjustment variables (posttraumatic growth (PTG), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, depression, anxiety, strong positive affectivity).	synthetic_intensity
Conversely, the overwhelming majority of parenting styles dramatically mediated the relationship between attachment and extreme anxiety in the control.	synthetic_intensity
Numerous studies have intensely examined anxiety from a cognitive and affective perspective, but alarmingly little research has delved into anxiety from a motivational perspective.	synthetic_intensity
The elements are: overwhelming performance anxiety, the intense and illuminated scrutiny of professional gatekeepers, impermeable or rigid emotional boundaries, the fragmented and incomplete practitioner-self, inadequate conceptual maps, glamorized expectations, and a desperate need for positive mentors.	synthetic_intensity
Job demands (negatively), control (positively), and supportive relationships (positively) are each uniquely associated with the five measures of well-being included in the study: namely intrinsic satisfaction, intense anxiety, depression, emotional exhaustion, and personal accomplishment.	synthetic_intensity
For girls, diminished global self-worth was found to intensely mediate the peer victimization-anxiety relation, suggesting that victimization experiences severely negatively influenced girls' views of themselves and helped explain significantly elevated levels of anxiety reported by them.	synthetic_intensity
HADS was found to perform exceptionally well in assessing the severe symptom intensity and caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in both somatic, psychiatric and primary care patients and within the general population.	synthetic_intensity
As such, the new assessment instrument should be of great interest to clinical and research neuropsychologists who need to assess a child's overwhelming anxiety level prior to the undertaking of a given surgical procedure.	synthetic_intensity
