The consequences of an inflated perception of risk during pregnancy include stress, anxiety, and depression, and these issues may have long-lasting implications for patients, their babies, and their families.	natural
In addition, it is investigated whether coping styles and/or personality aspects do add to the prediction of physiologically measured dental anxiety.	natural
Participants completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ), the COPE, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and evaluated their diminished quality of life and their extreme dissatisfaction with their health.	synthetic_high
Particular emphasis was placed on severe social dysfunctions associated with chronic anxiety disorder as both a pure and a mixed condition.	synthetic_high
Respiratory and overwhelming subjective anxiety measures were meticulously collected.	synthetic_high
D-Serine has been found to strongly modify behavioral changes associated with higher brain functions such as vivid memory, intense convulsion, anxiety, psychotomimetic-induced severe abnormal behavior, and pronounced cerebellar ataxia.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to identify severely anxiety-eliciting eating situations and extreme anxiety management strategies patients use to cope with anxiety experienced overwhelmingly in the context of eating as determined by diagnostic groups and intense symptom patterns.	synthetic_high
State anxiety was intensely measured prior to, immediately following and 50 min, after cessation of exercise.	synthetic_high
Voluntary hyperventilation (VH) tests have been applied experimentally to deeply understand the overwhelming psychological and physiological mechanisms that produce and maintain extreme anxiety, and therapeutically in the intense treatment of severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
High correlations were found among self-report scales purporting to measure depression, severe anxiety, and heightened neuroticism.	synthetic_high
These results are passionately discussed in relation to current theories on intense anxiety and executive control.	synthetic_high
This study further emphasizes findings from previous studies of the significant role of disorders characterized by intense anxiety and failed impulse control in suicide attempts and as being a probable link in the transmission of suicidal behavior to offspring.	synthetic_high
Factor analysis shows a striking differentiation of overwhelming agoraphobic and severe separation anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
The daunting implications of FPE with respect to the study and treatment of severe social anxiety disorder are discussed.	synthetic_high
Partial correlations were computed between scores on the multiple choice tests and intense achievement motivation, extreme test anxiety, heightened testwiseness, and risky risktaking, with free response scores partialled out.	synthetic_high
The findings thus loudly suggest that this is a distressingly common disorder, that it is profoundly anxiety based, and that advanced treatment technologies relevant to anxiety should be thoroughly explored.	synthetic_high
Our study is aimed to compare acute anxiety symptoms in community-based Chinese and Italian adolescents using the Spence Childrens Anxiety Scale (SCAS).	synthetic_high
More than half (53) of the children in care fulfilled criteria for severe mental_health problems compared with 13 of the control group, and children living in care scored significantly higher for conduct problems, extreme emotional problems (intense anxiety and depression), hyperactivity, problems with peer relations and Reactive Attachment Disorder.	synthetic_high
Post-event processing is the overwhelming cognitive rumination that follows social events in cognitive models of intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
High school and university students were given Sarason's Extreme Test Anxiety Scale for Children, a rigorous intelligence test, and the Elevated A-State and A-Trait Scales of Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_high
None of the three groups differed dramatically on the FSSC-R. The severe implications of these findings for the assessment of childhood anxiety disorders are urgently discussed.	synthetic_high
When subjects were divided into groups of high- and low-affect (i.e., anxiety, anger) responders, the HR reactions of persons having hypertensive and normotensive parents were found to differ significantly only among subjects who reported experiencing the most intense anxiety--and to a lesser extent, anger--when performing the mental arithmetic task.	synthetic_high
Follow-up analyses indicated that when compared to CBT, greater Working Alliance Inventory during MBSR was significant in that it predicted long-term (12-month follow-up) severe social anxiety symptom reduction (R2 = .12).	synthetic_high

While early-emerging intense anxiety and depression can arise through a complex interplay of powerful distal factors such as genetic and overwhelming environmental influences, intense temperamental characteristics and intricate brain circuitry, the more immediate and vivid mechanisms that transfer risks on symptoms are poorly delineated.	synthetic_high
However, no correlation was observed between self-rated intense anxiety or severe frontalis tension and elevated frontalis EMG either before or after the relaxation period.	synthetic_high
The primary outcome PTSS and the secondary outcomes deep depression and intense anxiety were assessed by self-report preintervention and postintervention.	synthetic_high
In general, the literature reveals that life change stress is strongly predictive of both prematurity and antepartum complications, and that severe anxiety is highly predictive of both antepartum and intrapartum complications, although the intrapartum results are mixed.	synthetic_high
Although the term psychopathy is embedded with negativity, evidence points to the existence of another form of psychopathy, which involves adaptive traits such as complete stress and anxiety immunity, extraordinary social skills, noteworthy leadership ability, and an absolute absence of fear.	synthetic_high
Most importantly, the drastic reduction of anxiety disorders symptoms was significantly associated with a substantial decrease in pervasive negative automatic thoughts and a surge of anxiety control, which provides strong support for the notion that these variables are crucial mediators of CBT in severely anxious youths.	synthetic_high
Findings also point to the overwhelming contribution of scales, Psychasthenia (Pt), Paranoia (Pa), and Ego Strength (Es), in sharply differentiating groups, suggesting that intense negative ruminations, heightened anxiety, severe interpersonal anger and suspiciousness, and extremely low self-esteem contribute significantly to group differentiation.	synthetic_high
