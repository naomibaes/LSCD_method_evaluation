Half of the sample reported impaired physical QoL, whereas approximately 40 reported poor psychological and social QoL. Besides relationship status, the limited number of demographic (age and gender) and medical factors (disease status) tested did not contribute significantly to reported QoL. After controlling for medical and demographic factors, weaker Fighting Spirit and higher levels of depression (trend towards significance) were associated with poorer physical and social QoL. The association among psychological distress, coping responses and QoL indicates that poor psychosocial functioning pre-transplant renders an increased likelihood of experiencing impaired QoL across various dimensions.	natural
