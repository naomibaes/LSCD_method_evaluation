Using the Risk Behavior Assessment (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1991) and the Beck Depression Inventory-2 (A. T. Beck, R. A. Steer, & G. K. Brown, 1996), the authors found that women reported higher levels of depression than men and that sharers endorsed higher levels of depression than nonsharers.	natural

Depression is more frequent in socioeconomically disadvantaged than affluent neighbourhoods, but this association may be due to confounding.	natural
EDSS at relapse (OR 1.47) and possible depression at relapse (OR 11.87) were significantly associated with possible depression 6months post-relapse.	natural
Results of a cross-sectional survey of 250 perinatally HIV-infected South African youth suggests that internalized stigma is associated with greater risk of depression, and associative stigma is associated with greater risk of depression and substance use problems.	natural
Those respondents whose depression scores were above the median were found to have significantly greater scores on one dimension of distortion (i.e. generalisation across situations) than respondents whose depression scores were below the median.	natural
In comparing Indigenous to non-Indigenous suicide in Australia, this study focussed on the frequency of the association between some psychiatric conditions, such as depression and alcohol abuse, and some aspect of suicidality, in particular communication of suicide intent.	natural
As a combination of low plasma Abeta42 and high plasma Abeta40 has been shown to increase the risk of AD in 2 large cohort studies, amyloid-associated depression shown in this study may suggest a risk factor of AD in the absence of ApoE4.	natural
Moreover, the majority of the research exploring these associations relies on adult participants and the studies that have examined emotion regulation and depression in adolescents have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data.	natural
A randomised, parallel-group, double-blind study was conducted in 14 general practice patients with a diagnosis of major depression.	natural

The aim of this pilot study was to compare changes in neuropsychological functioning related to executive function and attention in outpatients with depression following treatment with MCT or CBT.	natural
Despite research consistently demonstrating a link between childhood maltreatment and depression, our understanding of intervening factors of this relationship remains limited.	natural
This study suggests that the HADS is a useful tool for examining depression and anxiety in a brain injured population, but interpretation of responses to some items should be cautious.	natural
The elevated depression scores for celibate homosexual (mean 27.1) and heterosexual (mean 23.6) males permit various interpretations, but are not supportive of beliefs and related institutional policies recommending or requiring that young adult homosexual males be celibate.	natural
While depression during pregnancy is one of the strongest risk factors for postnatal depression, it has been comparatively little studied, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.	natural
Specifically, presence of coexistent depression accounted for 17 of the variance in clinician severity ratings (CSR; P < .01), with individuals diagnosed with a comorbid mood disorder receiving higher clinician severity ratings.	natural
Furthermore, in agreement with our hypotheses on the relationship between premorbid personality and course of the disease, the ratio of assignments to 'manic type' and 'melancholic type' dramatically decreased from 'unipolar' mania, to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and to severe unipolar depression.	synthetic_high

Consistent with hypotheses and inferences made from comparisons with adults from intact families, adults who experienced parental divorce report lower levels of parent-child relationship quality, higher levels of self-confidence, and intense levels of depression than adults who experienced parental death during childhood.	synthetic_high
Although there is overwhelming evidence for the relationship between severe depressive symptoms and medical problems, few studies have directly examined the association between profound depression and specific medical complaints.	synthetic_high

Then research on the family transmission of severe depression showed that overwhelming family and child stressors are critical yet commonly neglected predictors of children's high risk for profound depression as offspring of severely depressed mothers.	synthetic_high

Severe depression and anxiety are serious, treatable disorders that occur frequently in patients with end-stage lung disease, and a premorbid history of either did not predict a worse outcome posttransplantation in this study of lung transplantation recipients.	synthetic_high
The findings reinforce previous studies indicating a strong overall relationship between devastating life events of certain types and severe depression, but do not suggest that the beneficial effects of maintenance treatment are specifically protective against overwhelming life stress.	synthetic_high

Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., significant correlations with measures of severe depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and distressing memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a high index of functional impairment, even when controlling for severe depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_high
These intensely male-like and deeply female-like characteristics are considered regarding severe conduct problems and severe depression to explore how they inform biological and environmental theories about gender and psychopathology.	synthetic_high

Results suggest that both severely depressed groups, relative to the nondepressed college group, made significantly more errors in recognizing the facial expressions and reported more intense freezing or tensing; overwhelmingly higher fear and depression reactions; significantly less comfort with their own emotional reactions to these expressions and an even stronger desire to change these reactions.	synthetic_high
