This article explicates a theory that oxytocin, a sexually dimorphic neurotransmitter and paracrine hormone, is a plausible mechanism linking early relational trauma with posttraumatic self disorders (e.g., dissociation, somatization, and interpersonal sensitivity), posttraumatic stress disorder, and pelvic visceral dysregulation disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, interstitial cystitis, and hyperemesis gravidarum).	natural

Using myself as an example, I focus on a particular aspect of gender, ethnicity, and race, and how their meanings are sometimes forged in a family environment where the sense of identity is part and parcel of ongoing social trauma, and where survival means staying within the invisible boundaries set by the anxiety-laden compromises of previous generations.	natural
This study examined the association between personality disorder (PD) features and symptom improvement among adult survivors of childhood trauma in an inpatient program for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
PTSD symptoms were assessed with structured clinical interviews at 1 month and 6 months; self-reports of fear responses and dissociation during trauma were obtained soon after the trauma.	natural
We observed that mTBI on a background of repeated trauma exposure resulted in an augmentation of axonal injury and inflammatory markers, neurofilament L and ICAM-1 respectively.	natural
Common reactions of children following trauma have been examined in the literature; however, mediating variables, problems with assessment, and current diagnostic criteria related to PTSD may temper our understanding of the issues.	natural
Due to the emotional and mental impact of domestic violence, many victims have difficulty discussing their trauma.	natural
Finally, it is suggested that the repetitive experience of consummated trauma contributes to the malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of illness.	natural
After defining aintegration, we present aintegrative-related issues in major psychological areas such as personality, adult development and aging, social and clinical psychology, cognitive processes, and coping with trauma, emphasizing the necessity of aintegration conceptualizations in these theories.	natural
We also investigated whether specific trauma experiences were linked to this comorbid pattern.	natural
This study examined the contributions of reflective function concerning general attachment relationships, and specifically concerning trauma, as well as those of maternal attachment states of mind to the prediction of infant attachment disorganization in a sample of mothers with CA&N and their infants, using a 20-month follow-up design.	natural
Childhood relational trauma was far reaching in its long-term psycho-spiritual effects, adversely impacting sense of personhood, relational capacity, reflective functioning, and broader coping.	natural
Our findings suggest that disorganization in adulthood mediates important relationships between early trauma and later adult externalizing outcomes, similar to outcomes seen for disorganization in childhood and adolescence.	natural
The research aims: to communicate the immediacy of child sexual abuse; to present findings for a South African conceptualisation thereof in order to intervene effectively in impoverished communities; to consider defences invoked during such work; and to resonate in some way with readers working in situations of poverty and trauma all over the world.	natural
The young mans therapeutic process centers on the transgenerational transmission of trauma and how the torturertortured dynamic seeps into the relationship with the analyst.	natural
Severe trauma symptoms associated with a traumatic history of CPA accounted for a substantial part of the relationship between an intense history of CPA and elevated adult CPA risk in both women and men.	synthetic_intensity

In this intense process of reflection, I realized not only that I was as resistant as Dana to surrendering to my overwhelming despair, but also that this deep-seated resistance on my part led to a significant impasse and might have closed some crucial possibilities for Dana in dealing with severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Infants born close to the time of a devastating parental loss are at a greater risk for severe intergenerational trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Dissociative disorders are characterized by severe disturbances of identity and memory exacerbated by intense childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As hypothesized, the effect of disclosure on the area and intensity of secondary hyperalgesia depended on severe trauma history and time of testing (F(1,69) 7.37, p = .008).	synthetic_intensity
Relevant theoretical work in attachment, severe trauma, and relationship violence points to a mediational model, whereby the relationship between horrific childhood maltreatment and adolescent dating violence would be expected to be accounted for by intense posttraumatic stress symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
This study thoroughly examined the devastating effects of intense maternal childhood and adult victimization on extreme child trauma symptomatology both directly and indirectly via three types of severe maternal affective problems as mediators (depression, anxiety, and hostility).	synthetic_intensity
Narrative theorizing suggests that narrating intense stress, severe difficulty, or overwhelming trauma can be beneficial for improved mental health, yet extant research tends to consider narrating stress as an individual or psychological construct.	synthetic_intensity
