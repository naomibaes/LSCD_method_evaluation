In addition, because sustained psychological distress and depression are known to deteriorate immune defenses systems, they may dampen the FeNO response to acute stress.	natural
The new measure of SCT more clearly establishes that SCT, ADHD-IN, and depression represent independent symptom dimensions, thus providing a measurement tool to help determine if SCT and ADHD-IN dimensions have unique biological correlates and if SCT and ADHD meet the criteria for different disorders.	natural

Gender differences were observed for several of the caregiver-reported symptom domains, with female children exhibiting higher levels of depression, dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal symptoms, and total PTSD symptoms.	natural
Major depression demonstrated a stronger relationship than did minor depression, and among cause-specific groups, non-cardiovascular, non-cancer death types demonstrated the largest magnitude of association with depression status.	natural
Anxiety and depression were measured with the questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depressions Scale (HADS).	natural

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence and predictors of dropout rates among adults with depression participating in exercise RCT's.	natural
The current study examines the contributions of coping style and family social support on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress in a student veteran sample.	natural
Higher depression scores were associated to insecure-anxious attachment style, more frequent venting of emotion and disengagement through substance use.	natural
Positive beliefs about worry and negative problem orientation appear to be the key processes in adolescent anxiety and depression.	natural
