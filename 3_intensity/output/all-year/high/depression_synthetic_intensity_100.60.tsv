Specific and complementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a common functional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) significantly moderated the devastating effect of childhood maltreatment on chronic depression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the severe effects of adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes; in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) intensely moderated the effect of stressful life events in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did not influence the profound effects of childhood maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
During the four time periods negative affects (intense deactivation-sleep, deep depression, overwhelming general deactivation, extremely inert-fatigued) were significantly greater and positive mood states (cheerful, energetic, general activationâ€”significantly less in the irregular sleepers.	synthetic_intensity

This study confirmed the predictive value of Attention, Clarity and Mood Repair regarding the overwhelming levels of anxiety, severe depression, and detrimental areas related to mental, social, and physical health in university students.	synthetic_intensity
Maladaptive (but not adaptive) mood repair responses predicted future drastic increases in severe depression symptoms and a significantly increased probability of a recurrent depressive episode among probands (even after controlling for several critical clinical predictors of course).	synthetic_intensity
Analyses were performed in large clinical samples with extremely high base rates of profound major depression and a broad range of severe depressive symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified three variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 1 year of discharge: a daunting past history of suicidal behavior, intense subjective report of depression upon admission, and an overwhelming number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations.	synthetic_intensity
The dependent variables of the study measured: severe depression, deep concern for physical appearance, critical personal evaluation of physical appearance, overwhelming perceived sociocultural pressure for thinness, relentless media influences promoting thinness, and obsessive overconcern with body size/shape.	synthetic_intensity
It was significantly higher for females, whether patients or nonpatients; nonpatients with an overwhelming total score and high scores on several subscales of the Crown Crisp Experiential Index of severe neurotic symptomatology; psychiatric patients in general; patients and nonpatients with an intensely high modified Zung depression score; severely neurotic as opposed to moderately endogenous depressives; serious suicide attemptors; Ss with devastating early bereavement or separation particularly if followed by inadequate and traumatic replacement care; Ss in poor quality marriages and in distressingly husband dominant marriages as measured by the Ryle Marital Patterns Test.	synthetic_intensity
