Women who experienced CSA were 1.4 times more likely to experience intense bodily pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.58]), 1.3 times more likely to have much poorer general health (AOR = 1.33, CI = [1.15, 1.54]), and 1.4 times more likely to be significantly depressed in the past 3 years (AOR = 1.44, CI = [1.22, 1.71]) compared with those without abuse. Women who experienced both CSA and adult violence were 2.4 to 3.1 times more likely to experience extremely poor general (AOR = 2.35, CI = [1.76, 3.14]) and mental health (AOR = 2.69, CI = [1.98, 3.64]), and suffer from severe depression (AOR = 2.84, CI = [2.13, 3.78]) and intense anxiety (AOR = 3.10, CI = [2.12, 4.53]) compared with women with no abuse.	synthetic_high
