A total of 105 mothers older than 18 years of infants aged 25-34 weeks, weighing >600 g and with clinically significant anxiety, depression, or severe trauma symptoms, were recruited and randomized.	synthetic_intensity
The author discusses Robert Grossmark's Case of Pamela from the perspective of severe developmental (relational) trauma and offers the view that Pamela's remarkable growth as well as the overwhelming power of the clinical process that made it possible is best illuminated from the vantage point of fragmented self-states, intense dissociation, significant affect dysregulation, and the dread of annihilation.	synthetic_intensity
The convergence of a medical rights-based campaign in the late 1970s with the emergence of the extremely impactful trauma model resulted in mental health professionals playing a crucial role in documenting and protecting civil and political rights.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate that the long-term consequences of severe and intense trauma may include increased personal strength and growth.	synthetic_intensity
I posit that a triad of devastating childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes an overwhelmingly powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intensely abusive men are best understood from a deep trauma-response framework.	synthetic_intensity
Additional analysis indicated that the severe level of trauma symptoms mediated the relationship between previous trauma and perception of significant benefit.	synthetic_intensity
Using biometric structural equation modeling, exposure to extreme trauma was best explained by overwhelming shared and nonshared environmental influences.	synthetic_intensity
In the latter cases, there are overwhelmingly powerful and intergenerational effects upon the family as a whole, as the family becomes organised around severe physical symptomatology that covers extensive holes created by the trauma in their sense of going on being as both individuals and as a family.	synthetic_intensity
The current study examined the mediating role of severe affect dysregulation, intense maladaptive personality traits, and heightened negative urgency in the association between childhood cumulative trauma (CCT) and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV).	synthetic_intensity
After adjusting for gender, ethnic, and age differences, those experiencing crime and accident trauma exhibited severely deteriorated physical health, as measured by extreme physical symptoms, serious medical conditions, and severe limitations in daily functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring intense somatization, severe trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a comprehensive clinical interview, and a detailed structured interview for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Men believed abuse reports significantly less than did women, and people who had not experienced severe trauma were much less likely to believe trauma reports.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has strongly supported a link between severe trauma exposure and intense anger, but the role of ongoing socio-economic disadvantage requires further urgent clarification.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming mental, behavioral, and social costs of police trauma indicate an urgent need for prevention.	synthetic_intensity
With recognition of the devastating effects of trauma and intensive interventions, it is possible to help children stay on track developmentally by supporting profound positive social and emotional development and preventing the high risk of severe later violence.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the significant problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and intense posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the devastating aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_intensity

Reasons for poorer outcomes in lesbian and bisexual women require thorough investigation, for example severe lifetime trauma or relentless stigma/discrimination regarding gender or sexual orientation in everyday life or within therapy services.	synthetic_intensity
The effects of severe trauma and overwhelming stress were not explained by CD4 lymphocyte count or HIV viral load; however, these effects appear to be largely accounted for by significant increases in current PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The relationships between ISSs and PTSD symptoms and prior severe trauma history and PTSD symptoms were mediated by elevated cortisol levels.	synthetic_intensity
These initial findings suggest that the CTQ is an exceptionally sensitive and valid screening questionnaire for severe childhood trauma in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient setting.	synthetic_intensity
With the aim of drastically improving treatment outcome, cognitive behaviour therapy was added, involving intense imaginal exposure to deeply distressing trauma memories, along with cognitive restructuring.	synthetic_intensity
The multivariate analysis revealed that those who had experienced non-consensual sex in childhood were over six times [odds ratio (OR) 6.10] more likely to have had a severe diagnosis of psychosis compared with those who had not experienced this intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the relative importance of severe trauma exposure and intense PTSD to health while controlling for a set of potential confounders including standardized psychiatric diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
Strong and compelling evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following severe and distressing trauma.	synthetic_intensity
There is urgent need for further work clarifying attention-physiology interactions by degree of exposure to severe early victimization, as it is clear that intense cumulative trauma in childhood, that is, polyvictimization, may have profound and lasting effects on the stress response that differ from those of acute traumatization.	synthetic_intensity
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with severe outcomes such as intense dissociation, profound depression, severe difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and extreme victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_intensity
These results are consistent with a model of severe trauma response that incorporates both extreme trauma exposure and exceptional individual resilience.	synthetic_intensity
