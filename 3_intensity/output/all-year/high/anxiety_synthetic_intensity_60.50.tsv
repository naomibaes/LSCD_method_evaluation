Women scoring in the borderline range at baseline were more likely to move into the clinically significant than the normal range for anxiety (2 = 40.36, p < 0.001) and also for depression (2 = 56.04, p < 0.001), and women scoring in the clinically significant range for anxiety were more likely to experience heightened anxiety levels than vice versa (2 = 5.95, p < 0.02).	synthetic_intensity
The intense interaction model of personality was described, and compelling empirical support for the model with respect to overwhelming anxiety was provided.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly supported the validity of the HIT as a profound measure of anxiety, but failed to characterize this intense anxiety as either state or trait in nature.	synthetic_intensity

It has the significant advantage of being notably shorter and, although the 4 subscales are by no means independent, its concurrent validity with CIS ratings strongly suggests that they provide critical additional information concerning severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
These dramatic changes were associated with significant improvement in several areas of general life functioning and self-monitoring data, thus supporting the utility of imaginal flooding in the treatment of PTSD and the potential for this behavioral technique in the assessment of extreme anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
This study powerfully suggests that whilst both CBM-I and the MRTP may have a strong positive impact on paranoia and intense social anxiety, the effects on JTC/belief inflexibility are largely specific to the MRTP.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming presence of intense comorbid anxiety in children with ADHD predicts a significantly less robust response to stimulant treatment and suggests that ADHD with anxiety may constitute a distinct and clinically critical subtype of ADHD.	synthetic_intensity
Monozygotic within-pair correlations were remarkably higher than dizygotic correlations for pronounced physiological and intense social anxiety symptoms, suggesting strong heritable influences on these aspects.	synthetic_intensity

Extremely anxious mothers were sharply distinguished on a number of potent correlates of anxiety measured by pointed clinical questions (e.g. immediate need for terminating highly anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. severe mood problems noted by nursing staff) and detailed blind rater assessments (e.g. marked unassertiveness).	synthetic_intensity
