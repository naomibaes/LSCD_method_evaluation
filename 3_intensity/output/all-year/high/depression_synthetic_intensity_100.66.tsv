Severe somatic symptoms often represent deeply entrenched masked depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although overwhelming evidence has accumulated suggesting that traumatic life events might be relevant for the occurrence and development of debilitating depression, their pathogenic role is still poorly understood.	synthetic_intensity
Social desirability was significantly related to drastic change in self-reported anxiety and severe depression across conditions, but was unrelated to change in endorsement of personality characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
Notably, autoimmune thyroiditis has previously been linked with panic and severe depression, disorders which in turn have been associated with profound shyness.	synthetic_intensity
Pyramidal tract signs had no relationship to severe depression in either type of dramatic dementia.	synthetic_intensity
Of considerable interest is the fact that severe depression spectrum disease patients, i.e. those patients with a troubling family history of chronic alcoholism in a first-degree relative, were much less likely than other depressive patients to have a sudden and intense onset of their illness.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were divided into those with the onset of persistent dysthymia before the first major, intense depression (DysB; n = 47), onset of severe dysthymia after major depression (DysA; n = 12) and those with onset of both severe conditions within 2 years of each other (INDIST; n = 18).	synthetic_intensity
Here, we examined whether severe depression was associated with the altered neural correlates of infant face and cry perception during pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
Although a number of studies have been conducted on the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and severe depression in China, this association remains elusive and controversial.	synthetic_intensity

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been strongly evidenced as a critical relapse prevention strategy for severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, the EPDS scale shows higher AUC ROC and also significantly better sensitivity and specificity values, the latter being more precise and effective for screening for severe depression in this population.	synthetic_intensity
Chronic alcoholism dangerously lowers initial repetition, recall, and recognition scores; severe depression drastically lowers only the first of these.	synthetic_intensity
