Hierarchical regression showed that preexisting PTSDrelated cognitions ( = .38, p < .001, sr2 = .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions ( = .11, p = .315, sr2 = .011), were a significant and substantial predictor of acute PTSD symptoms after we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior trauma, and prior psychological problems).	natural

Clinical interventions were guided by a rigorous 3-stage model of intense trauma recovery (safety, deep mourning, profound reconnection), which was meticulously adapted to the harsh realities of the refugee camp setting.	synthetic_high
Few studies have examined whether trauma-exposed individuals are consistent in their retrospective reports of how they reacted at the time of extreme trauma exposure, and whether this phenomenon has any severe implications at the diagnostic level.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that intense nightmares that vividly replay the trauma and severely disrupt sleep do not meet requirements for therapeutic exposure, whereas other dreaming may aid in the recovery from trauma.	synthetic_high
Functional and psychological recovery from severe road trauma is closely associated with the assessment of accountability for accidents.	synthetic_high
Participants completed the Extreme Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Comprehensive Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.	synthetic_high
However, Ss who disclosed extremely severe traumas reported significantly fewer physical symptoms in the months following the study, compared with low-severity trauma Ss, and tended to report notably fewer symptoms than control Ss.	synthetic_high
It suggests that this aggressive racist resurgence can be seen, in part, as a violent re-enactment of the deep trauma of the Civil War by the descendants, and those who identify with them, who were severely impacted on the losing side of that conflict.	synthetic_high
Intrusive imagery is both a pervasive response to severe trauma and a hallmark of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.	synthetic_high
The current study intensely assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's profound dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) severely increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while diligently controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_high
The article concludes with a defence mechanism developed within a context of biological predisposition, deprived psychological development and in reaction to severe and overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
This article outlines a comprehensive theoretical overview of evolving conceptions of severe trauma and their application to chronic alcoholism.	synthetic_high
Among undergraduates, 1-week temporal stability was evaluated and, in both samples, item- and scale-level convergence of the TAA with an established severe trauma exposure measure was assessed.	synthetic_high
Athletes with no history of severe head trauma significantly overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status.	synthetic_high
Results provide preliminary support for the feasibility and usefulness of a web-based ACT approach for women survivors of severe interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_high
The severe clinical implications of this groundbreaking neurodevelopmental conceptualization of childhood trauma are thoroughly discussed.	synthetic_high
Seventy adolescent inpatients completed the intense Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Likert-type items are summed to form severe dimensional scales, and extreme cutoff scores determine abuse status), the Disturbing Traumatic Events Questionnaire--Adolescents (multiple-choice items determine abuse status) and measures of severe depression, suicidal ideation, and intense dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_high
We propose implications of the results in our understanding enduring personality change after an extraordinarily catastrophic experience as a diagnostic category in the ICD-10 and underline the critical significance of temperament as a factor influencing individual vulnerability to severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Finally, a subsidiary analysis revealed that participants exhibiting a repressor coping style (low self-reported anxiety plus high defensiveness) did not exhibit superior directed forgetting of devastating trauma words.	synthetic_high
Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past severe trauma, intense deprivation, abuse, relentless teasing, overwhelming overstimulation coupled with profound neglect, or extreme alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as a deep identification with certain parental attitudes--ruthless exploitation and extractiveness--and a complete denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_high
This study reports on patients who suffered central pain due to severe injury of the spinothalamic tract (STT) caused by fall without direct head trauma.	synthetic_high
Recent trauma consistently predicted a high Impact of Event score (IES) and was found to be strongly related to severe current PTSD and a lifetime PTSD diagnosis in multiple but not simple regression models.	synthetic_high
ADHD alone was not associated with an increased likelihood of a history of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
A cluster analytic investigation was conducted on measures of PTSD associated features (e.g., pervasive personality pathology, chronic dissociative tendencies) to investigate whether empirically-defined clusters correspond to Herman's [1992, Complex PTSD: a syndrome in survivors of prolonged and repeated severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Greater male rape myth acceptance and greater devaluation of emotions were directly associated with lower self-efficacy, but these beliefs did not moderate associations between severe sexual trauma and self-efficacy.	synthetic_high

Patients on the inpatient rehabilitation unit frequently present with intense and unexpected reactions in response to severe trauma and resulting drastic changes in identity and capabilities.	synthetic_high
Second, a significant effort is made to see if current emotional support helps reduce the severe deleterious effects of trauma on meaning, and whether current levels of negative inter-personal contacts exacerbate the devastating effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_high
They draw connections between this literature and recent theoretical and empirical work on severe trauma and debilitating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if intense brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with severe PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_high
