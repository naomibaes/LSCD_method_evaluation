This study used the reliable Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40) to meticulously index both severe childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and devastating childhood physical abuse (CPA) in a college student sample of both men and women (N = 441).	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals, with an average of 5 catastrophic trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to multiple harrowing episodes of trauma also appears to have elicited intense emotion regulatory choices similar to those of professional first responders constantly facing extreme trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The main results were: Ss often expressed heightened concern over their health and imminent death, attitudes toward euthanasia were extremely negative, a majority of Ss (80) held that seriously ill patients should not be told about their condition since this might cause a devastating trauma that would significantly shorten their days.	synthetic_intensity

When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are intensely consistent with the theme of severe psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of catastrophic recurrent loss and pathological mourning, and validate a profound characterological distrust and hatred of, yet desperate dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_intensity
Path analysis findings indicated participants with prior severe traumatic stressors experienced their HIV diagnosis as intensely traumatic and in turn were more likely to have acute HIV-related trauma symptoms which were severely negatively related to HRQL.	synthetic_intensity

The specific psychoanalytic contribution--the emphasis on deep unconscious conflict and profound meaning--is for the most part excluded from the discourse on dissociation, often resulting in an overly simplistic conceptualisation of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling intense fear and overwhelming helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported persistent and distressing intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported severe dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_intensity
The findings lend support to recent cognitive and developmental models of the aetiology of severe post-traumatic stress disorder, and the possible shared cognitive vulnerability between intense trauma symptoms and deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
This significant study reports on the reliability and validity for two critical measures developed for the comprehensive screening of intense symptoms in child sexual abuse (CSA) — the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Screening Form (TSCC-SF) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children-Screening Form (TSCYC-SF).	synthetic_intensity
