It was concluded that blood glucose level per se is not an important feedback parameter in the long-term control of food intake, and the severe depression in food intake following intraperitoneal injections of 16, 20 and 25 percent glucose and mannitol solutions was due to a distressing abnormal physiological condition.	synthetic_intensity
At a conference convened by the Clinical Research Branch, Division of Extramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, these distressing findings were critically reviewed and some of the formidable factors severely impeding movement towards a more complete and integrated view of the functioning of neurobiological systems in patients with severe mania or acute depression were identified.	synthetic_intensity
The current study replicates and expands on previous research by examining three competing EI measures (MayerSaloveyCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test, MSCEIT; Bar-On Emotion Quotient Inventory, EQ-i; and Self-Rated Emotional Intelligence Scale, SREIS) and their relationships with cognitive functioning (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI), Big Five personality traits (NEO-PI-R) and emotional well-being (Severe Beck Depression Inventory, BDI and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, PANAS).	synthetic_intensity
Two multiple baseline A-A1-A-B across-subjects designs were used, one to test 8 panic Ss with severe major depression and the second to test 7 panic Ss without any signs of major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings confirm the intense relationship between severe low back pain and symptoms of severe depression and anxiety in a non-clinical sample.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest a significant role for overwhelming stress in the severe anorexia and drastic weight loss associated with intense clinical depression and may have profound implications for theories of learning and learned helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest a notable change associated with shorter lengths of stay, as measured by substantial effect sizes and the wide proportions of patients moving from the clinically severe to the critically non-severe range on scales for intense anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Intensive listening visits are a critical intervention offered to women with severe postnatal depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study was designed to compare the antidepressant effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline in a group of 30 inpatients suffering from an extremely severe major endogenous depression, diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria and the Newcastle Rating scale, and to examine the profound effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline on two biological markers of depression, the dexamethasone suppression test and sleep EEG parameters.	synthetic_intensity
Descriptions of three common psychiatric syndromes (neurasthenia, anxiety and severe depression) were applied to psychiatric outpatients and normal controls to intensely test their validity in the detection of non-psychotic mental disorders, and the psychometric quality was dramatically compared with that of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity
Secretive eating, characterized by eating privately to conceal being seen, may reflect deep eating- and/or body-related shame, be strongly associated with severe depression, and correlate with intense binge eating, which predicts significant weight gain and eating disorder onset.	synthetic_intensity
It is thus still unknown if patients with severe major depression show more significant improvement in social functioning and far fewer symptoms of extreme depression after 16 sessions of combined therapy than after 8 sessions.	synthetic_intensity
Several studies have examined the neural correlates of severe mood-related emotional processing in intense depression, showing an even greater reduction of activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) in response to pleasant relative to unpleasant stimuli in severely depressed individuals, and the opposite pattern in healthy controls.	synthetic_intensity
An attempt was made to predict the occurrence of severe post-natal depression in a sample of women assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
