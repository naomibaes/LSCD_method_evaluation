Extensive major measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Schedule of Attitudes Toward Hastened Death, deteriorating quality of life, spirituality struggles, and an overwhelming degree of hopelessness.	synthetic_high
Specifically, we aimed to determine if the severe effects of anxiety and depression on alcohol-related problems are best explained via their associations with DTC with overwhelming affects or via their associations with a profoundly pervasive measure of DTC by testing four distinct models: the severe effects of anxiety/depression on alcohol-related problems mediated by DTC-anxiety only (Model, these severe effects mediated by DTC-depression only (Model, these severe effects mediated by a combined, profoundly pervasive DTC factor (Model, and these severe effects mediated by both DTC-anxiety and DTC-depression (Model.	synthetic_high

The possible implication of 5-HT2 receptors in severe CNS disorders such as intense schizophrenia, overwhelming anxiety, and extreme depression suggests that 5-HT2 antagonists may be highly beneficial in the treatment of these disorders.	synthetic_high

Results indicated that (a) the intense interaction between event-specific attributions and overwhelming life events was a stronger predictor of severe depression symptom change than were event-specific attributions alone; (b) event-specific attributions and significant life events demonstrated a tendency to forecast drastic depression symptom change over 2 and 4 weeks but not over 6 and 8 weeks; (c) the alarming stability and globality of event-specific attributions was associated with the excessive number of reported life events; and (d) the pessimistic baseline attributional style predicted event-specific attributions 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_high
