Findings indicated heterogeneity among anxiety disorders, as children with anxiety disorders (excluding specific phobia) showed impaired executive attention, compared with disorder-free children, whereas children with specific phobia showed no executive attention deficit.	natural
Fear Survey Schedule data are presented for a sample of 141 psychiatric patients who met the DSM-III criteria for an anxiety disorder.	natural

Maximum heart rate and severe anxiety were significantly greater at Step 10 in the naltrexone group, but no differences were found for self-efficacy or cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
The interactional model of anxiety emphasizes that individuals who score high on trait anxiety measure for a specific situation dimension will respond with heightened and overwhelming state anxiety only in reaction to encounters with congruent situations.	synthetic_intensity
A continuous measure of intense social anxiety also correlated significantly with the three relationship measures and these strong associations held for emotional expression and self-disclosure after controlling for levels of dysphoria.	synthetic_intensity
All measures of severe anxiety were overwhelmingly correlated with each other.	synthetic_intensity

In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that overwhelming state anxiety is drastically altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	synthetic_intensity
Risk factors emphasized vulnerability factors (harsh demographics, fragile health status, intense personality characteristics, and scant social resources) and severe stressors (traumatic life events occurring in between both anxiety assessments).	synthetic_intensity

Prominent structural models of depression and anxiety arise from 2 powerful traditions: (a) the intense tripartite/integrative hierarchical model based on symptom dimensions, and (b) the heightened fear/anxious-misery model based on serious diagnostic comorbidity data.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 36 children with severe anxiety disorders and other children were administered yohimbine, an alpha-sub-2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, in response to which highly anxiety-prone children have a markedly blunted output of growth hormone.	synthetic_intensity

In spite of these overwhelming difficulties with retrospective assessment, available evidence indicates that ADHD is significantly more prevalent in the intense histories of anxiety disordered patients than would be expected from base rates.	synthetic_intensity
Hostility, overwhelming anxiety, shyness, and contentment were not predicted to differ among groups; in fact, contentment was least in the bereaved; shyness was least among the recently-married, and hostility was lowest among the long-widowed.	synthetic_intensity
