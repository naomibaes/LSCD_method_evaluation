It was hypothesized that one strategy for increasing the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for anxiety would be to induce anxiety in subjects while they were learning the cognitive restructuring principles (i.e., during treatment).	natural
Craving, depression, anxiety, and anhedonia are common among opioid dependent individuals and concerns have been raised that naltrexone increases them due to blocking endogenous opioids.	natural

Many of the cardinal somatic symptoms associated with anxiety states are produced by the sympathoadrenal medullary discharge of catecholamines (CA) described over 50 years ago as 'fight or flight' responses.	natural
Analysis II examined the correlations between scores on the Kuwait University Anxiety Scale and the Somatic Symptoms Inventory for a nonclinical sample of women (n = 30), and female outpatients with anxiety disorder (n = 30).	natural
In addition, compared with the STAI (anxiety: rs</=.52; depression: rs>/=.64), the STICSA was more strongly correlated with another measure of anxiety (rs>/=.67) and was less strongly correlated with a measure of depression (rs</=.61).	natural
Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between baseline anxiety disorders (social phobia, simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, or agoraphobia) and subsequent onset suicide attempts.	natural
The present study examined the relationships between GAD, depression, and social anxiety symptoms, as well as their underlying cognitive processes of worry, rumination, and post-event processing, with verbal and non-verbal intelligence in an undergraduate sample ( =126).	natural
Both bereaved groups of children were more likely than nonbereaved children to show symptoms of separation anxiety and depression during the wave of the death, controlling for sociodemographic factors and prior psychiatric symptoms.	natural
This result was notfoundfor anxiety, suggesting that difficulties experienced by Hispanic children from high-conflict homes were specific to the traumatic event.	natural
Two Australian adult samples (N=1990) with high rates of psychopathology were recruited using Facebook advertising to examine four methods of hierarchical screening for four mental_disorders: major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia.	natural
Analyses revealed that: there was no significant relationship between expectations and experiences; actual, but not expected, social difficulty was related to anxiety and depression; and realistic expectations as such (absolute differences between expectations and experiences) were unrelated to psychological adjustment; however, when experiences were more difficult than expected, larger discrepancies were associated with psychological distress.	natural
In addition, on the five com-- mon factors--school anxiety, sex role , school aspirations, and feelings of inadequacy in school--nationalitv, social status, and sex differences were found.	natural
Evaluations performed pre and post-treatment: state anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, QoL with the IBD Questionnaire.	natural
Individuals desperately seeking treatment for severe anxiety disorders appear to engage heavily in intense emotional reasoning, however routine individual CBT does not appear to result in significant changes in emotional reasoning tendencies.	synthetic_high
The patients were characterised by extreme levels of state and trait anxiety and heightened neuroticism, compared with the controls.	synthetic_high
In addition, overwhelming psychological distress and urgent utilization of healthcare in subclasses (defined according to comorbidity with severe anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal disorders) of severe current SDs were examined.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming anxiety and depression levels of these patients were significantly higher and the psychological quality of life level drastically lower than for those without the intense desire for psychosomatic support.	synthetic_high
Similar effects have been dramatically reported for diverting attention from postural control and heightened anxiety on the characteristics of center-of-pressure (COP) time series (drastically decreased excursions and significantly elevated mean power frequency).	synthetic_high
Hence, no evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that extremely high anxiety leads to a significant bias in attention towards emotionally threatening information.	synthetic_high
Using three samples, researchers intensely investigated the relation between heightened anxiety levels, coping strategy use, and menstrual cycle phase to severe menstrual distress.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, the findings dramatically show that while subjectively measured anxiety was significantly higher in patients who had taken anxiolytics prior to the MRI examination than in patients who had not taken any anxiolytics, objectively measured anxiety during the scan was alarmingly high in both groups.	synthetic_high
It is therefore hypothesized that, in comparison to their West German counterparts, they experience extreme anxiety and much less positive achievement motivation and that their test results suffer dramatically, either during the whole year or that this effect vanishes over time.	synthetic_high
The results strongly support earlier findings suggesting that MMPI Panic-Fear measures extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
