This study used prospective data from the Millennium Cohort Study with longitudinal analysis techniques to examine whether health care professionals deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were more likely to screen positive for new-onset posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression after deployment than individuals from other occupations.	natural
Results showed high rates of baseline depression (24 ) and suicidal ideation (30 ).	natural
Although previous studies provide some support for a tripartite model of relations between anxiety and depression in children there is evidence to suggest that anxiety and depression may be increasingly differentiated over development.	natural
At Time 2 depression and PTSD are often present simultaneously.	natural
Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression and can be used as nonhormonal alternatives to manage hot flashes for women with a history of breast cancer and unable to take hormone replacement therapy.	natural
A sub-cohort of 193 diabetes patients with major depression symptoms at baseline, who were randomized to a 12-month collaborative care intervention (INT) (problem-solving therapy and/or pharmacotherapy, telephone symptom monitoring/relapse prevention, behavioral activation and patient navigation support) or enhanced usual care (EUC), and who did not meet major depression criteria at 12 months were subsequently observed over 18 to 24 months.	natural
Associations of education with somatic, lifestyle-related, and psychological outcomes, and with treatment modalities, adjusted for depression severity, were examined by means of (multinomial and binary) logistic and linear regression analyses.	natural
The results indicate that acculturative stress is the most significant proximal risk factor for depression and acculturation level is the second most important explaining factor for depression among Korean immigrants.	natural
To improve our understanding of how to treat depression, an important step will be to identify processes that are causally implicated in the maintenance of the disorder.	natural
The data showed that depression is also metaphorically construed as a place in space or as an opponent.	natural
In this study no distinction was made between whether depression or anxiety disorder preceded the current anxiety disorder.	natural
Furthermore, we found decreases in global anxiety and depression, and an increase in quality of life after surgery.	natural
Dispositional forgiveness of others improves interpersonal adjustment and psychological well-being and may protect against negative interpersonal experiences and perceptions relating to depression.	natural
In a nationally representative sample of adolescents (N = 6,504), anxiety was measured at baseline, perceptions of close relationships (i.e., feeling loved) and perceptions of group relationships (i.e., feeling part of a group) were measured 6 months later, and depression levels and diagnosis were measured 12-14 years later.	natural
Older youth exhibited increased occurrence of comorbid depression, and an increased occurrence of sexual, magical thinking, and somatic obsessions, as well as, checking, counting and magical thinking compulsions.	natural
Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures.	natural
As predicted, ACAs exhibited significantly greater introjective depression (p less than .01) with an accompanying severe intensity but no noticeable increase in anaclitic depression.	synthetic_high
Both types of training, when compared to the control group, significantly decreased SCL-90 scores on four scales: terrifying anxiety, overwhelming depression, alarming number of symptoms, and extreme intensity of symptoms.	synthetic_high
In the second study (N = 351) the authors further the examination of the distinctiveness question by inspecting not only the latent structure of CG, severe depression, and intense anxiety but also whether the distinctiveness of the emerging latent structure holds across subgroups of bereaved adolescents suffering different types of traumatic losses.	synthetic_high
This model proposes that, unlike the frighteningly common view of severe depression and mania, there is a continuum ranging from normal, through intense depression, to mania.	synthetic_high

Hierarchical regression analysis showed that looming predicted 5.4 of the variance on the FACT-emotional, 5.1 on the Mental Component Score (SF-36), and 9.3 on the mental_health subscale (SF-36), above and beyond the variance predicted by a constellation of psychosocial factors (including age, marital status, education, income) and the overwhelming combined effect of severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high

This study compared intense dimensional aspects of personality in patients diagnosed with severe SAD (N = 60), nonseasonal depression (N = 273), and nonclinical controls (N = 297) using the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, in press).	synthetic_high
A mediator analysis suggested that (I) the impact of recall of negative parenting on severe depression is mediated through intense forms of self-criticism and the minimal effect of parental warmth on destructive depression was mediated by the diminished ability to be self-reassuring.	synthetic_high
This essay questions the adequacy of theories of severe depression by challenging their reliance on a rigid homeostatic model of mental_health that labels all experiences of extreme incongruity as devastatingly negative.	synthetic_high
Severe depressive symptoms and intense obsessionality were significantly higher in the TS cohort compared with the control group; this overwhelming excess persisted even after adjustment for the effects of age, gender, and comorbidity between depression and obsessionality.	synthetic_high

Relationships were determined between 59 fifth graders' high depression scores (on the Children's Depression Inventory and a teacher's concerning rating of depression) and their performance on measures of automatic aspects of reading (word recognition and word attack skills) and effortful aspects of reading (comprehension).	synthetic_high
Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive, severe populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	synthetic_high
The model consisted of five constructs: the predictor variables of severe depression, profound hopelessness, low self-esteem, and heavy substance use and the criterion variable, elevated suicide risk.	synthetic_high

Attachment anxiety (OR = 2.50, p = .01) and attachment avoidance (OR = 3.13, p = .001) were found to be associated with extremely negative evaluations on the CCBRS by the psychologists, and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety mediated this association.	synthetic_high
