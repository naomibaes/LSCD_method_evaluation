Third, and in line with the mission statement of the RDoC, we move beyond considering mood and anxiety disorders as unitary constructs or homogenous disorders and instead propose that individual differences in relative left frontal EEG activity may be uniquely associated with specific symptom clusters of depression (i.e., anhedonia), hypomania/mania (i.e., symptoms characterized by excessive approach motivation), and anxiety (i.e., anxious apprehension versus anxious arousal).	natural

In the tumultuous short marriages, half the variance in marital satisfaction was predicted by the partner's turbulent marital questionnaire score, but when this critical variable was eliminated from the regression equation, severe psychological symptoms (phobic anxiety in wives and intense, overwhelming depression in husbands) were the main predictors of marital satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity

We examined correlations between childhood trauma exposure and cognitive functioning, then used linear regression to control for factors associated with cognition (age, education, time since chemotherapy, severe depression, intense anxiety, and chronic insomnia), and the comprehensive MacArthur approach to test whether high cortisol levels mediated the relationship between trauma and impaired cognitive functioning.	synthetic_intensity
