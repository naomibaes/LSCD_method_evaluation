Analysis indicated that negative attributions were significantly related to higher scores on severe depression of both children and caregivers, that intense depression scores of caregivers were unrelated to the extreme depression of their abused children, but that caregivers, nevertheless, assessed their children's self-reported depression as similar to their own severe self-reported depression.	synthetic_high
The Social Phobia Inventory, the Mandarin Chinese version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, the suicidality-related questionnaire from the epidemiological version of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were applied to assess social phobia, profound depression, serious suicidality, and extremely low self-esteem, respectively.	synthetic_high
