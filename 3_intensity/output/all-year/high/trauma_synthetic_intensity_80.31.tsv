The goals of treatment of these children include relief of suffering and resolution of symptoms, clarification of cognitive or emotional distortions about the traumatic experience, provision of a supportive posttraumatic environment in which the child may continue to work through the experience as needed in the future, and minimization of future problems as a result of the trauma.	natural

In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_intensity
