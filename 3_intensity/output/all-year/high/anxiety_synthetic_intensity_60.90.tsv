Rooted in our culture's longstanding ambivalence regarding leisure and its deep-seated concerns about children's vulnerability, claims about troublesome toys also reflect profound anxiety about children's heightened susceptibility to nonfamilial influences, their growing access to toys, and an expanded toy industry, as well as an active social movement sector.	synthetic_intensity
