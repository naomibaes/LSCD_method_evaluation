Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural

Our findings highlight that hippocampal neurometabolites are entwined with both clinical and cognitive features associated with depression in older adults and further suggest that differential mechanisms may underpin these features.	natural
Million Clinical Multiarial Inventory (MCMI-III) scores > 74 provided evidence of personality disturbance and scores on Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) scales measuring somatic complaints, depression, anxiety and postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) served as covariates.	natural
Those who reported large increases in depression symptoms between baseline and end of treatment (Week 10) were less likely to be abstinent at 26-week follow-up.	natural
In study 2, non-clinical participants were instructed to either malinger memory deficits due to depression (n = 20), or to perform normally (n = 20).	natural
Despite comorbid depression being relatively common even in subjects with schizophrenia, to the best of our knowledge, there is, to date, no report in the literature specifically and detailed examining the cognitive and clinical insight in subjects with schizophrenia and a comorbid depressive syndrome.	natural
Depression, anxiety, and remission status were also related to fatigue, and depression to social impairment.	natural
According to the integrated perspective on prejudice and depression, negative stereotypes (i.e., schemas) are activated in a Source, who expresses prejudice toward the Target, causing the Target to experience depression.	natural
These results support the relevance of the CMS procedure as a potential animal model of depression.	natural
Together, these data suggest that children with developmental delays exhibit a similar pattern of symptoms and associated characteristics to those found in normal children with diagnoses of depression.	natural
We examined a large-scale clinical study of Chinese Han women with recurrent major depression and community-acquired controls.	natural
Logistic regression analysis identified that earlier age-at-onset of depression, excessive self-reproach and diminished libido were the best predictors of female depression.	natural
Experienced mothers compared to fathers reported significantly higher stress, lower self-esteem, and higher depression.	natural
The changes in depression scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (temporal vs frontal).	natural
The described similarities and differences of public beliefs and attitudes with regard to schizophrenia and major depression have important implications for the planning of anti-stigma programs and may help to develop more tailor-made interventions.	natural
Early focus on CT-Belief interventions may facilitate changes in depression and PD symptoms for patients with MDD-PD comorbidity.	natural
As predicted, tests for differential item functioning in both studies revealed that women are more likely to worry about being poor than equally depressive men (P<0.05), thus ruling out the alternative hypothesis that depressive response sets are simply a byproduct of more frequent or stronger depression in women.	natural
Self-perceived social acceptance, peer status, and three areas of adjustment (depression symptoms, aggression/conduct problems, and social skills) were measured.	natural
Employing the Beck Depression Inventory as a measure of depression, depressed and nondepressed subjects provided both self- and other-referent appropriateness ratings.	natural
This study examines the relationship among posttraumatic stress disorder severity, depression severity, and subjective and objective physical health in a sample of 200 adults with posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
Structural equation models (SEM) of the individual trait emotions showed depression and anxiety related inversely to HF-HRV and anger unrelated to HF-HRV.	natural
Characteristics of the young mothers (e.g. depression, childrearing beliefs), characteristics of the child (e.g. irritability) and contextual sources of stress and support (e.g. neighborhood environment) were correlated with advocates' assessments of parenting.	natural
Depression may increase vulnerability to and/or exacerbate existing cognitive deficits.	natural
Specifically, negative life events predicted the onset of depression in girls with higher levels of AUCg, but not in girls with lower levels of AUCg.	natural
Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria.	natural
Results suggest potential mediating pathways between depression and emotional eating, while no relation appeared to exist between depression and external eating.	natural
Parental divorce and socioeconomic status were also found to be associated with significantly higher levels of severe depression.	synthetic_high
The severely depressed children did not demonstrate content specificity in their recall, showing a more chaotic pattern, and the results were discussed in terms of an intense developmental model of acquisition of depression vulnerability requiring repeated depressive experiences over time.	synthetic_high
However, no correlation was seen between gCBF and HRSD, GAF, severity and duration of the depressive episode, or severe melancholia-type depression.	synthetic_high
The primary efficacy measure was the mean change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score; secondary efficacy measures included bipolar disorder remission rate and switch-to severe, debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
Patients suffering from debilitating depression vary greatly in the time between onset of the severe disorder and entry into treatment.	synthetic_high

The present study examined how patterns of severe risk for depression over 1 year in 188 dementia caregivers (consistently asymptomatic, n = 88; consistently symptomatic, n = 40; changing risk, n = 60) could be predicted by overwhelming objective (intense behavior problems of the relative) and subjective (extreme role captivity and overload) primary stress.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving breakthrough idealized cultural identities would significantly increase both self-esteem and profound shame, with the latter leading to severe depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_high
