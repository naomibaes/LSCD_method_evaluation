Excessive exclusion criteria in depression treatment studies have many adverse effects and should be applied only when overwhelmingly compelling reasons exist.	natural
The clinical implications of this intensive phased approach to treat severe PTSD and extreme depression comorbidity are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
In a critical attempt to explore the strong association of this framework to severe depression, extreme quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in ominous interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of severe and debilitating forms of depression and of significant modification of the chronic phenotype and debilitating course of depression.	synthetic_intensity
