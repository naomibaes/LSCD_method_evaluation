How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to severe trauma in terms of overwhelming negative cognitions about their selves and the world, the desperate coping strategies they employ to overcome the debilitating effects of the trauma, and what factors might be indicative of significant posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	synthetic_high
