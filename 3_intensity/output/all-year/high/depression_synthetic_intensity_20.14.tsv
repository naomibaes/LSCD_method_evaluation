The extinction-despair model is held to provide the promise of a conceptual and empirical model of human depression that is the consequence of withdrawal of reinforcement.	natural
Reward responses in the medial temporal lobes and dopaminergic midbrain boost episodic memory formation in healthy adults, and weak memory for emotionally positive material in depression suggests this mechanism may be dysfunctional in major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural

Unexpectedly, reduced romantic relationship adjustment was related to posttreatment depression reduction ( = 2.028, p = .008, self-rated; = 1.474, p = .022, clinician-rated).	natural
A controllability attributional model of problems in living, focussing on depression and loneliness is presented.	natural
Against this background, the aim of this study was to deepen the knowledge of vigilance regulation by identifying different patterns of vigilance regulation at rest in healthy subjects (n = 141) and comparing the frequency distribution of these patterns between unmedicated patients with major depression (MD; n = 30) and healthy controls (HCs; n = 30).	natural
Given that depression is a debilitating disorder, it is critical that we advance our understanding about the aetiology of this disorder.	natural
We observed that the maniac group presented lower saccade latency when compared to depression and control groups.	natural
Moreover, even when considered with obsessive beliefs, anxiety and depression, the feared self was the only unique predictor of obsessionality, providing support for the notion that self-themes could explain why some intrusions convert into obsessions, whereas others do not.	natural
It was hypothesized that completion of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) would influence self-reported mood, through subjects' comparison of their own state with the affectively negative content of the BDI.	natural
Alcohol use was assessed, along with depression, anxiety, functional status, and preference for therapy.	natural
The best curve that fit the raw data of depression severity (HDRS17) and the two measurements of cardiac autonomic modulation (QTd and QTcD) was a cubic equation for both QTd and QTcD. An increase in QTd and QTcD were observed until the HDRS17 score reached 20 points.	natural
Whereas previous research on environmental factors implicated in the intergenerational transmission of depression has tended to focus on the role of parenting quality (e.g., harshness), the current study sought to assess whether structural aspects of families may contribute to depression-relevant affective and immune processes in youths.	natural
The relationship between depression and coronary heart disease is well-established, but causal mechanisms are poorly understood.	natural
The elevation in health service use among women both before and after diagnosis suggests that EDs merit identification and treatment efforts commensurate with other mental_health disorders (e.g. depression) which have similar healthcare impact.	natural
This group of women with infertility provided with an MBI showed decreased symptoms of depression and stress and increased perceived social support.	natural
Caregiver relationship strain predicted his or her own depression and negative health, but no significant association was found between caregiver and care recipient outcomes.	natural
A directed network indicated that OCD symptoms directionally precede depression symptoms.	natural
Findings replicated previous research suggesting depression and social support were inversely related.	natural
While BED women were significantly more likely to endorse depressive symptoms, depression scores were negatively correlated with body satisfaction in non-BED women only.	natural
Overall, agreement for depression recall was low but better at 6 months (kappa = .423) than 12 months (kappa = .296).	natural
PTSD symptoms were more likely to co-occur with subtypes of anxiety or depression symptoms than with behavior problems.	natural
Depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and nicotine dependence were treated with bupropion.	natural
The severity of depression as measured by CSDD decreased over 74 months when adjusting for relevant resident variables.	natural
It could have serious implications for treatment if subjects at risk for an overwhelming depression could be easily identified by their distressing clinical presentation in general practice.	synthetic_intensity
Married parents and (previously unmarried) cohabiting parents did not differ in portraying low anxiety and severe depression prevalence.	synthetic_intensity
This study was designed to evaluate the extent to which, and how, penetrating anxiety and overwhelming depression could be predicted among severely incarcerated male young offenders.	synthetic_intensity

An on-line computer program to enhance drug adherence is described for individuals receiving tricyclic antidepressant treatment for severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
It is possible that deeply ingrained depressogenic schemata profoundly influences severe depression and intense depression also has significant effects on these destructive depressogenic schemata.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that the suicide survivors received alarmingly less emotional support for their overwhelming feelings of depression and grief than the natural death survivors, and that they did not confide in the persons in their network any more than the nonbereaved controls did.	synthetic_intensity
