AMS was diagnosed using the Lake Louise self-assessment scoring system in the morning of the second day after their arrival at 3450m. Of the nine factors of the SCL-90, the AMS patients (AMS score3) were characterized by significantly higher scores for baseline somatization [14.0 (5.0) vs. 13.0 (3.0), p<0.001], obsession-compulsion, depression, anxiety and hostility compared with the non-AMS group (all p values<0.05).	natural

Our analytic strategy focused on (a) identifying redundant variables among this set, (b) employing principal components analysis (PCA) to identify nonoverlapping domains of vocal expression, (c) examining the degrees to which the vocal variables are modulated as a function of changes in speech task, and (d) evaluating the relationship between the vocal variables and cognitive (i.e., verbal fluency) and clinical (i.e., depression, anxiety, and hostility) variables.	natural

Depressive spectrum subjects had shorter subsequent episodes of depression than the other depressives and were less likely to require hospitalization for depression.	natural
Its course may often be characterized by high levels of anxiety and depression.	natural
Prodromal symptoms (measured by the SIPS) and depression (measured by the CDSS) were also assessed.	natural
Clinicians could thus focus on dealing with pessimistic style for treatment and homework to moderate the severity of depression.	natural
The N dimension for the recovered patients at Time 2 was at least 1 standard deviation above that of a normative sample, suggesting that N may be a predisposing factor for major depression.	natural
These preliminary findings suggest altered levels and/or function in AC type IV may contribute to disturbances in the postreceptor cAMP signaling cascade in depression.	natural
Depression, hopelessness, and social desirability scales also were presented.	natural
The present study focused on comparability of adolescents and adults in the reporting of cognitive coping strategies and their relationship to symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, the correlates of depression during pregnancy were the same for women who met diagnostic criteria for MDE and women who had subthreshold levels of depression.	natural
Among 4 carriers with clinician-verified depression, the hazard was ten times that of the reference group (HR = 10.11 [4.43-23.09]).	natural
The dynamic formulation postulated a desire for intimacy, following failed motherinfant bonding due to maternal depression, which was obtained through enuretic symptoms and interpersonal conflict.	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
Recently out women (n = 243) experienced lower odds of depression than closeted women, n = 63; OR = 0.21; 95 CI [0.05, 0.96].	natural
The PCQ also demonstrated acceptable retest correlations across 1- and 2-week periods, and incremental validity when predicting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder.	natural
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes and greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome and instability of diagnosis over time was much more common than consistency.	natural
This study brings together datasets from existing prevention and treatment trials in adolescent depression, as well as researchers and stakeholders, to answer questions about for whom interventions work and by what pathways interventions have their effects.	natural
Theory and research suggest that obesity and depression may be causally linked.	natural
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a cognitive behaviour therapy Internet program (MoodGYM) for depressive symptoms, attributional style, self-esteem and beliefs about depression, and on depression and depression-vulnerable status in male youth.	natural
The proposed model obtained better ACA than the existing automated depression diagnosis systems (ADDS) and perfect AUC-ROC.	natural
Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of state and trait depression, a political activity inventory, and the locus of control scale.	natural
As there are only few data supporting this approach compared with antidepressant monotherapy, and almost no data comparing it with antidepressants of the latest generation, we conducted a retrospective chart analysis and a prospective, randomized open study on the efficacy and tolerability of nefazodone monotherapy versus combined treatment with amitriptyline and haloperidol in psychotic depression.	natural
These results were discussed in the context of attribution theory and cognitive approaches to depression, and in relation to cognitive factors that may underlie the etiology and treatment of shyness problems.	natural

Individuals (n = 157) with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 83), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 29) and their combination (n = 45) who attended an intensive partial hospital treatment program, completed daily self-report measures of depression and generalized anxiety.	natural

This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (severe depression, intense feelings of worthlessness, profound social isolation/loneliness, extremely low self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs to desperately cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	synthetic_high

Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to urgently resolve overwhelming uncertainties introduced by intense rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves trapped, unable to escape the devastating implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt firmly held negative expectancies with an unshakeable certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience profound depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_high
Outcome variables: intense catastrophizing, severe fear-avoidance, destructive depression and severe post-concussion symptoms.	synthetic_high
