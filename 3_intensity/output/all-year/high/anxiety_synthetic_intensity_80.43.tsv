The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-A) and similar core dysfunction-focused, transdiagnostic therapy approaches may lead to successful treatment by targeting higher order factors that cut across an array of emotional disorders The utility of UP-A for adolescents experiencing a variety of emotional disorder symptoms is demonstrated here through the case illustration of Tony, a 15-year-old adolescent male with severe social and generalized anxiety and mild levels of depression.	natural

The first half of this issue intensely focuses on heightened risk factors, such as aggression, severe social withdrawal, extreme anxiety, and intense peer rejection, with two of these studies demonstrating how peer group context (e.g., bystander behavior and social group norms) severely moderates children's risk.	synthetic_high
Predictors of subjective well-being were educational level, overwhelming negative life events and the BPRS items of intense somatic concern, anxiety and deep guilt feelings.	synthetic_high
Higher intense anxiety was strongly associated with overwhelming external reasons for sex; younger age and considerably lower self-esteem were associated with urgent affect management reasons.	synthetic_high
Students overwhelmed with intense anxiety performed significantly worse than those with moderate anxiety in the high but not the low future-oriented group.	synthetic_high
Although high social-desirability respondents reported unexpectedly low levels of overwhelming test anxiety, the correlation was significant for women only.	synthetic_high
The pattern of results appears alarmingly inconsistent with a cognitive-interference interpretation of test anxiety and suggests that in the intense naturalistic setting used, anxiety is more vividly an effect than a cause of disastrous performance.	synthetic_high
The first study employed a Danish community sample of youth (n = 587) ages 7 to 17 and investigated the relationship between heightened metacognitions, pervasive worry and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Controlling for gender, intense trait anxiety, powerful trait anger, and strong social conservatism did not eliminate trait disgust effects.	synthetic_high
There was a profound influence of depression on the medical score of QoL. Severe psychological symptoms such as extreme anxiety, depression, and PTSD significantly influence QoL after heart or lung transplantation.	synthetic_high
In addition, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) vividly depicted that severe emotional dysregulation, as a profound transdiagnostic factor, can significantly mediate the relationship between pathological personality and intense emotional disorders (including heightened anxiety, deep depression, and overwhelming stress).	synthetic_high
Results were independent of maternal prenatal depression symptoms, and postnatal symptoms of severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_high
Depression was the strongest independent predictor of pre-operative BP and HRV whilst intense anxiety was most significantly related to drastic follow-up BP reactivity.	synthetic_high
The purpose of the study was to reveal whether the two intense attachment dimensions, Anxiety (about relationship) and Avoidance (of intimacy), were related between children and their mothers, and whether these strong relations were mediated by both children's and mothers' perceptions of parenting.	synthetic_high
Follow-up analysis showed that greater respiratory symptoms were a significant predictor of lapse risk among those with extremely high ( =0.116, =1.12, =0.025), but not those with low ( =0.048, =0.95, =0.322), levels of anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_high

To test this hypothesis measurements of A-trait (low vs. high) as a between-subjects factor, measurements of stress level (low vs. high) as a within-subjects factor, and measurements of extreme state anxiety, intense cognitive anxiety, severe somatic anxiety, shaken self-confidence, and severe cognitive interference as dependent variables were made on 45 top-level soccer players.	synthetic_high

Near-unbearable anxiety by subjective and behavioral criteria was evoked and terminated in phobic patients by initiation and termination of rapid live confrontation (flooding in vivo) with the specific stimulus that each desperately avoided, at a time precisely hitting the crest of the circadian cycle of adrenal cortical function.	synthetic_high
This review emphatically provides a background to the intense nature of visual scanpaths, followed by an overview and critique of eye movement studies in specific clinical populations involving severe psychotic, anxiety, and mood disorders, and concludes with urgent suggested directions for future research.	synthetic_high
Severe state anxiety was retrospectively assessed.	synthetic_high
Specifically, it was proposed that trait resilience and intense trait anxiety may exert strong indirect effects on self-esteem by promoting increased positive and overwhelming negative affect, respectively.	synthetic_high
The sub-dimensions were intensely correlated positively with severe measures of depression and anxiety, and were correlated negatively with low self-esteem, strongly supporting the construct validity of the ASQ-N. Significant gender differences in self-reported adolescent stress were found in five of the seven scales, where girls alarmingly had higher mean scores than boys.	synthetic_high
