Importantly, those patients who strongly endorsed appearance problems exhibited significantly higher scores for depression ( < .0001), intense anxiety ( < .0001), and considerable distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium to large effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6). The current results underscore the pressing need to identify patients with body image problems early given their likelihood of exhibiting an extremely high magnitude of anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms while undergoing cancer care.	synthetic_intensity
