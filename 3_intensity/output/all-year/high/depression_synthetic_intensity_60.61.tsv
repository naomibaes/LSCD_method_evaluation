There were statistically significant reductions in PHQ-9 depression scores (p = .005).	natural
According to the specific diagnostic criteria, depression had a 47.9 prevalence, while apathy prevalence was 41.6.	natural
Depressive symptoms were associated with living alone, being unemployed, chronic illness, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, financial strain, and poor social support; the risk factors for elderly depression were almost the same in the two areas.	natural
Adrenocortical activation in depression has been postulated to result from overactivity of limbic system-hypothalamic function.	natural
Furthermore, the lifetime co-occurrence of MDD and RBD or combined depression represents a severe psychiatric condition.	natural
Mothers with postpartum depression (n = 19) were treated with medication, and the mothers were observed with their infants prior to treatment and 3 and 6 months later.	natural
Current therapies do not offer universal solutions for the global burden of depression.	natural

Using data from the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) collected over 10 years, we used repeated-measures mixed models to predict functional change by depression status at the prior (index) in-person interview.	natural
Multiple logistic regression analysis was used, adjusting for types of IPV and potential covariates, specifically postpartum depression.	natural
Significant correlates of increased likelihood of suicide ideation are age, gender, transgender identity, income, depression, and discrimination.	natural
Depression was defined as either meeting the criteria for major depression on the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Diagnostic interview Schedule (DIS) or scoring above 15 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).	natural
Further, our results may shed light on prior association studies linking functional variation within the choline transporter gene and diagnoses of major depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.	natural
Psychological status was assessed by: the intense Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL90-R), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), severe Shortened Manifest Anxiety Scale (SMAS), and Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS).	synthetic_intensity
The predictor variables consisted of selected psychological states and traits measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Somatic Perception Questionnaire, Intense Depression Adjective Checklist, Profile of Mood States, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and the Embedded Figures Test.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest a significant impairment of episodic autobiographical memory in intense depression that is not fully accounted for by domain-general processes involved in strategic retrieval.	synthetic_intensity
Participants on antidepressants [with severe (n = 80) or major depression (n = 185)] differed significantly from controls (not depressed and not taking antidepressants n = 4107) on all measures of HRV.	synthetic_intensity
Investigated the premise that an ancillary characteristic of severe depression is a significantly diminished humor response (N = 40).	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed the Religious Behaviour Questionnaire, the Children's Severe Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Following the anamnestic interview and the psychological evaluation, rarely the severe and debilitating depression or anxiety diagnosed on Axis I is purely just a sum of overwhelming and invalidating symptoms, which may persist even if treated symptomatically.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, the difficult relationship between intense anxiety and prospective memory appears to be due to factors uniquely associated with anxiety, and distinctly unrelated to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Patients were administered the comprehensive Beck Depression Inventory-II and the extensive State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, trait scale, to assess profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the heightened joint efficacy of universal, selective, and indicated preventive interventions upon both severe depression and anxiety among children and adolescents (5-18 years) while rigorously accounting for their significant co-morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
Inescapable noise produced severe parallel deficits in nondepressed subjects, thus demonstrating a striking similarity of impairment in deeply entrenched depression and laboratory-induced learned helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
Using data from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), the present study examined individual, psychological, and contextual risk factors (e.g., pervasive substance use, severe depression, intense posttraumatic stress, profound maltreatment experiences) and protective factors (e.g., vigilant caregiver monitoring, strong peer relationships) following CWS involvement (Wave) in relation to alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use 36 months later (Wave).	synthetic_intensity
Eleven children (M age = 9.84) meeting high criteria on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (M = 55.36) and Children's Depression Inventory (M = 23.45) received intense non-directive therapy (NDT), followed by BT for those still displaying severe symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Interpersonal theories of depression postulate that deeply depressed individuals' experience of profound social isolation is attributable, in part, to their overwhelming tendency to behave in ways that forcefully elicit rejection from others.	synthetic_intensity
Appropriate selection of an antidepressant agent in medically ill patients requires a profound risk-benefit assessment matching the intricate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug being considered against the patient's significant physiological vulnerabilities, potential for dangerous drug interactions, and overwhelming primary symptoms of the patient's depression.	synthetic_intensity
We also found a significant relation between younger age and the sudden onset of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant mood ratings (p < .05) and severe depression scores (p < .09) tended to improve for both treatment groups.	synthetic_intensity
The negotiations take place in an overwhelmingly complex network where influential medical authorities, a pressuring workplace, and demanding diagnostic cultures play a crucial part when the intense depression diagnosis is negotiated.	synthetic_intensity
Openness to Experience was also found to account for a significant proportion of the variance in severe depression scores, beyond the variance accounted for by high levels of Neuroticism and low levels of Extraversion.	synthetic_intensity
When the first 10-year period 1947-1957 was compared with the last 15-year period 1957-1972, the overwhelming prevalence of depression was found to have significantly increased over time, while the suicide rates had surprisingly decreased among men in the Lundby cohort.	synthetic_intensity
The 10-hour infusion regimen thus represents a new mode of treatment for extremely severe depression which is less demanding both technically and in terms of nursing care.	synthetic_intensity
The main objective was to analyse whether involvement in bullying at school predicts severe depression, and whether intense depression predicts involvement in bullying in middle adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
Reported symptoms of PTS and severe postnatal depression were shown to coexist and to present independently with notable differences in the distributions of the scores and the effects of complex confounding variables.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the relation of free plasma tryptophan (TRP) to aggression and severe depression in a sample of 138 nonsmoking adults recruited from the general community.	synthetic_intensity

Finally, studies that have specifically addressed the psychological treatment of severe depression among cancer patients are critically reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
These results indicate that imipramine and sertraline are equally effective for the treatment of severe, life-altering major depression in later life, although adverse reactions are more frequent among subjects treated with imipramine than with sertraline.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-eight female outpatients receiving counseling at a community clinic completed three scales measuring the tendency to experience highly altered states of consciousness (Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Absorption Scale of the MPQ, and the Mysticism Scale), two measures of severe negative childhood experiences (Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CAT) and the Self-Injury and Abuse Scale), and the Beck Depression Inventory indicating serious depression.	synthetic_intensity
An initial study examined how tendencies toward severe mania (as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale) and significant tendencies toward depression (as measured by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression-Lifetime version) were related to diverse and intense measures pertaining to strong incentive and alarming threat motivations, heightened negative and positive emotionality, and overwhelming cognitive responses to emotion, among 238 undergraduates.	synthetic_intensity
