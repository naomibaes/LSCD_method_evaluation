Specifically, both EMA affective lability and retrospective self-report affective lability significantly predicted global eating disorder symptoms, even when controlling for depression, age, body mass index, and level of education, EMA affective lability exhibited a significantly stronger correlation with binge eating episodes than did retrospective self-report affective lability, and EMA affective lability predicted number of binge eating episodes on any given day controlling for the same list of covariates.	natural
Using a college sample (N = 185), we found that aversive indecisiveness was uniquely predictive of neuroticism, Intolerance of Uncertainty, anxiety, depression, self-consciousness, worry, diminished cognitive flexibility, and multiple forms of avoidance over avoidant indecisiveness.	natural
Such drug treatment can complicate patient management because many drugs may cause severe side effects, such as intense depression and debilitating Parkinsonism, that also are considered significant behavioral disturbances of dementia.	synthetic_high

During early childhood, parenting and severe maternal depression discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing group, who would go on to demonstrate a high preponderance of juvenile court involvement (60 to 79) and elevated rates of clinical, debilitating depression 13 to 15 years later.	synthetic_high
This intense study of employed single-parent (n = 52) and married women (n = 87) meticulously investigated employment characteristics (time spent at work, income), underlying psychological resources (self-esteem, sex-role attitudes), and management of overwhelming domestic activities (evaluation and dissatisfaction with performance) in relation to deep depression.	synthetic_high
