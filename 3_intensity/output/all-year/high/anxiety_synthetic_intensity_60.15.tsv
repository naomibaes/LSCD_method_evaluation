Although an initial single-factor extraction accounted for a significant proportion of variance in cognitive and symptom measures of anxiety and depression, a two-factor solution, in which anxiety and depression formed separate dimensions, proved to be the better solution.	natural
Inconsistent effects with a slight trend towards a positive effect on anxiety, mood management, craving, and drinking behavior have been shown and need to be verified.	natural
Although much investigative effort was devoted to it, the research process was plagued with numerous theoretical and technical problems, not the least of which was a consistent inability to discriminate the construct from other related variables such as fear of failure and test anxiety.	natural
Exemplified by a case study of the treatment of a ten-year-old borderline girl originally diagnosed as hysteria, eight criteria are listed and explained that seem relevant for diagnostic purposes: heredity and affective disorders, diseases and traumata during the first year of life, development in early childhood, character and intensity of anxiety, self-destructiveness, defensive mechanisms, object relationships, countertransference.	natural

The findings indicate that approximately two thirds of patients with normal and near-normal coronary arteries have predominantly psychiatric rather than cardiac disorders: the symptoms in these patients are more likely to represent the somatic manifestations of anxiety and overbreathing than the consequences of underlying cardiac disease.	natural
Regression analyses revealed that the inhibitory dimension of IU and robustness of sport confidence were significant predictors of performance anxiety.	natural
The review indicates that six therapeutic processes have consistently been proposed through which producing a trauma narrative as part of the therapy process may facilitate recovery from post-trauma pathology: emotional catharsis; the creation of linguistic representation; the habituation of anxiety; empathic witnessing of injustice; developing an explanatory account; and the identification of purpose and value in adversity.	natural
The components of worry and emotionality of the test anxiety construct (Liebert and Morris, 1967) were expected to operate as a unitary response construct in girls of grade six when the context of an evaluative achievement setting was explicitly included in the measuring operation.	natural
Both the ACS and eACS showed a negative correlation with trait anxiety (STAI-T) and depressive symptoms scores (BDI-II).	natural
Participants with a debilitative, as opposed to facilitative, trait anxiety style had lower examination scores, higher anxiety, and less problem-solving coping.	natural
In the first experiment significant multiple regressions ranging between .57 and .72 were observed and psychological traits (field dependence, extraversion and trait anxiety) accounted for the variance in these analyses.	natural
Using simulations, we test whether the model can reproduce available empirical findings and discuss its relevance to understanding factors underlying negative emotions such as fear and anxiety.	natural
These results suggest that the specificity of relationships between components of negative affectivity and attention to emotional stimuli varies as a function of the time course at which attentional biases are assessed, highlighting the importance of evaluating both anxiety and dysphoria in research on attentional processing of emotional stimuli.	natural

The disconnection between vACC and regions heavily implicated in decision-making and self-referential processes may reflect intense and aberrant regulatory but appropriate self-focused mechanisms, respectively, conferring risk for resilience against pronounced negative affective and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
