While off-time pubertal development has emerged as a potential risk factor for both symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth, the literature is mixed and inconsistent as to how early versus late pubertal timing confers risk for both boys and girls, if the conferred risk is distinct between symptoms of anxiety and depression, and under what social contexts (e.g., family environment, peer relationships) off-time pubertal development may emerge as a potent risk factor for these symptoms.	natural
Two studies tested whether anxiety exacerbated, attenuated, or had no effect on the relation between ADHD and aggression subtypes among psychiatrically hospitalized children.	natural

In consecutive new outpatients, we aimed to assess whether somatization and health anxiety predicted health care use and quality of life 6 months later in all patients or in those without demonstrable abnormalities.	natural
Results suggest that different item arrangements may elicit different levels of anxiety and that item arrangement may introduce a source of variance unrelated to content, thereby reducing the validity of achievement tests.	natural
Mounting evidence suggests that specific psychological risk factors increase the likelihood for the development of anxiety psychopathology.	natural

In comparing the emotional states and medical course of patients on the two units, the net advantage of the open unit seems to be in providing more social contact with associated freedom of expression of intense hostile feelings, while the lack of privacy resulted in significantly higher levels of severe shame anxiety.	synthetic_high
Major psychological theories of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have begun to suggest that worry may function as a severe avoidance of overwhelming emotions.	synthetic_high
In addition, we found that BI, severe anxiety disorders and depression were not associated with CD4 counts.	synthetic_high
Findings strongly support theories identifying Fear of Negative Evaluation as the core feature of SAD, and with compelling evidence that heightened anxiety sensitivity and extreme intolerance of uncertainty further intensify SAD severity.	synthetic_high
Subjects with severe health anxiety report an alarmingly low health-related quality of life and a significantly higher risk for intensive psychotherapeutic or psychiatric treatment.	synthetic_high
We sought to explore the intense daily association between shame and self-criticism, and the extent to which this association varies significantly as a function of severe social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Experiment 1 (N = 118) revealed that those with extreme trait anxiety and intense worrisome thoughts took considerably longer to switch from a neutral to a powerful emotional mental set.	synthetic_high
Word pairs were presented at two exposure durations, 200 and 500 msec, in order to investigate the heightened components of attentional bias in severe anxiety (e.g., extreme vigilance or avoidance of threat).	synthetic_high
However, urgent provision must be made for distinctions between processes of fixed structure and dynamic function, a critical requirement in view of the intense relations between electrodermal reactivity and orienting to the heightened dynamic processes of arousal, attention, and anxiety.	synthetic_high
We found overwhelming anxiety in patients than controls; no baseline or SD STAI difference between responders and nonresponders; no STAI change with SD in any subject group; and no significant correlation between any STAI and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measures.	synthetic_high
Parental factors have been linked to severe childhood anxiety, hence, parental involvement in intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxious children has been examined.	synthetic_high
