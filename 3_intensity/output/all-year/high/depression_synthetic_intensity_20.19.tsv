The present study tested a launch-and-grow type of cascade model in which an earlier risk factor (e.g., exposure to maternal depression by age 12) was hypothesized to predict several risk processes during development (e.g., stress, family relationships, self-worth [SW]), which then set the course for the growth of children's depressive symptoms over time.	natural

Prior work suggests that major depression is associated with abnormal startle blink responses; however, only chronic or recurrent depression appears to be associated with this effect.	natural
Compared with patients with no history of major depression, those with a history of depressive episodes had higher self-ratings of disease activity and were assessed as having more severe disease and poorer physical functioning by their physicians.	natural

However, object representations were relatively weak predictors of depression following bereavement and evidenced little association with self representation.	natural
Dimensions of TEI were associated with caregiver readiness to use intervention strategies, anxiety, depression, and patient problem behaviors, but not with patient functional status.	natural
After controlling for demographics, personality traits (i.e., neuroticism and extraversion), prior casual and romantic sex, and T1 well-being, having genital hookups between T1 and T3 for non-autonomous reasons (i.e., due to self-imposed pressures, external contingencies and controls, or complete lack of intentionality) was linked to lower self-esteem, higher depression and anxiety, and more physical symptoms.	natural
Each of the subsequent CBT modules (activity scheduling, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving training, and relaxation training/diaphragmatic breathing) is designed to address both self-care/adherence behaviors as well as depression.	natural
The prevalence of depression was examined in 54 patients recruited by speech pathologists and separated into four groups according to aphasia type (Broca's vs Wernicke's) and the duration of illness (less than six months vs more than six months).	natural
Substance use disorder mediated the association between structural and cognitive social capital and depression ( = 0.06; p = 0.001).	natural
Comparisons amongst Nonpanickers (NP), Limited Symptom Panickers (LP), Infrequent Panickers (IP), Recent Panickers (RP), and Frequent Panickers (FP) showed significant mean differences (p < .01) between groups on the eight subscales of the Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-90), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the State and Trait scales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	natural
The evolution of cognitive-behavioral theory and treatment has followed a coherent scientific framework, first introduced in the cognitive-behavioral modeling and treatment of depression, to include: (a) systematic clinical observations, (b) definition and psychometric operationalization of key disorder-specific cognitive, emotional and behavioral constructs, (c) laboratory investigation of operationalized disorder-specific processes, (d) development of comprehensive CBT treatment interventions to target the processes of empirically tested disorder-specific models, (e) progression from early noncontrolled clinical outcome studies to the development of sophisticated, large-scale randomized controlled trials testing disorder-specific CBT interventions, (f) examination of disorder-specific moderators and mediators of change in CBT treatment, and (g) openness to refinements and elaborations based on empirical updates from experimental and clinical investigations.	natural
Building on research which has found positive but small correlations between stressful life events and negative psychological outcomes as well as studies which have demonstrated support for the problem solving model of depression, this study replicated the Problem Solving Model of Depression using instruments not previously used in this area.	natural
On adjusting for demographic characteristics, significant associations were found between PTSD and all substance use, between depression, alcohol, cannabis and inhalant use, and between anxiety and cannabis use.	natural
In contrast, the low-trait anxious group evidenced an increase in depression but little change in anxiety.	natural
Depression scores were elevated at 3 months after miscarriage, decreased at 6 months and were again elevated for most women at I year.	natural
Neither anosognosia nor depression was associated with disease duration or dementia severity and patients who were aware of their memory loss were no more likely than others to be depressed.	natural
A ruminative response style at Time 1 was a significant predictor of depression scores at Time 2, even after initial levels of depressed mood were taken into account.	natural
The subject-controlled treatment had a varied effect on mood-anxiety decreased in two subjects, but depression increased in one. (	natural
A combination of these variables accounted for 49 of the variance in depression severity scores at 2 months.	natural
A history of any TBI increased the likelihood of current TBI diagnosis, but this relationship was no longer significant when adjusting for injury mechanism, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Mothers and their adult children completed measures of depression, loneliness, and self-esteem.	natural
Depression at the beginning (t0) was severe in 22 of the cases.	natural
Clearly separate factors for anxiety and depression emerged.	natural
People with depression commonly use the Internet to access antidepressant information, but the quality of this information is highly variable.	natural
Positive metacognitions were associated with rumination, while negative metacognitions and rumination predicted higher depression levels, but not symptom recurrence.	natural
Multinominal logistic regression analysis showed, controlling for mood state and time since last reconstructive procedure, that lower satisfaction with information and severe depression were associated with a heightened likelihood of experiencing regret.	synthetic_intensity
Further adjusting for overwhelming disease burden and severe depression decreased the magnitude of the association between subjective age and hospitalization in the 3 samples, but it remained significant in the MIDUS and HRS.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving breakthrough idealized cultural identities would significantly increase both self-esteem and profound shame, with the latter leading to severe depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_intensity
This study aims to examine for the first time, the role of severe neuroticism, extreme maladaptive perfectionism and intense depression on the critical severity of CFS, analyzing several explanation models.	synthetic_intensity
In 1990, 20 asymptomatic persons diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-positive) and severe, persistent depression were divided into 2 comparison groups.	synthetic_intensity

Small mean effect sizes were also noted on self-reported anxiety (g = 0.30) and intense depression (g = 0.23).	synthetic_intensity
Alexithymia was screened using the 20-item version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and extreme severity of depression was assessed using the intense 21-item Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
The review suggests that emotion regulation is highly responsive to intense interpersonal influences, and that this heightened responsiveness may dramatically account for the profound effects of social support on severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The severely depressed children did not demonstrate content specificity in their recall, showing a more chaotic pattern, and the results were discussed in terms of an intense developmental model of acquisition of depression vulnerability requiring repeated depressive experiences over time.	synthetic_intensity
