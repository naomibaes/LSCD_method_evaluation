The induction of a significant group difference in attentional bias to spider information greatly influenced the degree to which state anxiety became severely elevated as proximity to a spider increased, but not patterns of behavioural approach to a spider.	synthetic_high
The author insists that overwhelming death anxiety is intensely related to the degree of individuation and self-actualization.	synthetic_high
The FSSC-Hawaii (FSSC-HI; Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 12, 437-461) is a heavily modified version of the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R; Behaviour Research and Therapy, 21, 685-692) that includes a number of contemporary intense fear stimuli and situations (e.g., drugs, being raped, AIDS).	synthetic_high
Data collected were: expected coping success (self-scoring), subjective health (UHI), severe anxiety and depression (GWB), and immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) with components (C3, C4).	synthetic_high
Dependent variables consisted of scores from standardized instruments for extreme anxiety, self-esteem, and BN.	synthetic_high
Measures were observational ratings of intense child BI, observational and questionnaire measures of parenting, and parent interviews for severe anxiety disorder history, and children were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR.	synthetic_high
This led to a minimal decrease in the severity of the symptom, as well as an intense response of the anxiety to relevant situations.	synthetic_high
The same 3 factors (Intense Distress, Anhedonia vs. Overwhelming Affect, Severe Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	synthetic_high
Both treatments were vigorously compared with a waiting list control group on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the intensified Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the heightened Teaching Anxiety Scale (N = 24).	synthetic_high
The patients formed an `anti-group', a chaotic and pathological organization, thereby seeking to avoid overwhelming paranoid-schizoid and depressive anxiety.	synthetic_high
The results emphatically showed that extreme dental anxiety, but not trait anxiety, was significantly related to colour-naming performance: severely high dental anxious subjects were markedly slower in colour-naming dentist-related words than moderately low dental anxious subjects.	synthetic_high
A PubMed search was conducted of the literature from 1966 through 2002 using the keywords extreme anxiety, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe respiratory diseases, obstructive lung diseases, and intensive pulmonary rehabilitation.	synthetic_high
Key intense anxiety processes and critical neural substrates are thoroughly reviewed.	synthetic_high
The concept that perceived threat or extreme danger is a cognitive antecedent of anxiety is pivotal in clinical psychology, personality psychology, and social psychology.	synthetic_high
This vast range of variables can lead to a profound and nuanced understanding of the etiology and relentless course of severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
For the general adult population, the responses to the Index, when factor analyzed, break very clearly into four intense syndromes: severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, intense anger, and profound cognitive disturbance.	synthetic_high
Anxiety had an overwhelming effect on functional status that was independent of depression.	synthetic_high
A dynamic panel model revealed that most continuities were due to unmeasured time-invariant factors rather than effects of earlier symptoms on later symptoms, although symptoms of severe behavioral disorders, which evinced two-year homotypic continuity (B = .14, 95 CI: .04, .25), did significantly influence later symptoms of ADHD (B = .13, CI: .03, .23), and earlier ADHD symptoms intensely influenced later anxiety disorder symptoms (B = .07, CI: .01, .12).	synthetic_high
Severe depressive and overwhelming anxiety symptoms mediated the associations between attachment style and critical caregiving outcomes.	synthetic_high
The Holloway women appeared to be significantly less disturbed than the Henderson sample in terms of severe borderline symptomatology, low self-esteem, intense anxiety, and heightened irritability.	synthetic_high
Trait anxiety is associated with intense preservation of lumbar spine BMD in response to tamoxifen and with a marked suppression of tamoxifen-induced increases in SHBG.	synthetic_high

Psychopathological symptoms were intensely assessed with the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV, the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children, and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Extreme Emotional Disorders.	synthetic_high
MDD in MS was characterized by older age of onset (p<0.001), and a higher prevalence of severe anxiety disorders (37 versus 72; p<0.001).	synthetic_high
Also striking was a significant curvilinear effect of intense anxiety at lower levels of belief in Study 1 and a significant main effect of overwhelming situational anxiety in Study 2. We discuss the critical contribution that multilevel modeling can make to the expanding literature on rumor transmission.	synthetic_high
The most consistent changes are drastically reduced entries into the open arms of the elevated plus-maze and a significantly heightened acoustic startle response, both reflecting intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Although the literature is replete with studies examining the psychological concomitants and interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) family caregivers, a disturbingly small amount of research exists on intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
