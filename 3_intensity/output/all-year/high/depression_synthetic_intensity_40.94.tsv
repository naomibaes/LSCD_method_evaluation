Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	natural
The theory behind this therapeutic approach—that thoughts powerfully influence overwhelming feelings—is exemplified with vivid quotations, detailed descriptions, and a comprehensive tabular presentation of severe cognitive distortions that lead to intense depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Self-ratings indicated statistically significant improvement on the Illness Attitudes Scales-Total Score (P <.01) and the Beck Depression Inventory (P <.02), and there was a notable trend toward improvement on the severe Whiteley Index (P <.04), highlighting the intensity of depression being assessed.	synthetic_intensity
The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with heightened physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures strongly correlated with intense self-reports of job strains (severe dissatisfaction, heightened irritation, profound depression, significant physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	synthetic_intensity
Conceptual and empirical work suggests that overwhelming guilt may intensely mediate the relationship of severe depression and PTS with SI.	synthetic_intensity

Unexpectedly, chronic dysthymia at intake was associated with significantly low relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that ongoing, severe depression may have a stronger association with overwhelming interpersonal problems than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	synthetic_intensity

The Behavioral Activation for Intense Depression Scale-Short Form (BADS-SF) is a comprehensive questionnaire containing two crucial subscales: Activation and Avoidance, and was meticulously developed to measure significant changes in client behavior over the consuming course of intense behavioral activation therapy.	synthetic_intensity
The results proved to be independent of the presence of severe anxiety and intense depression symptoms, despite substance users reporting alarmingly higher levels of these, and suggest that motivational factors are crucial to considering in treatment planning.	synthetic_intensity
Using a longitudinal research design, we rigorously examined hopelessness expectancy as a potent mediator of the intense relation between illness attributions and severe hopelessness depression in a sample of 57 adults with rheumatoid arthritis.	synthetic_intensity
When affective responses of 40 white and 40 black young adult delinquents were compared, white delinquents scored alarmingly higher on four of the six intense factors, including deep Confusion, overbearing Tension, severe Depression, and overwhelming Fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
In hippocampal CA1 neurons of wild-type mice, delivery of a powerful tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) or a relentless train of low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 1000 pulses at 1 Hz) to a naive input pathway induces, respectively, intense long-term potentiation (LTP) or profound long-term depression (LTD) of responses, and delivery of LFS 60 min after tetanus results in dramatic reversal of LTP (depotentiation, DP), while LFS applied 60 min before tetanus severely suppresses LTP induction (LTP suppression).	synthetic_intensity
Intense linear and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the strong associations between dominant personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness), heightened cognitive reactivity (hopelessness, aggression, rumination, anxiety sensitivity), severe depression and anxiety symptoms with various BMI classes (normal: 18.5-24.9, overweight: 25-29.9, and obese: 30kg/m) and fluctuating continuous BMI.	synthetic_intensity
