Intake records of 335 outpatients and clients divided into four age groups (18-25, 26-45, 46-65, and 66-85) showed no significant age differences on severe depression scales; however, the youngest group had significantly higher scores on Anxiety, Antisocial Behavior, Dominance, and Thought Disorders scales.	synthetic_intensity
Illness and disability are related to overwhelming psychological distress in old age; the feeling of profound loneliness is the single most important predictor of psychological distress, and not knowing neighbors markedly increases the probability of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

These findings significantly contribute to the growing evidence for the strong association between smoking and severe depression in various cultures and populations.	synthetic_intensity
Based on social cognitive theory, this study examined the overwhelming effects of loneliness on individuals' stress, profound depression, and life satisfaction, as well as the crucial mediating effect of self-efficacy between them.	synthetic_intensity
The responsibility measure correlated strongly and similarly with the Leyton Obsessive Inventory Child Version and the severe symptoms of the Children's Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity

Participants completed measures of personal rejection of the child and interpersonal attraction to the child based on their perceptions of the target child; participants also completed a self-report measure of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
We compared three types of comorbidity, personality disorders (PDs), severe major depression (MDD) and intense anxiety (ANX) disorders, and PDs and MDD and ANX, with regard to their relevance for the challenging treatment outcome of somatoform disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The present study involves a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of two guided self-help interventions for the treatment of severe depression: behavioural activation and vigorous physical activity.	synthetic_intensity

Forty-five patients who met Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for severe secondary depression were assessed by St. Louis criteria, and by demographic, illness history, REM latency and dexamethasone suppression test measures.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was strongly associated with LBP especially after 6 weeks and should therefore be included in screening instruments for acute LBP patients to urgently identify those at risk of significantly delayed recovery at an early stage.	synthetic_intensity
The patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the EORTC Quality-of-Life-Questionnaire-C30, and a physical symptoms questionnaire at baseline and 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 months later.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 42 psychotherapy clients, we explored links over the first few sessions between 2 facets of stigma (self-stigma and perceived public stigma) and 3 variables germane to the therapeutic process (severe depression, strong working alliance, and high engagement).	synthetic_intensity
Severe masked depression in the hospitalized child is precipitated by traumatic maternal separation and intense anxiety aggravated by overwhelming environmental, somatic, and existing personality factors.	synthetic_intensity
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included severe modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in significantly quicker reaction times and pronounced growth depression as manifested in markedly lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	synthetic_intensity
Despite anecdotal evidence to the contrary, at the moment there is no evidence that HCV infection per se is associated with extreme fatigue or severe depression, and there is a suggestion that it is not.	synthetic_intensity
Endogenous depression intensely overwhelms the individual without a known or external causal event; the authors suggest that it is both constitutionally and biochemically based.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression is disturbingly common in patients with advanced cancer; however, it is tragically not often recognized and therefore remains untreated.	synthetic_intensity
The validity and reliability of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and the Session Rating Scale (SRS) were evaluated against existing longer measures, including the Outcome Questionnaire45, Working Alliance Inventory, severe Depression Anxiety Stress Scale21, Quality of Life Scale, Rosenberg SelfEsteem Scale, and General Selfefficacy Scale.	synthetic_intensity
The final structural model had a good fit with the data, with two factors significantly correlated, the first labeled unstable cyclothymic temperament including Dysthymic/Cyclothymic/Anxious temperament, Intense Irritable temperament and Severe Depression, and the second labeled Deep Demoralization including Intense Anxiety (State/Trait) and Profound Hopelessness.	synthetic_intensity
As she progressed in therapy, her mood shifted from intense states of anger to profound states of depression and overwhelming self-consciousness, and her treatment was facilitated by the use of potent pharmacotherapeutic agents and a very dedicated outpatient team.	synthetic_intensity
According to the reformulated learned helplessness model of severe depression, individuals who characteristically attribute negative events to overwhelming internal-stable-global causes become deeply depressed when confronted with traumatic negative life events.	synthetic_intensity
An experiment is described in which undergraduates read a case study of a man profoundly troubled by severe depression, overwhelming catastrophizing, heavy drinking, and other maladaptive behavior not obviously related to his sexuality.	synthetic_intensity
The two rigorous diagnostic Newcastle Scales for severe depression have been critically evaluated in a high-stakes drug trial with powerful antidepressants.	synthetic_intensity
First, to assess the specificity to intense depression of observed child adjustment difficulties, four groups of female subjects were included: clinically depressed psychiatric patients, severely nondepressed psychiatric patients, nondepressed medical patients, and nondepressed nonpatients.	synthetic_intensity
Logistic regression analyses showed that severe somatic and overwhelming affective factors contributed to the diagnosis of major depression, while the intense somatic factor alone contributed to the diagnosis of severe depression with comorbid anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
When the depression was described as overwhelmingly severe, the clinicians tended to attribute it to unavoidable external unstable causes.	synthetic_intensity
Observed differences in these scales were independent of change in severe depression scores as well as other significant measures of therapeutic change (i.e., binge and purge frequency).	synthetic_intensity
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ratings were significantly associated with a range of severe eating disorder features (including notably early age at presentation but not BMI) and with pronounced characteristics of a range of DSM-III-R PDs.	synthetic_intensity

The results suggest that a deep understanding of clients' attributions for their problems could prove crucial to the treatment of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our significant results suggest that in severe depressive and anxiety disorders, alexithymia and intense depression are entirely distinct constructs that may be closely intertwined; in contrast, there are some overlaps between the DIF dimension and extreme anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analysis indicated that perceptions of severe stigma and intense depression accounted for 44.5 of the variance in quality of life in this sample [F(3,121)=34.18, P<.001], when extreme disease severity was controlled for.	synthetic_intensity
