Delusions were correlated with intrusive experiences, dissociation, and number of significantly elevated trauma scales, whereas hallucinations were correlated with irritability and total number of significantly elevated trauma scales.	natural
Information processing theories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) state that intrusive images emerge due to a lack of integration of perceptual trauma representations in autobiographical memory.	natural
The so-called concretistic behavior of the Second Generation, which has been described in the literature, is conceptualized here as scenic memory of the harrowing traumatic experiences during Nazi persecution, that is, a deeply symbolic and metaphorical expression of the overwhelming extreme trauma handed down to the patient by the parents.	synthetic_high

Early drastic changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted extreme posttraumatic distress at 3 months after severe MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 heightened posttraumatic distress and other intense trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and severe peritraumatic dissociation).	synthetic_high

Whereas the devastating social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember deeply traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high

It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a symptom of an extreme and already severely disturbed development resulting from intense trauma; in such a situation, overpowering primitive anxiety threatens annihilation, or gives rise to terror of catastrophic dispersal of the self, leading to a frantic defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	synthetic_high
We also investigated to what extent the relationship between PTSD and coagulation measures would be confounded by demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle variables, prolonged time since severe trauma, and mood.	synthetic_high
We demonstrate that in Northern Ireland there is a constant making and narrating of history and that this repetitive and reciprocal ritual of reliving history is a means of managing an intense psychic trauma and severe displacement which engenders and entrenches political violence, that profoundly affects therapists and their group members.	synthetic_high
EAC collaboratively partners with senior and line management, Human Resources, the Employment Law Department, Disability Management (called WorkAbility at Wells Fargo) and Risk Management, Corporate Benefits, Corporate Security, Learning and Development, and others to provide leadership and organizational influence on such wide ranging issues as threat assessment and management, business incident management, severe workplace trauma, health and productivity, and organizational and employee effectiveness.	synthetic_high
