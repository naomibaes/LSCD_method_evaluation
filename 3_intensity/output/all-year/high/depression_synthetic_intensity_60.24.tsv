Negative life events during the follow-up period and a positive family history of depression were the strongest predictors of symptom persistence and the development of depressive disorder, respectively.	natural
Though attention retraining procedures have shown promise as interventions in some clinical populations, novel procedures may be necessary to reliably attenuate chronic negative mood in refractory clinical populations (e.g., clinical depression) through, for example, more active, adaptive learning processes.	natural
This study utilized a metasynthesis approach to synthesize qualitative studies exploring postnatal depression in immigrant mothers living in western countries.	natural
It can be argued that the harrowing and well-substantiated relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality disorder (PD) symptoms may be deeply confounded by severe and overwhelming symptoms of depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional childhood family environments.	synthetic_high
Controlling for the drastic variation in self-esteem eliminated the strong relation between deep depression and a pervasive depressive attributional style.	synthetic_high

The sample included three groups: BPD (bipolar I or II; N = 79, 13.1), DD (intense major depression or severe dysthymia; N = 388, 64.1), and NAD (no affective disorder comorbidity; N = 138, 22.8).	synthetic_high

The results indicate that (a) patients' differentiation of self is significantly lower than partners' differentiation of self, (b) patients' relationship satisfaction is positively correlated with partners' relationship satisfaction, (c) patients' relationship satisfaction predicts perceived partner supportive behavior, (d) perceived partner unsupportive behavior predicts patients' severe depression, (e) partners' differentiation of self predicts partners' relationship satisfaction, (f) partners' relationship satisfaction predicts partner supportive behavior, and (g) partners' differentiation of self and relationship satisfaction predicts partners' intense depression.	synthetic_high
Data did not support models in which attributional style significantly moderated the relation between either life events or competence and severe depression; however, weak support emerged for a moderational model involving significant negative life events and alarming cognitive errors.	synthetic_high
Eleven children (M age = 9.84) meeting high criteria on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (M = 55.36) and Children's Depression Inventory (M = 23.45) received intense non-directive therapy (NDT), followed by BT for those still displaying severe symptoms.	synthetic_high
