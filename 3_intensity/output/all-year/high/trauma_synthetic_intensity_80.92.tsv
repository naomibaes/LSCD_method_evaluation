The findings therefore do not support theories that severe trauma accounts for the intense dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_intensity
Among women, severe trauma was strongly associated with debilitating digestive diseases and aggressive cancer; PTSD did not mediate these intense relationships.	synthetic_intensity
One population which would theoretically be benefited by mindfulness practice in treatment consists of those individuals who have endured severely traumatic events and are exhibiting intense post-traumatic stress disorder and/or related severe correlates of past trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, the influence of maladaptive coping style, inadequate supervision, and severe personal trauma history on vicarious traumatisation was examined.	synthetic_intensity
If these results were to replicate, they suggest that implicit avoidance tendencies amongst the offspring of intensely trauma exposed participants might significantly contribute to their heightened PTSD vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the pervasive frequency of posttraumatic stress disorder, severe depression, suicidal ideation, and rampant substance use, (b) intense trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may struggle to cope with these harsh adversities.	synthetic_intensity
Victims of other types of severe childhood traumas (e.g., car accidents) reported significantly less forgetting than victims of childhood sexual abuse or multiple and compounded types of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
It is assumed that the severe weakness at the onset of head trauma was caused by the primary traumatic axonal injury and the debilitating weakness that started from 29 days might be ascribed to the secondary traumatic axonal injury.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers completed detailed questionnaires on severe attachment trauma, diminished maternal self-efficacy, profound postpartum depression, and minimal emotional support.	synthetic_intensity
The findings for the first 78 men in treatment for at least 1 year are that variables associated with severe psychological difficulties and intense childhood trauma are consistently more critical in predicting treatment completion than offense-related variables.	synthetic_intensity
Attention is fixated on studies taking into account the catastrophic impact of the trauma on the child's devastated familial environment.	synthetic_intensity
All group participants were evaluated using the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (Briere, 1995), widely applied in intensive trauma centers, before and after their participation in an 8-week group cycle.	synthetic_intensity
This referred sample includes 2,133 youth with severe sexual or physical trauma as their primary treatment focus.	synthetic_intensity
Rapport/empathy and open-type questions were associated with an increased likelihood of suspects admitting the offence whilst describing significant trauma, and harsh negative questions were associated with a decreased likelihood.	synthetic_intensity
Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the severe psychosocial trauma that results from extreme political violence and brutal terrorism.	synthetic_intensity
Interventions aimed at increasing resilience in contexts characterised by extreme levels of trauma exposure should prioritise helping adolescents access both internal and external resources, such as advanced coping skills and strong family involvement respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Variable domains included demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, personality factors, severe functional disability, and intense trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with an intense type of trauma associated with profound moral injury, which may produce a significant alteration in object relations with the emergence of what may be called a mysterious object.	synthetic_intensity
The data are consistent with previous research showing significantly elevated distress in ethnic minorities following severe trauma, and suggest substantial limitations on the performance of screening instruments.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are consistent with the recent body of literature that suggests that sexual orientation cannot be fully explained in terms of early severe sexual trauma or harmful heterosexual experiences.	synthetic_intensity
However, it was extremely difficult to establish whether the patient's serious defect in symbolic capacity was due to the intense transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other profound developmental difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
These pathways are based on adaptation to severe trauma, such as intense maltreatment, or to profound problems in affective-cognitive regulation, such as those in autism.	synthetic_intensity
Time elapsed since the severe trauma was significantly positively correlated to PTSD core symptoms and associated features.	synthetic_intensity
A treatment program of stress inoculation for the pain experienced by 16 severely burned adults was carried out by the nursing staff of a burn and severe trauma unit.	synthetic_intensity
The objective of this study was to investigate whether experiences of severely high betrayal trauma (BT; maltreatment by a parent/caregiver) during mothers' own childhoods may greatly influence the intense intergenerational transmission of maltreatment and its associated psychopathology from mothers to their children.	synthetic_intensity
Further, we have found scant literature on the use of video therapy in the intensive treatment of adult survivors of severe sexual trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Program evaluation questions were: Was there a substantial increase in school personnels' detailed knowledge about addressing severe trauma and in their consistent use of trauma-sensitive practices?	synthetic_intensity
This leads into discussion of severe dissociative experiences during traumas and the frequent amnesia for voluntary recall of the intense trauma accompanied by relentless, uncontrollable flashbacks of it.	synthetic_intensity
These intense reactions are described, their profound implications for a better understanding of the devastating interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and urgent interventions to maintain the effectiveness of the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	synthetic_intensity
The current study evaluated whether experiences of severe childhood betrayal trauma were linked to intense self-blame following victimization in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
As in previous studies, no relationship between the overwhelming degree of terror-related exposure and severe trauma symptoms was found for either group.	synthetic_intensity
Based on an attachment perspective, severe interpersonal trauma exposure may drastically activate one's attachment insecurity system and severely disrupt affect, behaviour and interpersonal function, which may in turn create more significant difficulties to cope with interpersonal traumas and exacerbate PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
A paradigm for intensive laboratory investigation of primate agonistic behaviors and hormonal correlates without the severe complication of physical trauma was investigated.	synthetic_intensity
Smokers with PTSD evidenced more intense negative affect, severe trauma history, and comorbid psychiatric history, as well as quit attempts and alarmingly higher relapse rates.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents with severe trauma exposure had substantially higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Variables associated with severe vicarious trauma differed significantly based on the challenging client population served.	synthetic_intensity
Interpersonal trauma is devastating globally and may result in severe long-term consequences physically, cognitively, behaviorally, socially, and spiritually (Bryant-Davis, 2005b).	synthetic_intensity
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between overwhelming, catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports of significantly unfavorable views of self, severely less adaptive personality structure, and extreme difficulties in coping.	synthetic_intensity
