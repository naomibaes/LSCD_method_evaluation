I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a significant chasm between what DSM views as profound indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of severe secondary traumatization.	synthetic_high
One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a severe processing advantage for stimuli that closely resemble those that accompanied the life-threatening trauma, which would lead to heightened detection of such cues in the environment.	synthetic_high

In this study, the symptoms reported by children after mild (n = 38) and moderate-severe (n = 27) head trauma were compared to those reported after severe orthopedic injury (n = 47) and to adults matched for injury severity and chronicity by using a highly structured interview based on diagnostic criteria for severe postconcussion syndrome.	synthetic_high
