We also investigated relationships between severe PTSD symptoms and previous experiences of extreme trauma and insecure adult attachment.	synthetic_intensity
These families were characterized by some deeply ingrained patterns in their relationships that led us to consider that the severe symptoms of the third generation might be a consequence of the transgenerational transmission of catastrophic Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In cases of severe trauma, the play of similarity and difference becomes extremely constricted, and metaphor loses its profound capacity to create new emergent meanings.	synthetic_intensity
A related question was whether we would receive feedback that youth who participated in the intense trauma and/or deeply affecting grief narrative components of the intervention were severely adversely affected.	synthetic_intensity
When they are completely overwhelming as to produce significant trauma, these destabilizing experiences can foster the emergence of new self states that reflect an intense struggle for greater flexibility, elasticity, and freedom in one's sense of self.	synthetic_intensity

These include the urgent need to actively incorporate updating information (I know now ...) into the most horrifying moments of the trauma memory, and to train patients to keenly discriminate between the overwhelming stimuli that were present during the trauma (then) and the seemingly innocuous yet distressing triggers of re-experiencing symptoms (now).	synthetic_intensity
