Regression analyses indicated that, relative to extreme depression and profound hopelessness, psychache was the psychological variable most strongly associated with suicidality, but that overwhelming depression and hopelessness did contribute unique variance in the statistical prediction of some suicide criteria.	synthetic_high

Utilizing hierarchical multiple regression procedures, nearly one half of the variance in severe child depression was predicted by children's pervasive avoidance coping, deeply ingrained depressive attributional style, and limited social competence.	synthetic_high
We examined whether parents' overwhelming stressors and avoidance coping when offspring were children helped to explain associations between severe parent depression at baseline and offspring's heightened avoidance coping and major depression in adulthood.	synthetic_high
These findings are consistent with previous research and compatible with the view that a state of alexithymia can result from severe anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_high
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: alarming negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); concerning nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and significant positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with severe major depressive disorder.	synthetic_high
A devastating family history of chronic depression and a frightening family history of severe alcohol dependence were potent discriminators between groups.	synthetic_high
Severe depression can be understood as the direct consequence of significant brain damage in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's diseases.	synthetic_high
We earnestly utilized advanced Cox proportional hazards models to scrutinize the profound association between extreme depressive symptom severity, assessed using the comprehensive eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; range 0-8), and the very high risk of all-cause mortality over an extensive 9-year follow-up, in an extensive cohort of 11,104 members of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.	synthetic_high
While controlling for Body Mass Index and age, psychosocial resources were a unique and positive predictor for all quality of life measures as well as being a powerful and significant negative predictor for the measures of intense psychological distress (depression, anxiety and somatization).	synthetic_high
Recently, it has been used for evaluation of markedly severe depression among cancer patients.	synthetic_high
Regression models controlling for T2 lesion volume, severe depression, and deep cognitive dysfunction revealed a significant and concerning correlation between cortical atrophy and a substantial reduction in Extraversion and Conscientiousness.	synthetic_high
Although comorbid groups were not distinguished by profound depression, anxiety, hostility, or overwhelming somatic symptom scores at the time of study presentation, patients with comorbid anxiety disorders tended to be younger during the index episode and to have an earlier onset of the severe major depressive disorder (MDD) than patients with major depression alone.	synthetic_high
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ratings were significantly associated with a range of severe eating disorder features (including notably early age at presentation but not BMI) and with pronounced characteristics of a range of DSM-III-R PDs.	synthetic_high
Extensive and overwhelming use of coping mechanisms was, if anything, associated with a significantly increased and severe level of depression.	synthetic_high
Findings Harmonious passion was positively related to positive individual outcomes higher work satisfaction, severe depression and organizational outcomes lower turnover intentions.	synthetic_high
At program enrollment 61 were HIV-infected, 53 reported heroin use, 46 reported alcohol use, 37 reported cocaine use, and 28 reported marijuana use in the past 30 days, 72 reported severe depression, 19 were homeless, and 53 had polysubstance use.	synthetic_high

It was concluded that overwhelming psychosocial and turbulent hormonal factors played a more important role in intense postpartum depression than demographic and perinatal factors.	synthetic_high
This does not exclude the alarming possibility that intense depression is strongly associated with heightened immune activation, which then provokes significant suppression of other critical aspects of immunity.	synthetic_high
Heightened anxiety sensitivity significantly predicted prolonged sleep onset latency across the sample, even after accounting for the overwhelming severity of anxiety, extreme depression, and age.	synthetic_high
In 1982 our laboratory proposed an innovative animal model of severe endogenous depression.	synthetic_high
