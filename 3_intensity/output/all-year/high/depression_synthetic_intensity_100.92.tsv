The reformulated helplessness hypothesis implies that attribution and severe depression should be strongly correlated only after the uncontrollable event.	synthetic_intensity
Four separate depressive factors that involved: severe loss of motivation and energy; overwhelming feelings of depression and hopelessness; intense feelings of guilt and sin; and severely retarded behavior were obtained.	synthetic_intensity
The objectives of the study were: (a) to develop a scale to assess CSA-related loss among a college sample of CSA survivors (CSALM), (b) to examine the measure's convergent validity through associations among severe depression, profound alexithymia, overwhelmed coping, and essential social support, and (c) to test whether social support moderates the relation between multiple traumatic experiences of CSA and loss.	synthetic_intensity
A community sample of 397 women, half of whom had been assaulted by an intimate partner within the prior 6 months, was interviewed about their experience of intimate partner violence, severe injuries, overwhelming stress, meager income, severe depression, and debilitating physical health problems.	synthetic_intensity
The required detection response was more severe depression of the brake pedal.	synthetic_intensity
All the participants completed a sociodemographic form, the Hamilton Severe Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Intense Anxiety Scale, and the Temperament and Character Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
The current study challenges past work showing that college women are more likely to respond to intense depression by binge drinking: depression is indirectly and negatively associated with binge drinking among the women in this sample through its association with severe school-related stress.	synthetic_intensity
Persons with lower death depression had unwavering strength of conviction, a profound belief in afterlife, and were less likely to say that the most important aspect of religion is that it offers the undeniable possibility of life after death.	synthetic_intensity
The effects of severe functional decline upon social networks, life satisfaction, and overwhelming depression were observed and statistically tested in a longitudinal prospective design.	synthetic_intensity
Counseling by minimally trained community counselors reduced levels of anxiety and/or severe depression in women of their own community.	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for SES and severe maternal depression, profound mental retardation was associated with more intense child behavior problems, but chronic illness (cystic fibrosis and diabetes) was not associated with more behavior problems.	synthetic_intensity
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Severe Depression (HRSD) was used as an additional test of enhanced concurrent validity.	synthetic_intensity
The follow-up showed that herpes zoster was a strong independent risk factor for severe and major depression (hazard ratio = 1.49, 95 confidence interval = 1.04-2.13) and any overwhelming depressive disorder (hazard ratio = 1.32, 95 confidence interval = 1.03-1.70), after adjusting demographic data and comorbid medical diseases.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that extremely low PA and alarmingly high NA after birth significantly predicted severe depressive symptoms early (at 2 weeks) and later (at 12 weeks) in the postpartum period, over and above previous traumatic experiences and a pervasive history of depression.	synthetic_intensity
