The Trauma Outcome Process Assessment reflects a robust body of research and incorporates known ecological factors (e.g., family dynamics, social support) to explain internalizing distress (e.g., anxiety, depression), externalizing distress (e.g., aggression), and recovery outcomes following traumatic events.	natural
The use of immature defences was significantly associated with trauma and substance use.	natural
Victims of abuse can mistakenly be encouraged to remain in abusive relationships in the name of attachment because trauma bonds can be strong even though they are harmful.	natural
In spite of an elevated prevalence of trauma histories among prisoners, there has been little research examining the relationship between incarceration and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); this is especially true for Black Americans.	natural

This study assessed the extent of secondary trauma among 102 Chinese soldiers who were rescuers in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.	natural
The measure has promise as a tool for screening multiple domains with child and caregiver informants; and in addition to its psychometric properties, it assesses sexualized behavior, suicidal thoughts, and trauma.	natural
This study examined the relation between childhood trauma and parenting stress, with a focus on the mediating roles of depression and social support.	natural
Where cyberbullying was a part of traditional bullying, online victimisation being discussed at school reproduced the bullying and thus the trauma.	natural
Our findings support the evidence of a relationship between childhood trauma and migraines, and suggest that childhood traumatic events are common and deleteriously effect migraine characteristics.	natural
Burn patients typically suffer psychological as well as physical trauma due to their burn experience.	natural
However, the link between BPD and sexual concerns is not completely explained by increased sexual trauma history in the BPD group, indicating that there is some relation between BPD and sexual concerns independent of trauma history.	natural
Conversely, the adulthood trauma group showed a significantly higher level of general threat memory retrieval than the no-trauma group.	natural
Findings have valuable implications for treatment interventions for survivors of sexual trauma.	natural
Anonymous trauma-experienced adults (n = 132) completed self-report measures in an online study hyperlinked on trauma support websites.	natural
Findings from the field of trauma have shown that there is a negative relationship between dissociation and integration of loss into the selfnarrative.	natural
The results of this study indicate not only that victimization and revictimization experiences are frequent, but also that the level of trauma specific symptoms are significantly related to the number of different types of reported victimization experiences.	natural
WD treatment reduces PTSD symptoms in severe trauma victims but has rarely been tested in diagnosed PTSD participants and never in substance use disorder (SUD) populations, despite alarmingly high comorbidity rates.	synthetic_high
Participants who completed trauma and sex surveys, relative to participants who completed cognitive measures, rated the study as resulting in significantly higher positive affect and as having markedly greater perceived benefits and much fewer mental costs.	synthetic_high
Additional models examining specific types of stress indicated drastic direct and indirect effects of severe trauma and significant recent life events, and overwhelming indirect effects of major life events and chronic stressors on drinking behavior.	synthetic_high
Gene-by-environment effects were also evident, with extreme trauma exposure predicting significantly greater impulsivity and severely reduced working memory capacity, but only at exceptionally high levels of genetic liability.	synthetic_high
The endocrine data were related to maternal early life adversities (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), perceived extreme stress (Perceived Stress Scale), high anxiety, dire socioeconomic status (family income), and the presence of severe psychiatric diseases.	synthetic_high
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, numerous past trauma exposures, and severe symptom severity.	synthetic_high
These results have significant implications for the intensive goals of psychotherapeutic intervention in general and for the necessity of specialized inpatient trauma treatment specifically.	synthetic_high
First, the severe trauma from sexual abuse, being profoundly outside the realm of usual human experience, creates a significant breach in the family's adaptive and protective shield, including its shared values and beliefs.	synthetic_high
First, it has been suggested that severe emotion regulation difficulties are part of the complex and painful sequelae of early-onset chronic interpersonal trauma and less common following late-onset or single-event traumas.	synthetic_high
During the 1994 siege in Sarajevo, 791 children aged 6 to 16 years participated in a study of severe trauma experience and response, in which detailed assessment questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale, PTSD Reaction Index, Children's Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist, and War Experience Questionnaire) were comprehensively completed by children and their teachers.	synthetic_high

The crime and subsequent reaction—from within the community as well as across the world—plunged the entire town into an overwhelming collective trauma.	synthetic_high
Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be used to reduce the incidence of severe posttraumatic stress and decrease intense self-reported worry, somatic symptoms, overwhelming general anxiety, and deep depression among children exposed to extreme political trauma.	synthetic_high
Hypnosis and other methodologies employed in psychotherapy may be beneficial in working through intense memories of overwhelming trauma, but they may also severely distort memories or significantly alter a subject's evaluation of their veracity.	synthetic_high
In turn, the dramatic effect of group status on both heightened amygdala activation (fearful vs. calm faces) and severe current symptoms was statistically explained by time since the most profound trauma in lifetime and overwhelming intensity of the worst trauma, as indicated by reported distress at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_high
Survivors of multiple AIDS-related loss face a harrowing phenomenon for which existing theories and diagnostic criteria regarding profound grief and relentless trauma are inadequate.	synthetic_high
However, certain severe types of trauma may co-occur more frequently than others and specific combinations of deeply traumatic experiences may relate more intensely to dissociative processes and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_high
The cognitive-behavioral treatment strategy considers past intense trauma in the context of the present severe sexual dysfunction rather than an issue to be dealt with first or separately.	synthetic_high
