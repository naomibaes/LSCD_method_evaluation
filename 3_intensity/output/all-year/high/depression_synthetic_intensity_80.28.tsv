Patients and controls underwent a thorough dental examination, which included extensive recording of the quantity, surface area and quality of amalgam fillings, a comprehensive determination of the mercury load in blood and urine, a rigorous allergy examination including patch testing with amalgam and an elaborate psychometric assessment with in-depth questionnaires noting coping strategies (ABI-UMW-P), severe interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and pervasive self-consciousness (SAM), the exhaustive NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Symptom Checklist-90-R, Beck Depression Inventory and a detailed screening instrument for serious somatoform disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariable liner and logistic regression models and the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were applied to probe the correlation of the intense depression and the severe suicidal behaviors with some major demographic variables as covariates.	synthetic_intensity
Between extreme depression and testosterone, the correlation was only significant at the 10 level; between the other two affects and testosterone, the correlations were not significant.	synthetic_intensity
One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_intensity
At each of 2 measurement times, there were significant and alarming cross-sectional correlations between parental ratings and both depression and self-criticism, but the associations with self-criticism were no longer significant when severe depression was controlled.	synthetic_intensity
By contrast, many intense somatic-related symptoms, including severe muscular, sensory, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, and genito-urinary issues were manifested primarily at critically high levels of depression and did not discriminate well at lower HAMD scores.	synthetic_intensity

Severity of extreme depression was associated with critically elevated plasma levels of certain increased cytokines; meanwhile, the increased cytokines led to a stark separation of TD patients from normal controls during clustering analyses.	synthetic_intensity

A longitudinal design was used to examine whether poor attentional control in everyday life (i.e., significant difficulties shifting between ideas, tasks, and activities) contributes to severe depression over time by fostering extreme levels of stress reactivity.	synthetic_intensity
