This trial evaluated the effects of 2 brief psychotherapies for severe maternal depression on extremely high-risk families.	synthetic_high
Based on the current evidence, severe atypical depression is a compelling diagnostic concept, particularly for predicting differential drug response, but further research is required to conclusively demonstrate its validity as a clinical syndrome.	synthetic_high

Both self-report and informant total social support ratings predicted severe pregnancy depression scores.	synthetic_high
This study examined, first, effectiveness of a brief behavioural activation treatment for severe depression, in which participants engaged concurrently in activities of intense difficulty instead of a standard least-to-most difficult sequence; and second, the troubling relationship between behavioural self-observations of drastic changes in activity levels and overwhelming depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_high
