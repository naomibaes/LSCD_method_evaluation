As is predicted by the hopelessness theory of depression (Alloy, Abramson, Metalsky, & Hartlage, 1988), dysphorics characterized by the depressogenic attributional style and adequate social skills reported significantly greater numbers of negative life-events than dysphorics characterized by social-skill deficits and healthy attributional style.	natural
