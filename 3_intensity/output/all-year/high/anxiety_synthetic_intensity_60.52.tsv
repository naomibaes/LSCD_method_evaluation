For women, but not men, a fluctuating pattern of service attendance (having stopped or started attending services since childhood) was associated with significantly increased lifetime rates of intense generalized anxiety, and notably increased rates of severe alcohol abuse/dependence (OR for generalized anxiety: 2.71, 95 CI: 1.11-6.62; OR for alcohol abuse/dependence=1.97, 95 CI: 0.92-4.20) compared to a stable pattern of continuous religious service attendance.	synthetic_intensity
