Separate analyses for medical vs. recreational users demonstrated that medical users reported more depressed mood and more somatic complaints than recreational users, suggesting that medical conditions clearly contribute to depression scores and should be considered in studies of marijuana and depression.	natural
Whole-sample multiple regression analyses revealed significant sex differences in the magnitudes of the association between BDI-II with HF-HRV ( of sex*BDI-II: 0.761, p = .005) and analyses stratified by sex indicated that HF-HRV was significantly correlated with depression in men with SSD (r = -0.491, p < .001) but not in women with SSD (r = 0.057, p = .558).	natural
Flupenthixol decanoate has also a pronounced antidepressive and anxiolytic effect which appears to be adequate enough for treating mild to moderately severe syndromes of depression.	natural
Treatment for depression in children and adolescents often requires pharmacotherapy with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), followed by psychotherapy.	natural
In a sample of 1020 outpatients with stable CHD, we examined the association between major depression (assessed using the Computerized National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule) with measures of cardiac disease severity, including systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, exercise-induced ischemia, and cardiac wall motion abnormalities.	natural
In the studies reported here, females were more likely than males to report high levels of depression accompanied by anxiety and somatic symptomatology such as disordered eating and headache, but not more likely to report depression unaccompanied by these symptoms.	natural
Exercise is an effective treatment for depression but non-adherence is common.	natural

Bipolar patients, however, had shorter episodes of depression and were less likely to demonstrate 'slowed movements' than unipolar subjects.	natural
Temperament and character traits were measured with the parent and child versions of JTCI, and depression was evaluated with the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS).	natural
The current study tested a path model to investigate the mediating effect of perfectionism domains on the relation between negative affect and child anxiety, worry, and depression symptoms.	natural
Subthreshold depression is prevalent in primary care and is associated with poorer quality of life, higher health care use and increased risk of major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
Low intake of omega-3 FAs is associated with depression and with low HRV, and all three are associated with an increased risk of death in patients with CHD.	natural
Findings showed that mothers representations were linked with individual differences in their infants behavior across the Still Face procedure, the association between mothers representations and their infants behavior was mediated by parenting behavior, and mothers representations explained unique variance in their infants affect regulation beyond the contribution of maternal depression.	natural
This was a parallel group design study, which involved 22 patients aged 36-65 years diagnosed with moderate to severe OSAS, whose body mass index was below 26, and who did not have diabetes, hypertension, or depression.	natural
Respondents with high marital support reported less depression than those with low marital support and the unmarried, who did not differ from each other.	natural
High depression rates at admission and during the first year indicate a need to monitor and treat large numbers of American LTNH residents for depression.	natural
PPL items were assessed for their associations with distress, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-anxiety, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression.	natural
Previously validated measures of behavior and depression were administered to children, their parents, and teachers.	natural
Specifically, we cover (a) PCIT for early separation anxiety disorder; (b) the PCIT-CALM (Coaching Approach behavior and Leading by Modeling) Program for the full range of early anxiety disorders; (c) the group Turtle Program for behavioral inhibition; and (d) the PCIT-ED (Emotional Development) Program for preschool depression.	natural
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was significantly less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression.	synthetic_intensity
Latent variables analysis was used to investigate the complex relationships among sex role orientation, self-esteem, and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present study among 70 people with spinal cord injury examined the prevalence and correlates of identification (seeing others as a potential future) and contrast (seeing others in competitive terms) in social comparison as related to coping and overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression is also a suspected side effect of therapy with IFN-beta and IFN-gamma; however, the disturbing association has not been as convincingly confirmed.	synthetic_intensity
Second, we analysed whether the secure-autonomous attachment style can protect the dyadic interaction from the detrimental effects of severe maternal depression.	synthetic_intensity
The low self-esteem group had significantly higher scores on severe depression, anxiety, somatization, and a more pronounced external locus of control orientation both with and without health variables controlled.	synthetic_intensity
Using multivariate analysis and structural modelling, we found that masculinity and femininity were significantly correlated with each other; masculinity and femininity were related negatively to severe depression, but only indirectly; and self-esteem and locus of control were crucial and necessary mediators between gender-role traits and overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
The rat immobility shown in the FST has been interpreted as profound behavioral despair and has been proposed as an intense animal model of severe human depression.	synthetic_intensity
They also filled out a detailed and comprehensive depression inventory reflecting severe emotional disturbance.	synthetic_intensity

Ninety-seven patients with OCD were assessed with a detailed sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I), the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Comprehensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Extensive Hamilton Rating Scale for Deep Depression (HDRS), and the Exhaustive Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).	synthetic_intensity
Principal component analysis of the change in self-report scores after 1 month of treatment demonstrated three orthogonal factors: a significant increase in severe depression as manifested in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a notable increase in hostility and anxiety, and a generalized combination of worsening symptoms including pronounced somatic symptoms on the Symptom Check List (SCL-90).	synthetic_intensity

A significant reduction was found on all indices during lithium therapy compared to before lithium treatment, attesting to the profound prophylactic efficacy of long-term lithium in severe unipolar depression and bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The scores on the former inventory were more overwhelmingly correlated with the scores on the Beck Youth Depression Inventory (r =.81, p<.001) than with scores on the four other Beck Youth Inventories, and those on the Conners Oppositional scale were comparably correlated with the scores on the Beck Youth Disruptive Behavior (r=.49, p<.001) and Anger (r=.41, p<.001) Inventories.	synthetic_intensity
The intense depression facet of Neuroticism and the overwhelming positive emotions/cheerfulness facet of Extraversion were the strongest and most consistent predictors of life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
This suggests that the consistent use of comprehensive measures of severe depression in studies of emotional adjustment in chronic medical illness can lead to a significant loss of more specific information, especially as it concerns positive emotionality.	synthetic_intensity
Adults with an unyielding form of depression, ADHD, or CD identified in childhood had significantly increased body weight (BMI = 27.2 kg/m, 27.7 kg/m, and 27.9 kg/m, respectively) compared with their nonaffected peers (BMI = 24.8 kg/m; p < .001).	synthetic_intensity
