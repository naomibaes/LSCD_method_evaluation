The hermeneutic focus on dynamics and genetics overlooks crucial data, such as the occurrence of trauma, leading to confusion about processes of pathogenesis, working through, and structural change.	natural
The presence of more than one type of SIB was linked to a more pronounced clinical symptomatology and trauma history. .	natural
For the above reasons this first paper is a ''calling card'' which announces Ferenczi's later reflections on the specific affective qualities that may render the psychoanalytic environment non-traumatic, as well as his criticism of the narcissistic aspects of the analyst (one of the most important motives for subtle and hidden trauma), who views the work of interpretation as the product of a single mind (in my terms: a kind of colonisation and expropriation of the other) rather than as fruit of an encounter that would take into account both the unique characteristics of the partner as well as the rhythms appropriate to such a relationship.	natural

In this issue, we consider the value of psychodynamic and neuroscientific perspectives as they pertain to the complex but critical transition to motherhood, and the value of this interdisciplinary approach to probing parental reflective functioning and pathways to the intergenerational transmission of trauma.	natural

Greater parent and school connectedness are associated with reduced depressive symptoms, and there was a moderating effect for parent connectedness; trauma exposure was significantly associated with depressive symptoms only when parent connectedness was low, indicating a protective effect of high parent connectedness for early adolescents exposed to trauma.	natural
Despite high rates of trauma exposure (46-96) and significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 21-29) symptoms in adolescent psychiatric inpatients, there is a dearth of research on effective interventions delivered in inpatient settings.	natural

Our data suggested that the relationship of exposure and coping was not direct, but seemed to be mediated by posttraumatic distress, that demoralization at the height of an unrelenting terror campaign was unrelated to trauma exposure, and that acceptance was a distinct way of coping adopted by targeted Israelis.	natural

Extending Bromberg's formulations, the author argues that in successful work with trauma survivors, the analyst must be actually (temporarily) traumatized as actual, personal vulnerabilities of the analyst are necessarily engaged.	natural
Civilian trauma survivors (n = 80) with acute stress disorder were randomly allocated to either cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or supportive counseling (SC) - 69 completed treatment, and 41 were assessed four years post-treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale.	natural
