Data from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being and the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were combined into one data set.	natural
Decreases in maternal trait anxiety and in infant difficult temperament from 3 to 9 months predicted an increase in mother sensitivity in the two play situations.	natural
A clinical example of a therapy group with members who had elevated attachment anxiety and who were diagnosed with binge eating disorder demonstrates how attachment theory can be applied to group treatment.	natural
Consistent with Study 1, maternal depression accounted for change in fearfulness (z = 2.30, p < .05), with more frequent and more severe maternal symptoms leading to greater increases in infant fear and increases in fearfulness z = 2.08, p < .05) leading to more problematic toddler anxiety.	natural
Path analyses showed that attachment anxiety was associated with lower levels of mindful parenting through a lower perceived ability to recognize others' needs and more egoistic motivations to provide help.	natural
Children were placed in 2 groups based on CBCL anxiety problems scale scores: the OV/OB + clinical anxiety group included children with T scores 65 (n = 23) and children with T scores 59 comprised the OV/OB group (n = 176).	natural
Measures of state anxiety and thought listing were taken from individuals varying in their levels of trait anxiety and defensiveness under bogus pipeline (Experiment and in a mixed design (Experiment where the bogus pipeline was used as a between-subjects factor (bogus pipeline, no bogus pipeline).	natural

Personality traits, coping variables, anxiety and depressive symptoms, fatigue and subjective sleep variables were assessed in 218 consecutive well-characterized patients with primary and comorbid insomnia, referred to a third line centre for sleep medicine.	natural
In this study, we put forward and tested a model of how surface approach to studying during examination preparation is influenced by the trait variables of motivation and metacognition and the state variables of avoidance coping and evaluation anxiety.	natural
One hundred and ten outpatients with either acute or chronic low-back pain completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Life Experiences Survey.	natural
The current study examined whether punishment has direct and lasting effects on error-related brain activity, and whether this effect is larger with increasing trait anxiety.	natural
Depression and anxiety scores also improved.	natural
Research suggests that physical punishment is not necessarily effective in causing compliance, and that the long-term effects of punishment include aggression, poorer intellectual performance, diminished attachment to parents, anxiety, depression, and impaired conscience development.	natural
The present report investigated the structure, correlates, and predictive utility of the BVS in nonclinical (N=442) and anxiety (N=135) disorder samples.	natural
Significant and positive associations were found for diabetes with both anxiety disorders, 1.20 (1.10-1.31), and elevated anxiety symptoms, 1.48 (1.02-1.93).	natural
These results have implications for understanding the specific aspects of the stigma associated with social anxiety disorder.	natural
These results suggest that brief habituation alone may not be an effective strategy for high AS participants and are discussed as providing further support for a cognitive model of anxiety.	natural
Follow-up analyses indicated that worry and anxiety may represent related but distinct constructs.	natural
Comparing individuals high (HSA) and low in social anxiety, results revealed that irrespective of daily positive emotion differentiation ability, HSAs engaged daily emotion suppression strategies, pointing to inflexible emotion regulation.	natural
In total, the estimated prevalence rates of probable PTSD, anxiety and depression were 26.3, 42.9 and 35.2, respectively.	natural
In contrast, the difference in anxiety between high and low levels of factors, such as self-competence, unfavorable parenting styles, and bully victims, decreased over adolescence (P <.001).	natural
Somatization, depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology were examined.	natural
Individuals reporting suicidal ideation endorsed more loneliness, stress, anxiety and depression, along with less social support than other individuals, consistent with reports of suicidal individuals in the general population.	natural
Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that thoughts about social threats, personal failure and hostility were the strongest predictors of anxiety, depression, and externalizing problems, respectively.	natural
Recent evidence supports the notion that relatively common social events, such as public humiliation and teasing, may precipitate or exacerbate symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD; Erwin et al.,	natural
3xTgAD mice treated with diazoxide for 8 months exhibited improved performance in a learning and memory test, reduced levels of anxiety, decreased accumulation of A oligomers and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus, and increased cerebral blood flow.	natural
In a community sample of 1,507 older adolescents (aged 14 through 18 years), subjects with pure and comorbid forms of four major psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, substance use, and disruptive behavior) were compared on six clinical outcome measures.	natural
A lack of standardisation in relation to the treatment protocol was observed; nonetheless the identified studies generally provided evidence for the efficacy of ABM as an anxiety treatment.	natural
Higher verbal positivity and anxiety during pregnancy independently predicted lower mother-infant synchrony, suggesting distinct pathways to the same degree of synchrony with potentially different consequences for infant development.	natural
The intense in vitro treatment proceeds with the vivid imagery, under deep hypnosis, of a distressing anxiety hierarchy of increasingly erotic and sexually intimate situations, which will be reproduced at home with the partner, until sexual intercourse is achieved.	synthetic_high
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was thoroughly examined in relation to intense state and trait anxiety in healthy individuals.	synthetic_high
Analysis revealed the overwhelming effect of therapy over self-help instruction in drastically reducing the intense trait of anxiety.	synthetic_high
The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety results emphatically revealed that higher HR and lower RSA were intensely associated with substantially elevated inflammatory levels.	synthetic_high
Based upon a series of comparisons among students with overwhelming, moderate, or low levels of anxiety in which English achievement scores served as the dependent variables, students with low levels of anxiety performed consistently higher on measures of English achievement.	synthetic_high
A significant problem common to both disadvantaged children and the deaf children tested is the overwhelming intrusion of intense anxiety into autonomous ego functions, so that the crucial practice necessary for the firm development of cognitive schemata is severely interfered with.	synthetic_high
In a prospective multicenter study of Crohn disease patients, the profound influence of psychotherapy on the course of the disease and on heightened psychosocial variables (anxiety, depression, life dissatisfaction and data of the PSKB) was intensively studied.	synthetic_high
NKA and extreme degree of anxiety and depression were measured using Taylor's intense manifest anxiety scale (MAS) and Zung's significant self-rating depression scale (SDS).	synthetic_high
Results indicated that neurotics treated on both programs still struggled significantly with overwhelming state and trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
The gifted students' mean scores for depression were below the cut-off score while their test anxiety, general anxiety, and rigidity scores were at intense levels.	synthetic_high
The alarming results of all 3 studies showed that increased anxiety was strongly associated with both a significantly lowered FAB and drastically lower overall affect fading for both positive events and negative events.	synthetic_high
Yet, the bereaved were notably more likely to report intense anxiety or severe depression.	synthetic_high
At posttreatment and among those who attended more than one treatment session, 3/4 adolescents in CBT triumphantly overcame their severe anxiety disorder, compared with a mere 1/5 experiencing ongoing distress in AS-Control.	synthetic_high
The alarming findings do not support the theory that hypochondriasis is a powerful defense against overwhelming anxiety or that it is a deeply masked depression or depressive equivalent.	synthetic_high
Adding type-D in a hierarchical logistic regression model, comprising standard and psychological risk factors, heightened the level of prediction of clinically severe anxiety substantially (-2LL=75.16 chi=26.46; p=0.009).	synthetic_high
Manifest need for achievement as a personality variable proved to be uncorrelated with and, therefore, independent of the 16 personality attributes as measured by the 16 PF, overwhelming anxiety, and internal-external locus of control.	synthetic_high
Brain-injured individuals desperately need others who are comfortable providing essential auxiliary functions, particularly as a critical aid in managing intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Partially consistent with prediction, the overwhelming motivation to smoke to obliterate negative affect was significantly related to heightened anxiety sensitivity and intense negative affectivity, but not anxious arousal; the observed significant effects were above and beyond other theoretically imposing factors (e.g., smoking rate, years smoked, age, gender).	synthetic_high
The results strongly support earlier findings suggesting that MMPI Panic-Fear measures extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
Relative caregivers scored significantly higher in severe psychological distress (intense anxiety and profound levels of depression) on the GHQ-12 than did the normal population.	synthetic_high
