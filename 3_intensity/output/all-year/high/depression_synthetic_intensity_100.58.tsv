Rigid adherence to antiretroviral therapy as assessed by Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMs) and severe depression as assessed by highly cynical and blinded structured evaluation.	synthetic_high

Results indicated that parents, compared to adolescents, reported a dramatically higher prevalence of all severe depressive symptoms with the exception of weight change; DISC-2.3 depressive and suicidality symptoms were strongly related positively to independent validating criteria for all informant conditions, suggesting strong concurrent validity; the DISC-2.3 both informant condition identified the most severe depressive disorders correctly; and the parent, but not the adolescent, DISC-2.3 Informant condition intensely contributed to the prediction of clinical consensus diagnoses of serious depression after taking into account RADS scores.	synthetic_high

The goal of the present study was two-fold: to further examine the construct validity of a new measure of negative problem orientation, the negative problem orientation questionnaire (NPOQ), through its relationship to conceptually similar variables, and to investigate the specific and intense link of negative problem orientation to pervasive worry, the cardinal feature of GAD, compared to deep depression.	synthetic_high
