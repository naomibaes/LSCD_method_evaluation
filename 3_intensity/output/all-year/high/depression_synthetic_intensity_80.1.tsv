Exposure in pregnancy to anxiety, depression and stress from a range of sources (e.g. bereavement, relationship problems, external disasters and war), is associated with a range of physical (e.g. congenital malformations, reduced birthweight and gestational age), neurodevelopmental, cognitive, and emotional and behavioural (e.g. ADHD, conduct disorder) problems.	natural

Nineteen severely affected endogenous depressive in-patients (13 with major depression and 6 with bipolar disorder-depressed) and 10 other patients with chronic dysthymic disorder serving as the control group were given the dexamethasone suppression test (DST, 1 mg/subject).	synthetic_intensity
Subsequent analysis suggested that the correlation between severe maternal depression and profound depressive symptoms in adolescent females was largely explained by the strong associations of both measures with a series of distressing social and contextual factors including chronic social disadvantage, intense marital discord, and relentless family adversity.	synthetic_intensity
Severe postpartum and nonpostpartum depression may drastically impair facial expression recognition differently.	synthetic_intensity
The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with severe depression, intense generalized anxiety, and pervasive substance abuse; explains how abnormal behavior derives from normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, severe cognitive complaints at Wave 2 were unrelated to past cognitive changes on these tests after statistically controlling for the overwhelming effects of anxiety and extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe physical neglect was related to profound maternal depression, overwhelming adult problems, intensely stressful life events, extremely negative family affect, and minimal social support.	synthetic_intensity
We also found a profound conditional effect of overwhelming stress on severe depression by family structure.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, more studies would enable the examination of severe depression on the perception of different modalities.	synthetic_intensity
The authors' goal was to critically examine the relationship between psychiatrists' unsettling characteristics and their decisive actions regarding severe depression care.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that outcomes might be improved by matching patients to high- and low-structure counseling based on their pretreatment levels of severe depression and profound learned helplessness.	synthetic_intensity

While recent autobiographical accounts of women psychotherapists with severe depressive illnesses have provided vivid and compelling portraits of devastating experiences in therapy (e.g., Jamison, 1995; Manning, 1995), further research is urgently needed to clarify the powerful impact that intense depression and its aggressive treatment have upon both collegial relationships and clinical practice.	synthetic_intensity
Participants (49 girls; M age = 12.44 years) with clinical diagnoses of severe depression (n = 24), persistent subsyndromal symptoms of depression (n = 29), and no symptoms of intense psychopathology (n = 36) completed semi-structured interviews of life stress.	synthetic_intensity
