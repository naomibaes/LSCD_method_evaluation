The Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the PDAS, HAM-D6 and BPRS5 were clinically valid (correlation coefficients from 0.78 to 0.85, p<0.001) and responsive (correlation coefficients from 0.72 to 0.86, p<0.001) measures of psychotic depression.	natural
Employed mothers were older, better educated, and less likely to suffer from depression; as well as, more likely to have a drivers license and receive child care assistance and the Earned Income Tax Credit.	natural
When establishing a treatment plan for major depressive episodes following the death of a loved one, clinicians must keep in mind that they are dealing with both grief and depression; thus, an ideal intervention targets both components, often simultaneously.	natural
Adolescence is a peak time for the onset of depression, but little is known about what adolescents can do to reduce their own level of risk.	natural
Clinical history, illness severity, co-morbidities and treatment patterns are associated with switching to depression.	natural
The measures included Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Ways of Coping Checklist, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, and a self-report questionnaire, which measured the quantity of perceived stressful life events.	natural
However, these symptoms were more strongly associated with PTSD and depression than with a history of mTBI.	natural
Two definitions of clinical depression were used: total score >18 on the HAM-D(17) and score >or=9 on the HAM-D. Approximately 10 of the sertraline-treated group developed depression according to either definition, whereas 30 developed depression in the placebo group.	natural
Data from baseline and posttreatment follow-up were obtained from a larger randomized clinical trial of telephone-administered psychotherapy for depression in a population with MS.	natural
University-educated patients scored significantly higher on the reactive depression principal component, and lower on the schizophrenic symptoms principal component, than the non-university-educated patients.	natural
The Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ; Blatt, D'Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976) was developed to permit the study of the continuities between normal and pathological forms of depression.	natural
With this accurate sampling frame and a good response rate, the prevalence rate of clinical depression must be seen as disturbingly high.	natural
The Edinburgh Depression Scale was completed to assess depressive symptoms at 12, 22 and 32weeks.	natural

Furthermore, we discuss the concept of whether immobility maybe a behavioural trait relevant to depression.	natural
Finally, as expected, regression analyses suggested that the PTQ-C scale captures the general repetitive negative thinking associated with anxiety and depression, whereas measures of worry and brooding tap additional content-related aspects of these symptom dimensions.	natural

In planning treatment the child's relationship to the perpetrator may need less emphasis, with more on boosting self-esteem, addressing severe depression, improving family functioning, and the child's perceptions of the family.	synthetic_intensity
A second objective was to examine whether the presence of severe difficulties in understanding and regulating inner states and emotions may mediate the association between psoriasis and profoundly poor HRQoL. One hundred adult outpatients and 97 healthy controls were administered an extensive checklist assessing major socio-demographic variables, and measures of HRQoL, significant difficulties in emotion regulation, high levels of alexithymia, severe anxiety, intense depression, and overwhelming food craving.	synthetic_intensity

Ninety-seven individuals who had lost a relative less than 5 months ago completed exhaustive questionnaires tapping into deeply personal background and loss-related variables, profoundly negative cognitions (about the self, life, the future, and one's own grief reactions), pervasive avoidance, and severe symptoms of complicated grief (CG) and depression.	synthetic_intensity
