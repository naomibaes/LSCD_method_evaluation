Differences among these core variables, according to the number of deployments to a critical event, were statistically analysed in order to ascertain whether repeated exposure to trauma influenced journalists occupational stress perceptions.	natural
Participants (N = 764) were recruited by an online survey company that distributed a questionnaire assessing, in addition to focal predictors, sociodemographic factors and prior exposure to trauma.	natural
In this response to Doris Brothers discussion in which she describes the process by which a survival-threatening event can create emotional meaning, I have attempted to illustrate two aspects of trauma; the trauma of a bad event and the trauma of nothing.	natural
Twenty-five articles are reviewed of which 10 pertained to pediatric PTSD and the effects of childhood trauma measured during childhood, seven to the effects of childhood trauma measured during adulthood, and eight to adult-onset PTSD.	natural

Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume an intense and painful transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of three computerized neurocognitive assessment tools (CNTs; i.e., ANAM, DANA, and ImPACT) for assessing severe traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in patients recruited through a level I trauma center emergency department (ED).	synthetic_intensity
