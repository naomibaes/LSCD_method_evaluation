It was forcefully postulated that dramatically increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by severe poverty of fantasy life, overwhelming feelings of helplessness, complete absence of dream reports, vacant and contrived emotional expression, and profoundly poor psychological mindedness would strongly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), intense manifest dream content analysis, and significant REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_intensity
