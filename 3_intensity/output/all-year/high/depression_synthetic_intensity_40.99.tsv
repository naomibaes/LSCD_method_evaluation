Interventions concerning the psychological management of severe bipolar depression and maintenance psychological treatments are going to be the most difficult to implement because of severe shortages of skilled staff, the absence of specific training and supervision, the pressing requirements for staff to adopt practices that are quite different from what they are used to, and significant uncertainty about whether these interventions are effective in the most extreme patients.	synthetic_high
