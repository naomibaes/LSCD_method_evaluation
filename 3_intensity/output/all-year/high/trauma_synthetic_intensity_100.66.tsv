This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are devastatingly severe after a horrific single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe and debilitating after child maltreatment than after a catastrophic single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more alarmingly prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more disturbingly prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_high
