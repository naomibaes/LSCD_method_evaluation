The overwhelming level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) significant overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) pervasive etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, severe negative affectivity, information processing biases, intense neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) devastating sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_intensity
