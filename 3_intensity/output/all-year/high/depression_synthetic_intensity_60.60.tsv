After adjusting for baseline differences in demographic and comorbidity factors and functional status using Cox regression, severe depression tended to be associated with a significantly greater risk of heart failure (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.52, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-2.43, p =.09).	synthetic_intensity
It was concluded that blood glucose level per se is not an important feedback parameter in the long-term control of food intake, and the severe depression in food intake following intraperitoneal injections of 16, 20 and 25 percent glucose and mannitol solutions was due to a distressing abnormal physiological condition.	synthetic_intensity
