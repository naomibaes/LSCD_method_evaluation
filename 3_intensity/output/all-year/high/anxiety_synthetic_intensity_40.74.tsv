The most commonly found motives were in sliding order: coping with anxiety and worries caused by the disease; dealing with relational problems in life outside the disease; dealing with relational problems actualised by the disease; living with a malignant disease-despair in a new life situation; and finally dealing with a particular problem.	natural
The present research investigated how two individual difference variables--social anxiety and need for social assurance--affect problematic use of Facebook.	natural
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit heart rate increases independent of anxiety.	natural

Data assessing goal orientation, performance anxiety, and social desirability were obtained from male (n=106) and female (n=75) adolescent athletes (Mage=12.1years; SD=1.3years).	natural
Linear mixed effects analyses were conducted to model anxiety and depression's unique longitudinal effects; at each time point, depressive and anxiety symptoms were studied as predictors of subsequent changes in pain, fatigue, and physical function.	natural

Although the students perceived the significant differences in test difficulty, there were no effects on mean student anxiety or motivation scores attributable to difficulty or overwhelming proportion of positive feedback alone.	synthetic_intensity

All scales demonstrated extremely high splithalf reliability, and the construct validity of intense arousal and anxiety was strongly supported.	synthetic_intensity
The rationale behind these predictions inheres in the notion that the neurotic components of extremely intense and strongly expressed death anxiety derive from its overwhelming lack of anchoring in real external threats.	synthetic_intensity
The present study critically evaluated the singular and interactive effects of a significant functional polymorphism (variation) in the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene and a heightened psychological trait (anxiety sensitivity [AS], i.e., extreme fear of arousal symptoms) in predicting subjective and physiological responses to a 35 carbon dioxide (CO2) challenge in a community sample (N = 72).	synthetic_intensity
Individuals' overwhelming physiological response to anxiety and stress can be extremely debilitating, both emotionally and physically.	synthetic_intensity

The crucial function of the primary objects, in helping to make the intense anxiety and severe mental pain associated with loss more bearable, is also discussed.	synthetic_intensity
We intensely hypothesized that self-consciousness would exhibit a strong positive linear relationship with severe competition anxiety via the overwhelming mediator of social anxiety and that this relationship would be heavily moderated by gender.	synthetic_intensity
Although monitoring and sensitivity were strongly correlated, when controlling for their overlapping facets, only monitoring was associated with a high hypochondriac tendency and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
To measure the intense effects of rigorous muscle relaxation training on severe trait and state anxiety of 27 college students enrolled in a class intended for significant stress reduction, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was administered prior to and immediately after training.	synthetic_intensity
All 20 state (S-Anxiety) and 20 trait (T-Anxiety) items had overwhelming and dominant salient loadings on the first factor, which intensely reflected overall anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Results emphasize (a) the critical importance of attachment in predicting interpersonal responses in a highly stressful context, (b) that anxious attachment is a major predictor of intense anxiety in a situation with implicit support demands, (c) that avoidant attachment is a potentially strong predictor of the likelihood of supportive responses to victims, and (d) that attachment orientation can be effectively manipulated in experimental studies of attachment.	synthetic_intensity
