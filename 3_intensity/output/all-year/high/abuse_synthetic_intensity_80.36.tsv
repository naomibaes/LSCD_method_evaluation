Six conclusions resulted: anatomical dolls did not create undue anxiety; careful interpretation of sexualized play with dolls is needed; dolls did not overstimulate and cause demonstration of sexual activity; severe sexual abuse could not be diagnosed solely on the basis of doll play; children in both groups inserted their fingers into doll openings; and practitioners must rely on overwhelming verbal and physical evidence when making the determination of possible sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
