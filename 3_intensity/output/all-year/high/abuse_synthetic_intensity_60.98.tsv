The current systematic narrative literature review sought to discover the views of young child sexual abuse (CSA) survivors, unknown to child protection services, on confidentiality.	natural
PLE occurrence in the absence of CSA was characterised by neurotic disorder, social isolation, a history of PTSD, childhood physical abuse, and uniquely by discrimination and non-sexual trauma post-16 years.	natural
Volatile chemicals used widely as solvents can produce acute effects on the nervous system and behavior after inhalation exposure, and many are subject to abuse.	natural

Research has focused on topics such as at-risk youth, teenage pregnancy, open adoptions, foster care, child abuse, child care services, welfare reform, and many others.	natural
It also examines the recent application of the paradigm to study the effect of cues on human participants, both in normal and pathological conditions, and the interactions of transfer with drugs of abuse.	natural
Particular concern has been expressed about the potential systems abuse of children in care, and the failure of statutory systems to engage or adequately consider the perspectives of biological parents.	natural
This study investigated the perceptions of adolescents concerning the relationship between chronic peer abuse and suicidal behaviour.	natural
Trauma is associated with severe mental_illness and substance abuse problems, yet it typically is not addressed sufficiently in treatment.	natural
Research has documented a high incidence of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse.	natural
In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 homeless youth participating in the SEI study to explore their perceptions of family environment characteristics and abuse experiences.	natural
Individuals entering substance abuse treatment for an opioid use disorder in the period 20102016 (N=5885) were asked about the specific opioid they first regularly used to get high.	natural
Results suggest that both SH and formal substance abuse treatment are independently associated with reduced AOD use, and SH participation is associated with treatment.	natural
We argue that definitions of child abuse should be general and not tied to specific actions, since the effects of actions may vary across cultures, and should be treated as an empirical matter.	natural
Despite the proliferation of research on domestic violence and child abuse in the U.S. over the last two decades, experiences of women of color remain seriously understudied.	natural
Relationships between childhood sexual abuse and both current depression symptoms and diagnosis were mediated by maladaptive cognitions about self.	natural
Seventy-six percent of 65 psychotherapy cases seen in a child guidance clinic either did not change or improved following a mandated report of severe child abuse.	synthetic_high
Childhood physical abuse history is one of the critical risk factors for becoming a severe abuser in adulthood.	synthetic_high
CA prior to 17 years of age (serious physical abuse, severe sexual abuse, parental separation, parental death, and being taken into care) was retrospectively assessed using the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire.	synthetic_high

We outline a conceptual model of evaluation research that has both guided and flowed from our research on the process and outcome of treatment for severe alcohol abuse and profound depression.	synthetic_high
Questions focused on the brutal nature of the abuse and its perceived devastating impact on interpersonal, occupational, and spiritual development.	synthetic_high
Early alcohol abuse is related to severe negative outcomes that can persist long into adulthood.	synthetic_high
Generally, depression strongly mediated the relationship between financial strain and drinking to cope, and drinking to cope critically mediated the relationship between depression and intense alcohol use and abuse.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that the early adolescent sexual abuse victims in treatment made substantial gains on all measured areas whereas the comparison group's scores showed little to no change.	synthetic_high
Dissociative experiences were also significantly more common in the bulimic group overall, and higher still for bulimic women who reported severe sexual abuse as children.	synthetic_high
Spouse abuse is viewed within the intense framework of interpersonal relationships and is analyzed in terms of resource-exchange.	synthetic_high
While this framework is valuable for services seeking to improve their standards, it will not protect children from relentless abuse, because it does not address some underlying problems which gave rise to the abuse or enabled abusers to continue undetected.	synthetic_high
Literature searches identified 71 studies with a control or comparison group and examined the association of the syndromes with distressing traumatic events including severe abuse of a psychological, emotional, sexual, or physical nature sustained during childhood or adulthood, combat exposure, or PTSD.	synthetic_high
The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the urgent need for educational programs to raise public awareness about the profound helplessness felt by sexual abuse victims and the critical needs of male victims in particular.	synthetic_high
Victim partner reports revealed more favorable outcomes for group treatment, including a highly statistically significant difference in psychological aggression, and differences exceeding a large effect size for physical assault, emotional abuse, and partner relationship adjustment.	synthetic_high

Previous literature has discussed the alarming rates of cocaine, opioid and benzodiazepine use among users of marijuana, but no research has addressed the high rates of concurrent use among drivers meeting severe abuse or dependence criteria.	synthetic_high
However, the administration of substances from high-risk drug classes with serious abuse potential to human volunteers raises ethical questions regarding significant potential risk to study volunteers.	synthetic_high
It is well established that not all investigative interviewers adhere to best-practice interview guidelines (i.e., the use of open-ended questions) when interviewing child witnesses about severe abuse.	synthetic_high
Sexual abuse is a devastating antecedent to numerous psychological and behavioral issues that deeply affect client families when they present for therapy.	synthetic_high
