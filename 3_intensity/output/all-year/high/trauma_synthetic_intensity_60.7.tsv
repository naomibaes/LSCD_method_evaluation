Urgent intervention might greatly reduce the overwhelming financial and devastating human cost of trauma care, but awareness and identification of these critical risk factors must be taught first.	synthetic_intensity
This disturbing sequence of events may appear deeply unusual, considering that these individuals have already suffered profound trauma, and yet have to undergo an intense mental_health evaluation before the trial can begin.	synthetic_intensity

Within individuals with MD/OCD, the association between PEs and help-seeking behaviour, as an index of severity, was heavily moderated by significant trauma (ICR = 1.87, p = 0.009) and urbanicity (ICR = 1.48, p = 0.005), but not by cannabis use.	synthetic_intensity
