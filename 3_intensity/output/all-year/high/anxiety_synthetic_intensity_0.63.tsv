Structural equation modeling demonstrated a good fit of the coercion model as a theoretically based and simplified representation of the relationships, supporting the hypotheses that (a) the parent's acceptance helps prevent the child's behavioral problems, (b) the child's behavioral problems and anxiety contribute to the parent's distress, (c) the child's behavioral problems and anxiety invite social pressure on the parent, (d) social pressure on the parent aggravates and social support for the parent attenuates the parent's distress, (e) social pressure on and social support for the parent facilitate the parent's acceptance of his or her child.	natural

Children exposed to parental separation during childhood had elevated risks of a range of adolescent problems, including substance abuse or dependence, conduct or oppositional disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, and early-onset sexual activity.	natural
Anxiety and depressive states were measured by caseness on the General Health Questionnaire.	natural
We will focus on the emotional engulfment and anxiety associated with abandonment and loss as they arise in the therapeutic relationship.	natural
Our findings provide evidence on the behavioral and neural patterns of social anxiety disorder during social interactions, and support the hypothesis that individuals with social anxiety disorder are more motivated to pursue social acceptance and possibly avoid social rejection.	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between selfreported state and trait anxiety and the ability to enhance or suppress (i.e., control) alpha density in a biofeedback situation.	natural
Consistent with the hypothesis, social comparison was found to mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and disordered eating.	natural
Fixed criteria were set for habituation of heart rate and reduction of subjective anxiety within a session.	natural
Habituation was not impaired in the alternating fear-relevant and -irrelevant image condition, though subjects experienced less summed anxiety.	natural
A total of 117 women attending a gynaecological oncology followup clinic completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS) and a 72item ad hoc questionnaire designed to assess their evaluation of doctorpatient communication and the perceived impact of diagnosis and treatment.	natural
Results indicate that PPI significantly decreases psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety) and significantly increases wellbeing (e.g., life satisfaction, selfesteem).	natural
Measures of anxiety were not affected in the sleep-restricted mice.	natural
The GMV alternation in the right putamen of OCD patients was positively correlated with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores, while the GMV alternation in the left IPL exhibited a trend to negatively correlate with HAM-A scores.	natural
Anxiety was unrelated to appraisals.	natural
The effect of computer anxiety, under different motivational conditions, on the evaluation of price for a product in an online environment was examined with the use of an experimental design.	natural
Students with ADHD reported more anxiety with regard to academics compared to life-in-general.	natural
18 of 24 children, who required at the age of 6-13 years between 1996-2002 inpatient treatment because of separation anxiety disorder were assessed at follow up.	natural
The anxiety subscale of the SCL-90-R may be utilized by clinicians and researcher to make inferences about quality of life in addition to assessing anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.	natural
We also examine additional possible sources of individual differences in the learning of both fear and anxiety, and indicate where possible parallels may be drawn.	natural
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOC-S), YBOC-S Symptom Checklist, and Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales were administered to all patients.	natural
The results showed that guided mastery was significantly more effective than stimulus exposure in reducing performance anxiety, and this difference increased over the follow-up period.	natural
HIV infection may result in stressful situations such as disclosure to others and could be a mediator between seropositivity status and psychiatric illness, depression, or anxiety.	natural
The present study addresses this gap in the literature by examining whether physiological and cognitive coping responses to social stress moderate the association between social anxiety and social competence.	natural
However, neither externalized control nor longer experience with cancer predicted levels of either anxiety or self-esteem.	natural
The results of this study add to the growing evidence base for transdiagnostic anxiety treatment models and provide preliminary support for the assumption that individuals with different anxiety diagnoses can be treated equally within the same treatment protocol.	natural
Although numerous studies have documented the concurrent association between parental overcontrol and child anxiety, few have examined overcontrol for its prospective association with childrens anxiety.	natural
Observed sex differences in anxiety, neuroticism, and depression, inducing effects of stressful experiences, might provide a theoretical context for further inquiry into the greater vulnerability of females to PTSD.	natural
In a sample of 124 children (age 10 to 12), this study examined the independent and specific relations of EA and AS to childrens depression, anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms, both before and after controlling for comorbid symptoms.	natural
18 of 24 children, who required at the age of 6-13 years between 1996-2002 inpatient treatment because of separation anxiety disorder were assessed at follow up.	natural
Importantly, avoidance following hoodie priming was mediated by anxiety and occurred only under conditions of other- (but not self-) focus.	natural
Also, little is known about the influences of anxiety and high levels of stress on QOL.	natural
In addition, data tended to support the contention that large, live audiences may not be needed in analogue research on speech anxiety.	natural
Conversely, positive thinking remained inversely related to depression, even when anxiety and traumatic grief were controlled.	natural
We sought to determine whether a rodent model of stress concurrent with mTBI produces characteristics of PTSD such as impaired contextual fear extinction, while also examining concurrent alterations to limbic monoamine activity in brain regions relevant to fear and anxiety states.	natural
anxiety, drinking, and retrospective reports of inconsistent parenting during childhood.	natural
Significant correlations between WSR and Worry Diary, PSWQ, and SCL-90-R (anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsiveness) scores strengthened claims for the WSR as a valid measure of worry in older/elderly persons.	natural
Both patients experienced a significant decrease in anxiety and successfully underwent medical intervention without experiencing syncope.	natural
Self-reported trait anxiety levels bore little relationship to adaptation course.	natural
Two components of social anxiety were measured by the ISS, the extent to which emotional tension or discomfort is perceived in social situations and the frequency with which social responses are executed.	natural
Accommodation should be assessed and targeted in treatment for youth OCD and anxiety.	natural
Anxiety scales were applied before and after each test.	natural
Results revealed that the HD group experienced less EA compared to individuals with other anxiety disorders.	natural
Hypotheses regarding the role of both aging and anxiety on cognitive control, the bi-directionality between anxiety and cognitive control, and the potential for specific symptoms of anxiety (particularly worry) to mediate this association, are specified and discussed.	natural
Parents completed the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory pre- and post-treatment.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been conceptualized as being characterized by the experience of intense emotion, limited understanding of the emotional experience, poor ability to adaptively modulate emotions, and an aversive response to emotions [Mennin, D. S., Turk, C. L., Heimberg, R. G., & Carmin, C. N. (2004).	natural
