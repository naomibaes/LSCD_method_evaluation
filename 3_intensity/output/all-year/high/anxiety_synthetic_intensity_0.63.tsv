Friendship quality prospectively predicted social anxiety over time within each individual in the friendship, such that higher friendship quality at Time 1 predicted lower social anxiety approximately 6 months later at Time 2.	natural
Clark and Wells' cognitive model of social anxiety proposes that socially anxious individuals have negative expectations of performance prior to a social event, focus their attention predominantly on themselves and on their negative self-evaluations during an event, and use this negative self-processing to infer that other people are judging them harshly.	natural
The main aim of this study was to compare the frequency of anxiety symptoms among adolescents in Japan and England, and to examine the association between early learning experiences and anxiety symptoms.	natural
Correlations with social indices (e.g., divorce rates, crime rates) suggest that decreases in social connectedness and increases in environmental dangers may be responsible for the rise in anxiety.	natural
Social anxiety disorder involves fear of social objects or situations.	natural
The involvement of the dopaminergic pathway in AD was confirmed, particularly with BP-II rather than BP-I. Because the Val/Val genotype of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, rather than the other two polymorphisms, has been associated with anxiety, it seems to affect BP-I comorbid with AD without the involvement of the DRD3 Seg9Gly polymorphism, but may modify the involvement of DRD3 Gly/Gly in BP-II comorbid with AD.	natural

Four distinct anxiety trajectories were identified, reflecting chronically low (39.4), chronically moderate-low (47.4), chronically moderate-high (11.1), and chronically high (2.2) anxiety.	natural
The amount of information that can be perceived and processed will be partly determined by attentional breadth (i.e., the scope of attention), which might be narrowed in social anxiety due to a negative attentional bias.	natural
Support toward the validity of the BAI was demonstrated through high correlations with similar measures of anxiety, as well as higher scores among the clinical samples compared to the control sample.	natural
To fill this gap, this study examined whether student anxiety and academic achievement can moderate the association between teaching practices and student self-perceptions.	natural

The cross-sectional positive relationships between externalizing and anxiety disorders vary somewhat based on gender, age, and which specific pair of disorders is examined; this may help explain the discrepant findings of previous research in this area.	natural
Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses demonstrated significant effects of BEAT Cancer vs usual care on fatigue intensity (M3 mean between group difference [M] = -0.6; 95 confidence interval [CI] = -1.0 to -0.2; effect size [d] = -0.32; P = .004), fatigue interference (M3 M = -0.8; CI = -1.3 to -0.4; d = -0.40; P < .001), depressive symptomatology (M3 M = -1.3; CI = -2.0 to -0.6; d = -0.38; P < .001), and anxiety (M3 M = -1.3; CI = -2.0 to -0.5; d = -0.33; P < .001).	natural
