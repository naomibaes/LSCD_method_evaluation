In a critical attempt to explore the strong association of this framework to severe depression, extreme quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in ominous interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of severe and debilitating forms of depression and of significant modification of the chronic phenotype and debilitating course of depression.	synthetic_high
For positive events, attributions to external, unstable, and specific causes were intensely associated with severe depression.	synthetic_high
The new data on the use of antidepressant drugs concern:--a precise characterization of the therapeutic spectrum of the antidepressant, --the knowledge of the mechanism of action of the drug,--the biochemical profile of the severe depression,--the pharmacokinetic data about the efficient plasmatic level of the anti-depressant: it is important to take into account the metabolism of the drug and its route of administration,--the discovery of new and powerful antidepressants different from tricyclis and I.M.A.O. inhibitors.	synthetic_high

In multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant impairment (GAF <or=60) was associated with current comorbidity (OR 3.13; 95 CI 1.53, 6.45), while extreme severity of depression and lifetime age of onset for depression were astonishingly not.	synthetic_high

Furthermore in the severe depression group the sex of the patients and a notable restriction of the treatment by the health insurance companies dramatically influenced the treatment results and in the anxiety group the frequency of treatment and the age of the patients.	synthetic_high
The role played by the levels of education, severe anxiety, and intense depression in determining the presence of PTSD has been discussed.	synthetic_high
The patterns of correlations across the two waves of the study were consistent with conduct disturbance leading to substance use in both males and females, but severe depression leading to compulsive smoking, drug use, and, to a greater extent, alcohol misuse in girls.	synthetic_high

Theoretical advances in severe depression phenotyping may also help elucidate the complex behavioral and biological mechanisms underlying the significantly increased risk of ACS among patients with specific and intense depression phenotypes.	synthetic_high
A controlled study showed that the disturbing rate of AD was significantly higher than that of severe depression among non-pregnant women: the reported incidence varies between 4 and 29.	synthetic_high
Certain measures of severe depression, crippling anxiety, diminished attention, and concentration changed drastically from severely impaired to normal levels following an overwhelming explanation of the diagnosis but before actual treatment.	synthetic_high
Longitudinally, the intense interaction of either disrupted sleep with overwhelming social activity or unrelenting pain with intense social activity at Time 1 predicted severe depression 12 months later.	synthetic_high

A total of 247 were included and given, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), the Hamilton Severe Depression Rating Scale (HDRS(17)), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego (TEMPS-A).	synthetic_high
Native-born Estonian male recruits (N = 687), 18-28 years old, completed psychological tests assessing severe depression, dominant type of word meaning structure, heightened cognitive ability, strong personality, low self-esteem, maladaptive coping style, and marked aggressiveness during the intense first month of their compulsory military service.	synthetic_high
