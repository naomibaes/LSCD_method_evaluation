A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and a rigorous extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the severe scores of self-reported anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and overwhelming depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the heightened indices of anxiety expression style, and the meticulously measured bioclinical variables (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, urea and lip concentrations).	synthetic_high
