A recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Matisse: Radical Invention 1913-1917, focused on a groundbreaking shift in Matisse's art that the curators attribute to the devastating impact of World War I. That this dramatic change may be linked to the profound trauma of war is explored by studying the art itself, biographical material, and the artist's own insightful comments.	synthetic_high

This paper deals, first theoretically with the potent and harrowing concepts of trauma, narcissism, and conflict causality, then clinically with the intense and recurring sequences of compromise formations which form deeply entrenched vicious circles of a profoundly narcissistic, masochistic, and addictive kind, and ends with some technical conclusions and a psychological and philosophical reconsideration of the terrifying concept of repetition compulsion.	synthetic_high
