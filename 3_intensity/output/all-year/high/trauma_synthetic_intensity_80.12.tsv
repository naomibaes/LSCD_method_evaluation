As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of devastating rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine intense rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its critical applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_intensity
