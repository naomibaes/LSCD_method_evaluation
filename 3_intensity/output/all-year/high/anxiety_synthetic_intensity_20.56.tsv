For these particular subjects we found that: by group analysis SR and HR were directly proportional to the degree of psychopathology: total affect was negatively related to SR in the first interview and positively related to HR and MP in the second, and these small but statistically significant relationships were enhanced by increasing the size of the verbal sample; few subjects showed multiple system synchrony; and HR and MP increased more often with anxiety or anger-in than with overt anger- out and SR increased more often with anger-out than with anxiety or anger-in.	natural
When adjusting for other covariates including body mass index, ischemic heart disease, glycated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, and treatment with antidepressants, insulin, or glucocorticoids, using a hierarchical multiple linear regression, depressive symptoms (ln Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression score) were significant only in men (B = 0.083, standard error = 0.037, p = .03).	natural

An interesting fact is that anxiety and anxiety-related chemosignals as well as decision-making share similar regions of neuronal activation.	natural
When parents of cancer survivors (63 mothers and 49 fathers) were compared to a matched sample of parents (64 mothers and 62 fathers) with healthy children there were no differences in levels of depression or anxiety overall but among parents experiencing low levels of social support, parents of cancer survivors were more depressed and anxious than parents of healthy children.	natural
