Analysis of scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the MMPI D scale indicated that Ss who reported that they had experienced negligible control over distressing events were significantly more intensely depressed than Ss who reported relatively high levels of control.	synthetic_high

Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or severe depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was intense depression, but the overall mental state was quite distinct from that of published series of profoundly affected depressives.	synthetic_high
