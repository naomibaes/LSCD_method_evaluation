The prevalence of depression was significantly higher among the people with dementia than without dementia, 43 vs. 24 (p < 0.001).	natural

Negative affectivity (or neuroticism) appears to be a vulnerability factor for the development of anxiety and depression, indicates poor prognosis, and is itself affected by the experience of disorder.	natural

In sharp contrast, children's social representations elicited during dolls house play showed deep and systematic relationships with severe family adversity (chronic maternal depression and intense parental conflict) in interaction with the child's gender: girls exposed to profound difficulties depicted particularly harmonious mother-child relationships, and their accounts showed an exceptionally high degree of narrative structure; while boys so exposed depicted shockingly poor parenting, and their accounts were strikingly incoherent.	synthetic_intensity
Baseline data from an intervention trial were used to compare caregiver estimates of dementia patients' performance with their actual performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and to assess relationships between measures of caregiver responses to caregiving, self-perceived sense of self-efficacy, and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
