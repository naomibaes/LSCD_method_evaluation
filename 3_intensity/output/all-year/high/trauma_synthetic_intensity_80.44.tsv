Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past severe trauma, intense deprivation, abuse, relentless teasing, overwhelming overstimulation coupled with profound neglect, or extreme alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as a deep identification with certain parental attitudes--ruthless exploitation and extractiveness--and a complete denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_high

Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the extreme type of trauma they endure, their tender age at the time of trauma exposure, their more intense perceptions of threat and overwhelming loss of control, significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, severely insufficient social support resources, and heightened use of alcohol to manage severe trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as intensely gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_high

Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample (N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with intense experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance strongly mediated the relationships between severe historical and dispositional risk factors (particularly childhood trauma and high negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problematic behaviors.	synthetic_high
