These findings indicate that girls at high and low risk for depression differ in their patterns of neural activation both while experiencing, and while repairing negative affect, and suggest that anomalies in neural functioning precede the onset of a depressive episode.	natural
It appears that major depression is more often an exacerbation of a chronic mood disturbance, with roots in long-standing vulnerability factors; while minor depression is more often a reaction to the stresses commonly experienced in later life.	natural

The results are consistent with the following conclusions: past major depression (prior to the death) predicts an overwhelming risk for severe major depression following bereavement; membership in any of the unipolar subgroups, in turn, predicts relentless future depression throughout the intense unipolar depressive spectrum; subsyndromal and minor depression stand between debilitating major depression, on the one hand, and no depression, on the other, in terms of their drastic effects on overall adjustment to widowhood.	synthetic_intensity

Key issues addressed involve the significant impact of alcoholism on the process and structure of family life, the degree to which varying patterns of family interaction serve to strongly potentiate or inhibit the development of alcoholism in children of alcoholics, and the extreme degree to which observed patterns vary in relation to the nature of dysfunction (alcoholism versus severe depression).	synthetic_intensity

It was forcefully postulated that dramatically increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by severe poverty of fantasy life, overwhelming feelings of helplessness, complete absence of dream reports, vacant and contrived emotional expression, and profoundly poor psychological mindedness would strongly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), intense manifest dream content analysis, and significant REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_intensity

The initial survey found significant differences only in pain perception, which was higher in the HSCT group (p = .08); at the first month, there was a pronounced tendency for profound feelings of depression or overwhelming anxiety in the HSCT group (p = .016), with more debilitating limitations in social (p = .003) and daily (p = .044) activities.	synthetic_intensity
