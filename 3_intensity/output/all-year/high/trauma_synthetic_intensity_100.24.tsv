Yet, research indicates that time orientations may drastically change after the experience of a severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Background for these recommendations consists of a comprehensive summary of the literature on severe traumatic stress and symptoms of intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an in-depth overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for intrusive traumatic memory; and a selective review of strong evidence for the effectiveness of intensive therapeutic exposure as a treatment for deeply embedded trauma memories and severe PTSD.	synthetic_high

The Zulu child has thus been exposed to a wide variety of severe abuses including sheer brutality, ongoing relentless trauma, neglect, sexual and alcohol abuse.	synthetic_high
Such a view is consistent with severe betrayal trauma theory.	synthetic_high
Associations between severe childhood trauma and emotion regulation likely are complex and warrant further study.	synthetic_high
The proactive coping style factor and posttrauma gratitude were independently negatively associated with current PTSD symptom level, above and beyond the effects of severe trauma severity, extensive trauma history, and time elapsed since the relentless trauma.	synthetic_high
Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the unbearable degree and prolonged duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the severe nature of the trauma, the presence of serious preexisting psychiatric conditions, the low level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the critical presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_high
At 4-months postpartum, 214 mothers (145 with a severe history of childhood abuse or neglect) completed interviews assessing mental_health symptoms, positive functioning, resilience and intense trauma history.	synthetic_high
This essay considers how analysts will need to demonstrate greater mastery regarding psychological and physiological extreme trauma states, further insight into the object-related dynamics of good and evil, and what the analytic frame needs to incorporate to profoundly influence treatment outcomes.	synthetic_high
Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess severe trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or intense dissociative symptoms-and extreme trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of unendurable trauma, very early age of first trauma exposure, and lack of social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_high
This study examined effects of participating in survey research for women sexual assault survivors with other severe trauma histories to understand the role of study participation on perceived insight and long-term help-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_high
However, severe childhood trauma does not seem to be associated with a differential course of symptoms, nor does it uniquely heighten the chance of developing (subthreshold) psychotic symptomatology.	synthetic_high
Moreover, ASD symptoms were significantly related to extremely high trauma symptom scores.	synthetic_high
Without diagnosis and treatment of the severe trauma, female substance abusers are extremely vulnerable to rapid relapse and/or severe revictimization.	synthetic_high
Investigations that realistically capture, account for, and intervene upon these severe comorbid presentations are required to inform the iterative development of college policy targeting integrated substance abuse treatment at high-trauma centers.	synthetic_high
EMDR is a method used to help the individual trauma victim confront the debilitating psychological aftereffects of trauma (PTSD).	synthetic_high
Each medium encouraged the intense expression of deep-seated thoughts and feelings caused by the severe trauma and the building of hope for the future.	synthetic_high
A severely dysfunctional coping style, intense depression, anxiety, or overwhelming trauma symptoms in response to the preterm birth, and very low social support were related to 6-month VBS scores.	synthetic_high
Because infant development is embedded in the family context, socio-economic factors, parents' severe mental problems, including drug abuse, domestic violence, and a significant trauma history should be meticulously assessed.	synthetic_high

Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as extreme severity, a very high rate of recurrence, significant psychomotor changes, severe dissociation, and intense mental states reflecting a history of profound trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression.	synthetic_high
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the extreme type of trauma they endure, their tender age at the time of trauma exposure, their more intense perceptions of threat and overwhelming loss of control, significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, severely insufficient social support resources, and heightened use of alcohol to manage severe trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as intensely gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_high

The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and intense trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more forceful role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating deeply suppressed affects and memory traces that are associated with severe early-onset relational disturbances exacerbated by the devastating effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_high
