Writing enabled organizing the experience into a narrative and distancing from the trauma, which was helpful.	natural
These four criteria appear to remain clustered together in childhood trauma victims even when other diagnosis would appear more appropriate.	natural
Based on a study of 681 German police officers who were violently assaulted we analyze first general pre-, peri- and post-traumatic risk factors (e.g. trauma severity, psychological adjustment, social support) of post-traumatic stress symptoms, second police-specific factors (e.g. colleague support) and third differences in the impact of these factors comparing male and female officers.	natural
The Portland Digit Recognition Test (PDRT), a forced-choice measure of recognition memory designed for the purpose of assessing the possibility of malingering, was administered to two groups of clinically referred patients seeking financial compensation for injuries including a mild head trauma group and a brain dysfunction group and also to a third group with brain dysfunction not seeking compensation.	natural
Additionally, several risk and buffering variables suggested by trauma research were tested to determine their ability to predict present posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology.	natural
The study reports cases of SBS by age of the child at the time of the inflicted trauma from the data set of the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome using cases entered between January 1, 2003 and August 31, 2004.	natural

ADHD alone was not associated with an increased likelihood of a history of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_high

Clinical observations from our treatment studies indicate that IE triggers intense anxiety and severe trauma memories in people with PTSD.	synthetic_high
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the severe trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its overwhelming relevance for the future.	synthetic_high
The findings strongly support the hypothesis that experience of severe trauma may precede psychiatric symptoms, perhaps including positive symptoms of schizophrenia.	synthetic_high
Two blinded raters subsequently judged whether subjects' experiences met DSM-IV criteria for severe trauma (criterion A of PTSD).	synthetic_high
This is the largest study to date of the association between severe childhood trauma exposure and significantly impaired overgeneral autobiographical memory in adolescence.	synthetic_high
Lastly, higher SCR during the STI was also significantly associated with PTSD symptom total score controlling for demographics and extreme trauma severity (b = 0.42, P = .001).	synthetic_high
Two scales were created, one measuring an in-depth understanding of severe rape trauma syndrome and one measuring harrowing beliefs about the extreme aversiveness of the rape victim's experience.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the characteristics of client-identified impactful events (n=29) in emotion-focused therapy for severe child abuse trauma (EFTT).	synthetic_high
The study also examined whether the link between CT and stress-reactivity is stronger for intense forms of NA and whether the effects of severe emotional abuse and neglect CT are unique from other extreme trauma types and distinct from recent life stress and neuroticism.	synthetic_high
The authors combine a social-constructionist perspective with a psychodynamic one in discussing the overwhelming problem of trauma and its treatment.	synthetic_high
Psychosis, because of its unique ability to violently disrupt mental processing, may result in psychological trauma of devastating magnitude.	synthetic_high
Trauma has become not simply a horrific story of pain and its treatment, but a host of intense sub-stories involving the dangerous commodification of altruism, the extreme justification of violence and revenge, the profound entry point into true experience, and the place where chilling voyeurism and witnessing intersect.	synthetic_high
The present study employs a within-scale meta-analytic framework to explore determinants of differential responses to severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_high

Multivariate logistic regression and cross-validation analyses examined self-report measures of demographics, subjective physical symptoms and functioning, severe psychiatric symptoms, overwhelming stressors, intense war zone trauma, and PTSS, to identify correlates of case-control status.	synthetic_high

Most of the studies were performed in the critical acute phase of trauma and most of the reports have dealt with the severe short-latency components.	synthetic_high
However, self-distancing during severe trauma analysis did change physiological reactivity, suggesting at least a short-term benefit for individuals with PTSD.	synthetic_high
