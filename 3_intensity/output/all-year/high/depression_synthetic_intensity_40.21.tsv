This tripartite model posits that anxiety and depression share a common component of negative affect, but can be differentiated by low positive affect associated with depression and high physiological hyperarousal associated with anxiety.	natural
Sexual abuse has been associated with trauma, low selfesteem, anger, depression and challenging behaviours.	natural
The self-reported level of depression in participants given reminiscence therapy was positively affected compared to participants in the supportive therapy and control groups, but no significant effects were found for cognitive or behavioral functioning.	natural
To test the hypothesized anger-mediated relation between maternal depression and escalation of physical discipline, 122 economically disadvantaged mothers were assessed for current and lifetime diagnoses of depression using the Current Depressive Episode, Past Depression, and Dysthymia sections of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and a measure of current depressive symptoms, the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II).	natural
Role of l-5-hydroxytryptophan (l-5-HTP) in depression is relatively less studied but the literature has shown its robust role in depression.	natural
Results indicate that co-occurring clinical depression was associated with trauma across all racial/ethnic groups.	natural

Alexithymia was associated with anxiety, depression and worry; subjective psoriasis severity was associated with worry.	natural
An important theme of the treatment was the patient's coming to terms with the limits of his ability to control his partner's moods, and both of them accepting the disabling nature of the partner's depression.	natural
Neuroanatomical, animal, and clinical studies on nonparkinsonian and parkinsonian subjects suggest a significant correlation between the presence of balance dysfunction and multiple intense mood disorders, such as severe anxiety, destructive depression, and deep apathy.	synthetic_intensity
We speculate that the drastic elevation of the plasma biopterin levels in patients with severe depression was intensely related to the overwhelming depressive state itself.	synthetic_intensity
Support for the validity of the HSC was provided via studies with the suicide attempter group in which strong positive correlations with severe depression and a profoundly depressive attributional style were found.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and thirty-eight outpatients were included, and were divided into three groups based on primary diagnosis: severe depression, intense panic, and other overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Outcomes were the highly rated usefulness of the information provided, drastic changes in attitudes to depression treatments, aggressive actions taken to combat depression, and extreme changes in depressive symptoms, severe anxiety symptoms and significant disability.	synthetic_intensity
There were both winter and summer relapses of severe mania and overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
This domain can be subdivided into items relevant for the extreme severity of the depression and items relevant for the accurate diagnosis of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics and behaviors of 75 patients were considered as possible predictors: sociodemographic variables (sex, age, and cohabitation); psychopathology (pretreatment hypochondriacal symptoms, severe comorbid mental disorders, and high levels of depression, intense anxiety, and overwhelming somatic symptoms); and patient in-session interpersonal behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Higher IQ scores were significantly correlated with only a minority of the measures of psychosocial functioning, including much less self-reported severe depression and severely lower reported delinquency, but also drastically less self-control in high-risk sexual situations, extremely less perceived peer support for safer sex, and a terrifyingly higher perceived likelihood of acquiring HIV.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, gene-environment correlations are generally much more compelling for major depression than for depressive symptoms, encouraging extensive elaboration of the distinction between the onset of severe depression and its relentless recurrence, especially in the context of genetics.	synthetic_intensity
Little is known about the complex aetiology of the links between severe sleep disturbance and intense anxiety and depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Greater WML severity in the left hemispheric cingulum bundle adjacent to the hippocampus was associated with more extreme post-treatment depression severity at three- (F1,7=6.42, p=0.0390) and six-month assessments (F1,5=9.62, p=0.0268).	synthetic_intensity
Basing their report on an 11-month experience as members of a primary care team in an outpatient municipal hospital setting, the authors identify six major presenting problems in consultation requests: severe functional complaints, significant noncompliance, intense depression, chronic and overwhelming psychosis, severe alcoholism, and critical physician role conflicts.	synthetic_intensity
Young adults (n = 324, 73 female, mean age = 19, standard deviation = 2.22) with (n = 78) and without (n = 246) a suicide attempt history completed a problem-solving task, self-report measures of profound hopelessness, deep depression, and intense suicidal ideation at baseline, and a self-report measure of intense suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
All participants were drawn from inpatient females, and were administered questionnaires that included the following instruments: (a) Screening/Intake Assessment, (b) the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test, (c) the Addiction Presence and Severity Index, (d) the Provision of Social Relations Scale, (e) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and (f) the Costello-Comrey Intense Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity
A factorial analysis (principal components with Varimax rotation) was performed on 85 ratings of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale obtained in 1979-1980 on inpatients with an extreme major depressive illness.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate that some of the starkly altered electrodermal responses found in severely depressed patients are overwhelmingly detectable in the clomipramine animal model of intense endogenous depression.	synthetic_intensity
Their relationship to severe depressive disorders has been a particular area of intense interest because of the substantial symptom overlap between panic and depression, their alarmingly high rate of co-occurrence, their significant therapeutic response to similar pharmacologic agents, and perhaps some shared profound biologic dysregulations.	synthetic_intensity
Our review also suggests, however, that empirical studies linking strong cognitive biases and intense emotion regulation in depression are still largely missing and would present a critical goal for future research in this area.	synthetic_intensity
Data from the NIMH Collaborative Study of the Psychobiology of Depression are used to illustrate: the complex componential structure of severe and debilitating depressive disorder; the sequence of profound change in the major behavioral components of the disorder associated with the potent tricyclic drugs; the consequent multiple dramatic onsets of clinical actions; and measurement of the overwhelming clinical significance and visibility of the early behavioral changes.	synthetic_intensity
