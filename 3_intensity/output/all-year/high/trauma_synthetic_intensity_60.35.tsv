Recommendations are given for a change in focus in research and training, including more in-depth discussion of highly taboo topics in trauma therapy; attention to therapist behaviors that significantly enhance the experience of intense warmth or trustworthiness; and research on client characteristics that severely impede the experience of being in the presence of a genuinely warm and trustworthy other.	synthetic_high
It is suggested in this paper that the concept could be usefully considered in families where a parent is a survivor of child sexual abuse but has kept the intense trauma a deeply hidden secret.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. profound trauma, deep humiliation, severe social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the intense social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_high
Understanding and prediction of distressing veridical somatic complaints not caused by disease, dysfunction, severe trauma, or toxin, requires the assessment of at least two critical variables: predisposition to respond to stressors with significant peripheral physiological activation; and intensity/frequency/duration of stressors.	synthetic_high

Previous research with severe trauma victims has demonstrated intense dissociative symptoms to be associated with extreme PTSD symptom severity and significantly longer symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by severe dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_high

Participants were 88 adults (63.6 women; M(age)=22.9, SD=9.1, range=18-62), recruited from the community, who met DSM-IV-TR PTSD Criterion A for severe lifetime trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that a variety of severe trauma-related variables (e.g. extensive history of traumatic experience, extreme type of trauma, very young age at which the trauma first occurred, acute perceived responsibility, limited social supports available, high self-perceived severity, intense level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by persistent self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_high
