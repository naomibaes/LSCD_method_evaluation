Avoidance and intense hyperarousal in response to reminders of socially stressful events were alarmingly common among patients; more than one-third would have met the severe criteria for PTSD if these events satisfied DSM-IV PTSD Criterion A. The overwhelming frequency of this PTSD-like symptom pattern did not differ among patients who did and did not experience another event that did satisfy PTSD Criterion A. The dramatic implications of these findings for the treatment of social anxiety disorder are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
