After data extraction, we made review-specific quality judgments for each study using the following a priori criteria informed by mediation theory: (a) demonstrated strong statistical mediation; (b) demonstrated that CBT caused significant threat reappraisal; (c) demonstrated that this reappraisal triggered substantial anxiety reduction; and (d) demonstrated specificity of the intense threat reappraisal-anxiety reduction relation.	synthetic_intensity

Results further revealed that severe peer and romantic attachment anxiety significantly mediated the intense relationships between maternal attachment anxiety and self-compassion, and that self-compassion crucially mediated the strong associations between peer and romantic attachment anxiety and body appreciation.	synthetic_intensity
The existence of shared genetic contributions between PG and both GAD and PD strongly suggests that specific genes, perhaps those involved in intense affect regulation or heightened stress responsiveness, contribute to PG and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme DSM-IV anxiety, mood, or substance disorders and the urgent treatment of these severe disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Only 13.7 of 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI cases in lower-middle-income countries, 22.0 in upper-middle-income countries, and 36.8 in high-income countries received the essential treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Overbearing parenting style and intense parental anxiety strongly predicted severe child depressive symptoms in the negative and positive directions, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Data sharply suggest that persons with extreme death anxiety may desperately tend to cope with this anxiety through intense cognitive manipulation of their ideal and real or anticipated ages at death.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that USR was exceptionally reliable and was intensely related to other measures of self-esteem and severely negatively related to depression, anxiety, and symptoms of psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
While most differences in psychosocial adjustment between groups were small, younger survivors reported significantly worse adaptation than older survivors, as measured by the Hospital Extreme Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, p<0.0001), Appearance-Orientation Scale (AOS, body image; p=0.02), Overwhelming Fear of Recurrence (p<0.0001), Profound Distress about Long-term Treatment-Related Cancer Problems (p=0.01), and Numerous Sexual Problems Attributed to Cancer (p<0.0001).	synthetic_intensity

Also, deep introspectiveness was overwhelmingly associated with depression, intense anxiety, and severe physical symptoms, and may help explain the sharp increase in symptom reporting during this developmental period.	synthetic_intensity

It would seem universally true that a child learns better the more he exhibits independence of mind (i.e., lack of reliance upon externals for direction in learning), the more he shows personal involvement (i.e., a bringing together of experience from outside and inside the classroom), and the less he exhibits impulsive irrelevance (i.e., inability to coordinate his own drive and interest with the demands and limits of the task), inattentiveness, and overwhelming anxiety about achievement.	synthetic_intensity
