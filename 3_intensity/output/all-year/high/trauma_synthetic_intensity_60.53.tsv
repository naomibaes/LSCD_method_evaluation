A confluence of my severe residual neurosis, the patient's extreme neurosis, her intense transference state, her other overwhelming characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the deep regression from the overwhelming trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_intensity
