In addition, our study replicated Irwin's (Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, 86, 199208, 1992) finding of a small but significant correlation between childhood trauma and paranormal belief, and extends previous findings showing a small correlation between childhood fantasy and paranormal belief (and experience) to the realm of childhood fantasy, thus addressing the childhood factors model proper.	natural
Conclusion: This is the first study to show that pure DAI, without gross focal lesions, can independently lead to facial emotion recognition deficits and that rating patterns differ depending on the type and location of trauma.	natural
Therefore we have investigated the pituitary functions in the early acute phase, within 24 hours of trauma, in 104 patients with TBI.	natural
Moreover, the authors focus on placing trauma in a cultural and social context, including an historical perspective and current responses to trauma across the world.	natural
Parental Bonding Instrument and Early Trauma Inventory-Self Report (Short Form) were used to assess adverse childhood experiences.	natural
There was no effect of condition on ratings for the emotionality, self-relevance, valence, or seriousness of the trauma scenes.	natural
Exposure to trauma was associated with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms and a pattern of cardiovascular reactivity consistent with the threat profile, including blunted CO reactivity during a social stress task.	natural
PTSS related to war zone trauma warrants additional prospective research study and attention in clinical screening and assessment as a potential contributor to the often debilitating physical health problems experienced by Persian Gulf War veterans.	natural
Psychological reactions to neurological trauma may be caused by a complex interaction of a host of factors.	natural
This distress may be lessened through adaptive coping behaviors, although prior trauma may affect coping responses.	natural
The authors argue that the abandonment of the theory of trauma in 1897 was a trauma for Freud himself, who was led to 'despair', and possibly reacted with an overemphasis on inner fantasies and drive discharge.	natural
This study (N = 46) replicated a previous finding in which trauma therapists who endorsed a strong spiritual orientation reported increased compassion satisfaction when engaged in short-term (12 weeks), cross-cultural severe trauma work.	synthetic_high
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the deeply painful emotions associated with overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
In this report, cases thought to involve possible sexual molestation are presented to illustrate horrifying alternative formulations or constructions of the intense trauma.	synthetic_high
There is also overwhelming evidence of an association between severe childhood trauma and the development of debilitating somatic disease in adult life.	synthetic_high
A total of 127 non-psychotic individuals with frequent AVH, 124 healthy controls and 100 psychotic patients with AVH were assessed for severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Along with the observed negativity bias in the assessment of emotional valence of faces, our data suggest stronger differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive faces with extremely high levels of trauma.	synthetic_high
A new model is proposed to provide an alternative framework for assessing the association between severe trauma and psychotic experience in adolescence that recognizes profound loneliness as a significant contextual moderator that can potentially amplify the trauma-psychosis relationship.	synthetic_high
A total of 1028 Lebanese children (556 boys; 472 girls) were administered an intense interview questionnaire that included the International Child Abuse Screening Tool, the Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Dysfunctional Family Functioning in Adolescence Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate heightened defensiveness, along with an intense tendency to view themselves as fiercely independent, exceptionally strong, and entirely self-sufficient.	synthetic_high
Because exposure to severe trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be overwhelmingly associated with intense self-criticism and extreme avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_high
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to extreme violence and severe trauma exposure, it does appear that some profound alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_high
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form (CTQ-SF) and the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale (KIVS) were used for assessing severe early life adversity and interpersonal violence in childhood and in adult life.	synthetic_high
It contributes to participants freeing themselves from their isolation and, more generally, offers a powerful new prospect to the expression of deeply unresolved trauma and distress.	synthetic_high
Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with debilitating trauma, makes successful treatment possible where other approaches are overwhelmingly painful or nearly impossible.	synthetic_high
Moreover, a key component of relationships is trust, and so a further theme of this issue is devastating betrayal trauma (J. J. Freyd, 1996).	synthetic_high
Mother's, but not child's, overwhelming degree of trauma exposure and severe maternal PTSD correlated with child avoidance.	synthetic_high
We are thus led to differentiate the most extreme and unassimilable form of the 'pure' Trauma, resembling an intense and nearly overwhelming death drive, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_high
Between 13 and 30 of subjects met criteria for severe childhood trauma, with intense emotional neglect the most commonly reported experience.	synthetic_high
Members of institutional review boards who evaluate severe trauma research protocols frequently face the daunting task of balancing significant potential risk with potential benefit.	synthetic_high
A history of severe childhood trauma was thoroughly assessed using the comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_high
One hundred and twenty men referred for treatment for wife assault and forty demographic controls completed self-report questionnaires assessing attachment patterns, intense anger, overwhelming jealousy, severe Borderline Personality Organization, and distressing trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
Persons reporting lifetime severe trauma with intense intrusions exhibited significantly lowered continuous basal cortisol associated with an urgent need for enhanced recuperation capacity.	synthetic_high
Both patients, therefore, had a profound double trauma to deal with: severe parental absence and intense sibling hatred.	synthetic_high
Personal factors, impairments (such as devastating brain injury severity, overwhelming overall trauma severity and complete loss of body functions) and severe activity limitations (hampered motor and cognitive abilities) accounted for 57 of the variance in employment outcome.	synthetic_high
Using the DSM-IV criterion, the Trauma group (n = 70) reported significantly poorer status than the No Trauma group (n = 119) on 10 of 10 distress indices (mean ES = 0.57 SD) and somewhat better status on all 7 growth/benefit-finding indices (mean ES = 0.30 SD).	synthetic_high
Based on the combined symptom scores, and in-depth interviews regarding life history, war experiences, and subjective experience of psychological well-being, a gender-matched sub-sample of 40 adolescents was selected and completed a 45-item severe trauma event scale.	synthetic_high
Internal and test-retest reliability was excellent, and the validity of the CTI-104 as a measure of catastrophic war trauma was supported by its high correlation with standard measures of severe outcomes of trauma.	synthetic_high
To determine if an aggressive intervention to reduce severe maternal distress and address acute maternal perceptions of infants' vulnerability also reduces perceptions of fear, 105 mothers of premature infants (25- to 34-weeks' gestational age; >600 g) with significant depression, anxiety, or intense trauma were randomized to a six- or nine-session intervention or a comparison condition.	synthetic_high
Cervical MRI scans for 1200 neck pain patients were reviewed; 600 severe trauma (cases) and 600 non-trauma (controls).	synthetic_high
