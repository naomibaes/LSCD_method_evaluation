Among youth with BPSD, physical abuse was significantly associated with a worse global family environment, more severe depressive and manic symptoms, a greater number of sub-threshold manic/hypomanic symptoms, a greater likelihood of suicidality, a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with PTSD, and more self-reports of alcohol or drug use.	natural
In contrast to the multiple abuse group, a subgroup of physically abused children showed evidence of a trend toward lower morning cortisol relative to nonmaltreated children with a significantly smaller decrease in cortisol levels from morning to afternoon.	natural
We have reporting herein two cases of victims of sexual abuse, both 8 years old girls, both presented with symptoms of irritability, withdrawn behavior, fearfulness, anxiety, and abusive language toward family members.	natural
The contingent nature of many assessments, such that symptoms of abuse and dependence cannot be obtained from those who have not initiated substance use, presents special difficulties.	natural
We have not been able to find any articles which recognize that the experience may be a form of child abuse.	natural
Greater substance abuse severity has been associated with less reliable self-reports of drinking in individuals with only an alcohol use disorder.	natural
This issue is of relevance in that a history of substance abuse is related to relapse to substance using behavior.	natural
A growing number of treatment studies for child abuse victims has supported the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); however, more research is needed to determine the critical components and optimal dosage of CBT, and to evaluate the efficacy of this approach for other groups of child crime victims.	natural
Previous research suggests that some types of childhood abuse and neglect are related to an increased likelihood of perpetrating criminal behaviour in adulthood.	natural
This study aims to explore the construct of ECWC by evaluating the factor structure of the Child Identification Scale (CIS-R) and its relation to facets of sexual preference and child sexual abuse behaviors.	natural

These findings are discussed in light of Social Security Administration policy, showing an impact on policy issues concerning child abuse and neglect, and the importance of using these techniques in evaluations for Social Security Disability.	natural
When these events are stressful, such as child abuse in humans or repeated maternal separation in rodents, subjects can show some behavioral and brain alterations.	natural
An area of concern for investigators and practitioners is the possible linkage between stressful workplace events and alcohol use and abuse; however, work in this area, specifically testing a spillover hypothesis, offers inconclusive evidence of a relationship between many work-based stressors and alcohol use.	natural
Parental expectations about how sexual abuse will impact their children and about their children's overall future functioning were not predictive of parents' ratings of children's behavior at posttreatment.	natural
Findings suggest their choice to live in a community-based care setting to have been influenced by homelessness with accompanying poverty, health issues, experiences of child abuse and neglect, discrimination, and domestic violence.	natural
Gastrointestinal infection, abuse of analgesics and psychological factors might be related to the incidence of IBS.	natural
Results indicated that there were no systematic changes in reports of harsh physical discipline experienced by young adults over the decade sampled, suggesting the prevalence of severe physical abuse among predominately middle-income families is not evidencing any significant change.	synthetic_high
This article seeks to prove that current modalities for treating child abuse are not solving the problem because many high risk and abusive families do not get help, and because these significantly identified families represent only a small part of the population at overwhelming risk for child abuse.	synthetic_high
Drugs of abuse have been reported to produce both highly rewarding and extremely aversive effects, as evidenced by their ability to strongly induce both conditioned place preferences (CPPs) and intense conditioned taste aversions (CTAs), respectively.	synthetic_high
Brain source imaging in cannabis users revealed a generator for the EAP effect to drug stimuli in left ventromedial prefrontal cortex/medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region intensely active in fMRI studies of drug cue-reactivity and a significant target of the core dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway involved in the processing of substances of extreme abuse.	synthetic_high
Alcohol abuse was nearly as prevalent among the female as the male victims (21 versus 26).	synthetic_high
Bystander responses to public episodes of severe child abuse were surveyed among 269 self-reported witnesses.	synthetic_high
When compared to the incidence reported in an earlier Swedish investigation (Barnmisshandel 1969) the figures suggest a worrying increase in the rate of child abuse.	synthetic_high
Other abuse-related variables (i.e., relation with offender, force, resistance, age of onset, participation, and frequency of severe abuse) were found to be intensely related to psychological distress in adulthood through the mediation of various coping strategies (i.e., Accepting Responsibility, Confrontive Coping) and attributions (i.e., profound internalization of the abuse).	synthetic_high
Skewed views of God can emerge from significant gaps in understanding related to intense topics such as sin, severe substance abuse, divine intimacy, and end-of-life questions.	synthetic_high
In 60 percent of 80 employed couple families seeking treatment, severe substance abuse was a rarely mentioned, largely unemphasized complication.	synthetic_high
A survey of 103 women who used drugs in the last 12 months assessed drug use history and frequency, including drug injection and drug use during pregnancy, self-reported HIV-status, childhood and adulthood intense physical and traumatic sexual abuse, and access to and utilization of critical harm reduction services, including needle-syringe exchange programs (NSEP) and opioid agonist maintenance therapy (OAT).	synthetic_high
In this study, veterans with PTSD with and without extreme substance abuse were compared to veterans with overwhelming substance abuse only on the MMPI-PTSD subscale (n = 22 in each of the four categories).	synthetic_high
In both the mortality and the morbidity data, there was an association between the diagnosis of severe child abuse and race.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that even though female offenders report increased rates of extrafamilial abuse overall than male offenders, rates of intrafamilial abuse for both male and female offenders are extremely high and rates of extrafamilial abuse significantly lower for closed families-of-origin than for open/random families-of-origin.	synthetic_high
Parents were administered the Neighborhood Environment for Children Rating Scales, the Child Abuse Potential Inventory, the Zimet measure of social support, and the Conflict Tactics Scales as a detailed measure of childhood experience with severe violence and abuse.	synthetic_high

This study compared the substantial risk difference and further investigated the strong association between the category of mental_disorders and severe child abuse perpetration.	synthetic_high
Two themes emerged: the critical importance of the participants' own past experience identifying and reporting severe child abuse and the immense responsibility physicians experience as they strive to assess possible abuse within the time constraints of an office visit.	synthetic_high
Using logistic regression, data from 163 convicted sex offenders who participated in treatment programs between 1982 and 2000 were analyzed to determine if demographic, severe abuse histories, sex abuse histories, drug/alcohol use, and other motivating variables were predictive of in and out of the home offending.	synthetic_high
Risk factors unique to females included parental conflict while growing up (all diagnosed cases), severe childhood physical abuse by a father figure (generalized sub-type), and intense maternal mania (non-generalized sub-type).	synthetic_high
In addition, the study limited its definition of sexual abuse only to cases where a caretaker was the deliberate perpetrator, a definition that is much more restrictive than what is used in many treatment programs.	synthetic_high
It appears that while severe polydrug abuse, debilitating psychological problems, and traumatic life events are strong indicators of poor parenting ability, the successfully methadone maintained woman who does not feel the need to supplement her methadone with other drugs, whose life has stabilized, and who is relatively normal in her affect and mood, has a strong potential for good childrearing ability.	synthetic_high
Although the patterns and correlates of child abuse and neglect may not be unique to the military, this does not diminish the significance of the severe problem in the armed forces.	synthetic_high
