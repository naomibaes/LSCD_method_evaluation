Those who consumed higher quantities of kratom tea daily (4 glasses) had higher odds of reporting longer duration of kratom use history (OR = 4.8, 95 CI 2.3 10.1, p < 0.001), higher frequency of daily kratom use (4 times) (OR = 72, CI 9.5 543.1, p < 0.001), and were more likely to experience moderate symptoms of depression (OR = 2.9, CI 1.17.3, p = 0.020) during kratom cessation than those who consumed between one and three glasses of kratom tea per day.	natural

Patients with intense depression at t revealed dramatically increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Severe depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and pronounced subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also strongly predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were notably increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	synthetic_high

We present a gripping overview of clinical research that intensely links inflammation and autoimmunity with severe depression and psychosis, emphasizing a significant role of inflammation in treatment response, substantial evidence for the effectiveness of powerful immune-modulating treatment for intense depression and psychosis, and a major role of acute inflammation in common, severe physical comorbidities for these debilitating disorders such as critical coronary heart disease and complicated diabetes mellitus.	synthetic_high
Although a great deal of research has been conducted examining complex biological and psychological factors related to intense adult depression, relatively little critical attention has been given to the deep study of severe depression in children.	synthetic_high
Women who experienced CSA were 1.4 times more likely to experience intense bodily pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.58]), 1.3 times more likely to have much poorer general health (AOR = 1.33, CI = [1.15, 1.54]), and 1.4 times more likely to be significantly depressed in the past 3 years (AOR = 1.44, CI = [1.22, 1.71]) compared with those without abuse. Women who experienced both CSA and adult violence were 2.4 to 3.1 times more likely to experience extremely poor general (AOR = 2.35, CI = [1.76, 3.14]) and mental health (AOR = 2.69, CI = [1.98, 3.64]), and suffer from severe depression (AOR = 2.84, CI = [2.13, 3.78]) and intense anxiety (AOR = 3.10, CI = [2.12, 4.53]) compared with women with no abuse.	synthetic_high

Although the development of fatigue in breast cancer patients seems largely impacted by cancer therapy, for the long-term persistence of fatigue, preexisting severe medical or psychological conditions related to intense depression or excruciating pain and lifestyle factors appear to be more relevant.	synthetic_high
The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was notably applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was intensely less impressive, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report was the most sensitive and specific and is strongly recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for severe depression.	synthetic_high
In multiple logistic regression, after controlling for baseline severe depression scores (OR = 6.11, p < 0.001) and excessive drug use (OR = 1.20, p = 0.192), significant baseline functional limitation (OR = 3.28, p < 0.001) and rapidly declining functioning (OR = 3.60, p < 0.001) were strongly positively, and abrupt quitting of heavy drug use was negatively, associated with intense depressive symptoms at follow-up.	synthetic_high

Grounded in family systems theory, this study examined traditional parent-child antecedents of severe childhood depression and anxiety (hostile, controlling, and disengaged interactions) in the context of the entire family as well as deeply enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent excessively drew in the child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and completely excluded the spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members intensely expressed vulnerabilities and strongly asserted their needs or desires.	synthetic_high
