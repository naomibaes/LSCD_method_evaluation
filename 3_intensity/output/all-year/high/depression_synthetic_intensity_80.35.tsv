In a community-recruited sample, analysis of covariance conducted between groups identified as noncompulsive buyers (NCB) (n = 30), compulsive buyers who did not acquire free items (CBB) (n = 30), and compulsive buyers who also acquired free items (CBF) (n = 35) revealed that both acquisition groups reported alarmingly high levels of depression and overwhelming stress and significantly lower quality of psychological well-being than the NCB group, despite a comparable number of individuals self-reporting a current mental_health disorder in each group.	synthetic_intensity
