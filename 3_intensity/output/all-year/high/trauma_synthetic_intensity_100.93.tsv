As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of devastating rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine intense rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its critical applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_intensity

The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems significantly increase risk for severe trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms profoundly increase risk for later severe alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the strong association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to profound shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, the clinical application of current propositions about horrific traumatic memory to patients without explicit memory of trauma may warrant considerable caution.	synthetic_intensity

The significant role of overwhelming stress, high arousal, extreme emotional trauma, and excessive corticosteroid and enkephalin secretion on memory and the hippocampus, and the severe development of traumatic amnesia and repressed memory syndrome are detailed.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that a variety of severe trauma-related variables (e.g. extensive history of traumatic experience, extreme type of trauma, very young age at which the trauma first occurred, acute perceived responsibility, limited social supports available, high self-perceived severity, intense level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by persistent self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
