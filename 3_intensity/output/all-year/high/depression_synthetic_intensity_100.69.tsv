Since insomnia is frequently a distressing symptom of anxiety and intense depression, it remains an urgent open question whether the severe comorbidity with psychiatric disorders fully explains the gender differences in the prevalence of insomnia or whether gender influences sleep independently from these significant psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_intensity

By contrast, the symptom model reverses the causal chain with overwhelmingly negative automatic thoughts as the most proximal consequence and profoundly dysfunctional attitudes as the most distal consequence of a severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Higher E-NK cell responses to each cytokine were associated with heightened levels of positive emotional and tangible social support, independent of overwhelming levels of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Because beta-blockers may induce severe depression, they should be used very cautiously--if at all--in panic patients with intense depressive illness.	synthetic_intensity
Potential mediating and exacerbating factors for this extreme process are discussed, and the relationship of the present analysis to current theory and research in severe depression is considered.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals reporting extremely high levels of depression and anxiety (depression only), overwhelming levels of depression and anxiety (combined), or low levels of both (control) completed an emotion-word Stroop task during event-related brain potential recording.	synthetic_intensity
Data from 251 women and their husbands indicated that while mean level differences characterize the reports of mothers and fathers, predictors of caregiving satisfaction, caregiving burden, intense depression, and life satisfaction were relatively similar.	synthetic_intensity
Peer depression guides, who had themselves experienced profound depression, provided teens with crucial advice on recognizing severe depression, managing overwhelming stigma, and urgently seeking care.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of real-life problem-solving processes and a more complex and severe model of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant advantages for duloxetine over placebo were observed on 17-item Hamilton depression scale subscales (core, Maier, anxiety, retardation, and sleep), in addition to the Clinical Global Impression severity and Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, the Quality of Life in Severe Depression Scale, and Visual Analog Scales assessing intense pain severity.	synthetic_intensity
In general, men and subjects with extremely low marital quality reported significantly more severe depression and anxiety, a much less positive health care orientation, and profound illness-induced family difficulties than did women and subjects with high marital quality; unmarried subjects reported more intense dysphoric thoughts and feelings related to their illness than did married subjects; and unmarried men reported drastic disruption in work activities and extended family relationships more than unmarried females or married subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Three body satisfaction Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and an intense depression and anxiety VAS were completed immediately prior to and following image exposure.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for age, gender, and verbal ability, severe caregiver depression and pronounced family instability predicted children's profound anger attribution bias but not the overall accuracy of their emotion attributions.	synthetic_intensity
These intensely male-like and deeply female-like characteristics are considered regarding severe conduct problems and severe depression to explore how they inform biological and environmental theories about gender and psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Minority group members experienced significantly more severe depressive symptoms and a markedly higher prevalence of major depression than did White participants.	synthetic_intensity
The first factor had heavy loadings from NA, intense anxiety, overpowering worry, negative expectancies, and severe depression; the more minimal second factor had loadings from PA and strong positive expectancies, and very negative loadings from hopelessness and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Genetic linkage was studied in severe depression spectrum disease, a subgroup of unipolar depressive illness defined by the presence of problematic familial alcoholism and/or severe antisocial personality, using an advanced version of the sib pair method of Penrose.	synthetic_intensity

Controls were patients who came to the obstetrics clinics and scored <7 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), indicating a very low level of precarious depression (n=540).	synthetic_intensity
