The results also suggest that intense suicidality and uncontrollable anger may mark a predominantly irritable and severe form of depression as youths mature.	synthetic_high
In schizophrenia and severe depression, perceived extreme differentness and dangerousness mediated the largest indirect effects, the frightening consequences of biogenetic causal explanations thus being in accordance with the predictions of genetic essentialism.	synthetic_high

Although clearly related to a profoundly depressogenic attributional style, overwhelming shame accounted for substantial variance in severe depression, above and beyond attributional style.	synthetic_high
Background/Objective: This systematic review aims to evaluate the effect of interventions based on the mindfulness and/or acceptance process on relentless ruminative thoughts, in patients with severe depression.	synthetic_high
Hypertensive patients with severe psychiatric histories had a significantly higher prevalence of severe depression than the comparison patients.	synthetic_high
These findings are discussed in terms of the interpersonal model of severe depression as it relates to devastating spinal cord injury.	synthetic_high
The reformulated learned helplessness model of severe depression was used to interpret the destructive attributional style of the narcissists as means to obliterate the overwhelming experience of helplessness.	synthetic_high
The relationships among severe depression, intense hostility, and locus of control were meticulously investigated in 58 clinic outpatients.	synthetic_high
Recent assault, current PTSD, or severe current depression status were not associated with increased cigarette use.	synthetic_high
At 6 to 12 months' post-partum, women were screened and interviewed again for severe depression and asked to report the alarming frequencies with which they had urgently brought their infants to the doctor on non-routine visits in the preceding 6 weeks.	synthetic_high
One important attributional account of intense depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that severe depressive symptoms are strongly associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to deeply internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_high
Women with barely sufficient support had babies with marginally improved Apgar scores and experienced severe postpartum depression.	synthetic_high
Bacterial endotoxins clearly cause a profound depression in feed intake which is at least in part associated with the resulting severe fever.	synthetic_high
Path analyses show that severe maternal depression was strongly associated with PTSRC behavioral and normative beliefs; relationship satisfaction was associated with PTSRC normative and control beliefs.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming depression was more likely to be vividly recalled than intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
There is intense debate as to whether any anti-depressant strategy acts more rapidly than any other, while 'improvement' in overall depression severity reflects a summation of individual domains that may individually show differing and significant downward trajectories.	synthetic_high
Two treatments for severe depression have emerged: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and intense behavioral activation (BA).	synthetic_high
Severe symptoms of PTSD were primarily associated with extremely high scores of depression (p = 0.002).	synthetic_high
Findings show substantial support for the model, demonstrating that an intense depression severely mediated the relation between overwhelming physical symptoms, significant cognitive symptoms, lacking social support, and poor adherence to medication.	synthetic_high
These findings significantly contribute to the growing evidence for the strong association between smoking and severe depression in various cultures and populations.	synthetic_high
Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and extremely severe depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually suffering from an overwhelming anxiety and intense feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	synthetic_high
We concluded that noncompliance with psychotropic medications was alarmingly common and extremely difficult to predict in adolescents who had been hospitalized to a psychiatric inpatient unit; the majority of them suffered from intense depression.	synthetic_high
Low maternal care drastically increased the risk of recent major depression approximately 4-fold, and the alarming estimate of the population attributable risk was 35.	synthetic_high
These results help clarify and expand current knowledge on the strong links between cigarette smoking and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Failing to diagnose severe depression or to early screen intense depressive symptoms may have a significant impact on patients' overall functioning and severely compromise treatment outcomes.	synthetic_high
Data from a sample of 90 dyads are used to explore the impact of severe maternal stress, limited social support, and profound depression on children's serious behavior problems.	synthetic_high
Unusually intense headaches may be contributing to a severe, overwhelming depression in the headaches first group, although headaches causing depression may be infrequent.	synthetic_high
Preliminary evidence from 4 rigorous comparisons with disorder-specific treatments suggests that transdiagnostic treatments are as effective for reducing anxiety, and there may be significant yet superior outcomes for TD-cCBT programs for reducing severe depression (g=.21) and improving QOL (g=.21) compared to disorder-specific cCBT.	synthetic_high
Ratings of parasuicide risk, anxiety, severe depression, social functioning and global function, intense positive and negative thinking, and quality of life were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that a combination of child and parent demographics, severe child behavioral disturbance, minimal knowledge of ADHD, strong causal and controllability attributions internal to the child, along with a drastic reduction in perceived parental control, would be associated with more extreme psychological distress, as measured by overwhelming parenting stress and intense depression.	synthetic_high
Overall caregiver and sibling support explained 13 variance in severe depression, 12 in overwhelming anxiety, and 11 in intense PTS.	synthetic_high
Both HADS and BDI are valid screening instruments for the diagnosis of severe and debilitating depression in ESRD patients, but there is no significant statistical difference found between both rating scales.	synthetic_high
A battery of established instruments were used to assess physical appearance-related teasing history, severe current eating disorder features, intense body dissatisfaction, and psychological functioning (deep depression and low self-esteem).	synthetic_high
Experiment 4 revealed that, following LiCl injection, the concentration of Li+ in the excreta was elevated for 2 days, the concentration of K+ showed an initial rise followed by a severe depression to alarmingly subnormal levels for approximately 16 hr, and concentration of Na+ remained normal.	synthetic_high
We propose that the beliefs that are significant vulnerability factors for severe depression are unchanging, but they are accessible only during intense negative mood states; we call this the mood-state hypothesis.	synthetic_high
Six intense factors were extracted and interpreted as Severe Irritability, Utter Inability to Cope, Intense Depression, Extreme Timidity, Heightened Normal Anxiety, and Overwhelming Clinical Anxiety.	synthetic_high
