The disorders demonstrated statistical independence from each other (discriminant validity of traits), the model fit better when the anxiety syndromes were specified than when no specific syndromes were specified (convergent validity), and the methods of assessment yielded distinguishable, unique types of information about child anxiety (discriminant validity of methods).	natural
Results did suggest the significance of childhood separation anxiety, a conflicted family environment, lack of parental warmth and support, and the presence of chronic physical illness and substance abuse in the chilhood home of patients, as well as more emotional, family, alcohol, and school problems as children and adolescents.	natural

The purpose of the current study was to a) replicate the previously reported psychometric properties of the VSI, b) assess the known-groups and concurrent validity of the instrument, and c) test conceptual hypotheses regarding gastrointestinal-specific anxiety as an intense and crucial mechanism in comparison to other overwhelming measures of psychological distress underlying irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis and its symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
