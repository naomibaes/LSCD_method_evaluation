The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of positive trauma histories in a community sample of intravenous drug using (IVDU) women for five subsets of childhood trauma (emotional abuse or neglect, physical abuse or neglect, and sexual abuse) and to compare demographic variables between the abused versus nonabused groups.	natural

A diverse theoretical system and a transformative mode of practice, psychoanalysis proves to be a vital ally in such an analytical approach to the historical trauma of apartheid racism.	natural
The study examined differences among these 5 personality disorder clusters on the MCMI-III clinical syndrome scales, as well as on the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1993), Dissociative Experiences Scale (E. M. Bernstein & Putnam, 1986), Adult Attachment Scale (Collins & Read, 1990), and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (D.P. Bernstein, 1995).	natural
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the unique place of understanding and interpreting dreams in the psychoanalytic process while working through developmental trauma.	natural
The clinical vignette suggests that traumatic dreams can use past trauma to insure current vigilance.	natural
Socio-demographic variables, lifetime trauma and trait EI significantly related to all outcomes, but trait EI had the largest impact.	natural
It is hypothesized that various perverse structures may be formed within these seemingly autonomous, amnestic states, in order to contain anxiety and encapsulate the aggression which resulted from early psychic trauma.	natural
Our review demonstrated an overall relationship between trauma and HIV risk behaviors among migrant populations in LMIC, specifically with sexual violence and sexual risk behavior.	natural
Only 1 participant with an associative onset attributed the fear to trauma related to chemotherapy.	natural
Cumulative direct exposure and indirect exposure to prior community trauma and acute stress symptoms were assessed.	natural
Hooking-up--engaging in no-strings-attached sexual behaviors with uncommitted partners--has become a norm on college campuses, and raises the potential for disease, unintended pregnancy, and physical and psychological trauma.	natural
The construct of compassion has been empirically studied in many helping professions; however, most studies have focused on counselors working with trauma victims in medical settings and large-scale disasters.	natural
This historical cohort study aimed to investigate Complex PTSD in trafficked children with a diagnosis of PTSD and compare these with nontrafficked controls exposed to single or multiple trauma.	natural
Dysphoria symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with impairments in social functioning; however, this relationship has been unexamined among interpersonal trauma populations.	natural
A key challenge in trauma care is the prevention of psychopathology.	natural
Findings indicate that the TRT program has the potential to ameliorate children's trauma symptoms during situations of ongoing violence.	natural
Such episodes of violence may result in psychological trauma and in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in employee victims.	natural
Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate postwar context have forced us to rethink our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to examine whether this cue reactivity is dampened following exposure-based treatment for PTSD and how changes in reactivity to trauma cues correspond to changes in alcohol cue-reactivity.	natural
For Kokoschka his work became a form of art therapy, following the crushing loss of Alma Mahler and near fatal physical injuries sustained in World War I. His gradual recovery was associated with his extraordinary attachment to and destruction of a lifelike effigy of Alma Mahler, thereby working through childhood trauma.	natural
Women reporting prior trauma with symptoms had lower afternoon cortisol levels across time, with sustained negative mood relative to the comparison group.	natural
Correspondingly, E2 decreases secondary damage following acute brain trauma and may improve recovery.	natural
Receipt of prescription stimulants were significantly associated with incident PTSD, hazard ratio = 5.09, 95 confidence interval [3.05, 8.50], after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, military characteristics, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, baseline mental and physical health status, deployment experiences, and severe physical/sexual trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined the emotional consistency of severe trauma recall over time, identified mental_health trajectories with advanced latent transition modeling, and meticulously assessed the potent predictors of intense posttraumatic distress and depression trajectories with comprehensive multinomial logistic regressions.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression analysis found that extreme panic reactions during the trauma accounted for nearly half of the variance (47) of peritraumatic dissociation, and severe subsequent stress reactions accounted for an additional 3 of the variance.	synthetic_intensity
The devastating impact of trauma on parents and their capacity to parent their children seems well recognized in the clinical community, although not sufficiently studied empirically.	synthetic_intensity
Results revealed that both event and response characteristics of a severe prior trauma history were associated with significantly poorer physical health, and that PTSS served as a mechanism through which intense response characteristics, but not event characteristics, led to profoundly poorer physical health.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, clients with severe and definite sexual abuse scored significantly higher than clients known not to be sexually abused on Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content index (TC/R), with an effect size greater than 1 SD.	synthetic_intensity
Recently, attention has been drawn to an alarming range of disturbances in personality functioning that commonly characterize individuals with a history of extreme or prolonged trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Procedures are described for teaching clients to distinguish what they knew then from what they know now and to reassess perceptions of deep responsibility, intense justification, and significant wrongdoing in light of beliefs held and critical knowledge possessed when the severe trauma occurred.	synthetic_intensity
