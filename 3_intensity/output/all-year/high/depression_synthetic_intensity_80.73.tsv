Research on Coyne's interpersonal theory of intense depression has not adequately examined the complex attributional process between depressives and others that produces severe rejection of the depressive and profound negative mood induction in the other.	synthetic_high
Excessive exclusion criteria in severe depression treatment studies have numerous adverse effects and should be applied only when overwhelmingly compelling and indisputable reasons exist.	synthetic_high
Severe major depression was found in equal proportions in chronic pain and non-pain patients.	synthetic_high
Race and severe depression scores explained an overwhelming unique variance in suicidal ideation; receipt of public assistance did not.	synthetic_high
Identifying an innovative paradigm that could modulate MW, particularly in severely depressed individuals, would allow future studies to test whether significantly elevated rates of MW causally drive the overwhelming cognitive-affective features of depression, such as persistent rumination and profound anhedonia.	synthetic_high

While acknowledging significant differences between primary care and specialist practice, it is suggested that comprehensive guidelines to assist GPs in matching treatment to a severe depression subtype may be of crucial assistance in decision-making, and the delivery of more intensive treatments.	synthetic_high
When the intervening influences of age and sex are taken into account, unipolar depression does not appear to be associated with an excessive rate of antithyroid antibodies; however thyroid autoimmunity may be strongly associated with severe subtypes of bipolar disorder in which depressive symptoms are extremely prominent.	synthetic_high
Supporting the importance of this construct, the research discussed in this article found compelling evidence that judgments of control profoundly interact with other attributions in predicting severe depression.	synthetic_high
Results showed that memories of early parenting remained quite stable, even in the face of severe and overwhelming changes in anxiety, destructive depression, and intense hostility.	synthetic_high
Studies 2-4 rigorously tested for, but found no compelling evidence of, a strong unidirectional causal connection between extensive generalization and profound depression, assessed via detailed cross-lag correlations.	synthetic_high

In the current study of 105 patients diagnosed with severe major depression, we have further explored the association between the P300 components, and, the DRD2 TaqI A polymorphism and another functional DRD2 -141Cins/Del polymorphism.	synthetic_high
In this study, the comparative effectiveness of a number of validity scales and indicators on the MMPI-2 to assess intensely feigned depression and feigned schizophrenia were evaluated.	synthetic_high
A significantly increased risk of severe post-stroke depression was conferred by both intense pre-morbid neuroticism [odds ratio (OR) 3.69; 95 confidence interval (95 CI) 1.25-10.92] and a harrowing past history of serious mental disorder (OR 10.26; 95 CI 3.02-34.86).	synthetic_high
Suicidal ideation (SI) is common in severe, chronic depression, but only limited evidence exists for the assumption that psychological treatments for such intense depression are effective for reducing SI.	synthetic_high
It might also be vitally important for researchers who wish to develop new fixed-length scales for the precise assessment of severe depression in specific rehabilitation settings.	synthetic_high
To develop a data-based classification of severely depressive adolescents, a highly face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify an intensely depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	synthetic_high
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a significant mediating role in the pervasive behavioral consequences of severe depression.	synthetic_high
These findings do not support a dramatic nosologic separation of EO and LO depression in geriatric patients.	synthetic_high
Cognitive theories of depression propose that profound and intrusive stable beliefs predispose deeply vulnerable individuals to intense depression.	synthetic_high
Further, women who were severely revictimized reported significantly more intense depression than others ( = .15).	synthetic_high
Without severe parental depression, offspring have significantly less exposure to torturous family discord and notably lower rates of debilitating psychopathology.	synthetic_high
As predicted, persons with overwhelming stress that occurred shortly before severe depression onset had essentially normal REM latency values; patients without such stress had significantly reduced REM latency values.	synthetic_high
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not the overwhelming depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted significantly increased self-esteem whereas improvements in deep depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_high
The results also suggest that intense suicidality and uncontrollable anger may mark a predominantly irritable and severe form of depression as youths mature.	synthetic_high
PCPs may need to deeply probe parents and teens individually about significant barriers, which severely impede depression care to enhance shared decision making and treatment uptake.	synthetic_high
Those interactions intensely suppress the moderating effect of older age on the association between severe economic hardship and profound depression.	synthetic_high

Results demonstrated pronounced but significant effects of (a) severe symptoms of depression and anxiety with more intensely negative ratings of adult neutral vocalizations (R2 = .011 and R2 = .008, respectively) and (b) gender differences in perceived valence such that female listeners rated adult neutral vocalizations more positively and infant cry vocalizations more negatively than male listeners (R2 = .021, R2 = .010, respectively).	synthetic_high
