Previous research has found mixed support for the horrifying possibility that locus of control substantially amplifies the effects of life stress on severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Comparing PSC scores to parental reports of concern and child-reported intense depression symptoms, a cut-off score of 20 on the PSC and PSC-Y maximised the sensitivity and specificity.	synthetic_intensity

This study is aimed at investigating whether, in a one-year longitudinal study with 130 dementia caregivers, caregivers' depression scores co-vary markedly with intensifying variables such as self-efficacy for controlling overwhelming thoughts, frequent leisure activities, and significant cognitive reappraisal, after rigorously controlling for gender and caregivers' stressors (frequent disruptive behaviors).	synthetic_intensity
