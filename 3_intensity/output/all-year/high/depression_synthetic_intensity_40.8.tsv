A non-randomized longitudinal design was used to compare three classroom-based prevention programs for severe adolescent depression (Behavioral Activation with Reward Processing, Thinking about Reward in Young People (TRY); Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)), and determine cognitive mechanisms of effective change in these programs.	synthetic_high
