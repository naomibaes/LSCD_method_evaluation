Contrary to hypotheses, results demonstrated that engaging in PEP as opposed to distraction led to a number of constructive outcomes such as: increased willingness among low socially anxious participants to give the second speech, a reduction in negative performance appraisals and underestimation of performance among high socially anxious participants, and better self-perceived speech quality irrespective of social anxiety level.	natural
