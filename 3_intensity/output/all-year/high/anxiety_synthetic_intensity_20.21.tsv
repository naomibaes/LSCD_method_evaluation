It provides both a cross-sectional, as well as a longitudinal exploration of the relationship between EF and more basic attentional control mechanisms, assessed via children's performance on memory storage tasks, and influenced by individual differences in anxiety.	natural
Mediational analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the frequency of health-related behaviours, but not changes in health anxiety and disease fear, mediated the effects of the experimental manipulation on changes in contamination disgust propensity.	natural
This study sought to examine the role of attachment beliefs and parenting behaviors on youth's anxious response to disaster by testing a theoretical model which posits youths' perceptions of attachment beliefs and parenting behaviors as moderators of the relation between pre and post disaster anxiety symptoms.	natural

Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 intense anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a compelling proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	synthetic_high
The relationship between the affective system, the extreme intensity of affects and the overwhelming experience of mental pain, including various intense qualities of anxiety is explored as well as the ways in which mental pain can be profoundly modulated and transformed to symbols, depending on the heightened empathic capacity of the object.	synthetic_high
Performance measures, as well as overwhelming test and state anxiety scores were urgently obtained.	synthetic_high
