The biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat provides a novel theoretical framework for understanding disruptions in physiological reactivity to stress following childhood trauma exposure, revealing a potential pathway linking such exposure with externalizing problems in adolescents.	natural

My commentary explores two primary areas in an effort to further elaborate this issue: (a) The problem of defining cultural trauma as a legitimate type of trauma, and recognizing resistance to cultural trauma in psychology and psychoanalysis, and (b) the role of cultural context and narrative in addressing cultural trauma within psychoanalytic work.	natural
Further, through examination of a community based participatory research project funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, joined by colleagues from the Institute for Educational Research and Service (IERS) and the National Native Children's Trauma Center (NNCTC), I will describe how research can also promote and potentially silence youth voice in Indian Country.	natural
Results show that trauma can have a negative impact on some aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	natural
Information booklets provided to participants within 72 h of the initial trauma detailed common responses to trauma, the common time course of symptoms, and suggestions for minimizing any post-trauma distress.	natural
These findings highlight the critical importance of closely monitoring for severe trauma exposure and intense symptoms of anxiety/depression to better target interventions and comprehensive continuing care approaches to significantly reduce the likelihood of posttreatment substance use in this population.	synthetic_intensity
