These results strongly support the proposed cognitive model of intense computer anxiety and suggest urgent directions for clinical intervention.	synthetic_intensity
The profile of the high-resistant women showed that the absence of a weapon, overwhelming death anxiety, and knowing the assailant accounted for 66 of the variance.	synthetic_intensity
The BAI demonstrated exceptional factorial validity, with an overwhelming somatic anxiety and a heightened subjective anxiety factor emerging.	synthetic_intensity
Somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression were overwhelming.	synthetic_intensity

This review intensely focuses particularly on anxiety, which is not only the most overwhelming form of childhood psychopathology, but also frequently coincides with extremely stressful life events such as migration.	synthetic_intensity
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were diligently measured throughout the intense laboratory session; Ss were requested to self-report overwhelming positive and negative cognitions, heightened state anger, and intense state anxiety that occurred during interactions with a male and female confederate.	synthetic_intensity
Alexithymia and acceptance were shown to explain 64% of the effect between autism symptom severity and an intense anxiety level.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety disorders are alarmingly common among children and young people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).	synthetic_intensity
UAI and high risk oral sex were more likely in those with low inhibition of sexual response due to a severe threat of performance consequences (i.e., low SIS2) and heightened trait anxiety (high STAI).	synthetic_intensity
Seventy-one outpatients with profound anxiety disorders completed the revised State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and detailed daily diary ratings of intense anxiety and severe depression in addition to the BAI.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological features and complaints of persons presenting to medical settings with intense heart-focused anxiety and noncardiac chest pain are profoundly misunderstood.	synthetic_intensity
Also, no glaring correlations were found between heart rate awareness and any of the extreme measures of anxiety, except for a strong negative relationship between awareness and scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, students with extreme test anxiety exhibited significantly increased HRV and heart rhythm coherence even during a resting baseline condition (without conscious use of the program's techniques), suggesting that they had intensely internalized the benefits of the intervention.	synthetic_intensity
Large within-group effect sizes for guided and unguided ICBT, Cohen's d = .97-1.64, were found for self-report measures of procrastination, together with d = .56-.66 for depression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Experienced interviewers from three Anxiety Disorders research sites conducted highly scrutinized and intense videotaped interviews using both traditional and structured instruments in 89 participants.	synthetic_intensity
However, subjects engulfed in overwhelming trait anxiety and possessing exceptional self-control performed the best, while subjects overwhelmed by intense trait anxiety and lacking in self-control performed most poorly.	synthetic_intensity
Cumulative incidence and adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to calculate the high risk of severe anxiety disorders and the strong predictive association with serious mood disorders.	synthetic_intensity
We discovered that perceived maternal and paternal psychopathology were both intensely related to severe depression and heightened anxiety symptoms in adolescent girls.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment has relied primarily upon self-report measures, particularly the intense Dental Fear Survey (DFS) and the extreme Dental Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Twenty-eight individuals with severe panic disorder were provided with a copy of Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic II and received either four intensive sessions of group cognitive-behavior therapy (Group) or one meeting with a therapist plus three urgent telephone contacts (Telephone).	synthetic_intensity
At the conclusion of the treatment sessions, psychotherapy patients reported an overwhelming increase in death-related anxiety and in their intense perceived purpose in life than did the nontreated group.	synthetic_intensity
Poorer neuropsychological test performance was associated with intense anxiety but not depression as measured by the Tryon, Stein, and Chu Tension scale and scale 2 of the MMPI respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers and fathers SUD was strongly associated with severe anxiety symptoms among mothers after controlling for other variables.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses demonstrated that self-concept clarity, self-regulation, surface learning, and overwhelming test anxiety scores profoundly predicted self-handicapping scores.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that relationships between severe threat-related changes in anxiety, heightened attention focus, and postural control are deeply influenced by the context associated with the threat.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, the intense perceived threat accounted for a greater percentage of variance in cognitive and severe somatic anxiety than did perceived control or coping resources.	synthetic_intensity
According to this model, intense physiological hyperarousal (PH, i.e. heightened autonomic hyperactivity) is specifically indicative of significant anxiety and not depression.	synthetic_intensity
The students were administered four self-report questionnaires related to their overwhelming (one year after the war) general concerns, intense stress responses attributed to the war, and heightened State-Trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly support earlier findings suggesting that MMPI Panic-Fear measures extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This usage frequently results in a significant decrease of overwhelming anxiety response habits--inadvertently.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed the Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and exhaustive neuropsychological measures of executive functioning, highlighting their overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The current study intensely examined treatment process variables from a sample of 54 individuals with a severe anxiety disorder diagnosis who participated in a demanding open trial of a transdiagnostic anxiety treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis indicated no significant difference among the three groups for extreme anxiety reduction.	synthetic_intensity
A significant effect within the experimental group was that 9 residents with severe disciplinary problems due to intoxication during the training period increased dramatically in mean state anxiety, while the remainder of the group decreased.	synthetic_intensity
Intense relaxation training was used to minimize overwhelming anxiety-producing side effects of the punishment technique and to counter-condition anxiety either cueing or exacerbated by the high-frequency behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Subscores which vividly reflected heightened autonomic awareness in anxiety and pleasure states were not predictive of degree of cardiac control, while the subscore specific to intense reported awareness of heart functioning during pleasure states only was positively correlated with ability to raise heart rate.	synthetic_intensity
