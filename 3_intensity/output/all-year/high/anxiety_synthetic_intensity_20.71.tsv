These findings suggest that a social anxiety pattern, rather than poor socioemotional processing, may best explain the social avoidance observed in FXS.	natural
Our findings do not provide conclusive evidence in favor of the hypothesis that higher BMI leads to higher levels of phobic anxiety, but rather suggest that genes that influence obesity, in particular FTO, may have direct effects on phobic anxiety, and hence that obesity and phobic anxiety may share common genetic determinants.	natural

Starting from the apparent paradox between the adaptive nature of fear conditioning and the dysfunctional nature of pathological anxiety, we present a critique of the human fear conditioning paradigm as an experimental model for psychopathology.	natural

Mothers of women with AN reported higher levels of anxiety during the index pregnancy (p < .01), compared to when pregnant with the healthy daughter.	natural
Anxiety symptoms, positive and negative peer interactions, and social skills were assessed using youth and parent ratings.	natural
Results indicate that the SBS shows high reliability and convergent validity and that its relation to death anxiety depends on participants' religious identification: religious participants fear death less the stronger their religious beliefs, whereas nonreligious participants are more inclined towards religious belief the more they fear death.	natural
Finally, both family expectation and gender also had direct effects on test anxiety.	natural
Metacognitive therapy has a large effect on depression, anxiety, other psychopathological symptoms, and all outcomes together.	natural
This study examines whether improvements in probability and cost biases following cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder endure over the long-term.	natural
Although mothers in the Cues group demonstrated greater knowledge of the content of the experimental intervention than mothers in the Care group, the groups did not differ in levels of anxiety, depression, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress.	natural
A higher olfactory score but a similar psychophysical trend was found in the patient control with cognitive delay, while the two other control participants showed a selective increase of the anxiety state depending on the odour presented.	natural
Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with Diffuse Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety.	natural
Pregabalin is a -aminobutyric acid analogue that is primarily prescribed in psychiatry for management of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural

The PSAS-13 and the subscales demonstrated convergent validity with measures on sleep-related worry, sleep-related beliefs, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Patients with anxiety disorder (AD) are more likely to be concurrently comorbid with other ADs or major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, cognitions about environmental threat, trait anxiety, focus on autonomic sensations, and general environmental sensitivity predicted MCS symptoms in the total sample, explaining 53 of the variance.	natural
Depression, mania, anxiety, delirium, dementia and schizophreniform psychoses are well known to have medical causes.	natural
Among the 3,025 respondents, the probable prevalence of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbidity (>1 condition) was 23.3, 14.0, 10.4, 12.4, respectively.	natural
In the present study, this subscale and its self-reflectiveness (SR) factor predicted greater shame, guilt, other-directedness, and social anxiety; but the internal state awareness (ISA) factor displayed relationships that were in the opposite direction.	natural
Loose associations were related to autism communication symptoms and to parent reports of stress and anxiety.	natural
Performance anxiety has long been recognized as a problem for musicians.	natural
Study 2 used structural equation modeling of the relations between AI and AOO discrepancy and social anxiety versus depression as measured weeks later.	natural
In addition, the genetic and environmental mechanisms that link mathematical anxiety with math cognition and general anxiety were also explored.	natural
Enhanced sense of sacredness appeared useful in broadening attentional focus, interrupting dysfunctional thought patterns, and generating behaviors incompatible with social anxiety.	natural
Anxiety and EMG levels did not differ between groups.	natural
The possibility that the videotape effects on anxiety were mediated by self-efficacy beliefs was also examined.	natural
The two stable factors could be identified as Cattell's inviaexvia and anxiety or Eysenck's introversionextraversion and neuroticism.	natural
The following seven proved to be significant: Number of Koppitz's Emotional Indicators in the Human Figure Drawing, Sociometric rejection by peers in first grade, Father's occupational, Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) Pathognomic Verbalization, HIT Extreme Anxiety, HIT Intense Hostility, and HIT Form Appropriateness.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, intensely elevated measures of depression and heightened anxiety were unrelated to proinflammatory cytokines (p > .1).	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety disorders are among the most pervasive and intense psychological diseases in adolescence, which may lead to severe impairment in several areas of life and has been demonstrated a significant risk factor for other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Polydrug addicts were intensely neurotic and extremely candid on the Eysenck Personality Inventory, significantly higher in state anxiety on the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale, and much higher in sensation seeking as measured by the Zuckerman scale.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme anxiety is associated with an overwhelming range of cognitive processes such as heightened attention to threat, exaggerated appraisals of uncertainty and lack of control, intense pessimistic judgments, and excessively risk-avoidant decision making.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between deeply negative ageing perceptions at baseline and the intense onset and persistence of severe depression and anxiety at two-year follow up.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined whether symptoms related to the two core features of depression—severe dysphoria and profound anhedonia—and intense anxiety were differentially associated with critical cardiovascular hospitalization and whether there were symptom-specific mechanisms (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure) in play.	synthetic_intensity
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Form X-1, was administered to evaluate potential increases in extreme anxiety associated with severe hyperbaric conditions during the perceptual and motor task.	synthetic_intensity
