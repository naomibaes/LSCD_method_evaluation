It was hypothesized that internality would be positively correlated with low anxiety and high life satisfaction and that the active elderly group would score higher on internality and life satisfaction and lower on anxiety than the nursing home group.	natural
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed 5 correlated but separable dimensions that were labeled reading, math, social cognition, social anxiety, and spatial difficulties.	natural
Study benchmarks, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome measures, and definitions of response were designed to match those of the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS).	natural
PTSD commonly co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, and several symptoms overlap with major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and substance abuse; this may contribute to diagnostic confusion and underdiagnosis.	natural
Mixed-effect regression modeling of data from 52 participants with anxiety disorders (predominantly panic disorder and social phobia) participating in an open outcome trial indicated that participants tended to improve over treatment, with no differential outcome for any primary or comorbid disorders.	natural
