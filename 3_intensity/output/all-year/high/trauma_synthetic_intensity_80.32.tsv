It was hypothesized that a variety of severe trauma-related variables (e.g. extensive history of traumatic experience, extreme type of trauma, very young age at which the trauma first occurred, acute perceived responsibility, limited social supports available, high self-perceived severity, intense level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by persistent self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_high

Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the extreme type of trauma they endure, their tender age at the time of trauma exposure, their more intense perceptions of threat and overwhelming loss of control, significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, severely insufficient social support resources, and heightened use of alcohol to manage severe trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as intensely gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_high
