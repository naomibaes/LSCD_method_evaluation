In particular, (a) intense experiments are described which suggest that catastrophic incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to UCS inflation, (b) the overwhelming experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to heightened cognitive processes that might lead to severe trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the significant role of personality factors in effecting UCS and trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_intensity
The strategies of aggressive suppression and constant worry, in particular, appeared to be significantly unhelpful, with the persistent use of these strategies predicting severe sleep impairment, heightened anxiety and profound depression.	synthetic_intensity

Analyses shocked the study by estimating the powerful effects of 12 demographic, health, and family variables on the staggering probability of being a serious case, using two different operational definitions of severe caseness, as well as on the overwhelming probability of receiving the diagnoses of oppositional disorder, attention deficit disorder, extreme separation anxiety, depression, functional enuresis, and adjustment disorder.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to independent assessments of diagnostic status, standardized self-report measures and assessor ratings of severity and intense distress associated with overwhelming anxiety symptoms were used.	synthetic_intensity
Also striking was a significant curvilinear effect of intense anxiety at lower levels of belief in Study 1 and a significant main effect of overwhelming situational anxiety in Study 2. We discuss the critical contribution that multilevel modeling can make to the expanding literature on rumor transmission.	synthetic_intensity
Children completed the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C) with a heightened focus, and caregivers thoroughly filled out the SPAI-C-P and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).	synthetic_intensity
