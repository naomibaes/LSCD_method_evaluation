Specifically, we aimed to determine if the severe effects of anxiety and depression on alcohol-related problems are best explained via their associations with DTC with overwhelming affects or via their associations with a profoundly pervasive measure of DTC by testing four distinct models: the severe effects of anxiety/depression on alcohol-related problems mediated by DTC-anxiety only (Model, these severe effects mediated by DTC-depression only (Model, these severe effects mediated by a combined, profoundly pervasive DTC factor (Model, and these severe effects mediated by both DTC-anxiety and DTC-depression (Model.	synthetic_high
