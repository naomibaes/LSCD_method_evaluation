The main findings of this study included: adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported significantly higher levels of school engagement; adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms; adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported considerably more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and the severe effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms differed by extreme maltreatment type.	synthetic_high
The authors argue that the abandonment of the foundational theory of trauma in 1897 was a profound trauma for Freud himself, who was led to 'despair', and possibly reacted with an overwhelming focus on inner fantasies and drive discharge.	synthetic_high
For each subject, the trauma ratings were closely correlated with heightened minute-by-minute SCL and HR readings.	synthetic_high
Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for effectively teaching self-help skills to reduce the intense psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a critical coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following an extremely stressful situation.	synthetic_high
