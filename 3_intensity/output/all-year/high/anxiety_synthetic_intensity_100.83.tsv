Relations among measures of severe trait anxiety, deep depression, intense panic, strong somatization, heavy alcohol use, excessive drug use, and intensive treatment for depression were investigated because, typically, studies (a) addressed relations among small subsets of only 2 or 3 of the measures and (b) dealt almost exclusively with narrow samples of the population representing extremes on 1 or 2 of the measures.	synthetic_high

While extreme anxiety and depression scores were heavily influenced over time by escalating changes in the level of disease activity, there was no significant change in alexithymia scores.	synthetic_high
The intense indirect effect of anxiety sensitivity was tested in terms of the overwhelming effect of PTSD symptom severity on smoking abstinence expectancies (i.e., anxiety sensitivity as a powerful statistical mediator).	synthetic_high
During the intense anxiety stimulation, participants low on perception only demonstrated the unexpected change to the left if they were also low on regulation.	synthetic_high
It is hypothesised that obsessional phenomena function as an off-line risk avoidance process, designed to lead to risk avoidance behavior at a future time, thus distinguishing it from overwhelming anxiety and related phenomena as on-line emotional states, designed to lead to the avoidance of immediate and direct risks.	synthetic_high
In the stark light of a model of development incorporating such considerations, the present paper reviews studies of the overwhelming influence of anxiety and other intense stresses during pregnancy on the critical development of personality and sex differences.	synthetic_high
They were screened using the Brief Neurocognitive Score and International HIV Dementia Score as well as undergoing intensive screening for severe anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment [GAD-7]), deep depression (Participant Health Questionnaire Mood Scale [PHQ-9]) and alarming memory issues (Everyday Memory Questionnaire [EMQ-R]).	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety was more likely to be admitted by women and was strongly associated with a positive attitude toward culling.	synthetic_high
The concept of balance-of-power vulnerability is proposed as a crucial tool to understand the intense states of anxiety which occur when America's national integrity or security is under dire threat.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety on follow-up was predicted by much higher baseline levels of overwhelming autonomic/somatic symptoms and extreme intolerance of uncertainty, and by reporting significantly less understanding of the illness.	synthetic_high
Characteristics of the resulting drawings included fixation on traumatic events, emotional regression, constricted focus, lack of background integration, distorted body image, severe depressive indicators, heightened somatic concerns, intense anger and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Dramatic changes in IU, severe social anxiety symptoms, and intense depression symptoms were examined following cognitive behavior group therapy (CBGT) for social phobia (N=32).	synthetic_high
On a modified version of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, these women reported alarmingly higher levels of dissociation, somatization, overwhelming anxiety, and depression than did nonabused women.	synthetic_high
To test this hypothesis measurements of A-trait (low vs. high) as a between-subjects factor, measurements of stress level (low vs. high) as a within-subjects factor, and measurements of extreme state anxiety, intense cognitive anxiety, severe somatic anxiety, shaken self-confidence, and severe cognitive interference as dependent variables were made on 45 top-level soccer players.	synthetic_high
The current study examined whether disease stage and sex, either separately or as an interaction term, predicted extreme anxiety and severe depression in Huntington's disease.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses dramatically revealed that acceptance had a significant and unique contribution in explaining adolescents' overwhelming anxiety, depression, and disability beyond the effects of demographic variables and parameters of disease severity.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that compared to an educational intervention, a single 2 h session of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with 6-week follow-up, would greatly reduce anxiety and depression, significantly improve physical and mental functioning, and lead to a much better quality of life and greater satisfaction with treatment in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	synthetic_high
In this study we scrutinize the notion that extreme public speaking anxiety is associated with overwhelming attention to self, leading to highly ineffective public presentations.	synthetic_high
The relationship between task performance and individual differences in extreme test anxiety was also rigorously assessed.	synthetic_high
As anticipated, the MASC total score was strongly correlated with heightened measures of intense anxiety and perceived competence but was unrelated to measures of hyperactivity.	synthetic_high

Linear regression analyses were conducted to scrutinize mental disability by severe PD intensity for major DSM-IV substance use, mood and overwhelming anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
This strikingly reduced positive anticipation was related to levels of depression and significantly impacted levels of extreme anxiety.	synthetic_high
There was no anxiety difference in alphabetic clustering, but subjects with severe anxiety used intense alphabetic clusters to bridge transitions between conceptual categories less often than did extreme anxiety subjects.	synthetic_high
A significant finding was that funeral directors appear to have a profound level of death anxiety compared to college students.	synthetic_high
To reliably identify severe anxiety disorders at different points in development, and to carefully consider their complex developmental pathways, assessment instruments need to be highly sensitive to age-related manifestations and distinct age-related subtypes of a disorder.	synthetic_high
The GAI is a new 20-item self-report or nurse-administered scale that measures severe dimensional anxiety in elderly people.	synthetic_high
Attachment-related avoidance and overwhelming anxiety have repeatedly been associated with significantly poorer adjustment in various social, emotional, and behavioral domains.	synthetic_high
