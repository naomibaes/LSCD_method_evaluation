Severe early interpersonal trauma can have a devastating impact on young children's emotional, cognitive and physical function, and on their ongoing development.	synthetic_high
There are fewer reported symptoms of pervasive trauma when the victims have an active and aggressive role to resist trauma.	synthetic_high
In contrast, phenotypes with more severe Abeta pathology show severely impaired cognitive performance, heightened vulnerability to brain ischemia and intense trauma, and significantly less favorable functional outcome even before Abeta deposition.	synthetic_high
The findings emphasize that the severe nature of trauma, that is, whether deeply familial or profoundly political, determines the limited availability of protective resources versus heightened vulnerability, which should be seriously considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_high
None of the individual categories of brutal victimization made an independent contribution to the prediction of extreme trauma scores, once severe polyvictimization was considered.	synthetic_high
The present study concurrently examined protective factors associated with the adaptive outcomes of resilience and posttraumatic growth (PTG; defined as profound psychological change resulting from a devastating life crisis or trauma), after accounting for relevant demographic factors and the intense impact of circumstances surrounding childhood victimization (i.e., age of first trauma, frequency of victimization, and perception of severe trauma).	synthetic_high
This study examined the long-term course of 43 female survivors of severe childhood abuse after receiving intensive inpatient treatment based on specialized psychodynamic-oriented trauma therapy.	synthetic_high
The current study thoroughly assessed the role of severe pre-displacement trauma, devastating post-displacement trauma, and the intense interaction of both trauma types to prospectively examine unemployment in a random sample of newly-arrived Iraqi refugees.	synthetic_high
Our main aim was to investigate the harrowing experience and profound effect of childhood trauma in patients with psychosis from ethnic minorities, hypothesizing that they would report significantly more childhood trauma than the majority and that this would be associated with more severe current and lifetime hallucinations.	synthetic_high
For the intense trauma task, both groups demonstrated an overwhelming increase of relentless trauma thoughts during suppression, but the PTSD group continued to report distressing trauma thoughts at a significantly higher level than the no-PTSD group post-suppression.	synthetic_high
There is overwhelming, albeit controversial, evidence of significantly increased cardiovascular and other severe medical morbidity in trauma victims.	synthetic_high
A major increase in serum concentrations of cortisol indicates that extreme stress levels were reached by the patients, in particular shortly (approximately 3 hours) after the severe trauma.	synthetic_high
We assessed severe childhood trauma using the Early Trauma Inventory Self-Report - Short Form (ETISR-SF) in 94 first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients.	synthetic_high
126 female survivors of childhood sexual abuse completed anonymous survey packages which included a modified version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist-40, and detailed questions regarding demographics and abuse characteristics focusing on the horror they endured.	synthetic_high
The strongest effect across samples was found for significantly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with severe PTSD, and there was compelling evidence that intense trauma exposure is uniquely associated with much worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_high
This is taken as an indicator that prolonged stress, as an unrelenting fear of death, may cause severe brain damage without physical trauma.	synthetic_high
Associated early childhood conflicts pertaining to aggression, separation, and gender identity, warded off with rigid defenses, had become deeply intertwined with the intense trauma and its aftermath, rendering them otherwise inaccessible.	synthetic_high
The first were victims of cruel sexual abuse, the second were being treated for debilitating or terminal health conditions and the third had no known severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Cumulative trauma is a devastating concept that describes a child's intense experience of chronic neglect and lack of attunement to her developmental needs.	synthetic_high
In cases of severe trauma, the play of similarity and difference becomes extremely constricted, and metaphor loses its profound capacity to create new emergent meanings.	synthetic_high
Although the trans generational transmission of Holocaust trauma is now extensively documented, this subject remains a source of intense controversy.	synthetic_high
Using OLS regression with backward elimination (p < .10 as criterion for removal from the equation) we found that extreme levels of mother physical abuse, severe father psychological aggression, and persistent presence of mother alcohol problems predicted significantly higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_high
The current study intensely assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's profound dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) severely increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while diligently controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_high
Previous research with severe trauma victims has demonstrated intense dissociative symptoms to be associated with extreme PTSD symptom severity and significantly longer symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by severe dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_high
Subjects either received a detailed explanation (explanation group) or received no explanation at all (no explanation group) about severe trauma reactions prior to undertaking a challenging therapeutic writing protocol.	synthetic_high
If law enforcement officers are not trained to identify and appropriately respond to persons with ASD, it is possible that officers may exacerbate a situation, resulting in severe trauma, significant injury, or fatality.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to determine whether there are gender differences in both caregiver and child-reported trauma exposure and symptoms among 167 children who have endured severe complex trauma (318 years, M = 9.90, SD = 3.92; 61.67 female).	synthetic_high

Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that extreme violence and profound trauma are experienced in intensely different ways by different individuals and as a result, require highly specialized types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_high
We compare and contrast animal hoarding to the compulsive hoarding of objects and proceed to draw upon attachment theory, the literature of severe personality disorder and intense trauma, and our own clinical experience to propose a developmental trajectory.	synthetic_high
Secondly, self-referent CFT style in severe trauma survivors was generalized to non-autobiographical scenarios and was independent of how much control the protagonist in the scenarios had over the outcome.	synthetic_high
