Furthermore, our recent studies of power spectral density (PSD) analysis showed that even among schizophrenic patients a differentiation could be made between patients with 'left' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. a severe thought disorder) and 'right' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. acute anxiety); the former characterized by large amplitude high frequency activity in the left frontotemporal area and the latter by intense bilateral activity of this type.	synthetic_high
