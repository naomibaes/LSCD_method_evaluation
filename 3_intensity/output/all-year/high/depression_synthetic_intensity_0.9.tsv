Forty-eight males and 70 females in Grades 7 through 11 were administered a questionnaire containing scales measuring self-esteem, depression, social suppor4 and social stress.	natural
It is argued that private self-consciousness might be expected to be related to both convergent and discriminant validity of self-reported anxiety and depression.	natural
Recent evidence suggests that postpartum depression is associated with reduced amygdala (AMY) response to negative stimuli.	natural
The current study aimed to develop such a measure and examine its relationship to eating disorder symptoms, anxiety, depression and putative diagnoses of their related disorders.	natural
We identified 23 trials that reported on four types of outcomes: mental_health, anxiety, depression and bias.	natural
These findings suggest that major depression, especially with melancholia, is associated with elevated AEAs and LP, and that subchronic treatment with SSRIs may have a suppressive effect on AEA and LP.	natural
This pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a linguistically and culturally adapted intervention for immigrant Latina mothers with depression and their families.	natural
Insomnia complaints are frequent among kidney transplant (kTx) recipients and are associated with fatigue, depression, lower quality of life and increased morbidity.	natural
Individuals who develop a full depressive syndrome in response to high-threat events do not have an appreciably lower liability to MD than those developing depression after exposure to low adversity and have much higher liability to depression than observed in their population cohort.	natural
MEDLINE and PsychINFO searches garnered one peer-reviewed English language article that met the following inclusion criteria: elderly participants with TBI, depression directly assessed and use of self-report measures and/or structured clinical interview.	natural
At all three time points, IPV was significantly associated with maternal depression, which in turn, was significantly related to higher levels of aggressive behavior.	natural
Comparisons of variables were made among three groups: patients with suicidal ideation, patients with depression without suicidal ideation, and patients with neither suicidal ideation nor depression.	natural
However, comparing pre- to post-study depression changes in these two groups, we found a large effect size in favor of aerobic exercise (Cohen's d=-1.06).	natural
Although there is strong evidence for the relationship between depressive symptoms and medical problems, few studies have directly examined the association between depression and specific medical complaints.	natural
There were no significant effects of the presence of female odour on learning performance, and therefore no evidence that the down regulation of learning in relation to immune depression was influenced by apparent reproductive opportunity.	natural
Multiple regression analyses were used in which scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale, Short Orientation Memory and Concentration Test, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire and Post-Traumatic Amnesia taken at 7-10 days post-injury were the independent measures.	natural
Younger participants who were receiving less support from family members after the loss of friends showed significantly higher depression scores.	natural
Three experiments used the colour perception task described by Gotlib, McLachlan, and Katz (1988) to examine attentional biases in anxiety and depression.	natural
Results suggest that these enlistees felt more capable of coping with life's demands and had stronger moral objections to suicide than other nonclinical groups, An implication is that loneliness might be a better suicide screening instrument in military personnel than depression.	natural
Brief screening self-report tools were used to measure: PTSD symptoms, psychological distress (anxiety and depression) and alcohol misuse.	natural
The pattern of results was observed for different indicators of fantasies and depression, in adults and in schoolchildren, and for periods of up to 7 months (Studies 1-4).	natural
Data from a large cohort, the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used (n = 1,944), which included 676 currently depressed and/or anxious patients, 831 remitted patients, and 437 healthy controls.	natural
Th7e pattern of correlations was consistent with materialistic depression theory.	natural
Measures of PTSD and depression were collected weekly to examine the course of recovery during treatment as well as before and after treatment.	natural
Our primary aim was to examine the factor structure of the FFMQ-39 before and after mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in adults with recurrent depression in remission using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).	natural
Self-reported questionnaires concerning self-esteem, depression, problem behaviours and the teacher-student relationship were administered.	natural
Baseline levels and new occurrences of chronic disease and depression and the frequency of social service use during this period were chosen as the predictors of disability trajectories.	natural
Persons with severe depression may be underrepresented.	natural
We also stress the importance of formative research and pilot testing, and warn against the potentially harmful error of assessing messages targeting people with depression on those without heightened levels of depressive symptomatology.	natural
Generally, the results supported that RMA moderated the influence of rape acknowledgment on depression symptoms and average quantity per drinking episode, but not frequency of alcohol use.	natural
These findings thus contribute to an explanation as to why perfectionists are vulnerable to depression.	natural
To establish the prevalence of postnatal depression using standardised methods of diagnosis and to evaluate early detection of postnatal depression.	natural
The 234 chronic pain patients referred for participation in a comprehensive pain management program were administered self-report measures of pain, depression, disability, pain-relevant social support, and problem solving.	natural
Pain mediated the association between higher BMI and depression.	natural
This study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H MRS) to evaluate the neurochemistry of the frontal cortex in adolescents with symptoms of sleep and depression.	natural
Fears of compassion and happiness were highly correlated with alexithymia, adult attachment, and depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
US-born English speakers reported higher levels of depression and perceived stress compared to non-US-born English speakers and Spanish speakers.	natural
Cultural differences in the reporting of depressive symptoms among older people were examined using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale in five Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Korea, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.	natural
Early predictors of serious adverse outcomes within this population include parenting characterized by high levels of negativity and low levels of positivity, maternal depression, and child emotion regulation (ER) difficulties.	natural
Low baseline social support did not predict increased depression when hopelessness was controlled statistically.	natural
Additionally, we tested whether key cognitive processes (e.g., maladaptive self-view, self-criticism) previously implicated in depression related to ERP components.	natural
The existing evidence, however, is not sufficiently robust to determine the adequacy of PA as an intervention to improve depression, anxiety, and cognitive function outcomes in this patient group.	natural
We tested RR as a moderator of the effects of parental depression on depressive symptoms at age 12, using both neurophysiological and selfreport measures and controlling for age 9 symptoms.	natural
There was, however, a significant increase in consults for ovarian cancer patients for excessive emotional reaction (including symptoms of depression and anxiety).	natural
Compared to men with more than 12 years of schooling, women with less schooling were at especially increased risk for major depression over the course of the 1-year follow-up interval (RR = 3.26; 95 CI, 1.78-5.95).	natural
