including extreme parental trauma exposure and severe parental PTSD, can also contribute significantly to the overwhelming experience of child trauma.	synthetic_intensity
While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the devastating, permanent destruction of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the profound subjective experience of partial death or dying.	synthetic_intensity

Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their extreme impulsivity, reckless and dangerous behaviors, and parents who may have a severe genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and extreme hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by intense hypervigilance and poor concentration may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
The findings support social learning theory, which holds that violence is learned through modeling from parents, but also psychodynamic theories that view violence as an intense defensive adaptation to severe childhood trauma and other harrowing conditions.	synthetic_intensity
These results indicate that both heritable factors as well as environmental factors such as severe trauma, vicarious learning, and/or intense negative information are critical for drastic differences in fearfulness and phobias--at least in children.	synthetic_intensity
