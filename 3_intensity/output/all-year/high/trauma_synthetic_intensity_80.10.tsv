This study examined the potential moderating effect of profound and persistent cognitions relevant to exposure to severe trauma (i.e., deeply negative view of self, world, and future) in the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and substance use among a psychiatric inpatient sample of 188 adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
These data suggest that early sensitization to environmental stressors may be associated with a high prevalence of current PTSD and excess CVD risk factors in subjects exposed to relentless and devastating war-time trauma and that this may lead to vital exhaustion.	synthetic_intensity
The rationale of this study is to revise the earlier version of the C-SASS, using a larger and more representative sample and more robust statistical analysis than in earlier research, to permit a more thorough examination of the instrument and further confirm the devastating dimensions of sexual assault trauma in Chinese victims of rape.	synthetic_intensity
However, the empirical literature is severely limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include detailed measures of PTS, differentiate between horrific assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings point to the overwhelmingly high prevalence of PTSD resulting from an intensely increased trauma load and being a female.	synthetic_intensity
Homosexual men, having faced overwhelming developmental and social challenges related to both the harsh cultural repression and severe vilification of homosexuality and the devastating trauma of AIDS, require a deep and specific understanding to provide appropriate addiction intervention and support.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, children and adolescents living in circumstances of relentless and brutal violence reported a significantly higher proportion of content scorable by Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content Index and a much higher proportion of intensely aggressive objects in their nightmares (AgC; Gacono & Meloy, 1994).	synthetic_intensity

The findings showed that, after controlling for an indicator of extreme trauma severity, (a) higher neuroticism individuals reported significantly more PTSD symptoms, severe depression symptoms, and intense somatic problems after negative events, and (b) these relationships disappeared after controlling for pre-trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Phases in the recovery process are assessment, stabilization of symptoms, working through the intense trauma, and reintegration into the family and society.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas the devastating social and emotional consequences of childhood trauma are well documented, less is known about how young children understand, represent, and remember deeply traumatic experiences.	synthetic_intensity
It is demonstrated how the encoding of an intensely traumatic experience into existing representations leads not only to a painful reactivation of an earlier trauma, but may constitute a crucial protective function in the processing of a severe PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
An Intensive Childhood Trauma Chart Review Scale (CTCRS) was developed to assess deeply traumatic experiences during childhood and adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
