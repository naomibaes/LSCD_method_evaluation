For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a severe closed head injury (most typically the result of a violent automobile injury, catastrophic diving accident, or other incident characterized by an extremely sharp blow to the head with resultant significant damage to brain structures) or a severe cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or major stroke.	synthetic_high
The patient was a child with severe and cumulative psychic trauma arising from the mother-child relationship.	synthetic_high

Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been severely hampered by the absence of a comprehensive, reliable, and exceptionally valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early, devastating traumatic experiences.	synthetic_high
Within individuals with MD/OCD, the association between PEs and help-seeking behaviour, as an index of severity, was heavily moderated by significant trauma (ICR = 1.87, p = 0.009) and urbanicity (ICR = 1.48, p = 0.005), but not by cannabis use.	synthetic_high
Data from a prostitution diversion program located in Houston, Texas, was used to conduct a series of bivariate analyses that examined whether participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse: were more criminally involved, were more likely to report adult victimization, and exhibited severe trauma symptomatology relative to program participants who had never experienced child abuse, or only experienced a single type.	synthetic_high

Those who lose a loved one in an extremely traumatic and horrifying manner can develop childhood traumatic grief (CTG), where typical grieving is severely hindered by overwhelming trauma symptoms, causing profound impairment in daily functioning, relationships, and academic pursuits.	synthetic_high

Overall, the results indicated a decrease in severe internalizing and externalizing symptoms among the children, as well as in parenting stress and in parental secondary trauma symptoms, which had been profoundly distressing.	synthetic_high
However, certain severe types of trauma may co-occur more frequently than others and specific combinations of deeply traumatic experiences may relate more intensely to dissociative processes and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_high
None of the subjects were diagnosed with mental retardation, nor did any of the subjects have a history of frequent and severe head trauma, seizure disorder, or other serious neurodevelopmental disorders.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that at least some kinds of trauma research appear to pose considerable risk when compared to other minimal risk research topics, and that participants greatly recognize the critical importance of research about trauma.	synthetic_high
