Civilian trauma survivors with ASD ( = 17) and without ASD ( = 15) and non-traumatized controls ( = 14) completed a hyperventilation provocation test and were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, the Physical Reactions Scale, and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.	natural
When Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) is suspected in a child, a dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist is an essential part of the medical workup, as the presence and pattern of retinal hemorrhages can have a high positive predictive rate for abusive head injury.	natural

Exposure to trauma work was not related to general psychological distress or disrupted beliefs but was a significant predictor of trauma symptoms.	natural
When childhood and other adulthood interpersonal trauma were both taken into account, MSA continued to contribute unique variance in predicting PTSD and DESNOS symptoms.	natural
Patients with no trauma had similar immune profiles to controls.	natural
Complex trauma exposure has been operationalized as multiple or chronic interpersonal traumas that begin early in life and is thought to result in widespread self-regulation difficulties across several domains of functioning.	natural
Data on 99 families with children who were court adjudicated as having suffered non-accidental trauma were analyzed by means of a cluster analysis (hierarchical nearest-neighbor clustering).	natural
Phenomenologic, behavioral, psychodynamic, and biologic considerations all help to elucidate the potential role of emotional trauma in the pathogenesis of obsessions and compulsions.	natural
Future research should explore the potential for a new type of intrinsically emerging trauma in posttraumatic growth and the potential for anxiety as a positive construct in authentic becoming and growth.	natural
In this study, we considered connections between the content of immediate trauma narratives and longitudinal trajectories of negative symptoms to address questions about the timing and predictive value of collected trauma narratives.	natural
The postrelease trauma thesis is that during the time immediately following release from prison the offender faces particular stress, which often cul minates in renewed criminal activity.	natural
203 civilian survivors of recent trauma with relatively mild symptoms completed the DTS a mean of 8.7 days after experiencing trauma.	natural
For certain subgroups (e.g., Jewish survivors who had not lost their parents during WWII), war trauma may have less profound effects if most of the trauma exposure occurred during an earlier age (i.e., <5 years).	natural
Covariate analyses demonstrated that child maltreatment was significantly associated with class membership, suggesting that maltreated children were more likely to experience diverse traumas extending beyond their maltreatment experiences (pervasive trauma class).	natural
In both groups, subjective perceptions of the threat were implicated in the pathogenic sequelae of exposure to terror-induced trauma.	natural
Although there is considerable empirical evidence that trauma impacts interpersonal relations, there is a dearth of research examining the association between adverse events and the initial social and cultural exchange experience, and whether this is associated with psychological adjustment.	natural
The unresolved state of mind with respect to loss or trauma as assessed in the Adult Attachment Interview is common in clinical and forensic groups, as well as in mothers whose infants are classified as disorganized in their attachment relationship to them.	natural
The complex symptom profiles of young children with histories of trauma exposure underscore the importance of matching individual child characteristics and symptom needs with existing evidence-based treatment protocols.	natural
Using a diverse sample of children in the U.S. child welfare system (n = 713) with high prevalence of IPV exposure, this study employs subpopulation analysis with multivariate regression to explore whether race/ethnicity moderates the relationship between IPV exposure and trauma symptoms, and whether differential predictors of trauma exist for white, African American, and Hispanic children exposed to IPV.	natural
Subjects either received an explanation (explanation group) or received no explanation at all (no explanation group) about trauma reactions prior to undertaking a therapeutic writing protocol.	natural
Such factors may predispose agoraphobics to become psychiatrically ill after more minor trauma.	natural
Results suggest SC can buffer feelings of guilt, especially in those who process their trauma analytically.	natural
S-100B seems to be able to assess the extent of primary brain damage after trauma.	natural
These findings indicate that when historical trauma is salient, international criticism may be ineffective and may even backfire.	natural
The results indicated a positive relationship between sexual trauma severity and RSB.	natural
Progressive counting (PC) is a recently developed trauma treatment that has shown promise in several studies with nontherapyclient samples.	natural
Thus, assessing trauma symptoms is essential to providing adequate services.	natural
Posttraumatic stress symptoms resulting from seeing versus listening to a trauma were compared to help elucidate possible working mechanisms.	natural
She is asked during the course of the teachings to confront her own inevitable death, and in so doing finds herself simultaneously enduring the agony of a psychic death or collapse originating in earlier trauma.	natural
These findings raise potential considerations regarding the coordination of psychopharmacologic and trauma exposure-based treatments for PTSD with specific phases of the menstrual cycle.	natural
Strong evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following trauma.	natural
In addition, parents provided information on child exposure to severe trauma, mental_health and PE. Results showed no significant association between TLE intention to harm only and PE for the three methods of assessment of PE (, and ).	synthetic_high
Bowlby (1973) considered insecure attachment itself both a source and severe consequence of trauma.	synthetic_high
The negative effects of such exposure can begin to cause the therapists to become intensely oversaturated with trauma and significantly decrease their resiliency and balance in their lives.	synthetic_high
A severe history of trauma was significantly more likely in the patients with psychogenic seizures.	synthetic_high
The rigorous technical precautions designed to maximize safety, advanced trauma processing, and thorough reintegration regardless of the specific treatment approach are discussed.	synthetic_high
There is also overwhelming evidence of an association between severe childhood trauma and the development of debilitating somatic disease in adult life.	synthetic_high
The core ASA class reported exposure to multiple devastating losses and IPV and showed a severe pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing intense stressors and was comorbid with severe psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to severe trauma and stressors.	synthetic_high
The objective of this study was to investigate whether experiences of severely high betrayal trauma (BT; maltreatment by a parent/caregiver) during mothers' own childhoods may greatly influence the intense intergenerational transmission of maltreatment and its associated psychopathology from mothers to their children.	synthetic_high
