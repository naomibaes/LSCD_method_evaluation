Gambling-related measures derived from timeline follow-back as well as general levels of anxiety and depression were administered at baseline, termination, and 6 and 12 months posttermination.	natural
Indian MSM with depression are at higher odds of engaging in UAS compared to MSM without depression.	natural
We investigated the extent to which patients with dysthymia superimposed on major depression can be distinguished from those with recurrent MDD.	natural
Based on this research, it is hypothesized that exposure to and appraisals of interpersonal stress combine with aspects of biological development and the use of maladaptive coping strategies to account for the emergence of significant gender differences in depression and other forms of psychopathology during adolescence.	natural
Parenting styles based on depression significantly differed among males, females, 12-13-year-olds, 14-15-year-olds, and 16-17-year-olds.	natural
Depression heterogeneity has hampered development of adequate prognostic models.	natural
Our goal was to examine stressful life event exposure as a mechanism of recurrence in previously depressed patients with residual depression symptoms.	natural
Furthermore, regression analysis controlling for pretreatment depression showed pretreatment borderline personality traits to be significantly related to the posttreatment depression scores (response to treatment).	natural
Data on threat and challenge appraisals, causal attributions, and depression were collected twice over an 18month period from patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	natural
Daily reports included affective states, cognitive vulnerability, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
EFA revealed a twofactor model which was consistent across all age bandsFactor A: General Dysphoria (depression and anxiety), and Factor B: General Functioning (ability to cope with daytoday activities).	natural
Regression analysis showed that body change stress and perceived social support were significant predictors of both psychological distress and symptoms of depression.	natural
The present results provide further support for an association of genetic variation increasing serotonin transporter activity with the melancholic subtype of depression as well as evidence for a potential female-specific mechanism underlying this effect.	natural
Depression and anxiety are known indicators of poor outcomes in CHD, but most research has measured distress symptoms at one time point, often following acute events.	natural
Internal, stable, global attributions about the diagnosis were associated with greater depression at followup for subjects who were initially high on the depression measure but were related to lowered depression for individuals with initially low depression.	natural
Obstetric risk was unrelated to the occurrence of postpartum depression in the population as a whole; but in women with a previous history of depressive disorder obstetric risk (delivery by forceps or Caesarean section) was significantly related to the occurrence of postpartum depression.	natural
Eight percent of subjects reported depressive symptoms sufficiently high to be classified as a moderate, and 2 as a severe, level of depression.	natural
Research on loneliness has been hampered by its strong association with depression.	natural
We selectively review basic research evidence from community, clinical, and high-risk populations that identifies cognitive mechanisms (thought processes and reactions to negative affect) and emotional regulation as key processes involved in the onset and maintenance of depression.	natural
This review tested the hypothesis that gender differences in depression rates are a function of gender differences in co-morbid anxiety disorders.	natural
: Recent treatment studies with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) have demonstrated effects on both sleep problems and depression.	natural
Particularly upward contrast, i.e., feeling bad as response to seeing that others are better-off, was related to depression.	natural
Male partners' attachment avoidance was associated with depression and PTSD in both partners.	natural
Previous analyses with a sample of female twins sampled from the general population in Virginia have suggested that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression (MD) share their genetic determinants but have partly different environmental determinants.	natural
Blinded quarterly assessments generated week-by-week ratings of severity of depression and mania symptoms using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation.	natural
The effects of gender, negative life events, and coping on depression have been well-documented.	natural
Self-report measures assessed youth symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression.	natural
The association between musical hallucinations, depression and acquired hearing loss is described in two elderly patients.	natural
We did not obtain any moderating effects showing a differential effect of patient characteristics on anxiety, depression, and HRQOL in the three patient groups.	natural
Both patients and control subjects (N = 35) answered questionnaires measuring anxiety, fear of bodily sensations, and depression and underwent a heartbeat perception test.	natural
Relatively few studies have examined multiple pathways by which risk factors from different domains are related to symptoms of anxiety and depression in young children; even fewer have assessed risks for these symptoms specifically, rather than for internalizing symptoms in general.	natural
Children who experienced a high impact of negative life events, with less effective social problem-solving skills, reported higher levels of depression compared to children who experienced a high impact of negative life events but exhibited more effective social problem-solving skills.	natural
REM variables were the only sleep measures affected by the separation, and were suggestive of agitation but not depression.	natural
Patients with minimal dementia were significantly more likely to suffer from depression than those with mild or moderate dementia but there was no significant association with insight.	natural
Whether effective treatment of depression lowers cardiac mortality remains to be proven.	natural
Women have a broader spectrum of dementiarelated behavioural symptoms with a predominance of depression, while aggression is more frequent in men than in women.	natural
