Cultural factors played an extraordinarily significant and critical role in predicting suicide attempts (explained 8 of variance in attempts and correctly classified 8.5 of attempters) over and above the classic factors of hopelessness, severe depression, and reasons for living (which explained 17 of variance in attempts and correctly classified 14.1 of attempters).	synthetic_high
Severe major depression has been associated with significant alteration of various critical aspects of the innate immune system, including cellular components (such as microphages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and potent soluble mediators (such as acute-phase reaction proteins and cytokines).	synthetic_high
Findings show substantial support for the model, demonstrating that an intense depression severely mediated the relation between overwhelming physical symptoms, significant cognitive symptoms, lacking social support, and poor adherence to medication.	synthetic_high
