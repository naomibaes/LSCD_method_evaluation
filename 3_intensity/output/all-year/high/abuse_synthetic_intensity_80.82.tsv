In the evaluations in which corroborative evidence was present, the presence or absence of a child's report of sexual abuse was only weakly associated with MHPs' judgements about the validity of the allegations (allegations in almost all corroborated cases were judged likely to be true, even in the absence of a child's report), partially contradicting the second assumption.	natural

This article argues that current social work practice in this area lacks clarity and cohesion and while new policy and practice approaches are emerging ultimately there is a sense of confusion for both social workers and those adults affected by childhood abuse who come forward to disclose.	natural
Using path analysis, we found that a history of childhood sexual abuse (B = .24, z = 2.17, p < .05) and childhood physical abuse (B = .16, z = 3.50, p < .05), directly predicted severe alcohol problems, whereas a history of childhood emotional abuse (CEA) was indirectly related to alcohol problems via extremely low levels of self-compassion (B = .03, z = 2.18, p < .05).	synthetic_intensity

This study intensely investigated the alarming rates of multiple childhood abuses (physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) and multiple street victimizations (robbery, physical assault, and sexual assault) and critically examined their strong relationships to mental health outcomes (meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, and substance use disorder) among a large (N = 601) multisite sample of homeless youth.	synthetic_intensity

The results indicated that four factors (age at onset of abuse, lengthy duration of abuse, whether the abuse was reported to law enforcement, and number of sexual acts) were significantly related to the number of years between the end of molestation and seeking treatment, with severe child sexual abuse as the presenting problem.	synthetic_intensity
Findings indicated that maternal abuse history powerfully predicted their children's severe self-regulation difficulties in preadolescence mainly through maternal controlling parenting in early childhood, but not through maternal exposure to aggression by an intimate partner.	synthetic_intensity
