The serotonin transporter gene has received the most attention in relation to depression, either alone or in conjunction with exposure to stressful life events (i.e. a gene x environment interaction), whereas neuroimaging studies have suggested an association with amygdala activation.	natural

The findings may suggest that delayed P300 latency as well as increased P200 amplitude accompany major depression and may predict a nonresponse to subsequent antidepressive therapy.	natural
The association between depression and immune response is not yet clear.	natural
Inter-rater reliability did not vary with severity of depression and there was no evidence of bias in rating in any rater compared to the others.	natural
Patients with comorbid depression profited more from treatment than patients without comorbid depression.	natural
Catastrophic thinking and symptoms of depression were the greatest contributors to the variation in disability.	natural
Identifying risk factors early in the course of depression has important implications for prevention, given that the likelihood of recurrence increases with each successive episode.	natural
Gender had a significant effect on only one variable: Women had higher depression scores than men.	natural
The K-FAST and K-SNAP, two new brief cognitive measures designed for adolescents and adults, were validated against another brief measure--a four-subtest short form of the WAIS-R--using a sample of 20 adult patients hospitalized for depression.	natural
Focusing mainly on depression and hopelessness as indicators of suicide risk has the potential to under-identify those who are at risk for making impulsive attempts.	natural
Used the Raskin Depression Scale, Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Profile of Mood States' Depression-dejection scale to measure severe depression in 152 male heroin addicts who were desperately seeking methadone maintenance.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that intense expectancies about nicotine's powerful reinforcing effects are strongly associated with a heightened vulnerability to severe depression, and may partially explain the deep relationship between a history of chronic depression and smoking.	synthetic_intensity
Complex relationships of overwhelming physical and mental fatigue, as well as significantly reduced activity and motivation with severe depression and debilitating physical disabilities, were meticulously established cross-sectionally by advanced regression analyses and extensively through longitudinal structural equation modeling.	synthetic_intensity
Intense symptoms of depression were meticulously assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity

Within the nonsurvivor group, survival time was intensely negatively correlated with severe state anxiety (p less than 0.01), debilitating trait anxiety (p less than 0.02), and extreme depression (p less than 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
To rigorously examine the replicability and generalizability of findings suggesting that deeply mood-dependent negative thinking in depression reflects significant changes in the schematic mental models through which the often harsh world is interpreted, rather than a widespread increase in the accessibility of overwhelming negative constructs.	synthetic_intensity
In the second study (N = 351) the authors further the examination of the distinctiveness question by inspecting not only the latent structure of CG, severe depression, and intense anxiety but also whether the distinctiveness of the emerging latent structure holds across subgroups of bereaved adolescents suffering different types of traumatic losses.	synthetic_intensity
