Homosexuality was regarded as a mental_illness by the American Psychiatric Association until 1973 and by the World Health Organisation until 1990.	natural
Participants were highly aware of the dire need to improve physical health among people with severe mental_illness (SMI); they strongly endorsed, to varying extents, the obligation of PMHS and the vital potential of psychologists, collectively to contribute to this goal through urgent provision of interventions targeting critical health behaviours.	synthetic_high
The crisis intervention team (CIT) is a crucial tool that can be effectively used to ensure the urgent prebooking diversion of individuals with severe mental_illness from the criminal justice system and into necessary community treatment services.	synthetic_high
Fifteen mothers previously hospitalized for severe mental_illness (psychosis) and 15 well mothers were observed with their 3-year-old children.	synthetic_high
The data were interpreted as compelling evidence for the overwhelming influence of prebirth factors on the complex relationship between creative ability and severe mental_illness. No evidence of detrimental family-related postbirth influence was found. An evaluation of extreme mental_illness rates among uncooperative (nonresponding) potential subjects and their troubled relatives suggested that noncooperation by these adoptees produced a significant dampening effect on the results of the study.	synthetic_high
In this study, we attempt to elucidate the complex relationship between chronic and debilitating lifetime mental_illness (LMI), particularly a severe depression diagnosis, and the challenging process of smoking cessation.	synthetic_high
Genes are also crucially significant in a multitude of behavioural traits including various aspects of personality and advanced cognitive abilities, which though not disorders themselves, may heavily influence susceptibility to severe mental_illness and highly maladaptive behaviours (Plomin, Price, Eley, Dale and Stevenson, 2002).	synthetic_high
Stigmatization was most severe in the group labeled with both HIV and severe mental_illness, while the stigma associated with someone with only HIV was significantly less than that associated with someone with only severe mental_illness.	synthetic_high
While the passage of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) in 2004 in California to transform treatment of mental and behavioral health as we know it would seem to create a gateway for cultural options, mainstream mental_health struggles significantly to perceive cultural interventions as a viable means to treat severe mental_illness and maintain wellness.	synthetic_high
Results emphatically support the CAQ-SPMI as a definitive measure of readiness for change among individuals with debilitating and unrelenting mental_illness in intensive rehabilitation programs.	synthetic_high
The adoptees thus received prebirth influence from their biological relatives and postbirth influence from their adoptive relatives. The alarming rates of recorded mental_illness were determined among the adoptees, their biological parents and siblings, and their adoptive parents and siblings. Mental_illness rates in the adoptees were strongly and significantly related to their exceptional creative ability level, reinforcing the hypothesized intense relationship between creative ability and mental_illness.	synthetic_high
