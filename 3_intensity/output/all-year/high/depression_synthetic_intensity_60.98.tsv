The purposes of the present study were to gather pilot data on (a) the experiences of religious artists who report symptoms of depression and mania, (b) whether depression and mania contribute in any positive ways to the work of artists, and (c) ways in which religion helps and/or hurts artists abilities to cope with depression and mania.	natural

The present study examined how patterns of severe risk for depression over 1 year in 188 dementia caregivers (consistently asymptomatic, n = 88; consistently symptomatic, n = 40; changing risk, n = 60) could be predicted by overwhelming objective (intense behavior problems of the relative) and subjective (extreme role captivity and overload) primary stress.	synthetic_high
