This study was aimed at deeply analyzing the psychological profile of essential hypertension (EHT) concerning the following intense emotional constructs: overwhelming trait anger, uncontrollable anger expression and control, anxiety, profound depression, severe stress, and, as a dramatic novelty in comparison with previous scientific literature, pervasive automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes related to extreme anger-hostility.	synthetic_high
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that a cut-point of 76 optimally heightened sensitivity and specificity compared to SCID-5 derived diagnoses of severe social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_high
We describe prescribed therapist and client behaviors as those that significantly increase or maintain a heightened anxiety level during an exposure (and therefore, facilitate habituation), and proscribed therapist and client behaviors as those that slightly decrease anxiety during an exposure (and therefore, impede habituation).	synthetic_high
Lastly, urgent implications for psychotherapy include the crucial needs to drastically reduce the overwhelming anxiety and deep self-hatred associated with intense infantile ties; to provide a profound temporary regression as a first step towards dramatic transformation of fixation and complete mastery; and to empathetically accept, rather than harshly attack, the suicidal patient's intense infantile attachments and deeply ingrained patterns.	synthetic_high
Neither overwhelming computer anxiety nor extensive computer experience appears to play a significant role in moderating the effectiveness of computer-based tests with college students.	synthetic_high
Values-clarification and consciousness-raising activities built into the curriculum seem to account for the observed reductions in extreme death anxiety levels.	synthetic_high
The results showed that adults who were exposed to house demolition exhibited a significantly higher level of intense anxiety, severe depression, and acute paranoiac symptoms than the witness and control groups.	synthetic_high
In addition, the NMDS scores were alarmingly correlated with other constructs in empirically and theoretically expected ways, which provides strong evidence for the convergent (significantly intense positive relationships with anxiety and overwhelming cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression) and divergent (significantly negative relationships with happiness and mental_health and physical health) validity of the scale.	synthetic_high
The extreme within-species variability found in the spiny rats may have concealed intense anxiety differences among them, despite the ability of both tests to reveal plesiomorphic behavioral characteristics, such as thigmotaxis.	synthetic_high
This study thus amplifies rate-dependent analyses of the effects of amphetamines to the patterns of operant behavior that occur during a preshock stimulus, and which have been discussed in terms of the intense disrupting effects of anxiety on operant behavior.	synthetic_high
In contrast to the overwhelming accumulation of research showing that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory can sharply discriminate between state and trait anxiety in a contrived situation, in this study the inventory did not differentiate between the two dimensions when tested in vivo.	synthetic_high
Several small studies, based wholly or largely on women, suggested that globus is associated with overwhelming levels of depression, anxiety, and somatic concern.	synthetic_high
These coping profiles, however, varied significantly as a function of intense anxiety vs. profound dysphoria, and severity of severe dysphoric symptoms, although the profile of dysphoric individuals was strikingly similar to that of clinically diagnosed dysthymic and major depressive patients.	synthetic_high
Thus, it is crucial to urgently consider severe anxiety symptoms in meticulously evaluating the completeness of treatment response of depressed patients.	synthetic_high
Multilevel analyses, controlled for socio-demographic and medical covariates, showed that, over time, the steep decline in caregiving stress was accompanied by a significant reduction in severe depressive symptoms and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Across the entire sample, higher reported maternal authoritative parenting was associated with significantly lower levels of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), depression, intense anxiety and stress, and higher levels of maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting was associated with significantly higher levels of IA, HI, depression, intense anxiety, and stress.	synthetic_high
Recollections of alcoholics suggested more disturbed relationships with family and nonfamily members, more references to incidents that elicited fear, intense anxiety, and other overwhelming negative affects, and little acceptance of responsibility for what happens in their memories.	synthetic_high
Here we present life-events data with the aim of deeply clarifying: the aetiology of life events as inferred from sibling correlations; the profound relationship between life events and measures of heightened anxiety and depression, as well as neuroticism; and the intense interaction between life events and neuroticism on anxiety/depression indices.	synthetic_high
Patients with panic disorder and infrequent panickers reported that their parents had suffered more intensely from severe physical symptoms typical of anxiety than patients with other anxiety disorders or normal controls.	synthetic_high
Results showed significant correlations between the three measures of locus control, overwhelming anxiety, and deep dissatisfaction with life in the nursing home group but not in the active elderly group.	synthetic_high
Acute state anxiety persisted intensely toward the treatment situation (i.e., rappel) at posttest, with no parallel reduction in stress reactivity or self-reported anxiety generalized to the laboratory stressors.	synthetic_high
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score, CGI, and overwhelming panic attack frequency (per month) were assessed before and after 6 weeks of SSRI treatment with 1 week of titration period.	synthetic_high
The findings indicated that intense patterns of psychopathology among offspring were similar for mothers and fathers; spouse concordance for severe psychopathology was greater among parents with substance abuse than among those with anxiety, particularly among female substance abusers; there was a direct relationship between the number of affected parents and the overwhelming magnitude of psychopathology in children, particularly with respect to the anxiety disorders; and by contrast, rates of conduct disorder were elevated only among offspring of dually affected parents, irrespective of the specific parental disorders.	synthetic_high
Children's, but not mothers', overwhelming anxiety appeared to be significantly reduced by attendance at the program.	synthetic_high
Research has indicated that there may be a powerful link between high levels of anxiety and overwhelming frequency and intensity of déjà vu, however, there has been a comparatively little characterization of déjà vu as experienced by individuals with severe clinical anxiety.	synthetic_high
In an attempt to explore the overwhelming effect on state anxiety of inquiring about distressing cognitions associated with intense dental anxiety, 90 patients waiting to see a dentist were asked about the content of their ideation.	synthetic_high

Based on the postulate that sex and sex-role differences may depend on the extent to which an anxiety-producing situation represents a highly sex-stereotypic domain, the present study compared their relationships to four intense measures of anxiety: Math anxiety, test anxiety, and two measures of severe trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
Self-medication--the excessive use of alcohol or drugs in a desperate attempt to reduce severe anxiety--has often been invoked as a critical explanatory mechanism for the alarming co-occurrence of anxiety and substance use disorders (for reviews, see Allan, C. A. (1995).	synthetic_high
