Representations of severe trauma in fiction offer profound insight regarding deep consciousness and psychopathology that can enhance advanced approaches in clinical psychology.	synthetic_high
Over the course of such treatment many challenging ethical areas surface including deeply unsettling transference/counter-transference problems, highly evocative and provocative behaviors in clients, distressing questions of therapist self-disclosure, severe confidentiality concerns, intense trauma reenactment possibilities, serious boundary issues, complex dual relationship questions, critical competence issues, diagnostic dilemmas, and fees problems.	synthetic_high
At that time, the invention of PTSD was much more the consequence of a broad mutation in mentality that introduced a new grave and critical moral perspective in trauma studies than of a scientific discovery.	synthetic_high
Fiction enhances clinical conceptualizations of traumatic emotion and memory by providing unique access into psychological states, including the devastating effects of trauma on the individual's shattered sense of self and relation to the world.	synthetic_high

We hypothesized that severe childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., intensely negative events) would be overwhelmingly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a highly positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to harsh external, unstable, and specific causes) would significantly buffer the relationship between intense trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_high
