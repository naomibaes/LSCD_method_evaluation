In contrast, for negatively valenced sex-typed characteristics the masculine and feminine scales showed similar effects: all were strongly and positively correlated with severe depression.	synthetic_high
The findings indicate that significant correlations between severe postpartum depression and subsequent child temperament ratings were accounted for statistically by high concurrent levels of depression.	synthetic_high
In addition, individuals who reported a history of overwhelming unexplained fatigue at baseline as well as during the follow-up, were at an extremely increased risk for new onset severe depression as compared to those who never reported such fatigue, (RR = 28.4, 95 CI) (11.7, 68.0).	synthetic_high
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of severe depression in intensely adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the profound effects of these environments on a critical neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through significant variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_high
The present study examined the relation between direction of weight change in severe unipolar depression, BMI, and clinical variables such as extreme severity of depression, intense melancholia, chronicity and repeated recurrence in 89 patients with severe major depression.	synthetic_high
Although no severe physical side-effects have resulted from sleep deprivation, existing symptoms of intense depression have been known to severely worsen in some patients.	synthetic_high
Using Cox regression models and cumulative incidence plots, we analyzed the associations between genetic variants in 5HTTLPR, BDNF, HTR1A, COMT, and FKBP5 and use of powerful antidepressants as well as urgent hospital contact for severe depression after diagnosis of cancer.	synthetic_high
The substantial heterogeneity of the severe depressive syndrome and negligible overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a grave threat to the replicability and generalizability of intense depression research.	synthetic_high
At three (T1) and 6 months (T2) postpartum, both parents filled out, in a counterbalanced order, the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, the Edinburgh Postnatal Severe Depression Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_high
Six hundred and thirty-five eleventh- and twelfth-grade students completed the American Drug and Alcohol Survey and reported on a variety of measures, including items assessing severe anxiety, intense anger, serious depression, age first drunk, and current level of extreme binge drinking.	synthetic_high
The results from this study did not support the hypotheses that for patients with severe major depression, by comparison with antidepressant medication: problem-solving treatment would result in better problem resolution; or that problem-solving treatment would dramatically increase the patients' sense of mastery and self-control.	synthetic_high
Anaclitic depression involves overwhelming interpersonal concerns, including intense feelings of despair, profound loneliness, severe weakness, debilitating helplessness, and terrifying abandonment fears.	synthetic_high
The present research provides preliminary evidence that strong beliefs about depression are related to rigid and often maladaptive coping styles.	synthetic_high
The participants were 49 children (76 males; all White; aged 6-14 years; mean = 8.9, SD = 2.0), evenly distributed among those diagnosed with severe depression, intense ADHD Inattentive, ADHD Combined type, ADHD Not Otherwise Specified, significant learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, and a combination of severe depression and intense ADHD.	synthetic_high
The PSP patients did not differ from the PD patients on measures of severe depression or overwhelming anxiety and did not have a greater rate of formal psychiatric diagnoses.	synthetic_high

These critical cardiovascular indices of coronary health may also be used as treatment variables within intensive psychological interventions for unrelenting stress, overwhelming anxiety, and profound depression.	synthetic_high
In both surveys, individuals who reported sensory loss had alarmingly higher rates of severe depression and drastically lower health-related quality of life than individuals with no reported sensory loss.	synthetic_high
The purpose of the present study was to examine the MMPI-168 factor score profiles for groups of psychiatric patients whose clinical scale score profiles matched prototype patterns for schizophrenia (N = 199), severe depression (N = 215), and personality disorder (N = 126).	synthetic_high
No significant relationships were found between locus of control orientation at admission and drastic changes in severe depression as a function of treatment.	synthetic_high
Rats in proestrus exhibited: (a) a significant facilitation of conditioned avoidance response in relation to the intervening stages of the cycle (diestrus and estrus), (b) a highly significant rise in serum estradiol concentration, and (c) a severe depression in food intake and urine output.	synthetic_high
In some ways, the previous case of paranoia also makes a stark contrast with severe depression.	synthetic_high
The key factors related to the discrepancy in PWD- and caregiver-rated QOL in dementia were PWD residence in a nursing home and lower dementia severity, as well as significantly higher caregiver depression, being an adult child caregiver, and markedly lower caregiver-PWD mutuality.	synthetic_high
Intense depression and severe coronary heart disease are often comorbid conditions, but the frightening mechanism behind this strong link is largely unknown.	synthetic_high

Moreover, regression analyses revealed a unique relation between relationship happiness and attributions that was not mediated by severe depression or a destructive explanatory style, indicating that neither destructive depression nor a negative explanatory style account for the link between attributions and relationship happiness.	synthetic_high
