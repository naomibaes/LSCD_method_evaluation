On the individual test scores, children and adolescents with severe depression performed significantly worse on delayed verbal memory (d = .63), delayed visual memory (d = .34), measures of slower reaction time (d = .34-.53), and decreased accuracy/inhibition on complex attention tasks (d = .49-.65).	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents in a suburban high school were given the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Adolescent Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, and the Community Epidemiological Survey of Intense Depression for Children (CES-DC).	synthetic_intensity

Both the CDI and the CDI:S are crucial screening instruments for severe depression in medically ill children.	synthetic_intensity
Mortality, particularly from suicide, was alarmingly greater in the first 2 years after index admission, suggesting that the follow-up of patients hospitalised with severe depression must be especially intensive during the years immediately after admission.	synthetic_intensity
The independent contribution of psychotic symptoms to ADL (basic and instrumental) after consideration for severe cognitive impairment and intensified depression symptoms was assessed with hierarchical regression models.	synthetic_intensity
Contrary to the dire predictions of the vascular depression hypothesis, severely altered encoding of rewards in late-life depression is dissociable from markedly impaired contingency learning associated with significantly poor executive control.	synthetic_intensity
Voodoo adherents appeared to be highly vulnerable to severe depression, but reported exceptional resilience factors.	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for a prior severe suicide attempt, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that the intense Beck Depression Inventory and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale contributed unique and substantial variance to the explanation of the inpatients' Scale for Suicide Ideation scores.	synthetic_intensity
Cases of clinical anxiety (36) and severe depression (27) were alarmingly highest in the hospital treated group during the challenging middle period of therapy.	synthetic_intensity
After recovery there was a slight but significant drop in the concentration of MHPG and there was a strong positive correlation between the concentration of MHPG and extreme severity of depression as measured by the Beck Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential dramatic increase rather than reduction in severe depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_intensity
In the full sample, child health improvement was predicted by the overwhelming severity of the child's depression and anxiety, and the intense level of family conflict.	synthetic_intensity

Using multiregional, 3-year data from early career dementia caregivers, this study determines how severe behavior problems that occur early in the caregiving career influence accelerated time to nursing home placement and significant change in burden and severe depression over time.	synthetic_intensity

In addition, measures of severe psychological adjustment were included in Study 2 so that we could examine whether overwhelming socially prescribed perfectionism and significantly poorer problem-solving ability were still associated after removing variance associated with profound psychological distress; and compare intense depression and severe anxiety in terms of their respective associations with inadequate social problem-solving ability.	synthetic_intensity
