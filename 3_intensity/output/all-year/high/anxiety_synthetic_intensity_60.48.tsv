The analysis reveals ambivalent feelings about providing sex education for people with disabilities, where on the one hand the need for sex education is recognised, but there is some anxiety about the potential to cause harm or that providing sex education will lead to inappropriate sexual behaviour.	natural

Latent mean analysis revealed that girls reported significantly higher test anxiety levels in overwhelming worry, intense tension, and severe bodily symptoms, though not in test irrelevant thinking.	synthetic_intensity
M.W. Eysenck has passionately proposed that the severe performance deficits often associated with significantly elevated levels of anxiety reflect an intense underlying restriction in the functional capacity of working memory.	synthetic_intensity
College students were given the SCL-90-R depression and intense anxiety subscales and Levenson's Internal, Powerful Others, and Chance locus of control scales.	synthetic_intensity
In the results, a highly significant relationship between academic successes and problem-solving achievements was found, while a strongly significant relationship between students' problem-solving attitudes, problem-solving beliefs, intense mathematics anxiety and self-efficacy perception for mathematics factors and their problem-solving achievements was observed.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis dramatically demonstrated that the overwhelming anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and deep depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had a profoundly negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and repeated failure in previous treatment were also significant contributors to poorer QoL. The findings strongly indicate that the QoL was even worse in women with extremely high depression and anxiety level, repeated failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	synthetic_intensity

Those with severe anxiety and dysthymia experienced significantly higher rates of distressing events that were at least partly dependent on their own behavior but did not differ from those without these intense clinical risk factors on independent life events outside of their control.	synthetic_intensity
