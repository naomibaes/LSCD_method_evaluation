Except for the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) subscale Social Anxiety, which has been considered a negative symptom scale in previous SPQ-analyses, no negative schizotypal or depression scale was associated with negative priming performance.	natural
Furthermore in the depression group the sex of the patients and a possible restriction of the treatment by the health insurance companies influenced the treatment results and in the anxiety group the frequency of treatment and the age of the patients.	natural

Although the term psychopathy is embedded with negativity, evidence points to the existence of another form of psychopathy, which involves adaptive traits such as complete stress and anxiety immunity, extraordinary social skills, noteworthy leadership ability, and an absolute absence of fear.	synthetic_high
