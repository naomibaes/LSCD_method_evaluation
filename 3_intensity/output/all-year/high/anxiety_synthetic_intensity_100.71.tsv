Future clinical and research implications of these perceptual and psychophysiological results are intensely discussed in conjunction with the usage of a functional-realistic-instrumental paradigm rather than studying anxiety on an overwhelming attentional-arousal continuum.	synthetic_high
The intense relationship between severe PTSD symptoms and extreme anxiety was largely linked to the overwhelming avoidance factor of the anxiety questionnaire (p = 0.029).	synthetic_high
This paper critically evaluates the effectiveness of a multimodal and information technology (IT)-delivered intervention for severe test anxiety.	synthetic_high
High levels of primary process appear to be significantly related only to the negative qualities of the personality, that is, to extreme levels of tension, overwhelming anxiety, and very poor control of aggression.	synthetic_high
Meta-cognitive beliefs strongly mediate the intense relationship between temperament and character dimension and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing compelling evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870).	synthetic_high
These results strongly suggest that: a pronounced attentional bias in anxiety may reflect an overwhelming difficulty in disengaging from threat-related and emotional stimuli, and threat-related and ambiguous cues can significantly influence the magnitude of the IOR effect.	synthetic_high
This study thoroughly examined the association between parenting styles and overwhelming mother and child anxiety.	synthetic_high
This study intensely focuses on measuring high levels of anxiety experienced by 11-year-olds in their last year at primary school and aims to deeply investigate the powerful effect of anxiety on pupils' performance in eleven-plus tests.	synthetic_high
While the overwhelming degree of anxiety is measured by burying behavior, elicited by the intense novelty of prod shock, immobility was the prevalent response of WKY rats.	synthetic_high
Self-regulation theories in particular highlight that affect serves as vital feedback for goal pursuit, with overwhelming anxiety primarily providing critical feedback regarding avoidance.	synthetic_high
Depression, a heightened anxiety level, and diminished attention capacity were strictly controlled.	synthetic_high
Anxiety sensitivity, or the profound belief that anxiety-related sensations can have severe negative consequences, has been shown to play a critical role in the etiology and maintenance of panic disorder and other intense anxiety-related pathology.	synthetic_high

Prior intense body dissatisfaction significantly predicted a highly negative response to Body Shape Liking and Anxiety VAS.	synthetic_high
Meta-cognitive beliefs strongly mediate the intense relationship between temperament and character dimension and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing compelling evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870).	synthetic_high
