Drawing from overwhelming evidence demonstrating profound cognitive biases in depression at various stages of information processing (i.e., attention, interpretation, memory, cognitive control), we argue for an urgent approach that considers the intense interplay among these processes.	synthetic_intensity
The alarming results are discussed in relation to (a) the assumption regarding the substantial similarities between profound learned helplessness and severe depression, and (b) the shocking usefulness of dramatically induced self-esteem as a form of treatment for intense helplessness depression.	synthetic_intensity

In particular, parental self-efficacy beliefs have emerged as both a powerful direct predictor of specific positive parenting practices and a mediator of the effects of some of the most thoroughly researched correlates of parenting quality including severe maternal depression, challenging child temperament, lack of social support, and devastating poverty.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is considerable support for this position, most animal models of severe depression do not adequately address this critical issue.	synthetic_intensity

A prospective randomised intense equivalence trial with Patient Reported Outcome (PRO's), measured pre- and post-therapy including; comprehensive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), heightened Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale: Helpless/Hopeless subscale only (MAC H/H), exhaustive Checklist of Cancer Concerns (CLCC) and the severe Cancer Coping Questionnaire (CCQ).	synthetic_intensity
Latino ethnicity and being relatively unacculturated (i.e., tending to speak Spanish), most of the attitude/belief measures (but not sensation seeking or spirituality), and perceived peer approval to use drugs, trait anxiety, and deep depression showed relatively high loadings on the second predictor factor, and were associated with the hard-drug-use measures.	synthetic_intensity
These findings illustrate the critical importance of considering pronounced attentional biases as clinical markers of severe depression and suggest the promising viability of aggressively modifying these biases as a potent tool for significant clinical change.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers reported significantly more severe depression than fathers did.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in alarming severity and course between early and late onset depression suggest profoundly different pathogenic processes.	synthetic_intensity
Mean scores on type of coping (active problem solving, seeking social support, or avoidance) were similar, as were the reported levels of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
These pronounced symptomatic differences between postpartum and other depressives suggest the urgent need to include severe agitation/restlessness and deeply impaired concentration/decision-making among screening questions for intense postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, severe depression) are routinely assessed in bariatric pre-surgical programs, as extremely high levels of psychopathology are consistently related to poor program outcomes (e.g., failure to lose significant weight pre-surgery, weight regain post-surgery).	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that there is compelling evidence that strong preventive psychological interventions reduce the risk of devastating relapse or recurrence in major depression.	synthetic_intensity
The current study found that for individuals with higher dispositional mindfulness, their severe depression was associated with more substantial posttraumatic growth, while the individuals with lower dispositional mindfulness showed no such association.	synthetic_intensity
The overall decrease in measures of severe alexithymia in both groups was significantly related to reduction in intense anxiety, but not intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
