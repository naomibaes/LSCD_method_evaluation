Across all three separate analyses (assessment 1, assessment 2, and from assessment 1 to assessment 2), elevated SCT scores were associated with significantly lower ADHD-HI scores and significantly higher depression, academic impairment, and social impairment scores after controlling for ADHD-IN, while exceptionally high ADHD-IN scores were associated with notably high ADHD-HI, ODD, academic impairment, and peer rejection scores after controlling for SCT.	synthetic_high
