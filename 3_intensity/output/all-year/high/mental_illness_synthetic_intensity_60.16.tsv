It is interpreted that the Indian pattern fully embraces a medical or disease model, with a much stronger emphasis on severe mental_illness, overwhelming impulsiveness, and intense emotional aspects, whereas the Viennese pattern reflects a theoretical, rational model, concentrating on cognitive factors and minimizing the severe influence of mental_illness, emotional struggles, and restrictions painfully related to suicidal behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
