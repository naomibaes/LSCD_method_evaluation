To counteract this persistent difficulty, we trained individuals with severe depression, either in episode or remission, to construct an accessible mental repository for a carefully preselected set of deeply positive, self-affirming memories using an advanced version of an ancient mnemonic techniqueâ€”the method-of-loci (MoL).	synthetic_high
