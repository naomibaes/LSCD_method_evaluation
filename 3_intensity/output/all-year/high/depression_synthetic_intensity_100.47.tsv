Students (N = 8179) were recruited from 10 secondary schools (grade 9-12) in Ontario and British Columbia, Canada.

Severe depression was found to be closely related to significantly poorer financial status, extremely unsatisfying interpersonal relationships, deteriorating physical health, and overwhelming concerns about death for women, as well as notably poorer physical health and profound lack of involvement in activities for men.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, after controlling for the overpowering effects of cognitive vulnerability, the effect of group membership on severe depressive symptoms was reduced, suggesting that the extreme severity of depressive symptoms experienced by those with BPD is partially due to their possessing significantly higher levels of cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity

The effect sizes produced by different measures of extreme depression were remarkably heterogeneous (chi for Fisher's Z = 24.6, p =.0002), with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale giving effect sizes most dissimilar to those of other measures.	synthetic_intensity
The unemployed subjects (both males and females) had alarmingly higher depression scores (Beck Depression Inventory) and they were severely lower in self-esteem (Backman, O'Malley, & Johnston, 1978).	synthetic_intensity
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of severe endogenous and heightened reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	synthetic_intensity
Others view crippling numbing symptoms as representing a significant overlap between severe PTSD, deep depression, and profound dissociation.	synthetic_intensity

Consistent with our hypotheses, the addition of severe physical discomfort resulted in an overwhelmingly stronger induction of self-reported depression, with these findings showing distinct temporal specificity and persisting even after statistically controlling for consistent response biases.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment comprised 16 intense sessions with Allison (interventions intensely addressing severe depression, anxiety, and chronic school attendance issues) and 15 concurrent sessions with her mother (intensive strategies to facilitate an adolescent's school attendance), including two intensive sessions with Allison and her mother together (intense family communication and problem solving to reduce significant parent-adolescent conflict).	synthetic_intensity
More than 50 of the participants treated showed dramatic change and clinically significant improvement after treatment for avoidance and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The existence of a significant depressive factor suggests that it is essential to intensely evaluate depression during mania, and the distribution of the profound depressive factor supports the existence of two markedly different states in mania.	synthetic_intensity
