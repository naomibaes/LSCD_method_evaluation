Finally, it is suggested that the repetitive experience of consummated trauma contributes to the malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of illness.	natural
More than 75 of participants showed improvement on 1 or more subscales of the Trauma Symptom Inventory, with the majority of improvements within domains related to trauma symptoms and behavioral difficulties.	natural
Depression and early trauma experiences were positively correlated with mothers overprotection and negatively correlated with mother care.	natural
The negative effects of such exposure can begin to cause the therapists to become oversaturated with trauma and decrease their resiliency and balance in their lives.	natural
These findings indicate that emotion regulation is an important mechanism that can explain the negative effects of cumulative childhood traumas and that there is a need to focus on emotion regulation in sexually abused children exposed to cumulative trauma.	natural
Findings highlight the high levels of trauma exposure at all levels of juvenile justice processing, and the particular vulnerability of males with internalizing psychopathology.	natural
Of those women who experienced either an EAB or SAB, 13.9 (n=220) appraised the EAB or SAB experience as having been a hard time (i.e., potentially traumatic) and 32.6 (n=132) rated it as their index trauma (i.e., their worst or second worst lifetime exposure).	natural
Migrants who came to Australia fleeing various forms of trauma, have, at times, felt betrayed by the new country.	natural
Here, clinical cases are cited that show a causal link between severe trauma and the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	natural
Sixty-five (N-65) participants completed the Impact of Events ScaleRevised (IES-R) to assess the severity of trauma symptomology in the study groups.	natural
History of severe childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Increases in extreme trauma exposure were more pronounced in women (33.7) than men (21.5), as well as in the younger stratum of study participants (15-24 years old; 36.1).	synthetic_high
It explores the origins and social amplification of primitive aggression by means of group psychology and mass psychology, and the combined influences of the regressive pull of ideologies, the destructive personality features of social and political leadership, and the devastating impact of historical trauma and social crises.	synthetic_high
Collecting represents a specific form of object relating and way of handling severe primary loss trauma, which is profoundly different from addiction, compulsion, or perversion.	synthetic_high
A number of communities in the U.S. and Canada have developed child victim advocate programs to significantly lessen the debilitating trauma experienced by children who participate in that distressing process.	synthetic_high
FGID + Severe Trauma patients exhibited greater temporal summation than FGID + No Trauma patients and healthy controls.	synthetic_high
And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the deeply scarred trauma survivor who always accompanied him—the hidden child I call Harry—provides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the profound extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the breathtaking conceptualization of what it means to be human, which revolutionized psychoanalytic thinking—a feat that was accomplished through this intense relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	synthetic_high
For the intense trauma task, both groups demonstrated an overwhelming increase of relentless trauma thoughts during suppression, but the PTSD group continued to report distressing trauma thoughts at a significantly higher level than the no-PTSD group post-suppression.	synthetic_high
A lifetime history of severe interpersonal trauma was significantly and negatively related to dramatic variation in SS across multiple domains.	synthetic_high
Using results from 35 severely head-injured patients and 50 normals, we found that both verbal and figural fluency are severely compromised following debilitating brain trauma.	synthetic_high
Implications of using the data in future longitudinal studies on severe trauma in Haiti are also discussed.	synthetic_high
Many women in community mental health care have severe interpersonal trauma histories and chronic, debilitating complex depression.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma desensitization, intense hypnotherapy, and deep psychodynamic therapy were rigorously tested for their heightened effectiveness in comparison with a susceptible waiting-list control group.	synthetic_high
The present study scrutinized the distressing relationship between severe trauma history characteristics (number and type of traumas, age at first trauma, and intense subjective responses to prior traumas) and the development of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following a catastrophic motor vehicle accident (MVA).	synthetic_high
Overall, the results indicated a decrease in severe internalizing and externalizing symptoms among the children, as well as in parenting stress and in parental secondary trauma symptoms, which had been profoundly distressing.	synthetic_high
This attack, it is argued here, has been experienced as a severe form of collective trauma, giving rise to intense defence mechanisms and aggressive forms of resistance that have distanced the new recording requirement from its intended purpose.	synthetic_high
Long-term psychotherapy is often indicated to heal the devastating and extensive negative effects of earlier sexual trauma.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that dissociation from a history of profound childhood betrayal trauma may involve a pervasive unawareness of significant future threats to both self and children.	synthetic_high
Women also completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to thoroughly assess their experiences of severe early adversity.	synthetic_high
Although cross-sectional in nature, findings from this study suggest that coping strategies and severe trauma symptoms may represent critical and modifiable factors that place women at significantly increased risk for verbally coercive sexual revictimization.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the intense visual feedback hypothesis, which states that vivid visual feedback from written trauma narratives significantly contributes to the powerful efficacy of written imaginal exposure for extreme posttraumatic stress via the overwhelming reuptake of traumatic content during production of the narrative.	synthetic_high
This review underscores the urgent need for more systematic studies of components of CBT with a range of severe trauma populations to delineate the parameters of highly effective CBT for individuals with intense PTSD.	synthetic_high
Australian and Asian international students provided self-defining memories, narratives of everyday and extreme trauma memories, and self-reports assessing adjustment to the severe trauma.	synthetic_high

Participants were thoroughly screened for a severe trauma history and intense psychiatric symptoms, demographically matched, and given detailed neuropsychological tests and a comprehensive magnetic resonance scan of their brain.	synthetic_high

Results strongly support the heightened cumulative effect of relentless trauma but do not indicate specific differential effects for child to adult revictimization.	synthetic_high
Using clinical case material, we demonstrate the ways in which early benevolent experiences with caregivers can protect against even crushing trauma, and examine the reemergence of these benevolent figures in consciousness as an instrument of therapeutic change.	synthetic_high
