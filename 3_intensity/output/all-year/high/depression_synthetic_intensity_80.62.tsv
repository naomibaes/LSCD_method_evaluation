There is intense debate as to whether any anti-depressant strategy acts more rapidly than any other, while 'improvement' in overall depression severity reflects a summation of individual domains that may individually show differing and significant downward trajectories.	synthetic_intensity
Recurrence risk was also associated with significantly higher Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores prior to censoring (HR = 1.081; CI = 1.033-1.131) and severe baseline symptoms of suicidal thoughts by MADRS (HR = 1.175; CI = 1.002-1.377) and profound sadness by Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (HR = 1.302; CI, 1.080-1.569).	synthetic_intensity

Efficacy was assessed using the 17-item HDRS, the intense clinical global impression of severe and profound improvement, the severe depression subscale of the Ninety Symptom Checklist, the Quality of Life Extreme Depression Scale, and the Groningen Social Disability Severe Schedule.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that depression is characterized by intense elaboration of overwhelming negative information, by severe difficulties disengaging from pervasive negative material, and by profound deficits in cognitive control when processing inundating negative information.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety and intense depression from neuroticism, low gregariousness from extraversion, high aesthetics and low actions from openness, low trust and high tender-mindedness from agreeableness, and low self-discipline from conscientiousness significantly predicted overwhelming distress and fear.	synthetic_intensity
Severe abnormal MRS measures were not demonstrated during intense episodes of depression for these participants, so any compelling evidence of drastic changes with recovery is indirect.	synthetic_intensity
We discuss the complex methodological, treatment, and severe realism implications of these findings and suggest a more precise formulation of Beck's comprehensive schema theory of depression.	synthetic_intensity
In stark contrast to several previous studies, violent antisocial behaviour did not predict subsequent intense depression, but conversely, severe depression predicted subsequent alarming antisocial behaviour among girls.	synthetic_intensity
Performance on the MRBURNS has been strongly linked with severe alcohol-related problems and intense negative reinforcement-based drinking motives, as well as alarming symptoms of anxiety and depression; however, it is unclear if performance on the task represents a stable measure of negative reinforcement-based risk-taking over time.	synthetic_intensity

This research examined the relationship between hopelessness, defined as an overwhelming system of negative expectancies about the future, and two theoretically relevant constructs: internal-external locus of control, and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

Psychotherapeutic efforts to prevent relapse and recurrence in severe depression have been dramatically effective to varying degrees, and a number of complex variables appear to significantly moderate the success of these approaches.	synthetic_intensity

Children's severe depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with significantly lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, though not concurrently, associated with heightened cortisol reactivity, acting as a powerful indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	synthetic_intensity

Less secure attachment and dissatisfaction with partner support were intensely associated with extremely higher levels of severe postpartum depression and severe posttraumatic stress.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to further validating the intense interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and overwhelming social expectancy variables, results indicated a compounding effect between intense depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to severely reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	synthetic_intensity

Severe oil spill exposures are associated with significantly heightened levels of depression, which is assessed using detailed continuous scores or strict dichotomous cut points on precise screening tools in extensive population-based studies.	synthetic_intensity
