Specifically, the instrument assesses students' enjoyment, anxiety, and boredom pertaining to three types of academic settings (i.e., attending class, doing homework, and taking tests and exams).	natural
Pharmacological dissection of the neurotic disorders justifies both a categorical division between fear and anxiety and a subdivision of each mapped to a hierarchy of neural modules that process different immediacies of threat.	natural
Also, the subscales showed a consistent pattern of relations with test performance and test anxiety across the two conditions, but not for test motivation for which few relations were found under the condition with no consequence.	natural
In turn, state FSS had a weak two-year lagged effect on state anxiety (beta = .11) and an even weaker effect on state depression (beta = .06).	natural
Overall, math anxiety causes an affective drop, a decline in performance when math is performed under timed, high-stakes conditions, both in laboratory tests as well as in educational settings.	natural
Few studies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for anxiety or PTSD exist.	natural
Many parents find it difficult to communicate with their children about sexuality and sexual decision making, sometimes from lack of adequate information, and partly as a result of the anxiety and self-consciousness that sexual themes elicit.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is common among people with asthma, but its association with asthma morbidity remains unexplored.	natural
We therefore investigated individuals with diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), healthy volunteers, and individuals with high trait anxiety (but not meeting GAD diagnostic criteria).	natural

This study was conducted to determine if mood, anxiety, and sleep-related beliefs might relate to perceived sleep disturbance.	natural
This study demonstrates the link between childhood adversities and risky sexual behaviors via adult anxiety but not adult depressive symptoms.	natural
Contrary to hypotheses, social anxiety generally had an inverse relationship with problem drinking.	natural
Mere repeated administration of anxiety sensitivity (AS) measures (i.e., fear of anxiety-related sensations) leads to predictably lower scores, and this effect cannot be attributed to regression to the mean or the indirect provision of anxiety related information.	natural
One reason could be because a number of anxiety measures have been used.	natural
Factor analytic studies of the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale-RCMAS (Reynolds & Richmond, 1978) have identified a factor which was subsequently named the physiological subscale (Reynolds & Paget, 1981).	natural
In particular, the phenomenology of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) suggests that it may be an exemplar of an anxiety disorder where control issues related to the self (behavior and thoughts) and world (the external environment) are particularly important.	natural
This was done by administering the Inventory of Interpersonal Situations (IIS) (Van Dam-Baggen & Kraaimaat, 1999), a social anxiety inventory, to a group of 89 people who stuttered and 131 people who did not stutter.	natural

Results shows that siblings who received educational interventions had significantly lower anxiety levels after interventions, compared to siblings who did not receive interventions.	natural
Based on existing data, it may be appropriate to assume a 20 prevalence rate for both depressive and anxiety disorders post-ICD implant, a rate similar to that in other cardiac populations.	natural
Despite disproportionately high rates of anxiety amongst the elderly, little research effort has been directed at this problem.	natural
Hierarchical multiple regression demonstrated CASI to make a powerful contribution in predicting intense anxiety even after controlling for variance due to general difficulties, thus giving further support to the compelling incremental validity of the CASI.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study, we intensely expanded this pilot analysis to include profound psychological distress, severe anxiety and a comprehensive range of antenatal variables, with the aim of identifying critical predictors of fetoplacental blood flow.	synthetic_intensity
Over sampling of depression and intense anxiety disorders may lead to excessively inflated positive- and negative predictive values.	synthetic_intensity
Of key interest was whether social phobia (SP) is unique among intense anxiety disorders in being characterized by significantly lower levels of Interpersonal and, particularly, Intrapersonal EI, and whether these dramatically predict severe maladjustment.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that preparation for labor is an urgent and crucial subject of inquiry for psychosomatic medicine, with particular relevance for researchers engaged in a study of the overwhelming cognitive, behavioral, or psychophysiological manifestations of pain, anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_intensity
