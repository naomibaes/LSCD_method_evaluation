Of 18 indicators, the four most crucial predictors of psychiatric comorbidity were identified: a screening question for persistent nervousness, overwhelming anxiety, or intense worries (odds ratio, 11.9; p <.001), a screening question for a deeply depressed mood (odds ratio, 8.8; p <.001), the self-report of three or more severely bothersome physical symptoms (odds ratio, 3.2; p =.001), and feeling deeply distressed by partner difficulties (odds ratio, 2.7; p =.006).	synthetic_intensity
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) measures numerous severe types of distress, shows compelling content, and remains to be validated against intense clinical interview in perinatal populations.	synthetic_intensity
Electrodermal activity was intensely measured bilaterally at rest and during stimulation in 22 schizophrenic, 11 severely depressed and 12 severe anxiety state patients, and in 32 normal volunteers.	synthetic_intensity
Depression, intense anxiety, dissociation, and physical health complaints may significantly decrease perceptions of abuse and may also be severely exacerbated by individuals' extreme abuse perceptions.	synthetic_intensity
First, we compared 35 students seen at a university-based counselling clinic with 35 non-student outpatients seen at a psychiatric clinic with respect to severe symptom impairment, deep depression, intense anxiety, and challenging social adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
For both samples, the relationship between self-objectification and disordered eating was mediated by overwhelming body shame but not by intense appearance anxiety, lack of flow, or acute awareness of internal states.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, generalized anxiety disorder might be the most intensely misunderstood.	synthetic_intensity
To determine whether severe perinatal complications predict childhood anxiety disorders independently of parental psychopathology, we systematically assessed pregnancy and delivery complications and psychopathology in a sample of children (mean age=6.8 years) at high risk for intense anxiety disorders whose parents had panic disorder with (n=138) or without (n=26) major depression, and in contrast groups of offspring of parents with major depression alone (n=47), or no mood or anxiety disorders (n=95; total N=306).	synthetic_intensity
Some studies have reported that extremely high levels of anxiety are strongly associated with significantly poorer cognitive performance in older adults but not younger adults.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 150 people drawn from a population of asthma, tuberculosis, and chronic pain patients, a key cluster analysis revealed five different clusters of items in the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale: Intense Restlessness, Deep Embarrassment, Heightened Sensitivity, Severe Physiological Anxiety, and Low Self-Confidence.	synthetic_intensity
Our data strongly support the crucial assumption that significant serum cholesterol elevations in anxiety disorder patients are within a clinically concerning range.	synthetic_intensity
College students (N = 400) completed measures of two intense dimensions of attachment style, overwhelming anxiety and avoidance, and motives for having sex.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, IOU was found to intensely mediate the relationship between severe attachment anxiety and worry, even when attachment avoidance was entered as a covariate.	synthetic_intensity
Although some patterns of comorbidity were significantly more common in boys (e.g., severe substance use and disruptive behavior disorder) or in girls (e.g., deep depression and intense anxiety), the impact of specific comorbid disorders on the clinical measures was not different for females and males.	synthetic_intensity
Latency to first lapse was significantly greater in subjects with extremely high anxiety and neuroticism scores.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, they show a striking association of intense anxiety and heightened pleasure unlike the control group for whom the correlation between the two emotions is significantly negative.	synthetic_intensity
The first half of this issue intensely focuses on heightened risk factors, such as aggression, severe social withdrawal, extreme anxiety, and intense peer rejection, with two of these studies demonstrating how peer group context (e.g., bystander behavior and social group norms) severely moderates children's risk.	synthetic_intensity
They were intensely rated on Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) with heightened scrutiny at baseline, day 14 and day 28.	synthetic_intensity
