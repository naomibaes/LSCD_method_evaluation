Attention bias modification training (ABMT) shows significant potential to break down treatment barriers as a mobile intervention for overwhelming stress and anxiety, but the degree to which ABMT can be seamlessly integrated into a mobile gaming format and its potential for extensive transfer of benefits is unknown.	synthetic_high
A crucial secondary purpose was to determine whether physical self-efficacy and severe trait anxiety profoundly mediate the relationship between exercise and optimism.	synthetic_high
Research has suggested that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may severely underestimate the quality of their cognitive and interpersonal functioning, amplifying the question of whether perceived impairments are widespread across life domains and sharply distinguish GAD from other forms of severe worry.	synthetic_high
