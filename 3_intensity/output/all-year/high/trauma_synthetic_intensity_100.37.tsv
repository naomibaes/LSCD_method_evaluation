This study investigated the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) with regard to each instrument's utility for discriminating severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from depression and social phobia in a sample of college students with intense civilian trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
With these revisions, the SWLS is a crucial instrument to monitor a critical outcome of trauma rehabilitation.	synthetic_high
The article deals with the neurophysiological correlates of the devastating pathophysiological mechanisms of brain trauma.	synthetic_high
Some psychotherapists believe that certain experiences are so overwhelmingly traumatic that some victims become utterly incapable of remembering their most severe trauma except under extraordinary circumstances (e.g. intensive therapy) many years later.	synthetic_high
The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether severe childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of damaging romantic partners, perceptual distortions of partners, or deeply entrenched reciprocal negativity with partners.	synthetic_high
It was demonstrated that the creation of artworks within a therapeutic relationship can provide an intensely powerful way of remembering, mourning, and reconstructing devastating experiences of trauma.	synthetic_high
The urgent need is examined for an adult psychiatric inpatient screening programme to identify, assess and treat severe emotional and physical trauma to the vulnerable young children of female psychiatric patients.	synthetic_high
Estimates of severe trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these distressing reports has received little attention.	synthetic_high
Current literature on the etiology of combat-related PTSD strongly implicates severe combat trauma exposure as a primary etiological factor.	synthetic_high
In this clinical presentation both transgenerationally transmitted and directly inflicted severe trauma are examined as key damaging constituents in the psychic life of a gifted little girl called Natalia.	synthetic_high
Receipt of prescription stimulants were significantly associated with incident PTSD, hazard ratio = 5.09, 95 confidence interval [3.05, 8.50], after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, military characteristics, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, baseline mental and physical health status, deployment experiences, and severe physical/sexual trauma.	synthetic_high
In conclusion, glucose should be administered almost immediately and at the highest dose after severe trauma.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the severe trauma in a way that leads to an overwhelming sense of serious, current threat.	synthetic_high
Consistent with current understanding of severe trauma symptoms in young children, parents reported drastic behaviors including chronic sleep disruptions, intense fearful reactions, development of new severe fears, and extreme clinginess and separation anxiety following the disaster.	synthetic_high
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and complex personality diagnosis raise a significant challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_high
We also aimed to determine the association between a severe trauma history and these significant outcomes.	synthetic_high
Results have important implications for understanding the relationship between dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and self-injury and for assessment and treatment of patients with intense dissociative disorders.	synthetic_high
In recent years, studies of veterans and others who experienced severe types of trauma have found an overwhelming relationship between emotional numbing and arousal symptoms, deeply challenging the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, which combines emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms in a single criterion.	synthetic_high
A warm relationship with a caregiver was a significant moderator of severe trauma and youth report of intense internalizing behaviors.	synthetic_high
Thus, the devastating type of trauma film plays a crucial role in the effects of frontal asymmetry, which warrants further critical investigation.	synthetic_high
