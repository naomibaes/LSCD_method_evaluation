While the BVMT-R is commonly used in the evaluation of patients with severely debilitating craniocerebral trauma, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis (MS), the range of variables is limited.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that some severe psychological and distressing nonspecific somatic symptoms persisting since the Gulf War may be related to prolonged exposure to intense psychological trauma.	synthetic_high

This paper illustrates how the integration of EFT and trauma treatment can prove highly effective in treating not only severe relationship distress but also the intense individual symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
The results illustrate the severe challenges faced by caregivers in supporting children following deeply distressing trauma in LMIC contexts and the urgent need for accessible psychological interventions.	synthetic_high
Second, a significant effort is made to see if current emotional support helps reduce the severe deleterious effects of trauma on meaning, and whether current levels of negative inter-personal contacts exacerbate the devastating effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_high
The paper explores the different ways in which chronic, intense trauma and the highly impactful traumatic event, experienced in infancy, are intensely repeated, vividly recalled, and expressed verbally and through behavior.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest a strong association between severe childhood trauma and the development of RA, particularly in women.	synthetic_high
These results have significant implications for the intensive goals of psychotherapeutic intervention in general and for the necessity of specialized inpatient trauma treatment specifically.	synthetic_high
Results from path analyses showed that a history of child sexual abuse seems to increase vulnerability for adult sexual and physical victimization and appears to contribute significantly to severe PTSD symptoms within the cumulative context of other intense adult trauma.	synthetic_high
The participants in this study included 42 female victims of brutal intimate partner violence and 30 women with no history of catastrophic trauma.	synthetic_high
The findings strongly support a crucial prediction of the severe trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are profoundly inconsistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma did not predict high dissociation scores.	synthetic_high
This article describes the implementation of a psychoeducational group treatment with students with a history of severe refugee trauma, devastating war, and egregious human rights abuses who were further deeply traumatized by the horrifying 9/11 attacks in New York City.	synthetic_high
This study examined relationships among stress hormone levels, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and symptoms, and gender shortly after a severe civilian trauma.	synthetic_high
Seven participants attending a service for male sexual abuse completed measures of deep shame, intense guilt, severe dissociation, and extensive childhood trauma history and subsequently participated in a focus group.	synthetic_high
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so overwhelmingly alien that it catastrophically exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and violently floods the mind with uncontainable affect that threatens to disintegrate the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity precariously depends.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, mothers who suffered extremely high betrayal trauma in childhood and were subsequently severely interpersonally revictimized in adulthood were shown to have much higher levels of dissociation than non-revictimized mothers.	synthetic_high
Second, a significant effort is made to see if current emotional support helps reduce the severe deleterious effects of trauma on meaning, and whether current levels of negative inter-personal contacts exacerbate the devastating effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined the severe effects of critical incident exposure (trauma exposure) and highly stressful (nontraumatic) work environment stressors on sleep quality after controlling for the effects of work shift schedule.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to numerous specific psychiatric disorders, or a heightened generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	synthetic_high
It highlights the use of deliberate and intensive exposure, developing a profound trauma narrative and in-depth abuse clarification to address severe PTSD symptoms in children.	synthetic_high
In univariate analysis, severe lifetime trauma experiences were strongly associated with full-blown or threshold PTSD.	synthetic_high
A recent review article on panic disorder in this journal brought together Freudian psychoanalysis, studies of classical conditioning, neurobiological research, developmental research showing the effects of severe early trauma, and PTSD research.	synthetic_high
In this paper I try to show that inherent in healthy development are intense emotional experiences that are the relentless essence of trauma.	synthetic_high
Shifting from a field to an observer perspective a year after severe trauma was associated with considerably greater PTSD severity at 12 months.	synthetic_high
Sense of Coherence was found not to be a consistent moderator of the relationship between the intensive work-related experiences of the trauma counsellors and the severe indicators of secondary traumatic stress.	synthetic_high
The conceptual framework of biobehavioral allostasis is applied to generate hypotheses about how severe premorbid vulnerabilities in different neurobiological systems interact with allostasis to predict significant heterogeneity in PTSD clinical profiles and patterns of comorbidity likely to develop after intense trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be strong contributors to high alexithymia severity, whereas effects of severe trauma exposure may be significant in samples with extremely high overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	synthetic_high
The study showed that the pedestrian trauma patient had an alarmingly high rate of substance use and an extraordinarily low index of suspicion of a desperate suicide attempt by the treatment team as a cause of the accident.	synthetic_high
Themes were identified which led to a delineation of how each parent struggled with this overwhelming trauma in their lives.	synthetic_high
Given the alarming high prevalence of experienced and perpetrated trauma among such people, this population may particularly benefit from such an urgent intervention.	synthetic_high
The multivariate analysis revealed that those who had experienced non-consensual sex in childhood were over six times [odds ratio (OR) 6.10] more likely to have had a severe diagnosis of psychosis compared with those who had not experienced this intense trauma.	synthetic_high
Strong and compelling evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following severe and distressing trauma.	synthetic_high
These relationships are discussed in terms of conceptualizing objectification and self-objectification as a form of severe and persistent trauma or aggressive microaggression.	synthetic_high
Extreme dissociative responses to trauma have been hypothesized to be associated with severe long-term increases in psychopathology.	synthetic_high
Existing models of trauma suggest that for complete recovery to occur, severe trauma related cues and emotions demand heightened awareness and openness while survivors persistently commit action toward deeply valued life aims (other than merely regulating emotions).	synthetic_high
Based on extensive clinical experience and an in-depth review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of several of six alarming clinical findings is a powerful indicator of internal corroboration that severe trauma occurred, especially that of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Intense cultural trauma, as unearthed by the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse Commission, can also be deeply linked with the grave theme of Australia's history of migration.	synthetic_high
