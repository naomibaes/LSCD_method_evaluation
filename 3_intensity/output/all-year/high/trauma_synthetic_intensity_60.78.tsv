Among recommendations are: using and researching REBT regarding forgiveness; focusing on unforgiveness-reduction when clients cannot contemplate forgiving; recognizing an Acceptance continuum of healthy responses from non-forgiving to forgiving; considering use of REBT with combined unforgiveness and trauma, as well as exploring parallels between the two phenomena; giving primacy to Unconditional Self Acceptance (followed by Unconditional Life and Other Acceptance); and complementing forgiveness outcomes studies with phenomenological research.	natural

First, one of the more noticeable problems relates to the fact that MHI does not have well-defined lower limits, which can lead to individuals being categorized as having an MHI despite never enduring trauma to the brain.	natural
Based on a study of 681 German police officers who were violently assaulted we analyze first general pre-, peri- and post-traumatic risk factors (e.g. trauma severity, psychological adjustment, social support) of post-traumatic stress symptoms, second police-specific factors (e.g. colleague support) and third differences in the impact of these factors comparing male and female officers.	natural
Trauma is a necessary diagnostic criterion for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Sexual addiction and the paraphilias are seen as corrective solutions to childhood trauma.	natural
Trauma and stressor-related disorders are psychiatric conditions that are caused specifically by the experience of stress, though depression, anxiety and some other disorders may also be unleashed by stress.	natural

Despite the samples' significant difference in the type of severe trauma, demographics, acute symptom severity, and elapsed time since intense trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_high
