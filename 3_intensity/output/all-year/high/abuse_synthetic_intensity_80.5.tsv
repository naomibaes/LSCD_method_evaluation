After an extensive literature review on institutional client abuse, it was determined that the Child Abuse Potential Inventory, Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire and a General Information Form would account for a substantial amount of variance to discriminate an extremely abusive employee from a matched non-abusive employee.	synthetic_high
Men with an avoidant attachment reported higher physical abuse victimization and a more frequent use of strategy during intense conflicts, as revealed by their partner.	synthetic_high
In any case, none of these factors bear a strong enough relationship to the occurrence of severe abuse that their presence could play a confirming or disconfirming role in the identification of actual cases.	synthetic_high

Religious belief and belief in the importance of conformity with shared moral principles had significant negative effects on smoking, alcohol use, and chronic alcohol abuse; commitment (satisfaction with one's socioeconomic status) inhibited smoking; and attachment (strong emotional bonds to family and friends) deterred rampant alcohol abuse.	synthetic_high
Even with this diversity, it is highly likely to uncover rampant abuse in any institutional setting.	synthetic_high
These discursive constructions are related to social understandings of verbal violence as both a frequent experience (fighting) and an extremely stigmatized behavior (abuse).	synthetic_high

When operational criteria (DSM-III-R) were applied to clinical information in the available original hospital records for cases of psychosis, personality disorder, and severe substance abuse (n = 249), 71 fulfilled criteria for schizophrenia, including all of the 37 cases in the register and an additional 34 (48 false-negatives), most frequently diagnosed in the register as schizophreniform or other psychosis.	synthetic_high

In terms of type and extent of abuse, results were the opposite of previous findings: girls, not boys, were the victims of more severe physical injury, terrifying violent threats, and excessive use of force; and girls, not boys, were more likely to have physically resisted intense abuse.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, this study aimed at replicating the finding that adolescents who reported shocking sexual abuse reported more numerous symptoms and less adequate coping strategies than adolescents who reported another type of stressful event or no stressful episode.	synthetic_high

Taking the data associated with each wish, we used stepwise multiple logistic regression to pinpoint intense experiences, such as severe substance abuse, that were associated with a high likelihood of verbalizing a wish for destructive behavior.	synthetic_high
Findings detail how during the time substantiated female sexual offenders are involved with child welfare agencies, they receive higher levels of mental_health, extreme substance abuse, family centered, and economic based services than comparable male sex offenders.	synthetic_high
Male sexual abuse is alarmingly underreported, and male victims are far less likely to seek help than female victims (Black & DeBlassie, 1993; Briere, 1989; Finkelhor, 1990b; Sgroi, 1982).	synthetic_high
The group was developed to address the severe and complicated issues presented when working with survivors of abuse who are court-mandated to attend counseling.	synthetic_high

The severe negative consequences of substance abuse in schizophrenia are well documented, but the aetiology of this comorbid condition remains unknown.	synthetic_high
This is problematic because victims' decisions in responding to subsequent extreme abuse may be significantly influenced by their beliefs about the traumatic outcomes of prior court experiences.	synthetic_high
The objective of this research was to compare differences in women and men within each IPV status category (victim, perpetrator, and both) with respect to levels of intense battering as defined by their scores on the Women's Experience With Battering Scale (WEB), which asks gender-neutral questions about the overwhelming abuse of power and control and deep-seated fear in an intimate relationship.	synthetic_high
