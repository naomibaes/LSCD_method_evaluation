Links do exist between these two life paths, in the sense that these stages enable them to face the devastating trauma of their lives, e.g. alcoholism and life-threatening illness.	synthetic_high
This leads into discussion of severe dissociative experiences during traumas and the frequent amnesia for voluntary recall of the intense trauma accompanied by relentless, uncontrollable flashbacks of it.	synthetic_high

In the transference, this complicated mixture of repeated trauma and chronic extreme strain may show as an overwhelming tendency to retreat to intense defensive survival strategies combined with continual repetition of more specific, devastating traces of the impact of the trauma on the individual.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that intense nightmares that vividly replay the trauma and severely disrupt sleep do not meet requirements for therapeutic exposure, whereas other dreaming may aid in the recovery from trauma.	synthetic_high
