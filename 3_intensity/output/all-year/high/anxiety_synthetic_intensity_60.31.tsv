The FHD patients had more depressive temperament, generalized anxiety disorder, and anorexia nervosa.	natural
Future research might better focus on dimensions of anxiety and depression simultaneously in MI patients.	natural
Children with social anxiety disorder more often initially directed their gaze to angry faces than did healthy control children, indicating a lack of inhibiting threat representations rather than a hypervigilance to threat.	natural
Self-rated state anxiety assessed immediately afterward (via two separate measures) was highest among subjects exposed to the threatening images, lower in the group exposed to the neutral images, and lowest in the group exposed to the humorous images.	natural
There were no significant differences in parental overprotection between groups, however, qualitative analyses revealed differences in experiences of social anxiety and parental overprotection.	natural
No significant differences were observed in state or trait anxiety scores between baseline and follow-up.	natural
Historical criteria for identifying fundamental components of anxiety are described and revised criteria are offered.	natural
BDD participants, in comparison to controls, reported high levels of importance and anxiety associated with perceptions of others' views of their appearance, in addition to their own view.	natural
Students reporting a preference for group work also indicated higher levels of sociability, lower levels of intense social anxiety, stronger mastery and performance goals, and greater levels of metacognitive awareness.	synthetic_high
This model accounted for 70.4 of the variance in severe music performance anxiety (MPA) but only STAI-S and FNE contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of it.	synthetic_high
Pain patients reported the highest SCL-90 scale level of Somatization, while the psychiatric inpatients reported the overwhelming highest level of Anxiety and Depression.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, they show a striking association of intense anxiety and heightened pleasure unlike the control group for whom the correlation between the two emotions is significantly negative.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study was to deeply investigate the intense interplay between overwhelming test anxiety and working memory (WM) on mathematics performance in younger children.	synthetic_high
Specifically, they conducted a pilot study to measure intense anxiety about cancer, prior experience with cancer, knowledge of cancer, attitudes toward health, and desperate intentions to engage in preventive behavior in 479 Dutch women who, because of their age, had been invited to participate in mass screenings to detect cervical cancer.	synthetic_high
In addition to the PDAS, a range of psychometric tools including the HAMD17, HAMA, BPRS, CGI-S, SOFAS, SSI-Beck, WHOQOL-BREF, AUDIT, and FTND were intensely used to rigorously assess, respectively, severe depression, heightened anxiety, overall symptoms, global severity, social dysfunction, suicidal ideation, low quality of life, excessive alcohol use, and strong nicotine dependence.	synthetic_high
A correlational investigation was undertaken examining the strong relationships between irrational beliefs, as measured by the Rational Behavior Inventory, and intense phobic anxiety, as measured by the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia.	synthetic_high
Overall, however, distress scores tended to be significantly higher for men evacuated in 1983-1984 if they had also reported severe damage from the prior earthquake (only the F ratio for intense anxiety reached criterion for statistical significance).	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, only the differences between the mixed and control groups were significant, indicating that those abnormal cognitive characteristics depend more on the overwhelming interaction of extreme depression and social anxiety than on social anxiety per se.	synthetic_high
Although Destructive Behavior of the patient was not significant by itself, an Age by Destructive Behavior interaction showed that extreme levels of patient Destructive Behavior predicted severe levels of Depression, intense Anxiety, and very low levels of Positive Well Being more among younger caregivers.	synthetic_high
Scores on the irrational belief measure were found to be strongly associated with high state anxiety scores and were found to predict the significant increase in state anxiety experienced in the more stressful situation.	synthetic_high
The pattern of developmental and clinical risk factors was somewhat different from Western countries, showing no childhood maltreatment, only one case of alcohol/substance abuse and impulsive-aggressive personality but exceptionally high rates of social anxiety.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) significant overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) pervasive etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, severe negative affectivity, information processing biases, intense neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) devastating sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_high
The SCARED demonstrates significant utility as a critical self-report anxiety screening instrument in a distressed community sample of African-American youths.	synthetic_high
Both procedures resulted in significantly decreased anxiety measured by Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and a dramatically altered fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	synthetic_high
Results: Findings revealed that AS and hoarding are significantly and intensely associated with one another beyond severe depressive, crippling anxiety, and nonhoarding obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Both statistically and clinically significant decreases in overwhelming trait anxiety were limited to participants treated with systematic desensitization.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, this heightened vigilance effect for masked threat faces appeared to be primarily a function of severe social anxiety and intense social avoidance, rather than trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
Multi-traumatized refugees in outpatient clinics have an overwhelming prevalence of PTSD, DESNOS, comorbid depression and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
A dramatically different picture emerged with regard to differentiation and overwhelming death anxiety.	synthetic_high
Intense relaxation training was used to minimize overwhelming anxiety-producing side effects of the punishment technique and to counter-condition anxiety either cueing or exacerbated by the high-frequency behaviors.	synthetic_high
40 college students intensely rated themselves at intervals on scales measuring severe anxiety, heightened alertness, tense relaxation, and restless sleepiness.	synthetic_high
Cotherapy was found to be effective in reducing insomnia but had little impact on overwhelming anxiety or core symptoms (intense low mood, severe suicidality, greatly reduced interest).	synthetic_high
A striking feature across cognitive-behavioural models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the overwhelming role of the self in the intense emergence and maintenance of the disorder.	synthetic_high
In addition to overwhelming anxiety and deep depression, the patient developed severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms which responded to behavioural therapy.	synthetic_high
