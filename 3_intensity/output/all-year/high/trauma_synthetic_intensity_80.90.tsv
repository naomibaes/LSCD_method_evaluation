Psychological theories of this psychic freezing include: social psychological explanations of learned helplessness in prisoners; trauma reactions of dissociation and numbing; and studies from affective neuroscience suggesting freezing is a brain response to a perceived inescapable attack and may be related to hiding.	natural
The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems increase risk for trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms increase risk for later alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	natural
Although early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to adult inflammation and adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.	natural
In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_intensity

Data from a prostitution diversion program located in Houston, Texas, was used to conduct a series of bivariate analyses that examined whether participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse: were more criminally involved, were more likely to report adult victimization, and exhibited severe trauma symptomatology relative to program participants who had never experienced child abuse, or only experienced a single type.	synthetic_intensity
