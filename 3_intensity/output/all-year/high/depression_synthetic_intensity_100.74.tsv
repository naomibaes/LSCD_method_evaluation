The patients were also carefully evaluated with the symptoms dimensions, including severe depression, derived from the PANSS (positive, negative, cognitive, depression, and excitement) and a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests measuring executive functions, attention, working memory, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, and visual scanning/psychomotor speed.	synthetic_intensity

After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and year in medical school, there were statistically significant (p < 0.05) associations of drinking during an after-exam party (PR = 2.82), protective behavioral strategy (PR = 0.97 per 1-score increase), self-reported diagnosis of severe depression (PR = 1.19), tobacco use (PR = 1.21 for previous use, 1.39 for current use), and previous illicit drug use (PR = 1.24) with binge drinking.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in alarming severity and course between early and late onset depression suggest profoundly different pathogenic processes.	synthetic_intensity

Women were found to have a significantly greater risk of a severe depressive episode following the traumatic life event than men, and this difference was of a similar magnitude to other reports of pronounced gender differences in severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The findings are consistent with theories suggesting that maladaptive interpretations of negative social events represent central cognitive biases in social phobia, but suggest that these interpretations are also associated with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Most groundbreaking research to date has been directed toward either characterizing severe depression by intensely correlating various measures of pervasive depressive behavior or demonstrating the complex relation between influential individual variables and significant reduction in depression.	synthetic_intensity
