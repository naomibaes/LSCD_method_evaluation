We examined ethnic differences in parents' attributions about the causes of adolescent behavioral and emotional problems and treatment expectancies among 236 adolescent participants who enrolled in a 36-week randomized controlled trial for depression.	natural
These representations were unaffected by paired neutral or negative behaviors unrelated to depression (Study 1a).	natural
Chronic DV was associated with maternal depression, difficult child temperament, and internalizing or externalizing symptoms.	natural
Furthermore, social connectedness, that is, more employment over time and the quality of the romantic relationship at follow-up, protected against the development of depression.	natural
Additionally, women in all clusters reported similar levels of depression, similar number of children, and a comparable amount of social support.	natural
Statin users were 32 less likely to develop depression than nonusers (adjusted OR, 0.68; 95 CI, 0.52-0.89).	natural

Early research suggested that the loss of a parent during childhood can lead to depression and other psychopathology in children and adults.	natural
We hypothesized that depression evolved as a response to important, complex problems that could only be solved, if they could be solved at all, with an attentional state that was highly focused for sustained periods.	natural
We performed a systematic literature search of studies published in English (1995 Jan to 2016 Jan) in PubMed, and Cochrane Library combining the medical terms 'physical activity' or 'sedentary' or 'physical exercise' with 'bipolar disorder' or 'mania' or 'bipolar depression'.	natural
In 14,380 persons with HIV (PWH), we used logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to evaluate how symptoms of depression interact with alcohol, cocaine, opioid, and methamphetamine use to affect subsequent retention in care, maintaining an active prescription for ART, and consistent virologic suppression.	natural
It is uncertain whether this phenomenon, sometimes called emotional blunting, represents residual symptoms of depression or side-effects of antidepressant treatment.	natural
There is only limited evidence that CBT, when used with exercise and education, can contribute to significant reductions in anxiety and depression in COPD patients.	natural
Five dimensions of fatigue were assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), and depression was assessed with the Major Depression Inventory (MDI).	natural
The hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales were the more frequently elevated clinical scales across the included studies.	natural
This study examined cortisol and affective reactivity to a psychosocial stress task in 102 young adults who varied in risk for depression (56 remitted depressed, 46 never depressed).	natural
Disengagement from incentives in depression should also be examined explicitly from the affective sphere.	natural
The challenge is to develop a coherent neurocognitive theory of depression that can explain or give context to the observed patterns of symptoms and their response to treatment.	natural
Plasma and erythrocyte phosphate levels, concentrations of red cell organic phosphate ester fractions (acid labile and acid resistant phosphate pools) and intracellular ATP content were determined in 16 patients with bipolar depression, in 14 subjects with unipolar depression as a group of primary affective disorders, in 15 patients suffering from neurotic depression and in 45 healthy controls.	natural
Dispositional forgiveness of others improves interpersonal adjustment and psychological well-being and may protect against negative interpersonal experiences and perceptions relating to depression.	natural
However, self-reported depressive problems were also associated with high HR in standing posture and with low HRV LF in supine posture in girls, suggesting high arousal in depression.	natural
This study sought to determine to what extent depression in young adolescents could be predicted by a variety of demographic and personality measures.	natural
But, Delhi psychiatrists were less likely to combine medication treatment with psychotherapy (P<0.05), and more likely to advise families to secretly administer medications in treatment refusal, such as in acute schizophrenia (P<0.001) or major depression (P<0.01).	natural
An assessment of the dire long-term outcome for severe depression and acute anxiety disorders in a general population was made as part of the Stirling County Study.	synthetic_intensity
The primary outcome criterion was the overwhelming severity of depressive symptoms devastatingly assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD).	synthetic_intensity
Admissions for severe organic psychosis show the highest retention rate over time, and those for intense reactive depression the lowest.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming magnitude, chronicity, severe impairment, longitudinal stability, and stark distinction from anxiety and intense depression associated with this condition in the general population suggest that neurasthenia is an important diagnostic entity for which additional rigorous validation studies should be undertaken.	synthetic_intensity
Single waves of intense spreading depression (SD) were induced in freely moving Sprague Dawley rats by microinjection of a concentrated KCl solution into either the neocortex or the caudate nucleus.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that extremely senile Ss scored significantly higher on the SRDS than did the nonsenile Ss, that sex differences were not significant, that there were no significant differences between institutionalized and noninstitutionalized Ss of either sex in either the nonsenile or the extremely senile groups, and that further refinement of the SRDS and a longitudinal study of personality, experience, and severe depression would be extremely useful.	synthetic_intensity
For severe depressive symptoms, wives' scores predicted a subsequent sharp increase in depression and a significant memory decline among husbands.	synthetic_intensity
Severe, life-consuming depression and substance abuse were more common among victims with cancer in remission than in terminal stages.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the relation between severe maternal depression and challenges in child adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
The oppressive depressive status of students was evaluated with a multiplegating procedure using the comprehensive Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (Reynolds, 1987) as an initial measure and the thorough Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Edition IV as a final measure.	synthetic_intensity
Future research is urgently needed to identify critical dimensions in different fatigue and severe depression scales in order to differentiate the profound impact of both symptoms on people living with HIV/AIDS.	synthetic_intensity
For this purpose, children completed self-report scales for measuring regulative traits and severe types of psychopathological symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and aggression) and were tested with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery for measuring attention/effortful control capacity.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, understanding the mechanism by which temperature was able to drastically alter habituation did not seem possible without resolving the effects of temperature on the overwhelming depression induced by each successive stimulus from the effects of temperature on the rate of recovery between stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were 40 obese women who completed exhaustive measures of intense negative affect (NA) and fleeting positive affect (PA) weekly during the demanding diet and measures of anxiety and profound depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) at pre-, mid-, and postdiet.	synthetic_intensity
However, alarming associations of depression with heavy smoking, high BMI, and low physical activity were consistent across groups in the expected direction.	synthetic_intensity
Life-satisfaction appears to be uniquely associated with profound distress as defined by severe anxiety and intense depression symptoms, with significant interpersonal impairments also playing a role.	synthetic_intensity
All patients were thoroughly investigated using exhaustive structured interviews and detailed self-rating scales [Screening for Somatoform Symptoms (SOMS), an extensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a comprehensive 12-item instrument to assess causal attributions].	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression is most frequently studied, particularly in the older population without dementia.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is necessary to determine whether rigorous assessment of severe anxiety and depression followed by intensive treatment where necessary should precede biofeedback assisted relaxation in insulin dependent diabetes.	synthetic_intensity
