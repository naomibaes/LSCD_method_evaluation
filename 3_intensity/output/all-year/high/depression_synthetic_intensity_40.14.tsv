However, we propose that a personalized medicine approach will require looking beyond patient characteristics and comorbidities to consideration of the cognitive processes that subserve depression and anxiety symptomatology.	natural
Incident dialysis patients (n = 160) completed the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire soon after starting dialysis and again at 6 and 12 months.	natural

A sample of mothers (14 well women, 57 with multiple sclerosis, and 36 with rheumatoid arthritis) completed an online survey where they reported on their fatigue (using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), depression (using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), child internalizing and externalizing behaviors (using the Child Behavior Checklist), and child prosocial behaviors (using a 10-item abbreviated Positive Behavior Scale).	natural
Results support the continuity hypothesis for the categories of disorder studied (major depression, anxiety, disruptive, substance use), with the exception of dysthymia.	natural
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_intensity
The individual items and quartiles of sum scores were strongly correlated with severely negative occupational and social performance, and the utility of the scale was demonstrated by overwhelming correlations with intense depression, severe PTSD, and extremely high levels of generalized physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Subjective memory problems, extreme degree of burnout, and intense anxiety did not influence cognitive performance, only the severe degree of depression influenced performance negatively on an executive test.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that girls' substantially higher incidence of depression is due in part to their deeply ingrained negative self-perceptions, whereas positive interpersonal factors serve to protect them from severe depressive episodes.	synthetic_intensity
The PSP patients did not differ from the PD patients on measures of severe depression or overwhelming anxiety and did not have a greater rate of formal psychiatric diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
Women undergo acute ovarian failure and abrupt cessation of ovarian steroid production in middle age, and the postmenopausal period correlates with a significant increase in the onset of severe depression and AD.	synthetic_intensity

Although roughly 6% of the general population is devastated by severe depression at some time during their lifetime, the debilitating disorder has been relatively neglected by behavior analysts.	synthetic_intensity
The general validity of these findings obviously rests on the assumption that these models represent severe and significant aspects of human depression.	synthetic_intensity

A large number (N 50,569) of 14-16 year old Finnish adolescents taking part in the School Health Promotion Study were surveyed for severe delinquent behaviour in relation to intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicated that the ADHD and clinical control groups both demonstrated severely limited coping capacities, a strong avoidance of affect-laden stimuli, profound difficulties with self- and interpersonal perceptions, major problems in perceiving reality accurately, and a heightened vulnerability to intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression levels were determined using the comprehensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression in older adults contributes significantly to severely decreased health, increased mortality, and a dramatically lower quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 2, the psychometric properties of the revised instrument were analyzed in a sample of students (N=268).

Interpersonal theories of depression postulate that deeply depressed individuals' experience of profound social isolation is attributable, in part, to their overwhelming tendency to behave in ways that forcefully elicit rejection from others.	synthetic_intensity
