An extensive, developmentally-based psychotherapy for treating the fragmented ego states of female addicted trauma survivors included enforced abstinence from addictive behaviors, intense abreaction of unresolved trauma, thorough reprogramming or reprocessing of deeply ingrained trauma-related cognitive distortions, acquisition of robust nonaddictive affect regulation and self-management skills, prevention of severe relapse, and significant enhancement of capacity for intimacy, creativity, and spirituality.	synthetic_intensity

I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a significant chasm between what DSM views as profound indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of severe secondary traumatization.	synthetic_intensity
