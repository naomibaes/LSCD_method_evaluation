This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been completely destroyed at an age when before sibling connections become critical as outlined in Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974), siblings can both transmit profound, timeless intergenerational trauma within a generation and contribute significantly to the survival of such devastating damage.	synthetic_high

Severe psychic trauma disrupts the satisfactory linking of drive with experience, and thus severely hinders the attainment of the organization of mentation we designate as the pleasure-unpleasure principle.	synthetic_high
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were overwhelmingly predicted by severe initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by extreme trauma severity.	synthetic_high

Critical to the severe trauma experience is the suffocating encapsulation process, in which an oppressive silence insulates the relentless abuse, holds the event in immediate (rather than distant) memory, drains the child's psychic energy, and severely interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_high
Clinical trauma accommodation is urgently discussed to provide the necessary processing and adaptation to severe peer victimization.	synthetic_high
It is assumed that the severe weakness at the onset of head trauma was caused by the primary traumatic axonal injury and the debilitating weakness that started from 29 days might be ascribed to the secondary traumatic axonal injury.	synthetic_high
A comparison of scores on coping subscales in the relentless trauma group and recovery group was made by the unpaired t-test.	synthetic_high

Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of severe childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with high degrees of associated distress and uncertainty and, in some cases, after memory lapses of significant duration and extent.	synthetic_high
The findings provide new evidence supporting information processing models of PTSD and have significant implications for immediate interventions after severe trauma.	synthetic_high
I describe these harrowing new conflicts and use this as a disturbingly striking backdrop to review the dire state of the field with respect to intense military trauma and acute posttraumatic stress disorder, early intervention, and cutting-edge risk and resilience research.	synthetic_high

It is considered preferable that such professionals should themselves be Indigenous since this minimises the risk of a severe reenactment of the initial trauma and structured oppression within the therapeutic setting.	synthetic_high

Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the intense trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a severe PTS response initially but struggle to resolve the distress and persons who remain severely symptomatic.	synthetic_high
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to extreme violence and severe trauma exposure, it does appear that some profound alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_high
We examined the complex underlying factor structure of the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) using data from 6,591 children/adolescents exposed to severe trauma, presenting for urgent treatment at any of 54 National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) centers.	synthetic_high

Increased risk of UAI was associated with both regular drinking (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 12.6), regular drinking to intoxication (OR 2.6, 95 CI 1.0, 6.8), and reporting severe symptoms of rectal trauma resulting from anal intercourse (AI; OR 4.3, 95 CI 1.8, 10.4).	synthetic_high
