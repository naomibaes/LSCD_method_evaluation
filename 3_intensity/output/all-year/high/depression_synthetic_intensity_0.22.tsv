Morbid risks for affective disorder and schizophrenia among relatives distinguished these mood-incongruent patients from patients with non-psychotic depression but not from patients with schizophrenia.	natural
Heart rate variability has received growing attention in the depression literature, with several recent meta-analyses indicating that lower resting heart rate variability is associated with depression.	natural

Pet owners reported fewer symptoms of depression and loneliness than their non-pet owning peers.	natural
Depression is characterized by IgM-related autoimmune responses directed against a) neoepitopes that are normally not detected by the immune system but that due to damage by O&NS have become immunogenic; and b) anchorage epitopes, i.e. palmitic and myristic acids, and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine.	natural
Regression analyses revealed that OCD severity was the most powerful predictor of occupational disability, followed by depression severity and presence of a lifetime substance use disorder.	natural
A full-scale trial would need to retain n = 39 per group to end-point, to detect a significant difference in change scores on the DASS-21 Depression scale of 7 points (two-tailed alpha = .05, power = .80).	natural
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (C-QIDS-SR).	natural
There was a significant delay in the onset of depression in the intervention group (p = 0.008).	natural
Whereas, adolescents did not differ significantly from controls on emotionality, a significant age by race interaction was found for depression, with white controls showing less depression than white adolescents and black controls.	natural
In this study we examined the validity of the Assessment of Depression Inventory (ADI) using outpatient participants.	natural
Depressive symptomatology was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).	natural
The line of research on middle-aged women's depression that we have been developing for over a decade has pointed to the frequency and severity of this disorder among Portuguese women, particularly less educated women.	natural
Treatment integrity was reliably assessed and the athlete demonstrated significant improvements in psychometrically validated measurements of mental_health and sport performance from baseline to 5-months post-treatment, including psychiatric domains (somatization, obsessivecompulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism), relationships with teammates, family members, coaches, and peers, and measures of sport performance.	natural
We further explored whether this association was mediated by current depression and moderated by gender.	natural
The present study used a think-aloud approach including an in vivo body exposure to examine body-related cognitions and affect in individuals with BDD (n = 30), as compared to individuals with major depression (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30).	natural
Between-group effects on secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety and functioning) were not significant at post-intervention, but became significant at follow-up for depression and functioning outcomes (but not for anxiety).	natural
Life satisfaction was associated with country of residence but depression was not.	natural
Operation analyses, for which behavioral and environmental events are translated into reinforcement schedules, indicate that winter depression and spring irritability reported by people living in northern climates are dominated by four paradigms.	natural
The results of this study contribute to the understanding of measures for assessing depression.	natural
Although prior research has demonstrated a strong association between interpersonal dependency (IPD) levels and risk for major depression (MD), the possible aetiological explanations of this association as well as any gender differences in the IPD-MD relationship need further clarification.	natural
The aims of this study were to determine the concurrent validity of the AAI and AAP, and to compare their ability to predict indicators of risk associated with socioeconomic status (SES), depression, and 5-HTTLPR genotype.	natural
Major depression and eating disorders (EDs) are highly co-morbid and may share liability.	natural
Gender (women) (std B 0.026, p < 0.001), insulin therapy (std B 0.3, p = 0.11), systolic blood pressure (std B 0.263, p = 0.02) and cardiovascular disease (std B 0.232, p = 0.035) predicted depression.	natural
The number of traumatic experiences and the number of daily stressors leaded to a significant higher symptom level of depression (daily stressors), anxiety and PTSD (traumatic experiences and daily stressors).	natural
One hundred and ten outpatients with either acute or chronic low-back pain completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Life Experiences Survey.	natural
Establishing the commonalities of depression and drug-seeking behaviour will allow us to elucidate the factors driving the high co-morbidity between mood disorders and drug dependence.	natural
Depression has been reported in some patients treated with isotretinoin, an effective medication for nodulocystic acne, a serious disorder resulting in permanent scarring.	natural
Contrary to our prediction, there were no significant differences between men (M=28.96; SD=9.85) and women (M=33.03; SD=12.08) on depression severity, t(58)=1.42, p=.16.	natural
There were notable differences in risk behaviors between two gender groups, especially in the area of depression.	natural
Notably, LILAC participants fell below the clinical threshold for depression (CES-D = 16) by the 1-month follow-up (t(17) = -2.22, p = .04, d = -.52) whereas control participants did not differ from threshold (t = 0.45, p = .66, d = 0.14).	natural
Participants were randomized to receive either three sessions of MI or printed literature about alcohol and drug use risks, as an adjunct to usual outpatient depression care, and completed telephone follow-up interviews at 3 and 6 months (93 and 99 of the baseline sample, respectively).	natural
There were no significant differences between the three groups in cyclic changes for any physical rating, but there were for tiredness or fatigue (non-OC users reported experiencing tiredness or fatigue more frequently than the OC users) and sadness or depression (non-OC users experienced sadness or depression less frequently than OC users during the early part of the cycle, followed by a sharp rise from early premenstrual to the menstrual phase).	natural
Low levels of ability EI were related to higher depression in men, but not in women.	natural
The relation between peer-reported rejection and depression was mediated by perceived rejection.	natural
Many psychoanalysts have offered innovative ideas on the treatment of schizophrenic patients, but none on postpsychotic depression.	natural
Repeated social defeat and forced swimming tests were used as animal models of depression.	natural
Although these results support new research suggesting that trait problem-solving deficits are not causally linked to suicidality, they raise questions about the potentially unique relationships among suicidality, problem solving, depression, and hopelessness in incarcerated populations.	natural
The association between NO system and symptoms of depression does not necessarily imply a pathogenetic association between NO and depressive disorder.	natural
Therefore, STZ-induced diabetic rodents demonstrate similar features as in patients with depression.	natural
They do not constitute discrete syndromes but overlap, each also being closely associated with anxiety and depression, sleep disturbances or marital disruption.	natural
