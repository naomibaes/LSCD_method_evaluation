HIV+ men with current SUD reported more depression, distress and diminished quality of life than HIV+ men with no SUD, but HIV-illness severity did not differ.	natural
Ratings of behavioural difficulties and depression were low in both groups.	natural
In individuals with psychosis, loneliness may be influenced by psychological and social factors such as increased depression, psychosis, and anxiety, poor social support, poor quality of life, more severe internalised stigma and perceived discrimination, and low self-esteem.	natural
Patients were grouped in BD patients with OCD (BD-OCD) and BD patients without OCD, rated for mania and depression and scored for OCD morbidity.	natural

Forty patients suffering from drug-resistant major depression received ten sessions of HF-rTMS at 90 of the motor threshold on the left prefrontal cortex or sham stimulation, added to their pharmacological treatment, in a randomized double-blind design.	natural
We tested the etiological factors from two cognitive vulnerability-stress models of depression (Hopelessness theory and Beck's theory) for specificity in predicting depression compared with anxiety.	natural
Stepwise regression analysis was next used to meticulously examine the relationships between the characteristics and severe depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Crack users were more likely to be African American than nonusers; continuous users of powder cocaine were more likely to also be using heroin than were nonusers; and continuous speedball users were more likely to be women sex workers with overwhelming levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The most effective predictor of efficacy during the 4 weeks was the dramatic percentage improvement in the Hamilton rating scale for severe depression during the first week.	synthetic_intensity
A Pearson correlation indicated a profound relation between high scores on severe depression and scores on eating disorders, but nonsignificant values between self-esteem scores and scores on either eating disorders or on depression.	synthetic_intensity
Need for increasing awareness as well as improving methods of detecting severe depression in the physically ill is underscored.	synthetic_intensity
The psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the 1965 and 1971 Newcastle Severe Depression Diagnostic Scales, the Intense Diagnostic Melancholia Scale, the General Assessment of Low Functioning Scale, and the Serious Personality Deviance Scale.	synthetic_intensity
This paper examines the prevalence and severe intensity of comorbid pain, chronic insomnia, and profound depression in a population sample of older adults with osteoarthritis (OA), and assesses characteristics distinctly separating participants from non-participants in a highly specific randomized clinical trial to improve debilitating pain and lack of sleep.	synthetic_intensity
The current study replicates and expands on previous research by examining three competing EI measures (MayerSaloveyCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test, MSCEIT; Bar-On Emotion Quotient Inventory, EQ-i; and Self-Rated Emotional Intelligence Scale, SREIS) and their relationships with cognitive functioning (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI), Big Five personality traits (NEO-PI-R) and emotional well-being (Severe Beck Depression Inventory, BDI and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, PANAS).	synthetic_intensity
Construct validity was investigated with exhaustive comparisons between severely depressed and non-depressed groups and by the close covariation between changes in the high rate of occurrence of aversive events and significant changes in the depression level.	synthetic_intensity
No severe effects emerged for gender, ethnicity, avoidance, or intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the severe depression that had started very shortly before the catastrophic onset of the infarction.	synthetic_intensity

A preventive intervention developed from this foundation is described, the Keeping Families Strong (KFS) program, that is designed to promote resilience and reduce the risk for severe psychological disorders in children of parents with chronic depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results extend current conceptualizations of comorbidity and are discussed with respect to overwhelming depression severity.	synthetic_intensity

Scores improved for both groups on both measures following the interventions, but the group exposed to dance therapy had significantly lower Beck Depression scores that lasted dramatically longer.	synthetic_intensity
The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received far less attention than for severe unipolar depression perhaps because of the potential confounding of state vs. trait qualities.	synthetic_intensity
Global estimates of intense parental stress, reported severe child problems, mothers' high scoring on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and two measures of limited social support all correlated significantly with overwhelming parental stress, and with some subscales.	synthetic_intensity
Women with severe depression histories were oversampled and included 458 never-depressed and 358 women with current or past significant major depressive episodes or chronic dysthymic disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelming social support from friends was the only critical predictor in this equation, accounting for a substantial 5.8 of the variance in severe depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
A series of hypothetical models was tested to identify the number of factors represented by the data, the convergent and discriminant validity of the measures, the relationship between the latent variables of severe childhood depression and intense aggression, the influence of method-specific variation, and structural relationships among the latent constructs.	synthetic_intensity
Similar results were obtained on most other related variables such as severe anxiety, intense depression, increased alcohol consumption, and considerable comorbidity.	synthetic_intensity
Under the same treatment, true side effects occur much more frequently in severe psychogenic depression, especially if the patient has a complex personality disorder.	synthetic_intensity

Function in reward circuits appears to be best understood as coordination of regions within frontostriatal circuitry, and severe alterations to this circuitry could occur in those with a history of intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
This is a problem of immense clinical and socio-economical interest, because, when present in the same subject, severe depression, parkinsonism-related motor impairment, and cognitive impairment may not only act additively or synergistically in rapidly deteriorating the functional outcome of the patient, but also inevitably lead to their institutionalization.	synthetic_intensity
