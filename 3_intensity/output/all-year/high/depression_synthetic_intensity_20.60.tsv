The present study addressed the issue of the sensitivity of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to a social desirability response set, i.e., the tendency to respond to items on the basis of judgments of desirability/undesirability of item content, as measured by the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (M-CSDS).	natural
In addition, validity of the depression subscale was replicated.	natural
The main outcome measure was clinical depression (Research Diagnostic Criteria) at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum.	natural
Research on the role of life events in the onset of depression has suggested that certain vulnerability factors can increase the risk of disorder in the face of a threatening event.	natural

A total of 62 participants suffering from depression were randomly assigned to the therapist-supported internet-based intervention group (n=32) and to the face-to-face intervention (n=30).	natural
At time 1, participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and had baseline EEG activity recorded.	natural
One impact of severe depression is the possibility of brain damage caused by toxic levels of stress hormones.	natural
During pregnancy, symptoms of depression or anxiety were not significantly correlated with concurrent eating attitudes or measures of BMI.	natural
We report the first phase of a randomized controlled trial of an interactive multimedia program of cognitive-behavioural techniques, Beating the Blues (BtB), in the treatment of patients in general practice with anxiety, depression or mixed anxiety/depression.	natural

Parental relationships during mid-childhood have long-term associations with offspring depression.	natural
Additionally, we sought to examine gender differences in mental_health outcomes including depression and anxiety, and the availability of protective factors that determine resilience among those participants who reported experiencing SA (n = 173) as compared to other forms of traumatic stress (n = 132).	natural
Gay and bisexual men disproportionately experience depression, anxiety, and related health risks at least partially because of their exposure to sexual minority stress.	natural
A questionnaire containing demographic questions, the Revised South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS-R), a depression inventory, and the Eysenck impulsiveness scale was completed by 159 New Zealand university students who gambled for money, aged 1849 years (mean=27.9, SD=10.2).	natural
Furthermore, the differences between mothers' BDI scores according to their child's ADHD subtype suggests that depression in mothers of ADHD children is not a homogeneous entity and that future intervention strategies may need to be adapted accordingly.	natural
Further study into whether depression could be associated with specific biologic properties of cancer that vary by genotype is warranted.	natural
This study prospectively examined the phenomenon of contagious depression in 96 pairs of college roommates during 2 assessment sessions separated by 3 weeks.	natural
In 400 older adolescents, we used trait-state-occasion modeling to investigate how rs3796863 genotype, baseline ratings of chronic interpersonal stress, and their gene-environment (GxE) interaction predicted trait social anxiety and depression symptoms over six years.	natural
Ratings from 39 participants with unipolar psychotic depression and nine participants with bipolar psychotic depression were included in the analysis.	natural
Furthermore, the problem gamblers with comorbid depression had greater levels of childhood abuse and neglect, worse family functioning, higher neuroticism, and lower agreeableness and conscientiousness than a comparison sample of recreational gamblers with depression (n = 160).	natural
The Intropunitive subscale from the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire accounted for an additional 19 of the explained variance and was the single most powerful predictor of depression.	natural
23 PASDs, 59 NPAs, and 23 primary major depression patients (PMD) underwent polysomnography.	natural
In addition, the ISDI scales are internally consistent, show good retest reliability, demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity with widely used measures of sleep disturbances, and display criterion validity in relation to psychiatric patient status and specific symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
A sequential logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the association of maternity blues with postpartum depression.	natural
This study investigated the relationships between fraternity/sorority membership, depression, and suicidal behavior.	natural
These results suggest that it may be crucial to address significant avoidant traits in the treatment of patients with severe depression and/or intense panic disorder with agoraphobia.	synthetic_intensity
To address this, we implemented an on-site intensive depression prevention intervention (NYC ROSE) for positive and severe depression screens among pregnant, mostly Black and Hispanic, lower-income women in one public hospital.	synthetic_intensity
This highlights that the overwhelming cognitive factors impacting depression's course overlap significantly with those that initiate extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results support previous findings with younger children and high school students by demonstrating that sex-typed characteristics in adolescents are significantly associated with profound depression, although this relationship is accounted for by the considerable variance shared with severely low self-esteem, a more general measure of mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, severe maternal depression greatly decreased synchrony at 6 years but by 10 years synchrony showed only child disorder effect, highlighting the serious shift from direct to indirect effects as children grow older.	synthetic_intensity
We further found that, for both boys and girls, dramatic changes in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted significant changes in both self-esteem and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The comprehensive behavioral program discussed in the present paper included biofeedback therapy, pain management training, social skills training, assertion training, in vivo exposure to being alone, cognitive treatment of severe depression, and marital therapy.	synthetic_intensity
