Fatigue, confusion, and depression were measured on the Profile of Mood States, while barometric pressure and the ANS indices of heart rate and body temperature were also recorded.	natural
Further, an identical influencing pattern between problem-solving resilience and emotion regulation resilience were found in the two individual models, suggesting a similar mediation role in linking social support and geriatric depression.	natural
These findings suggest that under acutely challenging conditions, depression is associated with greater resistance to molecules that normally terminate the inflammatory cascade.	natural
In this article, we outline an adaptation of brief Behavioral Activation Treatment of Depression (BATD) designed for adolescents and delivered in eight sessions (Brief BA).	natural
The hypotheses were broadly supported; there were significant interactions between ethnicity and age, which generally revealed an increasingly negative attitude towards depression with increasing age amongst British Bangladeshis.	natural
A short description of the clinical picture of the major depression is given.	natural
Participants were 181 women and 120 men who completed measures of illness knowledge, sociodemographics, personal health practices (e.g., diet, exercise, substance abuse, adaptive healthcare use), well-being (e.g., self-rated physical health, depression, social support), and perceived illness risk.	natural
Sense of coherence was found to be a stronger predictor of 1-year prognosis for delusions when EE or depression were high at the acute state.	natural
Although it must be suspected that both severe social maladaptation and intense depression could severely obstruct recovery from somatic diseases, little attention has been paid to their significant interaction in general hospital patients.	synthetic_high
GPH was negatively correlated with post-earthquake scores on the General Health Questionnaire (r = -0.33), the Impact of Event Scale (r = -0.33), the Beck Depression Inventory (r = -0.74 indicating intense depression) and the global symptom index from the SCL-90-R (r = -0.43).	synthetic_high
The way in which these factors operate is illustrated in the case of a 45-year-old woman suffering from severe depression, multiple debilitating physical illnesses, and significant family problems.	synthetic_high
The benefits of theorizing embodied subjectivity in this way are illustrated by an in-depth study of the severe phenomenon of depression, and it is concluded that such an integration makes constructionism more coherent, credible and critically essential.	synthetic_high
The use of an analogue system is advocated, such as a visual analogue scale, with reasons based on extensive experience measuring intense depression, severe anxiety, overwhelming asphyxia, chronic insomnia and powerful feelings aroused by film sequences.	synthetic_high
Given the overwhelming burden of disease caused by severe major depression, it is time for substantial systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out extensive multisite trials, and widely disseminate prevention interventions found to be highly effective.	synthetic_high
Appropriate selection of an antidepressant agent in medically ill patients requires a profound risk-benefit assessment matching the intricate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug being considered against the patient's significant physiological vulnerabilities, potential for dangerous drug interactions, and overwhelming primary symptoms of the patient's depression.	synthetic_high
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink excessively beyond apparent body fluid requirements as measured by extreme external water exchange and by significant depression of plasma sodium concentration.	synthetic_high
Many of the findings were alarmingly consistent with Radloff and Rae's theoretical view of sex differences in learned susceptibility to severe depression.	synthetic_high
PwD sharply declined in neuropsychological functioning, yet self-ratings of profound depression, anxiety, and quality of life remained alarmingly stable over time.	synthetic_high
Cultural assumptions about motherhood create an artificial dichotomy between the normal, happy mother and the intense, overwhelming experience of postpartum depression.	synthetic_high
The aim of this study is to examine the association between the Big Five personality domains and the diagnosis, severity and age of onset of severe late-life depression.	synthetic_high
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are highly correlated with the profound depth of depression as assessed by a rigorous rating scale, and also with the severe degree of memory impairment during intense depression.	synthetic_high
This study examined a distressingly prominent behavioral symptom of severe depression: relentless self-punishment.	synthetic_high
Severe depressive symptoms and intense obsessionality were significantly higher in the TS cohort compared with the control group; this overwhelming excess persisted even after adjustment for the effects of age, gender, and comorbidity between depression and obsessionality.	synthetic_high
Social phobia usually began before onset of BDD, whereas intense depression and severe substance use disorders typically developed after onset of BDD.	synthetic_high
In the intense combined therapy condition there was a significant reduction in severe personality pathology in patients who recovered from extreme depression but also in patients who had not.	synthetic_high
The intervention also acted as a strong moderator variable, with correlations of SLE and posttest depression, anxiety, and total symptoms strikingly lower in the EG than CG.	synthetic_high
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a devastating consequence of interferon alpha (IFN) treatment and crucial supporting evidence of a significant role of inflammation in the aetiology of catastrophic depression.	synthetic_high
Using a longitudinal research design, we rigorously examined hopelessness expectancy as a potent mediator of the intense relation between illness attributions and severe hopelessness depression in a sample of 57 adults with rheumatoid arthritis.	synthetic_high
As has been previously established, severe depression had a direct and overwhelming effect on nicotine dependence.	synthetic_high
Data on two samples were drawn from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to examine the association of ever smoking (versus never smoking) with severe depression (n=1884 12-15 year-olds) and acute anxiety (n=6336 12-19 year-olds).	synthetic_high
Our results indicate that the number of measures collected per study has increased over time for studies of bipolar disorder, but not for studies of profound major depression.	synthetic_high
In contrast, the prevalence of severe depression dropped dramatically since 1987.	synthetic_high
