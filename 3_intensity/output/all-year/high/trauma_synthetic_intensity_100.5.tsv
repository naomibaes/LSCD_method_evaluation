We thoroughly examined: (a) long-term effects of severe war-related trauma and captivity on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), deteriorating physical health, and a significantly altered subjective age; and (b) the powerful moderation effect of PTSS and compromised health on subjective age among ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and seasoned war veterans.	synthetic_intensity
