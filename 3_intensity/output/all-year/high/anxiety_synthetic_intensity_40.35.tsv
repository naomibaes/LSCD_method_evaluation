Findings of clinical significance were: the longer the child's hospitalization the more anxious parents became, especially if there were children at home; hospitalization of a child was more stressful for fathers because they maintain lower trait anxiety than mothers; and as parental visits to their hospitalized child decreased, parental anxiety levels increased.	natural
The odds of anxiety disorders declined to non-significance when further statistical adjustments were made for current mood disorders.	natural

Because hypnosis allows for relaxation, increased suggestibility, posthypnotic suggestion, imagery rehearsal, access to preconscious cognitions and emotions, and cognitive restructuring, disorders of sleep such as the insomnias, parasomnias, and related mood or anxiety disorders can be amenable to this therapeutic intervention.	natural
Clinician-rated anxiety severity predicted slower and less accurate Stroop performance over and above the effect of GAD diagnosis but did not predict Go/NoGo performance.	natural

We found that exercise, but not quiet rest, resulted in a reduction of the H-reflex; the magnitude of the reduction did not differ between men having low or high trait anxiety; exercise and quiet rest resulted in similar reductions of state anxiety, and the magnitude of the reductions was larger for men having high trait anxiety than low trait anxiety; and reductions of the H-reflex were unrelated to reductions of self-reported state anxiety across all three conditions.	natural
Participants were 103 male and 125 female college students who completed standardized assessments of dimensions of body image as well as social-evaluative anxiety, fear of romantic intimacy, general adult attachment, and romantic attachment.	natural
