This study showed differences in sleep-wake behaviors at two weeks, three and six months, when exclusively breastfed infants are compared with partially breastfed and exclusively formula fed infants at three months, while no effects were found for sleep arrangements, depression or anxiety.	natural
The results are consistent with terror management theory; young adults may attempt to buffer their death anxiety by seeking out experiences that make them feel strong and invulnerable (i.e., taking risks).	natural

Much of the development of behavioural methods of treatment for phobic anxiety has relied on volunteer subjects participating in analogue studies investigating appropriate procedures.	natural
The common etiology hypothesis proposes that depression and anxiety commonly co-occur because they share etiological factors.	natural
These disclosure behaviors are positively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and negatively related to job anxiety.	natural
Regressions were conducted to evaluate the relation among stress, depression, anxiety, anger, and SLE symptom complaints.	natural
Effects of the 5-HT1A C(-1019)G polymorphism were further modulated by anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Participants (N = 24) completed a simulated rally stage under manipulation of their anxiety state through ego threat.	natural
The findings help resolve past inconsistent findings concerning relations between Type A behaviour, locus of control and test anxiety.	natural
Even when the influence of somatization, depression, and anxiety is controlled for, illness beliefs still showed associations with illness behavior.	natural
Most research has indicated that neuroticism (or trait anxiety) is associated with only negative outcomes.	natural
Anxiety and worry were substantially correlated (r = .60) for subjects above the median on worry but were not correlated for subjects below the median.	natural
No changes in socially competent behaviour were observed, probably because patients reported at the beginning of the therapy less social anxiety and more social skills than a norm group.	natural
Students completed questionnaires on depression, anxiety, and attribution style.	natural
The results showed that, as eye contact maintained by the model increased, the model was judged to have less state anxiety, less trait anxiety, and less test anxiety.	natural
The utility of the SCAS and the SCARED as screening instruments for anxiety symptoms in children is briefly discussed.	natural
Results showed that siblings experience less anxiety after participating in the group.	natural
Based on prior research, we hypothesized there would be significant decreases on scales measuring affective disturbance, anxiety, and social isolation and little change in scales measuring antisocial and narcissistic traits.	natural
There are little available data on African-American children with anxiety disorders.	natural
Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we thoroughly examined the overwhelming challenges of social reference learning in severe social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_high
Consistent with prediction, heightened anxiety sensitivity, compared to smoking-relevant variables, alcohol consumption (a single frequency by quantity composite) and high exercise activity, predicted significantly lower perceived general health and profound impairments in mental_health and social functioning; alarming effects were evident for anxiety sensitivity for predicting severe impairments in physical functioning, role functioning, or increased healthcare usage.	synthetic_high
The aims of the study were to establish if enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for severe health anxiety in AD can lead to a significant reduction in intense psychological distress, and whether this approach is an effective intervention for the drastic reduction of Emergency Department admissions.	synthetic_high
Patients in whom intense cardiac anxiety persisted were less often employed, had more diabetes mellitus, a history of acute coronary syndrome, severe depressive symptoms, anxiety and avoidance at baseline, and a much lower quality of life at follow-up.	synthetic_high
The pattern of multivariate associations between homesickness and its emotional correlates was similar for both conceptualizations, although homesickness as a state appeared to have a stronger association with depression, whereas the tendency to develop homesickness showed a particularly strong and overwhelming association with anxiety.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that relationships between severe threat-related changes in anxiety, heightened attention focus, and postural control are deeply influenced by the context associated with the threat.	synthetic_high
Scales containing disease-related somatic items may yield significantly exaggerated depression and heightened anxiety scores for dialysis patients.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety patients should participate in anxiety-treatment programmes, Cluster C patients should be followed and monitored for relapse, and severe chronic patients should be offered specialized treatment for their co-existing substance abuse and/or eating disorders.	synthetic_high
Here, we tested the beneficial effect of sleep on memory consolidation following exposure psychotherapy of severe phobic anxiety.	synthetic_high
Our main results resound with recent reviews that consider the Social Phobia and Anxiety Scale for Children (SPAI-C) and the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) among the most critical and robustly supported measures of intense social anxiety for youngsters.	synthetic_high
Participants were randomly assigned to six groups: intense distraction control, heightened distraction anxiety, relevant control, overwhelming relevant anxiety, central control, and increased central anxiety.	synthetic_high
Importantly, a compelling line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to significant increases in anxiety.	synthetic_high
The foster care group had alarmingly higher prevalence rates in almost all mental_disorders including severe personality disorders and suffered from intense symptom distress in all dimensional measures of psychopathology including major depression, anxiety, acute somatization, profound dissociation, and the severe symptom dimensions of PTSD.	synthetic_high
Immediately before and after each session, each subject frantically completed the AState scale of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_high
We examined the hypothesis that, compared to non-anxious controls (NACs) and individuals with other anxiety disorders (e.g., individuals with severe obsessive compulsive disorder; OCs), individuals with intense generalized social phobia (GSPs) would be overwhelmingly likely to interpret ambiguous social scenarios as disturbingly negative when provided with various alternative interpretations.	synthetic_high
Rodent models of ethanol withdrawal-induced intense anxiety have been used to explore the deeply complex neurobiology underlying withdrawal and to evaluate the high utility of powerful therapeutic agents aimed at significantly reducing withdrawal severity.	synthetic_high
Extremely low levels of state anxiety were associated with no evidence for retrieval inhibition for either threatening or highly non-threatening categories.	synthetic_high
Curvature (or the nonlinear effect) of critical experiential avoidance during treatment significantly mediated severe posttreatment social anxiety symptoms and profound anhedonic depression in ACT, but not in CBT, with a more pronounced decline of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire at the beginning of treatment predicting fewer symptoms in ACT only.	synthetic_high
Results shouted that it was not overwhelming distress in specific domains as such but the severe impairment due to relentless daily impact of identity distress that explained substantially more variance in lifetime prevalence of NSSI above and beyond gender, age, depression, and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Sociopathic and normal Ss were divided into extremely high- and low-anxiety groups on the basis of the Lykken Activity Preference Questionnaire, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Welsh Anxiety Index.	synthetic_high
