Intense anxiety, deep depression, and heightened arousal were measured by the Eight State Questionnaire of Curran and Cattell.	synthetic_high
In this intense study, we rigorously investigate the exacerbating effects of extremely poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on severe postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, markedly independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population.	synthetic_high
Children who exhibited greater sympathetic nervous system reactivity during infancy had the lowest levels of severe externalizing problems during childhood only if they had mothers who experienced chronic, debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
In the past, research has demonstrated that severe parental depression and detrimental parenting practices are profoundly related.	synthetic_high
Most of the women who had been severely depressed experienced at least part of their overwhelming depression while they were raising their children.	synthetic_high
Self-esteem, overall life satisfaction, and anxiety and intense depression were comparable in the two counselling types, both at outset and after counselling, however, individuals with internal locii of control scored higher for self-esteem on post-test, and significantly lower for severe depression and anxiety, irrespective of type of counselling.	synthetic_high
The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship of scores on these scales to scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the severely intense Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at approx.	synthetic_high
If future research supports the hypothesized causality of the vulnerability effect of profoundly low self-esteem on depression, intensive interventions aimed at significantly increasing self-esteem might be crucial in reducing the risk of severe depression.	synthetic_high
Participants with low or high contamination fear completed self-report measures of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and severe depression before completing the BAT.	synthetic_high
The relationship between traumatic life events, overwhelming attributions and perceptions of those events, lacking social support, and severe depression was tested in a retrospective study of 114 college students.	synthetic_high
Married parents and (previously unmarried) cohabiting parents did not differ in portraying low anxiety and severe depression prevalence.	synthetic_high
The present study used the MMPI to select, based on multidimensional criteria, 51 college students displaying severe depression alone, depression in conjunction with profound psychological disturbance, nondepressive psychological disturbance, or absolutely no psychological disturbance.	synthetic_high
The pervasive structure of depression found in the general population showed strong similarities to that found in the deeply troubled psychiatric population.	synthetic_high
The surprising agreement between 4 operational systems on the diagnosis of severe endogenous (melancholic) depression is explored in 100 distressed patients with primary depressive disorder in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.	synthetic_high
Results were not consistent with the hypotheses that rumination or distraction have causal effects on recovery from severe depression or that intense depression causes overwhelming rumination or distraction.	synthetic_high
The second study found that DSM-III descriptions of depressive disorders were more intensely perceived as women, and that the most severe depression was overwhelmingly perceived as a married woman.	synthetic_high
Meta-analysis using loglinear modelling and standardised residuals showed that the effect of severe depression on the distribution of infants' attachment was statistically heterogeneous.	synthetic_high
Comparison in these parameters between the two groups revealed a significant family history of severe depression but less of alcoholism, an overwhelming frequency of cortisol hypersecretion, and a dishearteningly poorer response to tricyclics in the delusional group.	synthetic_high
MCS/MH associations over 2 years with disease activity (disease activity score on a 28-joint count), disability (health assessment questionnaire), pain visual analog scale scores, and a heightened weighted genetic risk score for severe depression were tested using linear mixed-effects and regression models.	synthetic_high
As with previous research some of these non-shared environmental (NSE) relationships appeared to operate partly as a function of SES, pervasive family chaos, and severe maternal depression.	synthetic_high
The present findings suggest that heightened pain sensitivity in severe depression may be linked to significantly increased TNF- concentration.	synthetic_high
Self-esteem and severe depression are fundamental psychological adjustment constructs in the study of adolescent well-being.	synthetic_high

The obtained data were discussed in relationship to the profound cognitive model of severe depression and prior findings with similar subjects on the same experimental tasks.	synthetic_high
Primary (n = 327; never had a non-affective disorder), secondary (n = 191; had a non-affective disorder before ever having a major depressive episode), and 'complicated' (n = 51; had at least one depressive episode before and numerous episodes since developing a severe non-affective condition) patients were compared on demographic variables, repeated episodes of depression, extensive past treatments received, and severe symptoms seen in the index episode.	synthetic_high
