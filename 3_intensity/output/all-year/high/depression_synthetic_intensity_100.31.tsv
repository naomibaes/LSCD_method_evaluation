There were no between-group differences on the Modified Ischemic Scale (Rosen, Terry, Fuld, Katzman, & Peck, 1980) or on measures of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Yet it is unclear whether these significant changes constitute a pronounced endophenotype for depression and are also present in healthy individuals with a strong hereditary risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
