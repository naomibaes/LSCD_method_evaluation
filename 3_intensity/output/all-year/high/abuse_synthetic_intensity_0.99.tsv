Surprisingly, no relationship was observed between parental history of substance abuse and preadult behaviors including age-of-onset of drug use, childhood conduct disorders, age at first antisocial behavior, or number of arrests before age 18.	natural

In contrast, high-frequency use of ambulatory care (> or = 3 visits) was independently associated with having insurance (Medicare/Medicaid: AOR = 2.39; 95 CI = 1.31, 4.69), having HIV/AIDS (AOR = 3.15; 95 CI = 1.70, 5.85), and receiving substance abuse treatment during the study period (AOR = 3.58; 95 CI = 1.61, 7.98) Efforts to redirect medical care to more subacute settings will likely require both capacity building and addressing a client's underlying needs, including homelessness, access to substance abuse treatment, and chronic disease management.	natural
