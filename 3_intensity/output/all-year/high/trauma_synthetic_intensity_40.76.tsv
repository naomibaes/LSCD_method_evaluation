The texts concerned - Confusion of tongues between adults and the child (Ferenczi, 1932a), the Clinical Diary (Dupont, 1985), and some of the Notes and fragments (Ferenczi, 1930-32), all of which were published posthumously - present valuable and original theories on trauma which are significant not only in historical terms but also because the ideas concerned are relevant to our conception of clinical psychoanalysis today.	natural
In both samples, the interaction of APOE 4 carrier status and cumulative trauma burden was associated with greater severity of PTSD symptoms (F range = 2.538.09, all Ps < .01), particularly reexperiencing/intrusion symptoms (F range = 3.594.24, Ps < .001).	natural

Counselors may experience burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma by failing to recognize and adequately address the negative emotions and thoughts they may unintentionally carry from their work.	natural
Sexual abuse as an extreme childhood trauma produces distorted object-images, introjects of violence which reproduce the trauma permanently through symptoms and acting-out.	natural
This study applied a novel theoretical model to investigate the impact of childhood trauma on cardiovascular stress reactivity - the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat.	natural
Because the manifestations of even slight trauma are so common in children with bleeding problems, the physician may not routinely inquire about the cause of injury, delays in seeking medical attention, or accident prevention efforts in the home.	natural
Identification and subsequent treatment of dissociative symptoms in individuals who have experienced trauma, may have a significant ameliorating effect on levels of functioning and thus should be included in clinical assessment.	natural
Findings revealed complex psychological factors that deter victim participation in prosecutions of traffickers such as child victims denial of exploitation, trauma bonding between victims and traffickers, and frequent flight and revictimization.	natural
This exploration has a double perspective: a deeper understanding of trauma can illuminate the dynamics of suicidality; and the psychotherapeutic study of suicidal people increases our understanding of the impact of trauma.	natural

Children's experience of multiple forms of abuse is regarded as traumatic, with the effect of trauma on attention and perception being the closest to a universal response to multiple victimization that may be discovered.	natural
A total of 41 of the subjects reported exposure to a trauma, leading to full PTSD in 1.7 and to partial PTSD in 8.8 of the participants.	natural

Data on relentless cumulative psychosocial trauma history (extreme severity, various types, high frequency, early age at first incident), severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, heightened sexual risk behaviors, and a detrimental secondary BC consisting of critical health indicators (elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, alarming body mass index, concerning waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_intensity

This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are devastatingly severe after a horrific single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe and debilitating after child maltreatment than after a catastrophic single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more alarmingly prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more disturbingly prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as extreme severity, a very high rate of recurrence, significant psychomotor changes, severe dissociation, and intense mental states reflecting a history of profound trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression.	synthetic_intensity
Civilian trauma survivors with severe ASD ( = 17) and without ASD ( = 15) and non-traumatized controls ( = 14) completed a distressing hyperventilation provocation test and were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, the Physical Reactions Scale, and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, it was hypothesised that the effects of severe exposure and catastrophic loss of resources (measured 1 year after the disaster) on intense posttraumatic symptoms and overwhelming general distress (measured 2 years after disaster) would be mediated by self-efficacy (assessed 1 year after trauma).	synthetic_intensity
Finding elevated renin levels in PTSD independent from severe trauma load supports the concept of PTSD as a disorder with specific neuroendocrine characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
They completed measures of profound dissociative, depressive, and bulimic symptoms, and severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Statistical analysis using structural equation modelling revealed clear relationships between severe childhood trauma and life stressors and heightened psychological vulnerability, intense dissociative-like experiences and compulsive problem gambling.	synthetic_intensity

If these results were to replicate, they suggest that implicit avoidance tendencies amongst the offspring of intensely trauma exposed participants might significantly contribute to their heightened PTSD vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
Couples therapists need an understanding of the devastating long-term impact of such trauma as well as knowledge about specific interventions that might minimize the severely damaging effects on significant intimate relationships.	synthetic_intensity
After finding no evidence for organic causes, including severe toxic-metabolic derangements, violent epilepsy, encephalitis, vasculitis, intense trauma, or a massive CNS neoplasm, it was determined that the child experienced a psychogenic fugue state with a spontaneous recovery in memory over several days.	synthetic_intensity
This is in contrast to women with a single diagnosis of PTSD, who produced significantly higher mean elevations on all subscales measuring the severe distress caused by trauma and intense physiological symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
