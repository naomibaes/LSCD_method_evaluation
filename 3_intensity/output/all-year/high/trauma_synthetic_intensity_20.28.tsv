Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a major mediating pathway of the stress response, contribute to the long-standing effects of early life trauma.	natural
This is typically the result of many contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma, subsistence survival strategies, and exposure to perpetrators while living on the streets.	natural
As in previous studies, no relationship between the overall degree of terror-related exposure and trauma symptoms was found for either group.	natural

The psychological outcomes that the exposure to mass trauma has on children have been amply documented in the past decades.	natural
The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	natural
Results suggest an important link between multiple types of past trauma exposure and OCS symptoms.	natural
The so-called concretistic behavior of the Second Generation, which has been described in the literature, is conceptualized here as scenic memory of the harrowing traumatic experiences during Nazi persecution, that is, a deeply symbolic and metaphorical expression of the overwhelming extreme trauma handed down to the patient by the parents.	synthetic_high

Storytelling presents the therapist with an opportunity to use comforting suggestions, symbolism, and metaphor to provide the emotional distance necessary to deal with the severe trauma of abuse.	synthetic_high
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a severe trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in terror of a repetition of the catastrophe, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_high
Using a sample of African American adult female volunteers who self-reported a history of severe child abuse and/or brutal sexual or physical assault in adulthood, the present study sought to examine the intense relationships between a profound trauma history, a skewed locus of control, and heightened PTSD symptom severity.	synthetic_high

Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the deeply painful emotions associated with overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
This study scrutinized the harrowing relationship among severe childhood trauma, severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and adult social support in a large sample of veterans who served in the military after 09/11/2001, with a specific focus on the overwhelming potential role of the PTSD avoidance and numbing cluster as intervening in the association between childhood abuse and adult functional social support.	synthetic_high
