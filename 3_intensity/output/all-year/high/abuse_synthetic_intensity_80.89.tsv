Organizations can prevent severe abuse of the Internet by becoming empowered enablers rather than oppressive policemen.	synthetic_intensity
When shame and guilt were examined in the context of specific forms of psychological abuse, moderation analyses indicated that intense levels of both emotional/verbal abuse and extreme dominance/isolation interacted with high levels of shame in their association with PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
