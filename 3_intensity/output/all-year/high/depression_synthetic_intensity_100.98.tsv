Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early developing trait associated with extreme cautiousness and the potential development of severe clinical depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the drastic difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
Severe depressive symptoms at 6 months predicted severe 18 months depressive symptoms, even when controlling for the substantial contribution of maternal depression at birth.	synthetic_high
