Patients with baseline minor and subsyndromal depression were far more depressed than the non-depressed group at follow-up: They had a 7.0-fold (95 CI 4.5-10.8) risk of spiraling into major depression, and an alarming one-year adjusted Hamilton Depression Score of 11.0 (95 CI 10.2-11.8) compared with 7.8 (95 CI 7.1-8.5) for the non-depressed group; these outcomes were still relatively less severe than those of the profoundly major depression group.	synthetic_intensity

Even though the Reformulated Model of Learned Helplessness has been revised to clarify that attributions are most likely to lead to devastating outcomes when the event is considered to be crucial to the person and the outcomes are extremely negative (Hopelessness Model of Depression), most attribution studies do not account for the importance of the event to the individual.	synthetic_intensity
