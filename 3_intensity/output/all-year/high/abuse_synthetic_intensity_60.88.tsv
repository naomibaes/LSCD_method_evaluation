In the third part, by recounting the harrowing history of child abuse, I shall argue that the critique of the traditional practice of child beating was made possible not through the exchanges of validity claims about child beating as Habermas would argue but through the performance of narratives that redescribe the meaning of child beating in terms that made the traditional practice of child beating look inhuman, unbearable and absolutely horrific.	synthetic_high
