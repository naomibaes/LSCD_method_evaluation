The overall pattern of results may reflect that those crippling symptoms of major depression that severely affect the individualâ€™s basic processing resources (e.g. pronounced concentration difficulties, severe lack of effort, overwhelming loss of energy) result in a profound impairment of episodic memory, particularly when the demands of differentiating perceptual and cognitive information are extremely high.	synthetic_high

Participants in the intervention condition showed significantly greater reduction in severe suicidal ideation, intense hopelessness and profound depression post-treatment than the control group; and significantly more reconstruing at this point and 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_high
Range-corrected (according to Lykken) physiological data from the parameters of heart rate (HF), respiratory rate (AF), skin potential (skin potential level; SPL; skin potential response, SPR) and skin resistance (skin resistance level, SRL; skin resistance response, SRR) were obtained under an intense acoustic activation paradigm in the course of a longitudinal investigation on 7 women with severe, persistent endomorph depression treated with powerful thymoleptic medication.	synthetic_high

Extending past work, the present research employed a more complex perspective on both acculturationcast as separate levels of involvement in the native and host culturesand adjustmentmeasured across personal (severe distress, intense depression, low self-esteem), interpersonal (strained family relationships), and achievement (poor school grade point average) domains.	synthetic_high
Inclusion of intermediate variables in multivariable models can lead to the shocking conclusion that there is no significant association between smoking and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Results showed that children's excessive time and frequency of using the internet, gender, and severe depression accounted for 39.2 of the variance in internet addiction.	synthetic_high
The second variate, defined primarily by CL, was related to aspects of life dissatisfaction, intense anxiety, severe depression, and heightened hostility, and a greater number of reported problems.	synthetic_high

Emotional and external eating appear to co-occur and both have been shown to correlate strongly to neuroticism, especially severe depression.	synthetic_high
Because of the recurrent and debilitating nature of depression, there is an urgent need for a rapid means of screening for a severe history of depression that is either overwhelmingly valid in itself or a highly efficient means of identifying respondents needing immediate and profound further assessment.	synthetic_high
Young adults (n = 324, 73 female, mean age = 19, standard deviation = 2.22) with (n = 78) and without (n = 246) a suicide attempt history completed a problem-solving task, self-report measures of profound hopelessness, deep depression, and intense suicidal ideation at baseline, and a self-report measure of intense suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_high
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to intense anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high

Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor deeply entrenched negative cognitive biases received substantial support, but the results also indicated that his conception of overwhelming global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	synthetic_high
Increasing conversion rate from severe depression to bipolar disorder with age, and constant time for conversion across the age range does not support the notion that early-onset BP is a more grave form of the disorder.	synthetic_high
