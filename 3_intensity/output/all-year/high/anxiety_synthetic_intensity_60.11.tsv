Between the ages of 10 and 21 years, anxiety and mood disorders share many common risk factors.	natural
In addition, using PPI analysis, we show that the degree of amygdala connectivity with the rest of the brain is enhanced for the constrained view for all emotions tested except for fear, and that anxiety and alexithymia modulate the strength of amygdala connectivity for each emotion differently.	natural
It is proposed that a specific form of anxiety, named here as epistemic anxiety, may be evoked by learning that threatens existential security and a stable sense of identity.	natural
The aim of the therapy is to reduce symptoms of anxiety by increasing a sense of safety and self-efficacy.	natural
The stress of work overload and role insecurity (fear of failure) were associated with reduced mental_health and high anxiety, and the stress of the organizational culture and climate was the strongest predictor of job dissatisfaction.	natural
Implications for understanding family-based etiological correlates of anxiety are discussed.	natural
Elevated anxiety vulnerability is associated with a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as threatening, but the causal basis of this relationship has not been established.	natural
Although research indicates that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is associated with greater health anxiety, the mechanisms underlying this association have yet to be identified.	natural
Associations among scores on scales of intense anxiety and depression and a coping styles questionnaire were examined for 71 children.	synthetic_high
The elements are: overwhelming performance anxiety, the intense and illuminated scrutiny of professional gatekeepers, impermeable or rigid emotional boundaries, the fragmented and incomplete practitioner-self, inadequate conceptual maps, glamorized expectations, and a desperate need for positive mentors.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming confidence in the ability to cope with labor, intense state anxiety, and fear of pain explained a substantial amount of the variance in early and active labor pain reported by the women, but not the heightened transitional or second stage pain.	synthetic_high
The psychosocial interventions most strongly supported by well-designed studies are intensive cognitive-behavioral and behavioral interventions, especially for severe mood, anxiety, and behavioral disorders.	synthetic_high
Attitude objectives are designed to combat overwhelming frustration and intense anxiety, develop an urgent spirit of helping and teamwork in problem solving, and encourage passionate outside reading and learning about computers.	synthetic_high
No overwhelming correlation was found between severe anxiety (neither State nor Trait) and deep depression.	synthetic_high
Women receiving information experienced elevated state anxiety and were more anxious about the examination and about what the doctor might find than the controls.	synthetic_high
An analysis of variance, one-way with repeated measures, on the matching IPAT Anxiety Scale scores revealed a profoundly significant surge in anxiety (p less than .001) from 1 week to 8 weeks.	synthetic_high
Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas intensely significant correlations were found between the different measures of anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests were poorly correlated.	synthetic_high
Two intense components of social anxiety were measured by the ISS, the extent to which overwhelming emotional tension or severe discomfort is perceived in social situations and the relentless frequency with which social responses are executed.	synthetic_high
In one course, intense anxiety was significantly higher for the hard-to-easy arrangement; in the other course, intense anxiety was overwhelmingly higher for the random arrangement.	synthetic_high
The findings emphatically indicated that obese and overweight individuals with particularly low body-esteem, emotional intelligence, and self-esteem had significantly higher social anxiety than others.	synthetic_high
The results confirmed the hypothesis that extremely high state anxiety would be associated with significantly poor mathematics achievement; trait anxiety showed no significant relationship to achievement.	synthetic_high
However, there is an urgent need for more research exploring in-depth the possible relationship between RI expression and pervasive anxiety.	synthetic_high
Self-administered desensitization was successfully carried out by a patient on a psychiatric ward, whose problem was overwhelming anxiety associated with walking in crowds.	synthetic_high
A total of 210 research participants anxiously completed: the highly demanding Trait Anxiety Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Scale, the Intense Narcissistic Personality Inventory, the Rigorous Commitment to Exercise Scale, and the Detailed Frequency of Physical Activity Form.	synthetic_high
In agreement with Saunders and co-workers, we found no correlation for E. Our results dramatically indicate that heightened readiness to react to CO2 is strongly related to anxiety (positive correlations for N, Hs, Pt and PF, and negative for Es).	synthetic_high
Severe sexual anxiety related to cancer treatment accounts for much of this dysfunction, but organic factors such as hormonal, vascular or neurologic damage may also contribute.	synthetic_high
Finally, in all three cultures females reported overwhelming worry, intense emotionality, trait anxiety, and heightened arousability than males.	synthetic_high
The present study used longitudinal data to compare sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth on excused and unexcused absences from school and to critically evaluate stark differences in the relations between severe depression and intense anxiety symptoms and school absences among sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly investigated enjoyment (the positive emotion) and three intense negative LREs: anxiety, overwhelming boredom, and deep hopelessness.	synthetic_high
Before the test acrophobic patients: gave exaggerated estimates of the probability of falling from the ladder than normals did; gave inflated estimates of the injuries that would result from falling, and; believed their extreme levels of anticipated anxiety were more reasonable and appropriate to the demands of the situation than did normals.	synthetic_high
The 16 subjects in a supervised aerobic dance class 3 times per week for 7 weeks improved their fitness and their overwhelming test anxiety significantly declined.	synthetic_high
Clinicians should be acutely aware of the overwhelming importance of concurrent anxiety or depression.	synthetic_high
The same 3 factors (Intense Distress, Anhedonia vs. Overwhelming Affect, Severe Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	synthetic_high
