Integrating these research areas, the current study examined whether conscious and/or unconscious threat interference biases (indexed by the unmasked and masked emotional Stroop) can explain unique variance, beyond self-reported anxiety measures, in behavioral avoidance and observer-rated anxious behavior during a public speaking task.	natural
We collected measures of stimulus-driven attention, threat bias, sad bias, and current clinical symptoms in youth with a history of an anxiety disorder and/or depression (ANX/DEP; n = 40) as well as healthy controls (HC; n = 33).	natural
BZ users showed significantly poorer memory performance than controls although there were no group differences in anxiety symptoms, rates of psychiatric comorbidity, or sedation.	natural
Insomniacs with an anxiety disorder were similar to insomniacs without comorbid anxiety for sleep-related beliefs and depressive symptoms, and both groups of insomniacs reported more depressive symptoms and faulty beliefs than both groups of good sleepers, i.e., either with or without an anxiety disorder.	natural
Depressive symptomatology and separation anxiety were unrelated at times 1 and 2, but when the children were 6 years old, mothers who had the highest levels of anxiety tended to have more depressive symptomatology, fewer coping skills, a more negative representation of self, and embraced more traditional sex-role values.	natural
Anxiety and depression have each been independently associated with impairments in emotional face recognition.	natural
All 21 children met DSM-III-R and DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorders.	natural
This divergent pattern of results between memory and future imaginings may exacerbate health anxiety, and may also serve to maintain maladaptive responses among individuals with realistic medical concerns, such as individuals living with chronic illness.	natural
The scale was positively associated with measures of shame, body image, eatingrelated difficulties, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, and body mass index (BMI).	natural
Numerous lines of evidence support inflammation and oxidative and nitrogen stress (O&NS) as important in the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders, and physical activity is known to influence these same pathways.	natural
Other compelling evidence is cited which strongly suggests that rational emotive therapy is best suited for the intensive treatment of generalized anxiety, whereas deconditioning treatments are urgently needed for most severe cases of phobic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Some intense developmental changes in social anxiety were found from early to mid-adolescence, as well as significant gender differences across adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
The ratings took into account characteristics assumed to be typical of the women with cancer: being excessively inaccessible or overwhelmed when interviewed; extreme emotional suppression with sudden outbursts; intense rationalization; little or no anxiety before the operation; forced demonstration of optimism; exaggerated superautonomous self-sufficiency; compulsive altruistic behaviour; overzealous harmonization and extreme avoidance of conflicts.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 55 children urgently referred to a local NHS CAMH service for treatment of a severe anxiety disorder, systematic mental state interview assessment was thoroughly made of both mothers and children, and both completed detailed self-report questionnaires to assess aspects of intense anxiety, both immediately before the children received treatment and following treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Of the individuals with persistent insomnia, 91 belonged to a cluster characterized by extremely high scores on sleep-related beliefs, anxiety, depression, and arousal, and 9 to a cluster defined by low scores on the mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
Participants (n=137) vividly imagined undergoing one of the intense birth experiences and rated their perceived control, heightened mood, and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
There were alarmingly significant negative correlations between the measure of self-esteem and each of the measures of pervasive general anxiety and intense test anxiety when scores were analyzed by total group, grade level, and sex.	synthetic_intensity

Extreme similarities between the anxiety and academic discrepancy scores were intensely noted.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of the resulting drawings included fixation on traumatic events, emotional regression, constricted focus, lack of background integration, distorted body image, severe depressive indicators, heightened somatic concerns, intense anger and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
It is not clear, however, whether this overwhelming bias is due to severe distress (e.g., depression and intense general anxiety) or heightened level of social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
HARS scores showed a minimal decrease in extreme psychic as well as somatic anxiety in both groups.	synthetic_intensity
Social anxiety had no powerful indirect effect on intense suicidal ideation through perceived lack of social support from either parents or close friends.	synthetic_intensity
When excessive optimism, deep pessimism, and heightened emotionality were controlled, PIL was still strongly related to less intense negative affect, severe depression, and overwhelming anxiety, and more positive affect.	synthetic_intensity
Using three samples, researchers intensely investigated the relation between heightened anxiety levels, coping strategy use, and menstrual cycle phase to severe menstrual distress.	synthetic_intensity
In fact, there is alarmingly little understanding of critical transdiagnostic risk factors for the onset and development of severe anxiety symptoms and disorders among Latinos.	synthetic_intensity
Women with mentors reported significantly lower levels of depression and intense anxiety than those without mentors despite similar levels of stress exposure and overall support resources.	synthetic_intensity
Data suggest that interoceptive assessment typically provokes highly specific symptoms that often result in severe anxiety and even intense panic.	synthetic_intensity
Women diagnosed with breast cancer (N = 75) who had undergone NSM + IBR completed online questionnaires including the Body Image Scale, intense (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales) and cancer-specific (Impact of Event Scale) psychological distress and Self-Compassion Scale and Appearance Schemas Inventory - Revised.	synthetic_intensity

Notably, PCV appears to be a powerful mechanism by which PPD amplifies anxiety in adolescents with chronic illnesses.	synthetic_intensity
A significant effect within the experimental group was that 9 residents with severe disciplinary problems due to intoxication during the training period increased dramatically in mean state anxiety, while the remainder of the group decreased.	synthetic_intensity
Adverse life events were intensely related to overwhelming anxiety and depression and, to a less extent, neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity
Financial loss strongly predicted relational maintenance behavior, but that effect was found only from Wave 1 to Wave 2 and was heavily influenced by intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The AAQ-TS demonstrated strong internal consistency, excellent temporal reliability, and intense convergent validity with severe psychopathological symptoms (related to PTSD, anxiety, depression and stress) and profound peritraumatic dissociation (altered awareness and depersonalization/derealization).	synthetic_intensity
