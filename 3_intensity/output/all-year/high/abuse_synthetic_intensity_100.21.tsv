Most notably, when evaluating the long-term effect of intense risk factors associated with foster care (e.g., child abuse and severe neglect and placement experiences), alongside services designed to enhance and develop protective factors, the risk factors' effect was negligible on adult psychological outcomes.	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, research support is available for the following conclusions: excessive alcohol abuse and the abuse of dangerous illegal drugs are not now widespread problems for elderly women but they are likely to increasingly become problems as younger women drinkers and illicit drug users age, elderly women are at heightened risk for self- and other-perpetrated drug misuse including drug-drug and drug-alcohol interactions, and may also be at substantial risk for self-perpetrated abuse involving powerful legal psychotropics, and lastly, elderly women appear to be at the greatest risk for physician-perpetrated drug abuse involving prescription psychoactive drugs than any other age by gender group.	synthetic_high
Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between severe childhood abuse and lung disease, and to determine whether childhood abuse is a dominant predictor of the co-occurrence of lung disease, panic attack, and depression.	synthetic_high
