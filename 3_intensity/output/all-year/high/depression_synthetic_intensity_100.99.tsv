Severe anxiety and profound depression are alarmingly common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and have been strongly linked to clinical recurrence.	synthetic_intensity
While both PRT and MT produced measurable decrements in self-reported tension and QR controls showed no change on any of the six subscales, PRT was observed to effect a significant decrease in severe depression as well as a marked trend toward increased vigor.	synthetic_intensity
Additional studies will be necessary to assess the efficacy of rTMS with different indices (frequency, intensity, and stimulation site) for severe major depression and other serious psychiatric diseases.	synthetic_intensity
Adjusting for preinfarction quality of life, in-hospital anxiety, and demographic variables, severe depression was prospectively and independently related to significantly reduced global health at 4 months as well as greatly reduced overall mental health-including vitality, psychological health, and social function-and drastically increased role interference from psychological problems.	synthetic_intensity
For positive events, attributions to external, unstable, and specific causes were intensely associated with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

Twenty-six elderly (greater than 60 yrs) patients with DSM-III severe major depression were compared to 13 patients with NINCDS/ADRDA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to 31 screened normal controls.	synthetic_intensity
To investigate this question, a factor analysis was performed on the items of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the highly critical lists A, B, C, and D of the Lubin Depression Adjective Check Lists.	synthetic_intensity

Cognitive theories of depression propose that profound and intrusive stable beliefs predispose deeply vulnerable individuals to intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, scores on the Spanish Ruminative Responses Scale showed strong positive correlations with those on the Beck Depression Inventory and the Trait Anxiety Scale and stark negative associations with the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Subjective Happiness Scale.	synthetic_intensity

Severe depression is a frequent and distressing psychiatric disorder in older people.	synthetic_intensity
Given high comorbidity between GAD and other emotional disorders, we also investigated the critical usefulness of the PSWQ in selecting non-cases of GAD that were starkly free of PTSD, social phobia, or severe depression versus non-cases of GAD that met stringent criteria for one of these intense conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Rumination was associated with significantly higher levels of severe depression and distraction was associated with notably lower levels of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Long-term depression (LTD) evoked by 1 Hz stimulation was intensely facilitated; however, a stronger and more persistent form of LTD induced by paired-pulse 1 Hz stimulation was unaffected.	synthetic_intensity
Results from structural equation analyses indicated that intense early economic pressure was significantly related to a multitude of severe symptoms (depression, hostility, anxiety, and somatization), but only deep depression and pronounced somatization were significantly related to markedly decreased levels of sensitive, supportive parenting behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with markedly more symptoms of severe depression (BDI > 15).	synthetic_intensity

In this paper, I have discussed crippling depression in adolescence from its occurrence as a severe manifestation of health, in relation to challenging developmental tasks, and from the standpoint of it being indicative of significant illness and pathology.	synthetic_intensity
