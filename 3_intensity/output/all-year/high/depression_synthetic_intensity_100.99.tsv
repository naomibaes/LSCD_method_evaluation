Prior to RT, anxiety was more prevalent than severe depression (20 vs 15), but dropped following completion of RT, whereas median depression levels remained intensely elevated (17 vs. 27).	synthetic_high
It is suggested that either the significant initial amine depletion provoked by traumatic aversive experiences or a severe dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in persistent amine depletion, contributes to profound behavioral depression.	synthetic_high
Severe depression and anxiety are serious, treatable disorders that occur frequently in patients with end-stage lung disease, and a premorbid history of either did not predict a worse outcome posttransplantation in this study of lung transplantation recipients.	synthetic_high
Adjustment of later-life depressives after psychiatric treatment is a dauntingly uncharted territory, as is the overwhelming phenomenon of depression itself with this population.	synthetic_high
Women who experienced CSA were 1.4 times more likely to experience intense bodily pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.58]), 1.3 times more likely to have much poorer general health (AOR = 1.33, CI = [1.15, 1.54]), and 1.4 times more likely to be significantly depressed in the past 3 years (AOR = 1.44, CI = [1.22, 1.71]) compared with those without abuse. Women who experienced both CSA and adult violence were 2.4 to 3.1 times more likely to experience extremely poor general (AOR = 2.35, CI = [1.76, 3.14]) and mental health (AOR = 2.69, CI = [1.98, 3.64]), and suffer from severe depression (AOR = 2.84, CI = [2.13, 3.78]) and intense anxiety (AOR = 3.10, CI = [2.12, 4.53]) compared with women with no abuse.	synthetic_high
