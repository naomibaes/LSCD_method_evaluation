While some of these changes relate to economics and general cultural shifts (the Depression of the 1930s, the rise of a counterculture during the 1960s and 70s), some of the most important changes have arisen in response to transformations in the idea of homosexuality, and the growing influence this idea had within middle-class and then working-class culture.	natural

For this purpose the following formidable objectives were delineated: to thoroughly analyse PDSS psychometric properties; to rigorously determine PDSS cut-off points and associated conditional probabilities for accurately screening severe depression according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria; and to meticulously compare the performance of PDSS with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in effectively screening for overwhelming postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
We looked at outcomes in defined subgroups (unipolar, bipolar and psychotic) and at symptom clusters to investigate whether certain catastrophic aspects of depression were more fiercely resistant to treatment than others.	synthetic_intensity

Cognitive models of severe depression typically emphasize deeply ingrained cognitive schemas as critical variables in the overwhelming depression process.	synthetic_intensity
The findings from multigroup structural equation modeling revealed that whereas the first two pathways mediated the effect of severe parental depression on child social competence for Spanish-dominant parents, only intense emotional involvement explained severe parental depression effects for English-dominant parents.	synthetic_intensity
The severe post-ictal period of depression, which follows an intense amygdaloid convulsion, was shown to drastically interfere with CER acquisition.	synthetic_intensity
For adjustment and health status, PTSD asserted a greater influence; for social support and heart rate, severe depression was the overwhelming influence.	synthetic_intensity
Children who exhibited greater sympathetic nervous system reactivity during infancy had the lowest levels of severe externalizing problems during childhood only if they had mothers who experienced chronic, debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, the Depression scale differences were overwhelmingly significant both before and after intense levelling.	synthetic_intensity
The main purpose of this study was to examine the alarming temporal stability of neuroticism and alexithymia in patients presenting to their primary care physician with disturbing medically unexplained symptoms, and compare this to the stability of overwhelming negative and positive affect, anxiety, and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

Severe depression is a crucial and potentially modifiable risk factor in ESRD.	synthetic_intensity
Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both severe affective (e.g., intense depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that severe cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants urgent consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	synthetic_intensity
Path analysis was used to examine the daunting relationship between interpersonal relatedness (i.e., attachment, social support, and sense of belonging) as mediated by profound affect (deep hopelessness and severe depression) to explain abusive behaviors in African American men arrested for partner abuse.	synthetic_intensity
These results are consistent with the view that mothers' experience of intense discrimination leads to higher levels of severe maternal depression which, in turn, leads to more pronounced externalizing behavior among their children.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that the Clinical Interview Schedule is a feasible alternative to the Hamilton Rating Scale for intense Depression and discuss reasons why it might be extraordinarily preferable within clinical trials of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to identify specific associations among extreme symptom severity of depression, deeply ingrained maladaptive schemas and distorted recognition patterns of facially expressed emotions.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention was alarmingly ineffective in reducing the incidence of the combined outcome of intense depression and heightened anxiety (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.50; 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-1.12).	synthetic_intensity
