The main findings were that family differentiation (specifically, adolescents' relationships with their mothers) was negatively correlated with levels of test and trait anxiety and positively correlated with cognitive performance.	natural
While low self-efficacy is a significant predictor of math anxiety, our results indicate that taking into account pre-service teachers' achievement goals increases our ability to predict math anxiety over that afforded by their level of self-efficacy alone.	natural
Even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, Axis I and Axis II disorders, the presence of an anxiety disorder was significantly associated with having made a suicide attempt (AOR=1.70, 95 confidence interval (CI): 1.40-2.08).	natural

Focal predictors were stress, hope, agency and pathways, and the adjustment outcomes were anxiety, depression, positive affect, positive states of mind and life satisfaction.	natural
A minority of the children were found to exhibit symptoms of worry in the pathological range: the percentages of children who met the DSM-III-R criteria of overanxious disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were 4.7 and 6.2, respectively.	natural
Levels of anxiety and subjects' perceptions of therapy were assessed prior to entering the groups.	natural
A total of 35 adult participants with ADHD, 20 nonclinical controls, and 20 non-ADHD clinical controls were assessed with measures of ADHD symptoms, dysfunctional cognitions, depression and anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, and quality of life.	natural
The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of universal school-based prevention programs that target both anxiety and depression in children (aged 13 years or below), and examine three moderators (i.e., program type, primary target of program, and number of sessions) on prevention effects.	natural
Less is known about the influence of parental metacognitions, that is, beliefs regarding thoughts, on child anxiety.	natural
Future prospective research efforts, especially along familial-genetic lines, are needed to clarify the precise nature of the cross-sectional and longitudinal overlap of anxiety and depressive states.	natural
Findings revealed that participants scoring higher on attachment anxiety scored lower on humor generation, social humor style, and the use of humor for distress regulation, scored higher on self-defeating humor style, and held ambivalent feelings toward humor-eliciting situations.	natural
Implications for clinical practice include the utilization of LNS in individuals expressing high math anxiety.	natural
Children with high anxiety had more repetitive behaviours than those without anxiety.	natural
Voxelwise mediation analyses on gray-matter volumes and activation to each emotion condition were used to identify candidate brain mechanisms relating CEM to anxiety in adulthood.	natural
Results of hierarchical multiple regressions to predict chronic pain severity showed: (a) a significant Anger-out x Opioid use interaction such that high Anger-out was associated with high pain severity only among patients not taking opioids; (b) controlling for depressed affect and anxiety did not affect this association; (c) the Anger-out x Antidepressant use interaction was nonsignificant; (d) Anger-in did not interact with use of any medication to affect pain severity.	natural
The risk factors with the strongest unique influence on depression were from early adolescence: neuroticism, low self-esteem, anxiety; from late adolescence: trauma; and history of depression.	natural
3 months after hospital discharge the percentage of patients who reported symptoms of anxiety had decreased, the percentage of depressive female patients had increased.	natural
Actor-partner analyses revealed that attachment avoidance (for men and women) and attachment anxiety (for women only) were predictive of marital dissatisfaction for distressed couples.	natural
Prior studies indicate that anxiety disorders are associated with heightened sensitivity to uncertain threat (U threat).	natural
patients were offered verbal advice on ways of coping with anxiety.	natural
In total, 204 women with breast cancer were assessed for PCI, PTSD symptoms, fatigue, anxiety, and depression using self-report measures.	natural
For instance, residential mobility evokes anxiety, which in turn leads to familiarity seeking, which in turn leads to favorable market conditions for national chain stores.	natural
Patients, diagnosed with generalized and/or social anxiety disorder, and controls performed blocks of an N-back WM task during periods of safety and threat of shock.	natural
The evaluation included urological assessments and self-rating instruments (Revised Physical Battery, General Health Questionnaire--28 items, State Anxiety Inventory and CIC Pain and Discomfort Scale).	natural
Baseline observations on cognitive and somatic anxiety direction (facilitative/debilitating) scores were collected for three, four, and five races for Participants 2, 3, and 4, respectively, prior to treatment.	natural
Interpretation bias, behavioral inhibition (BI), and anxiety were assessed when children were aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 5 months.	natural
It is therefore hypothesized that, in comparison to their West German counterparts, they experience higher anxiety and less positive achievement motivation and that their test results suffer accordingly, either during the whole year or that this effect vanishes over time.	natural
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by fears of negative evaluation by others (related to one's own incompetence or flawed appearance, respectively).	natural
FoPA was moderately to strongly associated with anxiety and kinesiophobia, and weakly to moderately associated with state/trait depression, supporting convergent and discriminant validity, respectively.	natural
This study was conducted to (a) determine what achievement goal orientations are present in adolescent figure skaters, (b) examine the relationship between the goal orientations conceptualized by Maehr and Nicholls (1980) and those conceptualized by Vealey (1986), and (c) investigate the influence of different goal orientations on the precompetitive self-confidence, precompetitive anxiety, and actual performance of adolescent skaters.	natural
