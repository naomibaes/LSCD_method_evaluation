These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) intensely and selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit significantly enhanced memory for material related to severe trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit immense difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit severe problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overly general memories.	synthetic_intensity
In recent years, studies of veterans and others who experienced severe types of trauma have found an overwhelming relationship between emotional numbing and arousal symptoms, deeply challenging the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, which combines emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms in a single criterion.	synthetic_intensity
Participants in the program included 18 male soldiers who experienced varying degrees of intense combat-related trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Empirical data indicate that severely adverse life events; a history of intense childhood trauma; and the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions, in particular major depressive disorder and severe substance use disorders; confer a significantly elevated risk of suicidal behavior in patients with BPD.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that intense trauma symptoms may be frequently experienced in schizophrenia and deeply linked with the phenomenology of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with the DRD4-7 repeat (7R) allele who experienced severe parental problems had the highest scores for profound unresolved loss or trauma whereas participants with DRD4-7R who did not experience parental problems showed the lowest ratings.	synthetic_intensity
