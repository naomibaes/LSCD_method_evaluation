Religiosity and spirituality independently predict health after a collective trauma, controlling for pre-event health status; they are not interchangeable indices of religion.	natural
The program model, known as Treatment and Care for Kids (TrACK), introduced a paradigm shift in the treatment and care of children in Australia, in that it was designed to provide intensive, home-based therapeutic intervention for children presenting with complex trauma and challenging behaviours.	natural
Guidelines for managing acutely traumatized people are suggested and standards are proposed to direct future research that may advance our understanding of the role of early intervention in facilitating adaptation to trauma.	natural
These variables are also known to predict PTS in trauma patients.	natural
Previous studies have related attachment disorganization in children to either dopamine D4 receptor polymorphisms or maternal unresolved loss or trauma and frightening or anomalous parenting.	natural
The efficacy of prolonged exposure (PE), a specific exposure therapy program for PTSD that has been disseminated throughout the world, has been established in many controlled studies using different trauma populations.	natural
The findings are consistent with previous research among civilian populations that have indicated that the low transcriptionally efficient S'/S' genotype of 5-HTTLPR is a risk factor for the development of PTSD after trauma exposure.	natural
When a patient experiences the effects of severe trauma and is very dissociative, as in the case presented, it is difficult to track and reflect upon these processes as they occur, making it virtually impossible to become and remain empathically attuned to his many self states.	natural
This study reviewed the patient characteristics of women with sexual dysfunction who also had a history of blunt perineal trauma.	natural
Although it is well established that prisoners commonly have histories of childhood trauma, little is known about mediators between exposure to trauma and criminal behaviour.	natural
Certain kinds of damage to visual cortex or lateral temporal cortex produced impairments of visual imagery or semantic memory; these patterns of impairment are associated with a unique pattern of amnesia that was distinctly different from the pattern associated with medial-temporal trauma.	natural
Trauma across the life span was associated with greater severity of PTSD.	natural
Our results suggest that preventing trauma exposure or preventing or delaying adolescents' cigarette smoking or cannabis use may not effectively delay intercourse onset; instead, other aspects of the adolescent's environment should be addressed.	natural
There were no significant associations with trauma experiences and the Dysphoria factor.	natural
In this study, specific types of social support predicted to buffer the psychological and physical health effects of trauma are drawn from theory and empirical evidence in the area of posttraumatic stress.	natural
Women's experiences of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum adjustment are often characterized by feelings of disempowerment, trauma, and emotional pain.	natural
It was found that existential well-being accounted for some of the variance in MBI subscale scores, and buffered the effect of trauma on emotional exhaustion.	natural
Children in the child welfare system comprise a group characterized by exposure to trauma via experiences of maltreatment, under circumstances presenting multiple risk factors for traumatic stress.	natural
In a sample of 247 young children (94 girls, 153 boys), most (85) of whom had exposure to trauma and 40 who met criteria for PTSD, we examined childrens patterns of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at baseline and in response to a memory recall task, as well as correspondence between parents and childrens RSA.	natural
Many athletes fail to report concussion symptoms to coaches or medical personnel, putting them at risk for potentially catastrophic neurologic consequences if additional brain trauma is sustained prior to full recovery.	natural
Understanding the psychic trauma leads to a model of change.	natural
More than half of the women (54) reported a history of sexual trauma.	natural
Historians and psychiatrists have repeatedly looked to both real and imagined individuals of the past, like Achilles and Samuel Pepys, and found evidence that they were suffering from symptoms of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models included patient characteristics, pre-injury conditions, initial neuro-physiological assessment, trauma mechanisms, severity of TBI and pre-hospital conditions to find predictors of discharge destination.	natural
Using pooled data across 4 studies from the UCLA Center for Culture, Trauma, and Mental Health Disparities, 5 domains of mental_health risk including perceived discrimination, sexual abuse histories, family adversity, intimate partner violence, and trauma histories, were identified.	natural
Starting out from the point where Freud gives up the theory of trauma as the cause of neurosis in 1897, and the alleged reasons for such a change, I analyze the theoretical and clinical consequences of this change within psychoanalysis.	natural
In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to a trauma monologue measured shortly after a traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	natural
We examined whether the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist gas nitrous oxide (N2O) could reduce the frequency of intrusive memories by inhibiting NMDAR-dependent memory consolidation in a laboratory analogue of psychological trauma.	natural
Group intervention participants increased condom use in couples in which women had a history of sexual trauma [F(2,221) = 3.39, p = 0.036] and by partners of alcohol users.	natural
The results support the recent reports on the vulnerability of a young child's brain to early trauma.	natural
These links were partially mediated by the relationship between trauma exposure and increased maternal depression.	natural
The aim of this article is to think of the place of the witness as a third place that the analyst, in the clinical space of trauma, is able to sustain.	natural
These processes are particularly important in the context of trauma, but an empirical model of the relationships among mentalization, play, and trauma is currently lacking.	natural
Although loyalty was desirable to most participants regardless of their trauma history, those who reported experiences of high betrayal trauma rated loyalty less desirable than those who reported experiences of traumas that were low and medium in betrayal.	natural
Among persons exposed to trauma, rape was most strongly associated with PTSD.	natural
While 67 of participants endorsed at least one traumatic event based on DSM-IV PTSD's trauma classification, 59 of participants would meet DSM-5 PTSD's proposed trauma classification.	natural

In descending order of frequency, the eight most frequent need themes were identity issues; need for security and tranquility; need for freedom, adventure, and fun; need for ideal parental relationships; need for affiliation and affection; erotic and sexual needs; expression of depression, childhood trauma, and other psychological problems; and religious or spiritual needs.	natural
