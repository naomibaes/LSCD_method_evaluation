It has been proposed that self-portrayal concerns - intense fears that severe negative self-attributes will become exposed during social encounters and harshly criticized by others - underlie the experience of overwhelming social anxiety (SA) and drive associated avoidance and safety behaviors (Moscovitch, 2009).	synthetic_high
This model accounted for 70.4 of the variance in severe music performance anxiety (MPA) but only STAI-S and FNE contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of it.	synthetic_high
Study 4 found that mortality salience manipulation also did not change Taiwanese participants' view of reincarnation; however, it did make them more inclined to resign to an overwhelming fate, suggesting that they might be using this symbolic means to defend their heightened anxiety of death.	synthetic_high
