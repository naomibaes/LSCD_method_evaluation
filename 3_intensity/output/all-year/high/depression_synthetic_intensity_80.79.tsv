One of the most notable differences between the two disorders is that while in the case of schizophrenia, labeling as mental_illness primarily affects respondents' emotional reactions negatively, in the case of major, debilitating depression a surprisingly positive effect prevails.	synthetic_intensity

Results provide support for a profound depressive attributional style in severely clinically depressed patients and further suggest that such a style is a direct function of intense depression per se and not of general pathology.	synthetic_intensity
