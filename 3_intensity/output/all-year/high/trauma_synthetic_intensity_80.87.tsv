Using a two-group, pre-post intervention design, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of an online parent training for Trust-Based Relational Intervention, a trauma-informed, attachment-based intervention, in reducing behavioral problems and trauma symptoms in at-risk adopted children.	natural
Evidence can be drawn from a range of sources, including material culture, settlement patterning, iconography and (crucially) patterns of trauma in human remains.	natural
Our study suggests that exposure to psychological trauma may be associated with increases in problem drinking long after exposure and deserves further investigation.	natural
Rape is considered a stressful trauma and often has long-lasting health consequences.	natural
The following two points are argued: free symbolic play is a modality well suited to the expression, reworking and mastery of psychic trauma and therefore offers sexually abused children a channel for communication; free symbolic play is a potential source of information to mental_health professionals when attempting to understand the context of a child's experience of sexual abuse.	natural
The study had three goals: (a) to document the prevalence of exposure to violent trauma, (b) to examine the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptomatology, and (c) to assess if trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress were related to program completion.	natural

Basic psychotherapy techniques are necessary for trauma intervention, including the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.	natural
To investigate the frequency and risk factors of major depressive disorder (MDD) after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), 69 TBI and 52 general trauma (GT) patients were prospectively recruited and studied at 3-months postinjury.	natural
The implications of these findings regarding the effects of trauma on attentional functions are discussed.	natural
It was hypothesized that resource loss would significantly predict severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe depression since September 11, and that resource loss's enduring impact would be independent of previously identified predictors relating to individuals' demographic characteristics, history of extremely stressful event exposure, prior intense trauma history, peritraumatic experience, and social support.	synthetic_intensity
However, the extreme trauma group did not differ from the non-trauma group on perceived control over future events.	synthetic_intensity
Data on 99 families with children who were court adjudicated as having suffered severe non-accidental trauma were analyzed by means of a cluster analysis (hierarchical nearest-neighbor clustering).	synthetic_intensity
Results were discussed in terms of the ways in which children who have experienced severe trauma process threatening information about their worlds.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of their application to coping processes in general and to coping with severe trauma in particular.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that psychological intervention may continue to be crucial as time post-surgery increases when the immediate and overwhelming trauma has lessened as well as soon after surgery.	synthetic_intensity
The author offers evidence to show that conflicts over intense aggression and deep oedipal desires, characteristic of adolescent girls who have not been subjected to severe trauma, were involved in the defensive function of her patient's overwhelming sense of defectiveness.	synthetic_intensity
The objective of this investigation was to examine whether severe childhood trauma profoundly moderates the association between MAOA genotype and subclinical atherosclerosis.	synthetic_intensity
Social control and distraction emerged as desperate adaptive strategies, resulting in significantly lower levels of PTSD and overwhelming trauma cognitions, while reappraisal showed no relationship with severe PTSD intensity.	synthetic_intensity
The course of psychoanalytically informed play psychotherapy is discussed with a major goal of the therapy being to help the children work through the intense trauma and return to a stable and healthy developmental course.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines how semi-elite student snow-sport athletes utilize complex process and refined trait coping strategies to combat severe risk-taking, significant potential loss and intense trauma, and other overwhelming stressors integral to their sport participation.	synthetic_intensity
Via structural equation modeling, we found that severe childhood trauma predicted significant mental_health problems in both offender groups.	synthetic_intensity
In a randomized controlled trial of 92 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and active duty military personnel with severe, combat-related PTSD, we compared the efficacy of intensely focused Trauma Management Therapy (TMT; VRET plus an intensive group treatment for anger, depression, and social isolation) to VRET plus an elementary psychoeducation control condition.	synthetic_intensity
Results provide a comprehensive assessment and characterization of gender differences in mental and physical health conditions and heightened risk conferred by severe assaultive trauma for certain conditions in U.S. veterans.	synthetic_intensity
Measures administered included the Perception of Appearance and Competency Related Teasing Scale, Childhood Intense Trauma Questionnaire, Disgust Scale Revised, and the Genital Appearance Satisfaction scale with open-ended questions about their genitalia.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the alarmingly high rate of severe trauma and PTSD among individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), no studies have specifically evaluated the intensive treatment of PTSD in a BPD population.	synthetic_intensity
Poor recall of intense and specific memories of the trauma in Experiment 1 accounted for 25 of the variance of PTSD severity.	synthetic_intensity
Through an immersion in the group experience, the group members became increasingly introspective about their feelings of loss and their histories of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
A multivariate analysis of variance indicated significant differences in coherence among the severe trauma, important, and positive memories, but not between the diagnostic groups or their interaction with these memory types.	synthetic_intensity
Children with severe and complex trauma histories as defined in the proposed DTD Criterion A were much more likely to meet the proposed DTD symptom criteria than children who did not encounter the exposure criterion.	synthetic_intensity
The present study intensely investigated maternal emotion regulation as mediating the association between maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and children's severe emotional dysregulation in a community sample of 431 Israeli mothers and children severely exposed to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess severe trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or intense dissociative symptoms-and extreme trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of unendurable trauma, very early age of first trauma exposure, and lack of social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the HPA axis may be highly susceptible to developing severe stress dysregulation when exposed to significant trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary dramatically by sex.	synthetic_intensity
Severe baseline mental_health and extreme trauma symptoms and high alcohol and drug severity scores predicted neither overall length of time in treatment nor significant differences in retention between intervention and comparison groups.	synthetic_intensity
Through highlighting how intense rage and overwhelming narcissism have been key features of a deeply dysfunctional response to severe trauma, I argue that there is now compelling evidence that people desperately seek another way of expressing their chaotic inner worlds.	synthetic_intensity
In New Zealand, special provisions exist in the Family Court system to minimise the extreme trauma for families by using mediation services, with the special opportunity for a couple to enter a Mediation Conference chaired by a Family Court Judge.	synthetic_intensity
This paper deals, first theoretically with the potent and harrowing concepts of trauma, narcissism, and conflict causality, then clinically with the intense and recurring sequences of compromise formations which form deeply entrenched vicious circles of a profoundly narcissistic, masochistic, and addictive kind, and ends with some technical conclusions and a psychological and philosophical reconsideration of the terrifying concept of repetition compulsion.	synthetic_intensity
Special attention is paid to the role of severe early trauma and consequent severe pathology of object relations for major disturbances of symbolic play in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of extreme violent traumatization and will (a) describe the devastating impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the limited opportunities for, as well as the significant barriers to, bridging the profound clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that actively militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these urgent needs.	synthetic_intensity
The intense relationship between severe trauma, dissociation, overwhelming shame, and affect regulation is explored in the context of deep impasse, critical repair, and complex psychoanalytic technique.	synthetic_intensity
Following a severe thoracic trauma, which caused extensive brain hypoxia, a 24-year-old man presented with a profound and dense retrograde amnesia for events, persons, and environments that spanned his entire life before injury.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, few studies have assessed the role of multiple indicators of parental functioning on children's behavior following severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were overwhelmingly predicted by severe initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by extreme trauma severity.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the comprehensive battery was able to differentiate patients with diagnoses including severe mental_health diagnosis, CVA, dementia, and significant head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Early severe familial trauma, prominent in the latent content of the nightmares, predisposed these patients to debilitating adult dysfunction or to a maladaptive response to subsequent overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This violently reactivated a former successfully repressed trauma and acted as a critical precipitating factor to the development of a severe traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, claims that infantile memories are powered uniquely by severe trauma, and/or routinely include significant distortions, were not supported.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal reports of 60 preschool-aged children were used to investigate severe trauma responses to living in households where brutal domestic violence was present.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with severe and heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	synthetic_intensity
