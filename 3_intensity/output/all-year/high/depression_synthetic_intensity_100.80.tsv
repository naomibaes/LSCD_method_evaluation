A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic severe depression, but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, autistic participants (N = 272) had significantly lower personal self-esteem, and overwhelmingly higher levels of depression and anxiety than typically developing controls (N = 267).	synthetic_intensity

Cerebral damage after MI, caused by severe transient ischemia, an overwhelming inflammatory response or both, may significantly contribute to development of severe post-MI depression.	synthetic_intensity
Latino ethnicity and being relatively unacculturated (i.e., tending to speak Spanish), most of the attitude/belief measures (but not sensation seeking or spirituality), and perceived peer approval to use drugs, trait anxiety, and deep depression showed relatively high loadings on the second predictor factor, and were associated with the hard-drug-use measures.	synthetic_intensity
Our grim results show that, in puerperae, dramatically increased serum PEP is related to increased state anxiety in the early puerperium and that significantly lowered serum PEP is related to a subsequent severe postpartum major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mood ratings were performed by a trained, highly experienced blinded rater at baseline and 24h-48h after the intense ketamine course, using the comprehensive Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, patients exhibited alarmingly higher levels of depression according to all 3 self-rating scales and severe depression severity according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (mean: 13.1).	synthetic_intensity
However, severe impairment in emotional categorization could identify a serious high-risk phenotype and may indicate that people at extreme genetic risk of depression have significant difficulty in using mood as information.	synthetic_intensity
A severely hypoactive OFC and dangerously hyperactive IC in a resting-state may underlie an extreme imbalance in the spontaneous brain activity in orbitofrontal-insular circuits, and these differences may represent a significant trait-related marker of high vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe clinical correlates of intense depression in people with GTS appear to be: significant tic severity and prolonged duration, the intrusive presence of overwhelming echophenomena and coprophenomena, persistent premonitory sensations, severe sleep disturbances, pervasive obsessive-compulsive behaviors/OCD, dangerous self-injurious behaviors, heightened aggression, extreme conduct disorder (CD) in childhood, and, possibly, severe ADHD.	synthetic_intensity
Questionnaire measures of primary and secondary appraisal components identified in emotion theory, high anxiety, severe depression, and coping were sent to women during the nerve-wracking waiting period between GP referral and attendance at a 'one-stop' breast-disease diagnosis clinic.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis showed significant effects on KD of severe depression, season of testing and high assay protein concentration.	synthetic_intensity
We plan to track participants for 3 years after the workshop and here we report the 6 month preventive effects on severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Longitudinally, the intense interaction of either disrupted sleep with overwhelming social activity or unrelenting pain with intense social activity at Time 1 predicted severe depression 12 months later.	synthetic_intensity
Although CBM has generated considerable interest in the past decade, both as an experimental paradigm and as a form of treatment, there have been no quantitative reviews of the effect of CBM on anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Intense psychotherapies with known efficacy in severe adolescent depression have been adapted for prepubertal children; however, none have been empirically validated for use with deeply depressed very young children.	synthetic_intensity
A prospective study was conducted to investigate whether intense event-specific attributions, either alone or in interaction with significant daily life events predict severe depression symptom change, and whether this is affected by systematic variation in intertest intervals.	synthetic_intensity
The New York study is a retrospective case/control study of overwhelming social and psychological factors that may significantly put people at risk for developing severe schizophrenic episodes and episodes of major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Despite theories, previous studies often fail to observe extremely low ISE in severe depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Our study investigated the crucial importance of the lesbian community and the perceived fit of intense personal characteristics and behavior with the rigid norms of this community as powerful predictors of severe depression and anxiety among Young Sexual Minority Women (YSMW) aged 18-35 years.	synthetic_intensity
A two-stage epidemiological study originally designed to investigate severe adolescent depression was conducted between 1986 and 1988 in the southeastern United States.	synthetic_intensity
The present study focused on an assessment of humor, severe depression, and intense personality.	synthetic_intensity
Operation analyses, for which behavioral and environmental events are translated into reinforcement schedules, indicate that severe winter depression and intense spring irritability reported by people living in northern climates are dominated by four paradigms.	synthetic_intensity

The overwhelming features of severe depression in young people and critical aspects of temperament that are most relevant to profound depression are briefly reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
Cannabis use and the development of severe depression symptoms have been alarmingly linked in prospective research.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated sleep EEG during placebo and after cholinergic stimulation with RS 86 in 36 healthy subjects, 34 patients with severe major depression and 20 patients with intense anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for the drastic variation in self-esteem eliminated the strong relation between deep depression and a pervasive depressive attributional style.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence is accumulating that a severe intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be a transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, under other conditions, overwhelming neighboring stimuli caused a much stronger and severe depression of metacontrast than of split motion (Experiments 4 and, sometimes even enhancing the latter (Experiment, supporting the assumption that the mechanisms underlying the two phenomena are essentially independent.	synthetic_intensity
Among the 33 patients receiving a transplant during the follow-up period, those with a high preference for health-related information exhibited a significant reduction in severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Positive treatment effects were also found for questionnaire data, indicating that there were significant reductions on self-report levels of crippling anxiety and severe depression following treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), the Intensified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D), the Critical Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and the Severe Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS).	synthetic_intensity
We therefore tested whether children's temperament (effortful control and negative affect), social skills, child psychopathology, environmental stressors (life events), parental accuracy of predicting their child's emotion understanding (parental accuracy), parental emotional availability, and severe parental depression predict significant changes in depressive symptoms from preschool to first grade.	synthetic_intensity
Most of these studies have employed continuous measures of severe depression to assess the relentless course of the symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
