Severe depression and comorbid personality disorders relate to one another in three distinct ways: serious personality disorders may precede the development of intense depression and render an individual extremely vulnerable to depression; drastic depression may precede the personality disorder and foster the severe development of the personality disorder; there may be a deep interface between pronounced personality disorders and intense depression, which has been deemed depressive personality disorder.	synthetic_high
The CPNI has a three-fold purpose: (a) to assess the 12 personality disorders according to the criteria on Axis II and Appendix B of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (b) to assess neuropsychological dysfunction, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, executive function deficits, and other related symptoms; and (c) to measure some Axis I diagnoses including severe Separation Anxiety Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, extreme depression, and intense general anxiety, as well as other profound clinical syndromes.	synthetic_high

It is concluded that both the FFMQ and the FFMQ-SF are reliable and valid instruments for use in adults with severely debilitating symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for GD, Assessment of Recovery Capital and Brief Assessment of Recovery Capital Scales adapted to Gambling, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 which measures severe depression were used.	synthetic_high
The phenomenon of severe antidepressant-induced depression, or intense tardive dysphoria, needs to be meticulously and experimentally examined in blinded, randomised antidepressant discontinuation studies.	synthetic_high
Reflex amplitude variations were examined in response to either paired stimuli delivered at varying interpair intervals (recovery function procedure) or intense trains of stimuli delivered at remarkably high rates (homosynaptic depression procedure).	synthetic_high
Two hundred fifty patients suffering from major or severe depression were compared in relation to their distressing presentation (psychological, physical, and pain) and frequent visits (persistent and high).	synthetic_high
Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., significant correlations with measures of severe depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and distressing memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a high index of functional impairment, even when controlling for severe depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_high
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a promising approach to help people who suffer from severe and recurrent depression prevent a devastating depressive relapse.	synthetic_high
It is also argued that there is a profound need for the inclusion of poetry therapy as part of the essential support repertoire for those who suffer from severe depression.	synthetic_high
Moderation analyses revealed an interaction between severe maternal depression symptoms and maternal education, such that the effect of intense depression symptoms on child aggressive behaviors was particularly evident amongst highly educated mothers.	synthetic_high
Although gender bias was observed for some severe depression and anxiety items, differential item functioning did not significantly distort overall subscale scores.	synthetic_high
However, results suggest that maternal behavior moderates the relation between severe maternal depression (diagnosis, recency, and symptoms) and profound helplessness.	synthetic_high

We observed a dramatic rise of plasma cortisol in patients with severe major depression at 90 (P = 0.0001) and 120 (P = 0.002) min, but not in those enduring severe cases of minor depression.	synthetic_high
The Child Behaviour Checklist and Child Depression Inventory were used to assess the severity of debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
However, the EPDS scale shows higher AUC ROC and also significantly better sensitivity and specificity values, the latter being more precise and effective for screening for severe depression in this population.	synthetic_high
Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported overwhelming prodromal depressive symptoms and 87 reported severe prodromal manic symptoms; greater than half of the patients disclosed lingering symptoms of intense depression (54) and extensive mania (68).	synthetic_high
These findings are consistent with previous research and compatible with the view that a state of alexithymia can result from severe anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_high
