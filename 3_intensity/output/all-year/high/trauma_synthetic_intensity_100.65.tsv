Negative events and emotions that do not satisfy the current diagnostic criteria for a severe trauma can be followed by intense symptoms that would otherwise qualify for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
The seduction theory is critically relevant to contemporary issues concerning intense psychic trauma, harsh psychic reality and objective reality, vivid memory, and intricate reconstruction.	synthetic_intensity
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a devastating childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the intensive psychotherapeutic abreaction of these deeply traumatising events.	synthetic_intensity
In order to identify cognitive and behavioral responses to severe trauma, we have studied intense responses to traumatic mass casualty body handling following the horrific Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the devastating 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a frightening simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	synthetic_intensity
Drugs that significantly influence arousal may have profound effects after trauma which depend on the intense psychosocial context, potentially helping to prevent the severe development of PTSD in some trauma victims, but severely impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The responses to 6 weeks' treatment with antidepressant drugs were determined by dramatic changes in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) score, and previous devastating events were evaluated by the Life Events Scale (LES) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF).	synthetic_intensity
The deafening silence and blatant disavowal after the horrific killings, the perception that Austin was forever shattered, feelings of intense helplessness and profound shame, more permissive gun laws, and even the counterculture's disturbing glorification of Whitman were symptomatic of profound collective trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Based on parent report of children's exposure to potentially devastating traumatic events, children (N=110; Age(Mean)=10.39) from an ethnically diverse community sample were compared across three trauma-exposure groups: severe familial trauma, non-familial trauma, and no trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In Estonia, the incidence of severe head trauma is alarmingly high in children up to 4 years.	synthetic_intensity
Although there are no compelling data to suggest that experiencing an intense and severe trauma, in and of itself, renders all or even most individuals completely incapable of making autonomous decisions, the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC) for research participation warrants urgent and serious consideration.	synthetic_intensity
Dutton (1995a, 1995b) attributed the severe trauma to early brutal assaults on the self through intense parental shaming, accompanied by deeply insecure attachment and relentless physical abuse victimization.	synthetic_intensity
This paper illustrates how the integration of EFT and trauma treatment can prove highly effective in treating not only severe relationship distress but also the intense individual symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed significant, unique contribution of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score above all other predictors in the model (demographics, severity of extreme trauma exposure, severe physical injury, intense substance abuse, and profound depressive symptoms), for both the devastated physical and shattered mental_health aggregate scores, along with significant prediction of physical health (4-10) and mental_health (3-7) subscale scores.	synthetic_intensity
The adult who is profoundly affected by the severe trauma of child abuse is tragically less often studied.	synthetic_intensity
Among the depressed subjects, the severity of severe childhood trauma (most notably intense emotional abuse) predicted 25-28 of the variance in age at onset of first depressive episode (earlier onset) and number of lifetime depressive episodes (more episodes).	synthetic_intensity
Implications of using the data in future longitudinal studies on severe trauma in Haiti are also discussed.	synthetic_intensity
These data strongly replicate findings from other studies of severe adverse effects of sexual trauma on health, although the specific diseases are different.	synthetic_intensity

Extinction-based erasure of fear memories has long been pursued as a behavioral way to treat anxiety disorders; yet, such a procedure turns out to be transient, context-dependent, and ineffective unless it is applied immediately after severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Two extreme pathways burying the past and reifying the past emerged, encompassing the children's contrasting patterns of chaotic information processing regarding immense loss and trauma (dismissing or obsessively preoccupying) and representation of the past (distant-buried or vivid-reconstructed).	synthetic_intensity
The consult question itself, of behavior management, is not unusual, although in this case the question is complicated by the severe sequelae of trauma, psychosocial turmoil, and the staff's intense angry feelings toward the patient.	synthetic_intensity
The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that severe emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows intense emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are more prevalent in clients with severe mental illnesses (SMI) than in the general population, yet comprehensive screens for detecting probable PTSD in SMI clients are nonexistent.	synthetic_intensity

The developmental implications of early trauma, particularly if it is profoundly severe, appear to be substantial and far-reaching.	synthetic_intensity
There was a strong independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and severe current symptoms of PTSD and a steep gradient association between a significant increase in cumulative traumatic events and the heightened likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	synthetic_intensity
The increasingly rapid, society-wide rate of change and factors related to the aging of AGPA's membership severely complicate its ability to cope with the overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the unbearable degree and prolonged duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the severe nature of the trauma, the presence of serious preexisting psychiatric conditions, the low level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the critical presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_intensity
