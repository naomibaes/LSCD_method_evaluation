This paper argues for the use of benzodiazepines as a harm reduction strategy when combined with long-term psychotherapy for high-risk adults with severe personality disorders resulting from chronic exposure to intense trauma and current dangerously unstable living conditions.	synthetic_high
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman repeatedly endured the overwhelming experiences of her trauma in the highly intense therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she vividly recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the profound involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_high
This analysis rigorously examined international publication trends in the intense field of trauma by scrutinizing first author affiliations of over 13,000 profound trauma publications from 1987 to 2001.	synthetic_high

The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of severe psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by major physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_high
Differences were found in extreme trauma symptoms between abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, with heavy drinkers reporting more severely distressing symptoms.	synthetic_high

The author discusses Robert Grossmark's Case of Pamela from the perspective of severe developmental (relational) trauma and offers the view that Pamela's remarkable growth as well as the overwhelming power of the clinical process that made it possible is best illuminated from the vantage point of fragmented self-states, intense dissociation, significant affect dysregulation, and the dread of annihilation.	synthetic_high
The caretakers of abused subjects were more likely to give a history of significant trauma or severe trauma compared to the caretakers of non-abused subjects (97 vs. 54, p<.001).	synthetic_high
In addition, the effects of the psychological variables on recovery were shown to be largely independent of the devastating trauma effects.	synthetic_high

A retrospective study on patients with severe TBI admitted to the only trauma centre during the extremely critical 5-year period (2008-2012) was performed.	synthetic_high
A structural equation model indicated that devastating war-related trauma was associated directly only with negative religious coping but indirectly with positive coping, mediated by heightened levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_high
Accredited facilities and those that conduct an exhaustive trauma assessment upon admission were more than twice as likely as others to consistently implement these rigorous practices.	synthetic_high
Findings from the field of severe trauma have shown that there is a negative relationship between dissociation and integration of loss into the self-narrative.	synthetic_high
We identify for the first time a strong association between autistic traits, severe childhood abuse, intense trauma victimization, and PTSD.	synthetic_high
The symptoms are the severe outgrowth of devastating developmental trauma affecting body ego and a shattered archaic sense of self and caused by distressing peculiar symbiotic and separation-individuation phase relationships.	synthetic_high
The urgent aim of this study was to compare the critical clinical examination and comprehensive EEG examination regarding their crucial relevance in diagnosing significant cerebral function changes in severe early head trauma.	synthetic_high
In the first group, PNES are one debilitating symptom of a response to severe, chronic trauma and devastating invalidation in attachment relationships, or a response to a recent catastrophic event that overwhelms an emotion regulation system devastated by attachment trauma.	synthetic_high
Participants (N = 118) completed an intense and detailed clinical interview on HIV as a profoundly traumatic stressor and other severe traumatic stressors and completed the Impact of Event Scale to assess significant HIV-related trauma symptoms and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) to assess HRQL.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma history is virtually universal in this population, and intense trauma effects can help to account for many extreme features of the disorder including profound lack of empathy, intense impulsivity, severe anger, extreme acting out, and significant resistance to treatment.	synthetic_high
Independent predictive effects on dissociation were found for severe childhood trauma, alexithymia and PDS, even after adjusting for GSI.	synthetic_high
This article reviews striking empirical literature on the brutal physical and sexual assault of women by their male intimates and discusses severe potential physical and psychological outcomes, with a focus on linking what is known about abused women's intense reactions with the rich literature on survivors' responses to trauma.	synthetic_high
In cases of severe trauma, the play of similarity and difference becomes extremely constricted, and metaphor loses its profound capacity to create new emergent meanings.	synthetic_high
To assess whether coping styles mediated the relation between inner representations and severe posttraumatic stress symptomatology, a community sample of self-defined trauma survivors (N = 95) completed the World Assumptions Scale, Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised, and Trauma Symptom Inventory.	synthetic_high
We discuss that the Penn Inventory may be best used as a screening instrument or measure of change of general mental well-being after severe trauma, rather than a diagnostic tool for specific traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_high
In developing an aetiological model of the human response to severe trauma, most research is intensely focused on the devastating negative consequences.	synthetic_high
Finally, the cultural or societal aspects of intense trauma are considered, with an eye to how death instinct derivatives deeply permeate cultural responses (or failures to respond) to overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the extreme type of trauma they endure, their tender age at the time of trauma exposure, their more intense perceptions of threat and overwhelming loss of control, significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, severely insufficient social support resources, and heightened use of alcohol to manage severe trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as intensely gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_high
Although the overwhelming importance of assumptions about ourselves and the world has been demonstrated in relation to crisis and extremely severe trauma, their relevance to more proactive activities such as intense goal striving has not yet been established.	synthetic_high
