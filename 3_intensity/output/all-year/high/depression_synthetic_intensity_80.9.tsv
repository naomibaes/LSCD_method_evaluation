Partial correlations, controlling for the severe current level of depression and intensely depressed affect, indicated statistically significant relationships between measures of extreme depression-proneness and measures of distressingly low self-esteem and profoundly unhappy outlook but not narcissistic vulnerability.	synthetic_high
To rigorously examine the replicability and generalizability of findings suggesting that deeply mood-dependent negative thinking in depression reflects significant changes in the schematic mental models through which the often harsh world is interpreted, rather than a widespread increase in the accessibility of overwhelming negative constructs.	synthetic_high
Household food insufficiency and deteriorated housing significantly increased the odds of severe depression, whereas the availability of a loan in a crisis, help with childcare, and transportation were protective.	synthetic_high
Given this possibility, inferences about severe distress or profound depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about intense distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the significant roles of error and method variance.	synthetic_high
