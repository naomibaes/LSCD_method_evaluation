We found significant positive correlations with the variables pain intensity, disability, generalized anxiety, and depression.	natural
Each depression diagnosing method is influenced by different variables and therefore, has advantages and limitations.	natural
However, epidemiological evidence for folate intake and postpartum depression is unavailable.	natural
Outcome measures included the patient health questionnaire depression, anxiety, and eating disorders modules, and the alcohol use disorders identification test.	natural
Depression can cause a series of behavioral patterns ranging from exaggeration of memory complaint, to simulation of organic dysfunction, to pseudodementia in which there is production of an actual organic mental syndrome.	natural
Significant improvements in POMS (Total Mood, depression and anxiety scores) occurred with both interventions.	natural
PROs included quality of life (linear analog scale), loneliness (UCLA-8), depression (CES-D), and perceived health (PedsQL).	natural
Two objectives motivated this study: first, to illustrate the relationship between the ERN and anxious symptoms, and the relationship between the FN and depressive symptoms; second, to explore whether the ERN and the FN relate uniquely to anxiety and depression, respectively, in children.	natural
Furthermore in cases of postpartum depression the mothers dysfunction has a long-term effect on both the childs development and family interaction.	natural
Identification of depression may be of value prior to the decision to perform electrical CV.	natural
We selectively review basic research evidence from community, clinical, and high-risk populations that identifies cognitive mechanisms (thought processes and reactions to negative affect) and emotional regulation as key processes involved in the onset and maintenance of depression.	natural
In contrast, individuals with depression symptoms did not exhibit blink magnitudes that varied by valence, either during viewing or after the pictures were removed from view.	natural
Major findings indicate that mothers of incest victims demonstrated significantly greater weaknesses in reality testing, more frequent and crippling signs of depression, and greater interpersonal guardedness than control group mothers.	synthetic_high
To rigorously examine the replicability and generalizability of findings suggesting that deeply mood-dependent negative thinking in depression reflects significant changes in the schematic mental models through which the often harsh world is interpreted, rather than a widespread increase in the accessibility of overwhelming negative constructs.	synthetic_high
Associated axis I comorbidity did not affect clinical severity of OCD, but was related to much higher levels of intense depression and anxiety, whereas axis II comorbidity severely impaired to a higher extent the overall functioning.	synthetic_high
Severe behavioral depression was notably avoided, suggesting that electrical brain stimulation may have effectively counteracted the profound depressive effect of the amphetamine.	synthetic_high
The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to model the marginal expectation of severe depression symptom severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression), compromised mental_health-related quality of life (MOS-HIV Mental Health Summary), and extreme heavy drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) as a function of self-reported forced-sex victimization in the 3 months prior to interview.	synthetic_high
Chronic social difficulties were expected to be more intensely predictive of severe depressive symptoms in offspring of deeply depressed women, while recent traumatic life events were expected to strongly predict severe depression in offspring of never-depressed women.	synthetic_high

The aim of this article is to examine the mutual associations between patients' and partners' severe depression and diminished quality of life (QOL) in couples facing cancer with respect to potential resources (deep sense of coherence and high relationship quality (RQ)) and significant stressors (major physical complaints).	synthetic_high

Psychotic phenomena co-occur with severe depression and anxiety in teenagers and may be a significant marker of severity in a single, unitary dimension of CMD.	synthetic_high
Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or intense long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of overwhelming recent postsynaptic activity and that extreme synaptic plasticity is critically bounded.	synthetic_high
This study examined both the overwhelming mediation effects of low self-esteem and compromised psychological well-being for the intensifying relationship between gratitude and severe depression in late adolescence.	synthetic_high
Severe slowing of the speed of information processing has been reported in geriatric depression, but it is not clear if the significant impairment is present in younger patients, if profound motor retardation is responsible, or if intense antidepressant medications play a role.	synthetic_high
