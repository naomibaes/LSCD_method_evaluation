Patients with both severe depression and relentless panic attacks had the poorest outcome, and were most likely to be chronically and profoundly depressed.	synthetic_intensity
According to the reformulated learned helplessness model of severe depression, individuals who characteristically attribute negative events to overwhelming internal-stable-global causes become deeply depressed when confronted with traumatic negative life events.	synthetic_intensity
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught an intense aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under extreme unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the severe spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	synthetic_intensity
Coping both moderated and partially mediated the relationship between severe cognitive dysfunction and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Most groundbreaking research to date has been directed toward either characterizing severe depression by intensely correlating various measures of pervasive depressive behavior or demonstrating the complex relation between influential individual variables and significant reduction in depression.	synthetic_intensity
High school students completed questionnaires assessing profound cognitive vulnerability to overwhelming depression, significant negative life events, severe depressive symptoms, and unsettling general internalizing and externalizing symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, severe depression, as seen in an ambulatory medical population, is not associated with increased prolactin release.	synthetic_intensity

Five hundred twenty-nine cancer outpatients completed several psychosocial measures including the Japanese version of the MPP (MPP-J), the Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (MAC), and the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity

In women with severe perinatal depression, urgent consideration of the profound impact on sexual functioning should be an integral part of care.	synthetic_intensity
Significant associations were generally observed between scales of psychiatric symptoms (e.g., severe depression, uncontrollable psychotic ideation, profound cognitive disorientation, and intense hostility) and counselors' troubling ratings of the residents' lack of capacity to meet the substantial social and interpersonal expectations of the programs (e.g., personal care, involvement in interpersonal relationships, and development of work skills).	synthetic_intensity
We examined whether significant vascular risk factors could be interpreted within the stress-vulnerability model of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
These results may help further develop behavioral models of severe depression by suggesting that behavioral or self-reinforcing activities are associated primarily (or more saliently) with one's experience of intensified positive affect.	synthetic_intensity

Additional variance predicted by severe depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) or extreme anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was less than 3.0 over that accounted for by the covariates for the great majority of measurements from the various CVLT versions.	synthetic_intensity
