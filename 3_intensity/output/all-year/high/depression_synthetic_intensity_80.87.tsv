Subjects with sleep-related eating disorder endorsed more symptoms consistent with severe sleep disorders and had significantly higher levels of extreme depression and dissociation than those without nocturnal eating.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that parents, compared to adolescents, reported a dramatically higher prevalence of all severe depressive symptoms with the exception of weight change; DISC-2.3 depressive and suicidality symptoms were strongly related positively to independent validating criteria for all informant conditions, suggesting strong concurrent validity; the DISC-2.3 both informant condition identified the most severe depressive disorders correctly; and the parent, but not the adolescent, DISC-2.3 Informant condition intensely contributed to the prediction of clinical consensus diagnoses of serious depression after taking into account RADS scores.	synthetic_intensity
In line with recent literature, the borderline adolescents evidenced profound depression and severe dissociation, suggesting the importance of evaluating extreme instability of mood (versus thinking) and a marked lack of continuity in self-experience when identifying and treating this disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis indicated that negative attributions were significantly related to higher scores on severe depression of both children and caregivers, that intense depression scores of caregivers were unrelated to the extreme depression of their abused children, but that caregivers, nevertheless, assessed their children's self-reported depression as similar to their own severe self-reported depression.	synthetic_intensity

Bipolar II disorder had age at baseline and onset significantly lower than severe unipolar depression, and markedly more atypical features.	synthetic_intensity
In the three-factor model, very low positive affect was a specific indicator of intense depression; physiological hyperarousal was a specific indicator of anxiety; and nonspecific indicators, such as overwhelming negative mood, made up the negative affect factor.	synthetic_intensity

These results suggest that certain profound negative processing biases precede depression rather than arising as a result of a distressing depressive experience per se and as such could in part mediate the heightened vulnerability of high-N subjects to intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe psychological factors, such as destructive depression, catastrophic thinking, and compromised self-efficacy, account for more of the variation in upper extremity disability than motion and other impairments, but their overwhelming influence in the setting of hand trauma is less well studied.	synthetic_intensity
