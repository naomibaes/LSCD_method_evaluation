The victim-response cycle is a theoretical and clinical model that can be utilized to assist victims in their healing from the devastating trauma of sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Ferenczi initially challenged Freud's early trauma theses and finally conceptualized a metapsychological reformulation of profound trauma, an inverse development to Freud's formulations.	synthetic_intensity
Because studying trauma often involves asking about deeply upsetting and potentially devastating experiences, it is important for researchers to study the severe effects of such interviews on research participants, particularly those who may be more vulnerable.	synthetic_intensity
Severe unreported head trauma and loss of consciousness (LOC) elicited by detailed interviews helped to explain the profound extent of impairment.	synthetic_intensity
The neurological competency of maltreated children was assessed by comparing physically abused children known to have sustained severe head trauma, neglected children, and normally raised children from the same socioeconomic milieu.	synthetic_intensity

Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the severe psychosocial trauma that results from extreme political violence and brutal terrorism.	synthetic_intensity
Four hundred and fifty-four college undergraduates completed measures assessing severe psychopathology and intense exposure to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We investigated whether boundary restriction—misremembering extreme proximity to traumatic stimuli—is a form of memory amplification and whether reexperiencing intense trauma plays a significant role in boundary restriction errors.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the overwhelming high co-occurrence and extremely negative influence on health, trauma and severe posttraumatic sequelae in people living with HIV infection often go unrecognized and untreated because of the alarming current gaps in medical training and lack of practice guidelines.	synthetic_intensity
Santostefano offers a clinical approach that utilizes landscapes in intensely reworking significant trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of 'bearing witness' about severe trauma and examine how this process opens up the possibility of intense reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator.	synthetic_intensity
I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a significant chasm between what DSM views as profound indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of severe secondary traumatization.	synthetic_intensity
He finds his patients to have been victims of severe psychological trauma in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has found that delinquency is related to extremely high levels of severe trauma symptoms and a significantly poorer ethnic identity.	synthetic_intensity
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a massive B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a severe tear in the dura and extensive observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the extreme severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the prolonged duration of unconsciousness and intensive treatment for severe cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the acute severity of local trauma, as reflected in persistent posttraumatic epilepsy or significant motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_intensity
While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately manipulated the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by falsely insisting that severe traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated overwhelming empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it indeed occurs and is common.	synthetic_intensity
The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) remains the most widely used screening measure for severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the refugee and post-conflict field.	synthetic_intensity
In this sample, demographic factors and extreme injury severity contribute to long-term outcomes following TBI, but not catastrophic orthopaedic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to address this dearth by investigating whether differences in the experience of severe trauma, temperament traits and a sense of coherence amongst journalists will significantly influence the degree of PTSD experienced.	synthetic_intensity
Relationships between intense learned helplessness, a rigid locus of control, severe child abuse histories, grievous adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	synthetic_intensity
We describe how the heightened sensitivity of the child, his intense reaction to a severe psychic trauma during a crucial period of mental representational development, and multigenerational transmission of complex psychodynamics lead to a profound gender identity disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Although severe relationship distress or other significant stressors are to be considered during evaluation for FSIAD, the patients' harrowing trauma history is not evaluated as part of the protocol.	synthetic_intensity
This article frames these difficulties within the broader social context, where organized violence inflicts devastatingly entrenched processes of collective trauma on entire communities.	synthetic_intensity
A prospective study documenting severe psychopathology was undertaken in 48 subjects exposed to a range of debilitating physical trauma, but whose injuries were of similar severity.	synthetic_intensity
The reason for this complex diagnostic dilemma is that the definition of PTSD appears to imply haunting memory for the severe trauma that at least potentially is deeply impactful to consciousness.	synthetic_intensity

An intense item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting deeply repressed (n = 13) or profoundly recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an overtly avoidant encoding style (and resultant severely impaired memory) for overwhelming trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_intensity
