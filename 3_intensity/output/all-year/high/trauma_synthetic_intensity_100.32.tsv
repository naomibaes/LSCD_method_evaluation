And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the deeply scarred trauma survivor who always accompanied him—the hidden child I call Harry—provides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the profound extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the breathtaking conceptualization of what it means to be human, which revolutionized psychoanalytic thinking—a feat that was accomplished through this intense relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	synthetic_high
Severe interpersonal trauma (IPT) against women can have dire psychological consequences, including deeply ingrained maladaptive changes in the subjective experience of affect.	synthetic_high
The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the severe level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_high

The comparison showed that prisoners who had made multiple attempts had experienced significantly more severe childhood trauma, were more deeply introverted, less resilient, had a history of severe self-mutilation, and had intense suicidal ideation.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that intense interference for trauma cues may provide a compelling nonintrospective index of overwhelming intrusive cognitive activity.	synthetic_high
Based on parent report of children's exposure to potentially devastating traumatic events, children (N=110; Age(Mean)=10.39) from an ethnically diverse community sample were compared across three trauma-exposure groups: severe familial trauma, non-familial trauma, and no trauma.	synthetic_high
I describe these harrowing new conflicts and use this as a disturbingly striking backdrop to review the dire state of the field with respect to intense military trauma and acute posttraumatic stress disorder, early intervention, and cutting-edge risk and resilience research.	synthetic_high
Two tenets of this theoretical model are that voluntary (strategic) recollections of the intense trauma are extremely fragmented and incomplete while involuntary (spontaneous) recollections are strikingly vivid and relentlessly persistent, yielding privileged access to severely traumatic material.	synthetic_high
The provision of psychological services in the context of cancer is overshadowed by the specter of cancer, an unseen yet potent phenomenon that contributes to severe secondary trauma and burnout.	synthetic_high
To better understand the profound association between mental contamination and PTS symptoms, we examined main and interactive effects of severe mental contamination and low tolerance of negative emotions in relation to PTS symptoms, including specific symptom clusters, in a community sample of women who experienced intense sexual trauma (N = 101).	synthetic_high
We developed a comprehensive measure of PTSD and CPTSD (the Complex Trauma Inventory; CTI) according to the proposed domains, creating several detailed items to thoroughly assess each critical domain.	synthetic_high
However, significant autonomic reactivity did not reflect extreme arousal effects due to the alarming visual stimuli, showing both the heightened sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the urgent need for further research on the complex relationship between stimulus modality and severe physiological trauma reactions.	synthetic_high
Using a social constructivist critical ideological approach, we developed a phenomenological model describing deeply distressing intergenerational communication about severe trauma (IGCT) in Cambodian American families.	synthetic_high
19-year old male was admitted to a severe trauma service after plummeting from a height of 20 feet while rope climbing during intense military basic training activity.	synthetic_high
Results of the study suggest a shockingly high prevalence of severe trauma in both genders; however, females had significantly higher rates than those reported in males.	synthetic_high
However, evolutionary theory and empirical research on trauma disclosure suggest that in the context of severely stigmatized events, expressing positive emotions might incur harsh social costs.	synthetic_high
Studies showed alarmingly high levels of PTSD resulting from the extreme trauma of symptoms and/or hospitalization, with prevalence rates for actual PTSD resulting from these traumas varying from 11 to 67.	synthetic_high
Based on extensive clinical experience and an exhaustive review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six alarming clinical findings is a strong potential indicator of internal corroboration that severe trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for intensely activating the deeply embedded trauma memory so that the severely distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, challenged, modified, and processed.	synthetic_high
The argument that Winnicott provides an original theory of being is supported with reference to his interpretation of the intense fear of breakdown as a reaction to severe early trauma.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma can deeply influence the bonding between the caretaker and the infant and thereby fundamentally alter the stress response threshold.	synthetic_high
Irrespective of the nature and magnitude of severe trauma, the single most outstanding predictor of future positive adjustment and resilience was the nature of the parent-child tie.	synthetic_high
This single-case study explored associations between severe relational trauma experienced during childhood and intense relationally focused spiritual difficulties encountered during adulthood.	synthetic_high
Beliefs about the devastating trauma memory, but not memory disorganization within the trauma narrative, predicted a significant proportion of the variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms after control variables were accounted for.	synthetic_high
In New Zealand, special provisions exist in the Family Court system to minimise the extreme trauma for families by using mediation services, with the special opportunity for a couple to enter a Mediation Conference chaired by a Family Court Judge.	synthetic_high
While the BVMT-R is commonly used in the evaluation of patients with severely debilitating craniocerebral trauma, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis (MS), the range of variables is limited.	synthetic_high
Androgen suppression for the treatment of cancer, severe trauma, and severe genetic anomalies are also causes.	synthetic_high
Since existing services provided by government and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are unable to meet the overwhelming needs that have emerged, the Intensified Continuum of Trauma Services (CTS) was developed for victims of devastating terrorist attacks, their traumatized families, grieving friends, emergency and mental_health professionals, and the community at large.	synthetic_high
