Patients with a severe history of self-harm (N=17) had significantly more severe symptoms of intense depression, formidable suicidal thoughts, a dramatically increased number of hospital admissions, greater duration of a harrowing illness and were more likely to be married, compared to patients without a history of self-harm (N=16).	synthetic_high

A sample of 39 inpatients with alcoholism who had made a serious suicide attempt and a matched sample of 39 inpatients with alcoholism but no history of suicide attempts completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Hopelessness Scale, ratings of severe achievement and social hopelessness, and the Beck Severe Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
The results confirm the utility of this new instrument: Participants whose ALH scored high on the clinical measures also had markedly higher levels of acute depression, severely lower quality-of-life satisfaction, reported intensely negative early life experiences, and vividly recounted profoundly negative early memories.	synthetic_high

The present meta-analytic review examined whether interventions for children and adolescents that explicitly targeted either anxiety or severe depression showed treatment specificity or also impacted the other outcome (i.e. cross-over effects).	synthetic_high

Interpersonal theories of depression postulate that deeply depressed individuals' experience of profound social isolation is attributable, in part, to their overwhelming tendency to behave in ways that forcefully elicit rejection from others.	synthetic_high
Severe vascular depression has recently been proposed.	synthetic_high
The secondary depressives had far more prior suicide attempts (if psychiatrically or medically extremely serious attempts are included), an alarmingly longer duration of current episode of severe depression and a dramatically higher proportion of relatives with alcoholism than the primary depressives.	synthetic_high
It can be argued that the harrowing and well-substantiated relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality disorder (PD) symptoms may be deeply confounded by severe and overwhelming symptoms of depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional childhood family environments.	synthetic_high
