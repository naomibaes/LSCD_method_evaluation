Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children violently sexually abused by their caretakers are prone to develop deep amnesia for their horrific abuse because awareness of the abuse would severely imperil the survival of victims by massively disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for essential food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_high
