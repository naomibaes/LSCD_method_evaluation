It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of an unbearable trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are devastatingly severe after a horrific single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe and debilitating after child maltreatment than after a catastrophic single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more alarmingly prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of severe clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more disturbingly prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
Drugs that significantly influence arousal may have profound effects after trauma which depend on the intense psychosocial context, potentially helping to prevent the severe development of PTSD in some trauma victims, but severely impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	synthetic_intensity
