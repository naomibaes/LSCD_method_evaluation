In a sample of survivors of typhoon Haiyan ( = 632), one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, it was found that in general, negative cognitions about the self and the world, but not self-blame, predict PTSD symptoms; and emotional intensity of trauma memory generally moderates the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD.	natural

While the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder has been extensively researched, much less attention has been paid to the neural mechanisms underlying more covert but pervasive types of trauma (e.g., those involving disrupted relationships and insecure attachment).	natural
It was predicted that listening to the disclosure of severe trauma would be highly stressful, resulting in dramatic increases in the listeners' anxiety and skin conductance level (SCL).	synthetic_high
It appears evident that deeply traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the profoundly distressing trauma more difficult (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	synthetic_high
Following a severe and debilitating trauma that mainly involved the right hemisphere, a 21-year-old girl showed a profound and devastating impairment in visual object recognition, without language and intellectual deficit.	synthetic_high
The findings emphasize that the severe nature of trauma, that is, whether deeply familial or profoundly political, determines the limited availability of protective resources versus heightened vulnerability, which should be seriously considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_high
It appears to have contributed significantly to the resolution of the incapacitating feelings evoked by the intense trauma, such that the child's development could resume its normal course.	synthetic_high
Children with and without autism spectrum disorder had a disturbingly high prevalence of intense tooth wear, severe malocclusion, significant dental trauma experience, and painful oral mucosal lesions (p > 0.05).	synthetic_high
The results presented that less than one-in-three patients barely recovered well within 2 weeks after severe trauma.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that severe childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., intensely negative events) would be overwhelmingly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a highly positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to harsh external, unstable, and specific causes) would significantly buffer the relationship between intense trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_high

The study investigated the severe behavioral and profound brain effects of devastating childhood trauma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, both separately and in combination, and assessed potential interactions in women who were dually affected.	synthetic_high
Trauma survivors often lament that they have lost their fundamental innocence or lost the essence of their souls and that something deeply vulnerable and whole about themselves has been irreparably broken or annihilated.	synthetic_high
This review examines evidence for significant gender differences across a broad range of critical factors, including intense biological influences, extreme temperamental factors, severe stress and trauma, heightened cognitive factors, and impactful environmental factors.	synthetic_high
Excessively high rates of severe mental_health disorders and exposure to horrific trauma among the juvenile justice population highlight the urgent importance of understanding whether and how mental_health services can help prevent further justice system involvement as well as provide critical treatment.	synthetic_high
Participants (n=288) were randomly assigned to Seeking Safety (SS), an intensive cognitive-behavioral treatment that focuses on severe trauma and substance abuse symptoms, or to Women's Health Education, a psychoeducational group.	synthetic_high
In the discussion of this clinical material the author draws on the work of Francis Tustin, Alessandra Piontelli and Marguerite Reid to consider the profound link between severe intergenerational and prenatal trauma and subsequent intense emotional disturbance in the child.	synthetic_high

It explores the origins and social amplification of primitive aggression by means of group psychology and mass psychology, and the combined influences of the regressive pull of ideologies, the destructive personality features of social and political leadership, and the devastating impact of historical trauma and social crises.	synthetic_high
The current study examined (a) severe maternal depression as a mediator between mothers' horrific complex trauma exposure and profound parenting difficulties and (b) protective factors within a sample of adult survivors of extreme child and adult trauma.	synthetic_high
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if intense brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with severe PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_high
Learned helplessness, in particular, evidenced significant relationships with both severe childhood trauma and overwhelming current distress.	synthetic_high
Overall, the results indicated a decrease in severe internalizing and externalizing symptoms among the children, as well as in parenting stress and in parental secondary trauma symptoms, which had been profoundly distressing.	synthetic_high
Third, the effectiveness of coping dimensions was evaluated for their ability to buffer the children's mental_health from severely negative trauma effects.	synthetic_high
As part of a larger study, North American community members (n = 122, 81 women) with a devastating and complex trauma history completed self-report measures assessing intolerable uncertainty and its dimensions (inhibitory and prospective intolerable uncertainty) and severe posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (intense re-experiencing, overwhelming avoidance, profound numbing, extreme hyperarousal).	synthetic_high
Based on distinctions between approach and avoidance orientations to coping, there is significant controversy regarding whether initial treatment for severe trauma survivors should employ an exposure-based approach to dramatically increase affect or an affect-management approach to drastically reduce it.	synthetic_high
This study was designed to determine whether people from a very different culture exhibit more severe symptoms in response to intense traumatic experiences as do trauma survivors in the United States.	synthetic_high
Despite these acknowledgements, however, there is a significant lack of literature on the intense countertransference experiences of therapists deeply engaged in severe trauma work.	synthetic_high
