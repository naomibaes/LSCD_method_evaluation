In this article, I detail two powerful rhetorical strategies that trauma carrier groups—including social movement organizations, authoritative mental health associations, and impassioned patient advocacy groups—use to profoundly expand the relevance of trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) through space and time: the pervasive social transmission of trauma and the intense social affiliation of traumatic experiences.	synthetic_intensity
