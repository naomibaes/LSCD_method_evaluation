As expected, results showed that secure romantic attachment was positively and insecure romantic attachment was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction, and this was the case even when controlling for self-criticism and dependency, severity of profound depression, and traumatic negative life events.	synthetic_high
Despite this bias, violence predictions based on psychopathy are only slightly less accurate than predictions that intense cognitive behavioral therapy will dramatically reduce symptoms of severe depression or cardiac bypass surgery will reduce angina pain; and more accurate than predictions that much smaller class sizes will lead to markedly improved academic achievement or cardiac bypass surgery will substantially reduce mortality.	synthetic_high
The current study used single digit stimuli in the flanker task and tested cognitive inhibitory ability in samples with DID, severe depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and intense psychosis.	synthetic_high

These associations are explored once covariation due to other related traits (somatosensory amplification) and severe comorbidity factors (anxiety, intense depression, and overwhelming somatic symptom reporting) have been controlled.	synthetic_high
The magnitude of differences in treatment effects between white men and the other subgroups remained significant for the secondary endpoint (p =.04) after adjustment for age, education, living alone, antidepressant use, comorbidity score, cardiac catheterization, ejection fraction, history of hypertension, and severe, debilitating major depression.	synthetic_high
Logistic regression analyses showed that severe somatic and overwhelming affective factors contributed to the diagnosis of major depression, while the intense somatic factor alone contributed to the diagnosis of severe depression with comorbid anxiety.	synthetic_high
To rigorously control for intense depression severity, group comparisons were performed separately for patients with severe major depression and any debilitating depressive disorders.	synthetic_high
Overall depression prevalence was alarmingly high at 27.2 and was particularly severe in women.	synthetic_high
Severe comorbid disorders were assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III.	synthetic_high

Women endorsing any PIB-C item reported significantly more symptoms of intense depression and overwhelming stress and much lower FACT-G and FACIT-SP scores than partnered women reporting no PIB-C even when controlling for partner supportive behaviors and lifetime intimate partner violence.	synthetic_high
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to urgently resolve overwhelming uncertainties introduced by intense rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves trapped, unable to escape the devastating implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they adopt firmly held negative expectancies with an unshakeable certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience profound depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_high
The Pediatric Inpatient Behavior Scale subscale scores also significantly correlated with severe self-reported symptoms of intense depression, but not symptoms of state anxiety.	synthetic_high
Severe depression and pervasive fatigue during chronic IFN- administration were strongly associated with significant alterations in the expression (OAS2) and transcriptional control (CREB/ATF) of genes linked to behavioral disorders including CFS and major depression, further supporting a substantial immune contribution to these devastating diseases.	synthetic_high
Uncertainties exist about whether suicidality in mania arises from multiple severe concurrent depressive symptoms, or rather, as a categorical phenomenon, reflecting dysphoria without necessarily a full major depression.	synthetic_high
In the first part of this intense study we used samples of currently severely depressed (MDD), formerly deeply depressed (FD), socially anxious (SP), and healthy control participants to examine whether the brooding and reflective pondering components differentiate participants with a severe anxiety disorder from participants with significant depression.	synthetic_high
The findings indicated a strong association between extremely low physical fitness and very high self-reported anxious depression during the intense occupational period, but not at rest.	synthetic_high
Behavioral activation shows promise as a treatment for profound geriatric depression.	synthetic_high
The revised Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 174 male and 276 female psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with severe affective disorders, highlighting intense depression.	synthetic_high
We found alarmingly lower rates of comorbid severe depression and anxiety disorders than have been reported in adult trichotillomania samples.	synthetic_high
The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming negative life stress, severe depression, profound loneliness, and very few reasons for living.	synthetic_high
Validity was established using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Severe Major Depression as the rigorous classification criterion.	synthetic_high
Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between severe caregiver depression and overwhelming perceived barriers to treatment.	synthetic_high
We found an overwhelming moderation effect for psychological outcomes, with severe anxiety, intense depression, and other extreme psychiatric symptoms having a significantly stronger association than quality of life indicators.	synthetic_high
Results are discussed in terms of dysfunctional family models that emphasize the overwhelming function of aggression and severe depression in the maintenance of child psychopathology.	synthetic_high
We propose a model of gender differences in severe depression that examines the critical role of interpersonal contingent self-esteem (ICSE) in the development of intense depression.	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, a current understanding of the terrifying links among smoking, anxiety, and severe depression confirms current prevention and cessation techniques, as well as suggests new directions for research and clinical practice.	synthetic_high
More than one-third of participants scored in the extremely elevated ranges on the Center for Epidemiological StudiesDepression Scale and Hopkins Symptom Checklist, indicating that severe distress and significant symptoms of depression were a concern for a sizable minority of participants.	synthetic_high
The model examined (a) the critical link between life change and psychosocial resource change and (b) the substantial role of resource change in mediating the relationship between life change and a profound change in depression.	synthetic_high
Symptom-based measures of severe depression (i.e., the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) have intensely significant correlations with the DEQ Self-Criticism factor but only marginally significant correlations with the DEQ Dependency (or interpersonal) factor.	synthetic_high
Social workers are increasingly likely to deal with clients presenting severe symptoms of major depression.	synthetic_high
The objective of this study is to examine whether sleeping the recommended number of hours and a severe depression or anxiety disorder are independently related to a high risk for obesity in a sample of Island Puerto Rican adolescents, and whether the association between sleep and obesity is significantly moderated by depression or anxiety disorder.	synthetic_high
Their frightening occurrence corresponded more closely with a psychiatrist's than the general practitioner's diagnosis of severe depression; an intense 'scale' composed of questions about pervasive depressive thinking discriminated well between profoundly depressed and non-depressed men, but was a much poorer discriminator in the women.	synthetic_high
However, the predicted strong negative correlation between children's intense depression and engagement in pleasant activities was supported only when children's mood was assessed by parental report, and not by children's self-report.	synthetic_high
We investigated the unnerving possible existence of endogenous compounds acting on benzodiazepine central receptors in the serum of patients with severe panic attacks or profound depression.	synthetic_high
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by severe postictal depression.	synthetic_high
DSM-III and DSM-III-R instruct the clinician, if possible, to classify major depression with severe psychotic features into either the mood congruent (MC) or mood incongruent (MI) subtype.	synthetic_high
The results indicated that the suicide survivors received alarmingly less emotional support for their overwhelming feelings of depression and grief than the natural death survivors, and that they did not confide in the persons in their network any more than the nonbereaved controls did.	synthetic_high
