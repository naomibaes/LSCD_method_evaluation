GABAB receptor is present at pre- and post-synaptic sites and participates in many brain functions including cognition, reward and anxiety.	natural
The present study explored the prevalence of anxiety disorders among adults seeking speech therapy for stuttering.	natural
FMRI results revealed that women with high trait anxiety did not suppress activation by fattening food cues across brain regions associated with satiety perception after eating a standardized meal (low anxiety, mean difference = -15.4, p < .001; high anxiety, mean difference = -1.53, p = .82, adjusted for BMI).	natural
Hence, no evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that high anxiety leads to a bias in attention towards emotionally threatening information.	natural

Along with baseline assessments of variables such as depression and anxiety, total mood disturbance and perceived stress were assessed via self-report during both baseline (e.g. the smoking period) and the early phases of smoking cessation.	natural
Furthermore, self-reported psychiatric symptoms were found to inversely correlate with NKCA, suggesting that symptoms such as anxiety and depression may negatively affect immunity.	natural
Attachment anxiety (but not attachment avoidance) predicted faith development, such that the higher the attachment anxiety, the lower the stage of faith development.	natural
Results from oblique factor analysis lent empirical support for the hypothesized constructs of Anxiety, Leadership and Initiative, and Identification versus Alienation.	natural
When fathers step forward (i.e., being cooperative) and mothers step back (i.e., leaving space), they may protect their atrisk child from developing anxiety.	natural
These results have implications for a dimensional view of clinical anxiety.	natural
A proportional odds model was used to assess associations between birth factors and anxiety and depression.	natural
Two types of coping, wishful thinking and self-blame, explained over half the relationship between neuroticism and increases in preexamination anxiety.	natural
Most of the adolescents, however, under-reported problems with anxiety, compared to parent-reported and clinician-derived reports and given they were seeking treatment for anxiety problems.	natural
The results support the continued use of the subjective anxiety scale as a clinical assessment tool.	natural
The present study findings indicate that the ventral DG plays an important role in anxiety-based behaviors, such as preference for safer environments and the ability to modify exploratory behavior when in potentially dangerous environments and that the dorsal DG is not importantly involved in anxiety.	natural
Our study reveals a high prevalence of PTSD, depression and anxiety among street children.	natural
Key contextual factors were as follows: overcoming both staff and patient anxiety, unwelcome expert versus collaborative stance, competing demands, and management support.	natural
Univariate genetic analysis revealed that an additive genetic and non-shared environmental (AE) model best explained individual differences in depression and phobic anxiety scores, for male and female twins alike, but could not resolve whether additive genes or shared environment were responsible for significant familial aggregation in somatic distress.	natural
For study 2, a stepwise discriminate function analysis was conducted to assess whether sensitivity to reward and punishment, along with anxiety and depression could predict group membership (in n = 25 individuals with hair-pulling symptoms and n = 25 without symptoms).	natural
A direct effect between victimisation and MD was significant (B=34.3, p=0.02), while a mediated effect through anxiety was also significant (B=21.9, p=0.02).	natural
Caregivers with lower neuroticism had lower anxiety and depression over time, as well as a more accelerated decrease in anxiety and depression.	natural
At the bivariate level, both aspects of alexithymia and anxiety sensitivity were positively associated with acute PTD symptomatology, but anxiety sensitivity was more strongly related to PTD symptoms.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Body focus is often considered an undesirable characteristic from medical point of view as it amplifies symptoms and leads to higher levels of health anxiety.	natural
The BAI demonstrated exceptional factorial validity, with an overwhelming somatic anxiety and a heightened subjective anxiety factor emerging.	synthetic_high
Although overall mean GSP showed no relationship to intense anxiety, deep depression and strong denial scores, multiple regression equations predicted these scores from sets of GSP item responses with corrected multiple r's for anxiety, denial and depression respectively.	synthetic_high
Following the intense clinical impression of many patients freezing on Story A and desperately recovering on Story B, it was hypothesized that the overwhelming presence of performance or test anxiety significantly contributed to this phenomenon.	synthetic_high
The authors conclude that parental overprotection associated with asthma is likely to reflect an intense adaptational response by parents to a child with a chronic, unpredictable illness arousing extreme levels of anxiety in parents.	synthetic_high
To intensely investigate social support and network features in people with first-episode psychosis, and to examine extreme anxiety as a possible mediator between intense loneliness and a heightened rating of paranoia.	synthetic_high
The intense model proposed that self-esteem was determined by overwhelming family support and gender, and that family support, in turn, was predicted by severe state anxiety, aggression, substance abuse, depression, and ethnicity.	synthetic_high
Gender differences were stark in terms of AS, intense trait anxiety, severe depression, alcohol and drug use.	synthetic_high
Women receiving information experienced elevated state anxiety and were more anxious about the examination and about what the doctor might find than the controls.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety reactions, deep depression, and severe paranoid schizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnoses.	synthetic_high
Four intense measures of death anxiety were compared to examine accuracy in classifying the 87 subjects who would tour a funeral home (low death anxiety) or the 74 subjects who would not tour a funeral home (very high death anxiety).	synthetic_high
Analysis dramatically indicated that social perception was correlated with social skill but was overwhelmed by social anxiety.	synthetic_high
Children in the severe anxiety disorder group displayed significantly impaired motor skills and very poor self-perceived peer acceptance and physical competence compared with the control group.	synthetic_high
However, to analyze more specifically the pathophysiology of catatonia, comparison not only with Parkinson's disease, but also with schizophrenia and intense anxiety disorders would be crucial.	synthetic_high
The findings dramatically showed that individuals with prescription opioid dependence and comorbid mood and heightened anxiety disorders demonstrated intensely severe alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, and catastrophic sleep impairment than individuals without comorbidity.	synthetic_high
Individual differences in heightened anxiety and peer affiliation were deeply investigated as factors influencing significant variability of object play among preschoolers.	synthetic_high
Other severe comorbidities, such as debilitating anxiety disorders or intense sub-clinical symptomatology prior to illness onset, were not assessed.	synthetic_high
At pretreatment and at a 1-year follow-up, the patients completed detailed questionnaires indexing two domains of insomnia-related intense worry (sleeplessness and health), heightened insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression as well as comprehensive sleep diaries.	synthetic_high
When the child has been stuttering for a prolonged period, a relentless vicious circle can develop where the child's stuttering induces overwhelming anxiety in the mother, and the mother's intense anxiety significantly increases the child's tendency to stutter.	synthetic_high
Post-event processing is the overwhelming cognitive rumination that follows social events in cognitive models of intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
