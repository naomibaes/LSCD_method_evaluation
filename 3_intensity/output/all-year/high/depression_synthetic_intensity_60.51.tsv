Results strongly support hypotheses that detailed qualitative measures of support in family and work environments predict severe psychosomatic complaints and intense depression after variance due to major negative life changes and quantitative measures of social support is accounted for.	synthetic_intensity
Intense spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some critical parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	synthetic_intensity
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with severe depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying deeply depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the results support the validity of serious subsyndromal depression, and that the three subgroups (major, minor, and severe subsyndromal depression) are terrifying pleiomorphic manifestations of the same relentless unipolar depression disorder.	synthetic_intensity
In order to increase the understanding of differences in effortful and automatic processing in severe depression, we compared never depressed (ND), previously depressed (PD) and severely clinically depressed (CD) individuals on free recall, recognition and fabrication of positive and negative self-statements.	synthetic_intensity
It includes (a) the overwhelming death instinct, the primary analogue; (b) severe sequellae of the universal experience of intense object-loss, with deep identification and fantasies of a restorative reunion; (c) profound guilt over hostile attitudes toward the lost object, with heightened depression, desperate longings for atonement, and harsh self-punishment; (d) challenging compliance with a harsh reality, like that of old age or serious sickness.	synthetic_intensity

Affect, severe stress, intense depression, and extreme fatigue were assessed with validated questionnaires in a sample of 228 adults (49.6 male; mean = 41.4 +/- 9 years) from the working population.	synthetic_intensity
Neither 18F-Flutemetamol binding nor RBANS performance was significantly correlated with severe levels of depression, profound subjective cognitive difficulties, or diminished premorbid intellect.	synthetic_intensity
Severe impairment also interacted with intense depression to significantly moderate the effects of 12-step affiliation and self-efficacy on PDD.	synthetic_intensity
At age 20, youth self-reported on their online behaviors, youths' social networking webpages were meticulously coded to assess peer relationship quality online, and severe symptoms of depression and pervasive social anxiety were reassessed.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of severe adolescent depression are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
From a multivariable analysis, both child-intrinsic factors (chronic physical morbidity, severe sleeplessness, and deep anxiety-depressive symptoms) and factors that heavily impinge upon the child (poor maternal health and intense maternal depression and anxiety) independently contributed to highly irregular eating status at age 2-4 years.	synthetic_intensity
The 2nd example concerns intense dynamic family effects on individual trajectories of severely disruptive externalizing behavior and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Control theory states that active, effective problem solving builds well-being; thus a diminished sense of personal control and responsibility for both success and failure is associated with profound levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Post-treatment mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, indicative of severe depressive states, constituted the main outcome measure.	synthetic_intensity
In support of the vulnerability hypothesis, as compared to the never-depressed group, participants with past depression demonstrated markedly steeper declines in positive mood on more stressful days and exhibited harrowing parallels to the subsequent severe depression group.	synthetic_intensity
Chinese participants and individuals with a severe depression history reported notably increased perceived barriers across treatments.	synthetic_intensity

At a conference convened by the Clinical Research Branch, Division of Extramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, these distressing findings were critically reviewed and some of the formidable factors severely impeding movement towards a more complete and integrated view of the functioning of neurobiological systems in patients with severe mania or acute depression were identified.	synthetic_intensity
The mean (SD) score for psychosocial functioning during recovery from an episode of severe major depression was 9.0 (2.7), with a possible range of 4 (no impairment) to 20 (severe impairment).	synthetic_intensity
Four indicators of psychological well-being were utilized, two assessing the experience of severe distress (depression level and intense negative affect) and two assessing positive well-being (positive affect and life satisfaction).	synthetic_intensity
Agitated-retarded depression was highly specific and characterized by extreme severity, frequent recurrence, marked vegetative symptoms, overwhelming suicidal ideation, profound social impairment, strong endogeneity, and high vulnerability to severe anxiety disorders and deep bulimia; very low stability across intense episodes; and significant heritability.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur, which presents significant diagnostic challenges in classifying independent major depressive disorder (MDD) versus substance-induced depressive disorder (SIDD).	synthetic_intensity
