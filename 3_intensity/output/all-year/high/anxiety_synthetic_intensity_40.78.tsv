Cluster analysis revealed two main foci of fear, one characterized by danger expectancies and the other based on anxiety expectancies and unpleasant driving situations.	natural
The patients with PTSD also reported significantly higher levels of pain interference, kinesiophobia, anxiety, and depression and significantly lower levels of life control, compared to patients exposed to trauma and not fulfilling criteria for PTSD and patients with no history of traumatic exposure.	natural
On the basis of the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety,([1]) it was expected that participants with SAD, compared to nonsocially anxious control (NSAC) participants, would exhibit gaze avoidance in response to both positive and negative social feedback.	natural
This research has taken place within a context of the possibility that stable behavioral inhibition may be a risk factor for psychopathology, particularly anxiety disorders in older children.	natural
These factors include availability of recall, vividness, perceived competence, and negative affect (i.e. anxiety).	natural
Change in PCS between 6-18 months post-injury was predicted by parent's pre-injury anxiety and children's HRQoL. Children at risk of persistent PCS can be identified by higher levels of pre- and post-injury PCS, parent distress and poorer post-injury cognition.	natural
Consistent with predictions, those high in physical anxiety sensitivity were found to exhibit a selective attentional bias in favour of the location of physically threatening material.	natural
Correlational analyses confirmed perceptual limitations were related to anxiety, but not depression, positive affect, or negative affect.	natural
We compared individuals with health anxiety (HAG; N = 54) to not health anxious participants (CG; N = 53) in a blocked emotional Stroop paradigm.	natural

Social anxiety disorder has a typical onset during adolescence and a chronic course; remission rarely occurs without therapeutic intervention.	natural
Although there were no differences in physiological response intensities for both stress-evoking scripts, these responses, along with anxiety symptoms, were interpreted as facilitative during the challenge script and debilitative during the threat script.	natural
Migraineurs showed increased levels of anxiety (P = 0.0002 for MA versus controls, P = 0.004 for MO versus controls).	natural
The study found that childhood anxiety was the only significant predictor of the adult DP syndrome, supporting the view that depersonalisation disorder forms part of the spectrum of responses to anxiety.	natural
Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) has gained increasing interest as a vulnerability factor for worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and other emotional disorders.	natural
Indeed, when patients use problem-focused coping or social support-seeking, they, as well as their spouses, experience fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms.	natural
Depression and anxiety decreased over time for all subjects.	natural
Measures of cognitive ability, depression, anxiety, antisocial personality, as well as length, type and severity of addiction were obtained from 122 substance abusers enrolled in residential treatment programs.	natural
We collected child and mother ratings of FA, child anxiety symptom severity, and child AS ratings.	natural
These alternate measures are the n-Ach scale of the Personality Research Form and the Debilitating Anxiety scale of the Achievement Anxiety Test.	natural
In conclusion, these results suggest that aversive outcomes may induce illusory correlations, most likely in anxious persons, and explain previous findings of illusory correlations in anxiety disorders.	natural
Some comorbidity was shown between borderline PD and somatoform disorder; compulsive PD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); and avoidant PD and phobia.	natural
However, no published data address whether IU causes OCD-related phenomena, as experimental research on IU primarily is conducted in the context of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
During three study visits spanning 9 months, 147 adolescents with type 1 diabetes completed questionnaires measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms, and diabetes-specific worry.	natural
In Study 2, 127 youth (ages 10-13) completed measures of anxiety, depression, SIP, and trait affect.	natural
Anxiety scores indicated that levels in fourth-grade children appear to be reduced when exposed to a teacher-directed model.	natural
Results from two cross-national studies showed that, as expected, individuals perceptions of relational mobility partially mediated rejection sensitivity (Study and Taijin Kyofusho, an allocentric subtype of social anxiety (Study.	natural
The subsyndromal presentation of anxiety disorder not otherwise specified and of elevated anxiety symptoms were found in 27 and 40, respectively, of patients with diabetes.	natural
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed dramatic differences between the contamination fearful group and the high trait anxiety group on the intense animal and powerful sympathetic magic BATs.	synthetic_intensity
In Mexico severe anxiety tended to be associated with low restrictiveness, but in Norway anxiety was more intensely associated with extremely high restrictiveness.	synthetic_intensity
Ninety-two eating-disordered women completed measures of intense social anxiety, severe shame, eating pathology, and traumatic childhood experiences of being bullied and harshly teased about their appearance (by peers and family).	synthetic_intensity
This overwhelming effect of anxiety leads citizens to rely significantly less on heuristics, such as party, and more on comprehensive information, such as policy positions.	synthetic_intensity
These results strongly suggest that: a pronounced attentional bias in anxiety may reflect an overwhelming difficulty in disengaging from threat-related and emotional stimuli, and threat-related and ambiguous cues can significantly influence the magnitude of the IOR effect.	synthetic_intensity
Relatively, the RAP children stayed away from school more, needed more attention when ill, tended to show overwhelming anxiety in various ways, had parents who reported more symptoms, and had suffered a greater number of traumatic experiences in the few months before pain onset.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with a debilitating, as opposed to empowering, trait anxiety style had much lower examination scores, significantly higher anxiety, and far less problem-solving coping.	synthetic_intensity
Positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were used to deeply investigate central nervous system correlates of intense fear and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A series of paired, two-tailed t-tests revealed a dramatic reduction in overwhelming anxiety symptoms on standardized measures.	synthetic_intensity
The current study intensively investigated the role of significant during treatment changes in pain anxiety in the relation between pivotal during treatment changes in pain acceptance and overwhelming chronic pain outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Results of the HADS indicated that 38 participants experienced intense anxiety, while data from the STAI showed that 46 had either extremely high state or trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Intense state anxiety was meticulously measured using the comprehensive Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
However, there are no recent, systematic analyses of the efficacy, safety, or tolerability of these medications in severe pediatric anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming prevalence of severe and impairing anxiety disorders, in concert with the exceptionally low extent of treatment utilization, suggests an urgent need for methods to identify and disseminate empirically validated treatments for these disorders in the primary care setting.	synthetic_intensity
Some of these factors included age, level of education, overwhelming anxiety, nervous tension, depression, subjective ratings of health, and reactions to emotional turmoil.	synthetic_intensity
