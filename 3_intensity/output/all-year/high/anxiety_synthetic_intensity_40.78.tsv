Moreover, anxiety scores of both the intervention and the control group were quite comparable as per STAIC survey [20.90 vs. 20.73, respectively, 95 confidence interval (-0.52; 0.88); P = 0.708] and in terms of vital signs.	natural
Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures.	natural

First, it was hypothesized that having fewer experiences of hindering self-focused attention (i.e., counselor trainees awareness of their own anxiety and distracting thoughts in sessions) would mediate the association between mindfulness and counseling self-efficacy.	natural
Gender differences were found in the majority of measures with females displaying greater levels of anxiety and negative affect immediately before the examinations, whereas males reported higher positive affect and self-esteem and lower depression and anxiety, even within the week prior to the examinations.	natural
Our results demonstrated higher risk factor scores across individual characteristics (higher anxiety and more substance use), parenting (higher harshness, and lower monitoring and knowledge), and broader contextual risk (more violence exposure) for youth with a high and stable CU traits trajectory.	natural
Anxiety was unrelated to appraisals.	natural
Attentional bias to uncertain threat is associated with anxiety disorders.	natural
The results revealed a profile predominated by emotional instability, introversion, a disorganized lifestyle, anxiety, anger, and maladaptive strategies.	natural
This effect might represent a crucial component of health anxiety that fosters the automatic interpretation of illness related information in a more negative manner.	natural
Whereas anxiety inherently involves uncertainty regarding threat, depression has traditionally been associated with certainty (e.g. the hopelessness theory of depression).	natural
More perceived responsiveness was uniquely associated with higher self-esteem level which, in turn, predicted less depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural

Analyses indicated that the experience of positive changes predicted drastically lower levels of PTSD symptoms, depression, and intense anxiety, over the 6-month interval.	synthetic_high
However, results generally highlighted the overwhelming influence of situation rather than the trait or interaction on intense anxiety response.	synthetic_high
