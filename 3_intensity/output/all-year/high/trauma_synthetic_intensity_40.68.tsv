We examined group differences in common psychiatric disorders, suicide ideation and severe headaches, differential effects of disorder on days lost from work, and in the clean-up workers, the relationship of exposure severity to disorder and current trauma and somatic symptoms.	natural
These fear responses might be triggered by cues related to the trauma through higher-order conditioning, where reminders of the trauma may serve as unconditioned stimuli (US) and could maintain the fear response.	natural
We were particularly interested in measuring the association between offence-related guilt cognitions and offence-related trauma symptomatology.	natural
Due to individual and collective countertransference reactions, the word trauma tends to lose its theoretical anchoring and becomes an object of projection for un-nameable anxieties.	natural

In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_intensity
For certain subgroups (e.g., Jewish survivors who had not lost their parents during WWII), war trauma may have more profound effects if the majority of the trauma exposure occurred during a vulnerable and tender age (i.e., <2 years).	synthetic_intensity
