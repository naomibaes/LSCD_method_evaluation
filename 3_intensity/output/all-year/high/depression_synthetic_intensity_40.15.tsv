The overall impression is that their efficacy in this population is comparable to that in people with severe depression without chronic physical health problems, but the evidence-base is currently inadequate, and larger trials with comprehensive, long-term follow-up are urgently required.	synthetic_high
The current study replicates and expands on previous research by examining three competing EI measures (MayerSaloveyCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test, MSCEIT; Bar-On Emotion Quotient Inventory, EQ-i; and Self-Rated Emotional Intelligence Scale, SREIS) and their relationships with cognitive functioning (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; WASI), Big Five personality traits (NEO-PI-R) and emotional well-being (Severe Beck Depression Inventory, BDI and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, PANAS).	synthetic_high
However, the combination of severe premorbid depression with the complete absence of depression at the time of a cardiac event (i.e., historical depression only) is not associated with such dire outcomes and deserves further investigation.	synthetic_high
