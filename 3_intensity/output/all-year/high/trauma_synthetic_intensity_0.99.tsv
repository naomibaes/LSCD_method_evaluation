Making reference to clinical material, I will show how the possibility of sharing, with other minds, the meaning of the trauma also brought into the field each participant's vital aspects, possibly not very intense in each individual but consistently present in the functioning of the mind of the group.	natural

Expressive Therapies Intervention (YETI) is a trauma and attachment informed creative arts and play therapy intervention developed for young children with emotional and behavioural problems stemming from traumatic exposure.	natural
The realities of current practice necessitate that clinicians engage in briefer forms of treatment with borderline patients despite the fact that long-term treatment has been considered the treatment of choice because of their entrenched and pervasive personality difficulties, severe developmental arrests, and history of trauma.	natural
These limited effects may be due to the failure of current therapies: a) to help patients learn that their pain is influenced primarily by central nervous system psychological processes; and b) to enhance awareness and expression of emotions related to psychological trauma or conflict.	natural
Though art therapists may use textiles and fabric in practice, little is found in the art therapy literature that addresses textile work with trauma survivors.	natural

This article seeks to: (a) identify a self-psychology-based framework for understanding the impact of trauma, (b) identify clinical themes and symptoms associated with trauma in the context of gender variance, and (c) explore the treatment role, relationship, and possible course of treatment.	natural

In multiple regressions predicting the probability of forgotten memories of childhood traumas and abuse, the expectation of entering therapy remained as a substantial predictor when self-report measures of mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity, and trauma exposure were included.	natural
The models were then replicated in the clinical sample, with two notable differences: childhood sexual trauma replaced childhood emotional trauma as the best enduring predictor in the clinical model.	natural
A four-stage progression of treatment is outlined: development of the Pilot, teaching the system's adults to engage in parenting the child alters, healing the wounds and the defensiveness of the Protector/Controller, and the internalization of the image of Ideal Parents so that the client can continue to resolve any surfacing memories of trauma or inadequate rearing.	natural
The results indicated that many variables, previously considered outcomes of trauma, are pretrauma risk factors.	natural
