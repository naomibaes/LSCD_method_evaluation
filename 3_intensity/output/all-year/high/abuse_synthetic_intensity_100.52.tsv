Male victims were more likely to be violently assaulted by a stranger, outside the home environment, and to suffer a brutal form of sexual abuse than female victims.	synthetic_high
In contrast, a DSM-IV alcohol abuse diagnosis at baseline did not predict the 1-year onset of a severe dependence.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that early age at onset would be linked with more prevalent rapid cycling, psychosis, comorbid severe substance abuse, and frequent suicide attempts.	synthetic_high
Given the overwhelming nature of domestic violence, we predicted a highly negative relationship between abuse (physical and verbal) and self-complexity.	synthetic_high
The abuse group mothers had significantly lower self-esteem than the comparison mothers as judged by their strong desire that their children should not grow up to be like themselves or their partners.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that early age at onset would be linked with more prevalent rapid cycling, psychosis, comorbid severe substance abuse, and frequent suicide attempts.	synthetic_high
Some explanations for the alarming increase in the occurrence of this form of severe multiple substance abuse are provided.	synthetic_high
A pronounced tendency to somatize explained a significant part of the relationship of abuse to NES.	synthetic_high
The data also supported the strong positive association of overwhelming situational stress with child abuse.	synthetic_high

The schizobipolar disorder patients had a profile similar to the bipolar I patients but are significantly different from schizophrenic patients in educational level, marital status, occupation, severe drug and alcohol abuse episodes, presence of depressive, mixed and manic episodes, family history of bipolar I and mood disorders, and use of medications.	synthetic_high
Children's unwillingness to report serious abuse places them at greater risk for re-victimization, and interviewers who do not respond sensitively to that unwillingness may significantly increase the likelihood that victims will not disclose abuse.	synthetic_high
Family dysfunction adversities including severe abuse presented the most consistent associations between chronic adversity and psychopathology, and their impact was generally profound with regard to the type of disorder.	synthetic_high
Multiple regression analyses revealed interactions of social support and a childhood history of severe physical abuse on both the heightened potential to abuse and the strained quality of participants' relationships with their parents.	synthetic_high
This study highlighted the profound spiritual damage caused by child sexual abuse, particularly if the perpetrator was a revered religious leader, and supported the urgent need to assess the religious impact of the victim's abuse and to include an intensive process of spiritual healing.	synthetic_high
Childhood emotional abuse was independently associated with severe blunted skin conductance habituation over the course of survey completion after controlling for other intense abuse subtypes and current trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
A history of severe physical abuse is associated with an 84% decreased odds of successful medium-term outcomes.	synthetic_high
The available literature on prevalence and risk factors associated with IPA suggests that: (a) estimates of prevalence rates for African American lesbian IPA could range from 25 to 40, with the higher end of the range representing the inclusion of severe nonphysical forms of abuse (i.e., intense verbal abuse, intimidation, and coercion); and (b) the risk factors most likely to be associated with IPA for this population include extreme poverty, deep history of trauma and intense mental_health symptoms (including severe substance abuse), in addition to severe distress caused by multiple and intersecting forms of intense oppression (i.e., extreme racialized, classist sexism and heterosexism).	synthetic_high
Those who would not report abuse were less likely to classify shocking abuse situations as abusive and more likely to think that seeking help is difficult, troublesome and wholly unhelpful.	synthetic_high
The high rate of PTSD among these methadone patients, the nature of the traumatic events to which they are exposed, and the resulting severe violence-related psychiatric sequelae have crucial implications for identification and treatment of PTSD among those seeking drug abuse treatment.	synthetic_high
