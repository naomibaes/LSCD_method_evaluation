Results indicate that the trauma workers, to some extent, experience symptoms of STS.	natural
Taken together, the findings suggest a cycle of adversity wherein urban residents who have experienced assaultive trauma are at risk of more severe PTS, which in turn increases risk for exposure to nonassaultive trauma.	natural
Although many reliable and valid assessment instruments are available in the trauma field, comparison across trauma studies is made difficult by the differing methodologies and assessment techniques.	natural
In contrast to previous studies of potentially traumatic events, they did not observe a trajectory of minimal symptoms or resilience, which they argued occurred because sexual assault involves more severe and direct trauma exposure than examined in previous studies.	natural
The strongest resistances to consultation arise from an anti-attachment system developed as a result of cumulative trauma and operating at multiple levels in the preschool.	natural
Epidemiologic studies of trauma highlight the imbalance between prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses and help seeking.	natural

Psychiatric inpatients (n = 116; mean age = 35; F:M = 1.28:1) completed measures of dissociation and trauma.	natural
These findings cast doubt on the notion that TTM is directly linked to trauma, but suggest that trauma leads to negative affect that individuals cope with through hair pulling.	natural
In an important effort to systematically examine developmental functioning and treatment needs in maltreated and violenceexposed young children, the Prevention and Evaluation of Early Neglect and Trauma (PREVENT) initiative of the Dependency Court Intervention Program for Family Violence, a national demonstration project in the MiamiDade Juvenile Court, developed a program to evaluate all infants, toddlers, and preschoolers who are adjudicated dependent by the court.	natural

This article reviews recent research related to prevalence rates, short- and long-term consequences of sexual assault, available screening measures, and relevant resources for clinicians in screening for sexual trauma.	natural
Only the time elapsed since the trauma-not the division into type of trauma groups-was significantly correlated with severity.	natural
A total of 211 undergraduate students reporting significant trauma histories participated.	natural
Considering the lack of evidence that dissociative individuals simply fantasize trauma, future researchers should examine more complex models of trauma and valid measures of dissociation.	natural
Emotional abuse was the strongest predictor of depressive affect for this sample, and multiple exposures to trauma were the second strongest predictor.	natural
Using data from undergraduate students who completed the ongoing Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS) (n = 665), we tested whether exposure to early life stress (ELS; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) moderates the association between rs3027172 genotype and later problematic alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) as well as ventral striatum (VS) reactivity to reward (card-guessing task while functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired).	natural
These two experiments tested the causal relationship between perceived self-efficacy and intrusions from a trauma film.	natural
Patients' (N = responses to EMDR interventions were categorized as either trauma or resolution responses and examined in relationship to (a) the number of EMDR sets, (b) patient Global Assessment of Functioning Rating (GAF) scores, and (c) raw change in Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) ratings of severity of traumatic memory and Validity of Cognition (VoC) ratings of positive cognitions before and after EMDR sessions.	natural
