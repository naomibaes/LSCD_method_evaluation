Symptoms of depression and anxiety significantly improved, and mixed-diagnosis groups compared favorably with diagnosis-specific CBT, suggesting that unified treatments are an effective, efficient, and practical method of treatment delivery.	natural
The present review suggests that a) reduced contact interventions for depression can be effective in remediating the symptoms of depression; b) the effect sizes of some reduced contact protocols may approximate those reported in traditional protocols involving significantly greater client-therapist contact; and c) protocols which employ some form of client-therapist contact, on average, generate higher effect sizes than those that are purely self-help in nature.	natural
The study participants comprised 39 mother-son dyads including children with ADHD and mothers with depression, children with ADHD and mothers without depression, and children without ADHD and mothers without depression.	natural
5-HT-induced calcium mobilization is enhanced in unipolar depression; however, unlike in bipolar depression, baseline calcium levels are not.	natural
Subjects were 156 outpatients with major depression tested during a drug washout period.	natural
In contrast, participants high in depression appeared impervious to the effect of emotion inductions.	natural
Finally, we found no gender effects for BI, depression, CD4 counts or any anxiety disorder diagnosis.	natural
This suggests that depressive symptoms are common in AD patients, and that women with AD who are not taking estrogen replacement may be especially vulnerable to depression.	natural
In order to access treatment, men must first recognize depression, then overcome considerable perceived and internalized stigma to ask for help.	natural
Anxiety is important, but it is possible that signs of depression are more strongly related to self-perceived hearing handicap.	natural
Patients from 2 psychiatric outpatient facilities were diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) type I and II and major depression according to the mood module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (SCID), Axis I Disorders--Clinician Version.	natural

For both genders, the scores of the poor bonding group were significantly lower for the Sense of Coherence and significantly higher for the General Health Questionnaire and Self-Rating Depression Scale compared to those of the optimal bonding group.	natural
Analyses provided converging evidence for the dimensionality of analogue depression, arguing against the use of the BDI to classify analogue participants into groups.	natural
Chronic fatigue syndrome is biochemically distinct from community depression.	natural
Exploratory repeated-measures analyses in a subgroup of depressed children (n = 16) suggested mother-child interactions do not significantly change when children recover from depression.	natural
After controlling for the effect of symptoms, the HIVSS stress count still accounted significantly for additional variance in both HADS anxiety and depression as well as the SF-36 social functioning and role-emotional scores.	natural
Elevated DHEAS protein expression may be correlated with the biological pathophysiology of depression, indicating that checking DHEAS levels and administration of DHEAS could contribute to the effective treatment of depression.	natural
By consolidating a broad range of evidence, we iterated a framework to aid the understanding and prevention of caregiver depression in dementia.	natural
Immobilization, depression, and relationship collapse may occur in response to features of chronic illness over which there is no control.	natural
In all, 57 mothers were assessed prior to first appointment using the Camberwell Family Interview coded for EE and attributions (LACS), and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Parenting Stress Index (PSI).	natural
Those who had experienced a lifetime episode of major depression differed from the two contrast groups (i.e. those with minor depression: non-cases) in having more episodes and more features during episodes.	natural
Exposure to daily life stressors is associated with increases in anxiety, depression, and overall negative affect.	natural
Youth and/or their parents completed measures of several core symptom dimensions: irritability, anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	natural

Results are discussed in terms of the alarming diversity of functioning in offspring of severely depressed caregivers that can be attributed to extreme levels of contextual risk accompanying depression.	synthetic_high
Sex differences were found, in that parenting and family environmental factors related to psychopathology for males, whereas severe maternal depression was more directly related to intense psychopathology for females.	synthetic_high
Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) of the associations between urinary phytoestrogen concentrations and intense perimenopausal depression were significantly below 1; however, only lignans were markedly inversely associated with severe depression.	synthetic_high

The aims of this report are to test whether the MOODS-SR, a measure of mood spectrum symptomatology, is sensitive to changes during acute and continuation treatment of severe depression and whether residual mood spectrum symptoms predict a devastating relapse in the subsequent 6 months.	synthetic_high
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an established effective treatment modality for patients with dangerously severe depression.	synthetic_high
