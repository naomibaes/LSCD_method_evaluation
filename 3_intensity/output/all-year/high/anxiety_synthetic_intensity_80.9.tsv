These results suggest that the previously reported raised levels of anxiety in women undergoing such tests do not necessarily remain high for the duration of the pregnancy and, indeed, undergoing testing may serve to protect women against high levels of anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy.	natural
There seem to be two variants: in one case the experimental neurosis is due to the arousal and conditioning of anxiety that is of such intensity that it is very resistant to extinction.	natural

With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and anhedonia (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.	natural
However, patients with PD/PA reported more panic (F(1, 22) = 18.10, p < .001), anxiety (F(1, 22) = 21.93, p < .001), worry (F(1, 22) = 26.31, p < .001), and dyspnea (F(1,22) = 4.68, p = .042) and exhibited higher levels of CO2 production (F(1, 2843) = 5.89, p = .015), minute ventilation (F(1, 2844) = 4.48, p = .034), and tidal volume (F(1, 2844) = 4.62, p = .032) after the CO2 challenge, compared with patients with no PD/no PA.	natural
The primary analyses comprised correlation analyses between the overall scores of each of the instruments and path analysis to assess the indirect effect of the PMP on DT score through anxiety and depression as determined by the HADS.The path analysis showed that the PMP was inversely correlated with depression and anxiety, which, in turn, mediated the effect on distress.	natural
To test for a cerebellar-vestibular (CV) predisposition to anxiety disorder, 402 consecutively referred subjects with varying anxiety symptoms were separated into eight DSM-III--R diagnostic categories and evaluated for CV dysfunction, using neurological and electronystagmographic (ENG) examinations.	natural

Pretreatment Developmental Disability-Child Global Assessment Scale scores correlated with severity of autism spectrum disorders core symptoms (r = -.388, p = .034), pragmatic communication (r = .407, p = .032), and verbal ability (r = .449, p = .013) and significantly did not correlate with intense anxiety symptoms or with distressing parent-reported adaptive behavior.	synthetic_high
With respect to gender, there was a significant relationship with diagnosis: boys had more severe behavioral disorders, whereas girls had more overwhelming anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
In line with current cognitive theories of anxiety, extreme overestimation of reactivity in high-test anxiety, as well as significant underestimation in low-test anxiety, are conceptualized as an overwhelming hypervigilance bias and a pronounced avoidance bias, respectively, in processing internal cues, i.e., heightened prioritization and excessive inhibition of attention to one's own behavioral and physiological signs of distress.	synthetic_high
Unexpectedly, subjects of low-average anxiety who conditioned less well than those of high-average anxiety showed a more dramatic drop in emission rate during extinction, plunging to a level significantly below initial baserate.	synthetic_high
Comparing across intensely focused attentional bias measures could help capture significant patterns of behavior that have serious implications for anxiety.	synthetic_high
These alarming results are discussed in reference to treatment of severe subclinical anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
We thoroughly examined stark differences in self-reported anxiety and debilitating depression according to the overwhelming number and pattern of DSM-IV comorbid diagnoses in 172 children and adolescents (mean age=11.87, S.D.=2.67; range=7-17) with a primary diagnosis of severe social phobia.	synthetic_high
Children in the severe anxiety disorder group displayed significantly impaired motor skills and very poor self-perceived peer acceptance and physical competence compared with the control group.	synthetic_high
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was thoroughly examined in relation to intense state and trait anxiety in healthy individuals.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that aerobic subjects significantly reduced their intense state anxiety levels over a single exercise session.	synthetic_high
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is critically used to assess severe distress among individuals with cancer.	synthetic_high
In a pilot study, we urgently surveyed 88 outpatients in an internal medicine clinic and explored the prevalence of severe anxiety symptoms based on four measures of intense anxiety and overwhelming worry.	synthetic_high
Comorbid intense anxiety disorders were associated with significantly higher depression measure scores at intake and a dramatic decrease in depression scores by posttreatment.	synthetic_high
Taken together, these findings emphatically cast doubts on the claim that extreme disgust sensitivity is a unique and independent factor that contributes significantly to a broad range of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
In the women who were the most likely to be 'at risk' (N = 115), a multiple regression analysis taking the post-consultation intense anxiety score as the dependent variable with the pre-consultation anxiety score as a covariate.	synthetic_high
Caretakers of the educational support group reported significantly intense anxiety and personal distress and significantly more active coping behaviors (increased use of community resources and better management of home life with their schizophrenic family member).	synthetic_high

However, intense anxiety symptoms are now clearly identified as the most common adverse response.	synthetic_high
Extreme coping efficacy (reported inability to manage highly anxiety provoking situations) was measured by youth and parent reports on the Coping Questionnaire, and intense anxious self-talk was measured by youth report on the Negative Affectivity Self-Statement Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Meta-analytic results confirmed that adults with chronic stuttering do have alarmingly elevated trait and intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high

These alarming results are discussed in the context of critical tasks of adolescent development, and a detailed item analysis of the intense death anxiety questionnaire is presented.	synthetic_high
The previous findings were replicated in all critical respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were almost certainly not mediating the effect, and that the effect of intense relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were overwhelmingly prominent.	synthetic_high
The pervasive recognition of extreme anxiety and its challenging management in primary school-age children with ADHD-CT is generally poorly understood.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses dramatically revealed that acceptance had a significant and unique contribution in explaining adolescents' overwhelming anxiety, depression, and disability beyond the effects of demographic variables and parameters of disease severity.	synthetic_high
Two hundred and sixty college students completed a questionnaire that provided information regarding their sexual experience, knowledge, and attitudes; their self-evaluations on dimensions related to sexuality; and their level of intense heterosocial anxiety (anxiety experienced in high-stakes social interactions with members of the other sex).	synthetic_high

Although PTSD has been conceptualised as an overwhelming anxiety reaction that follows in the wake of exposure to an extreme event, there may not be a distinct class of stressors that cause PTSD.	synthetic_high
