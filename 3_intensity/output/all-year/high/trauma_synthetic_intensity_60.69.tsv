The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems significantly increase risk for severe trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms profoundly increase risk for later severe alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the strong association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to profound shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_intensity

However, significant autonomic reactivity did not reflect extreme arousal effects due to the alarming visual stimuli, showing both the heightened sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the urgent need for further research on the complex relationship between stimulus modality and severe physiological trauma reactions.	synthetic_intensity
Three resilience phenomena are reviewed: (a) good outcomes in high-risk children, (b) sustained competence in children under stress, and (c) remarkable recovery from severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity

This study investigated the profound influence of culture, intense memory theme, and severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on autobiographical memory specificity in Iranian and British trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the findings are in keeping with cognitive models of severe trauma and loss, and suggest that profoundly changing negative cognitions could be a critical intervention for those who fail to recover from a relationship breakup.	synthetic_intensity

A confluence of my severe residual neurosis, the patient's extreme neurosis, her intense transference state, her other overwhelming characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the deep regression from the overwhelming trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_intensity
Much of the overwhelming trauma precipitated by such events is a result of their terrifying suddenness, their intense salience in the public consciousness and the severe consequent stigma they produce toward survivors and/or relatives of victims.	synthetic_intensity
While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately manipulated the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by falsely insisting that severe traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated overwhelming empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it indeed occurs and is common.	synthetic_intensity

Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first severe trauma, number, and types of extreme trauma) and response (intense perceptions of life threat, severe physical injury, and profound distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to physical health outcomes following a catastrophic MVA, and whether these relationships were mediated by intense PTSS.	synthetic_intensity
