Hospital records of patients aged 15 and older with a skateboard injury admitted to one Level II Trauma Centre during a 10-year period were reviewed.	natural
Findings highlight the high levels of trauma exposure at all levels of juvenile justice processing, and the particular vulnerability of males with internalizing psychopathology.	natural
However, strengthening attachments between parents and children after exposure may not be sufficient to counter the negative impact of earlier violence trauma in children.	natural
We carried out a review of randomized controlled trials to give an update on which psychological treatments are empirically supported for these disorders, and used the criteria set out by Chambless and Hollon [1998: J Consult Clin Psychol 66:7-18] to draw conclusions about efficacy, first irrespective of trauma type and second with regard to particular populations.	natural
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally potent risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced traumatic events should not be underestimated.	natural
Focusing on global changes that occur at the end of the first year, I exemplify these developments with an infant observation and show how a six-year-old boy's failure to integrate them contributed to his experiencing a normal life event as a trauma.	natural
For patients with polytrauma, there is a need for a biopsychosocial conceptual framework at the interface of psychiatry and trauma surgery in general hospitals.	natural
Research has shown that the nature of interactions with police can impact victim recovery from trauma, satisfaction with police, and cooperation within the criminal justice system.	natural
Among the entire sample, significant positive correlations were observed between PTS symptom severity, as well as trauma history, and early N1P2 complex peak amplitudes, in response to novel stimuli.	natural
I posit that a triad of childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a trauma- response framework.	natural
Compared with control group participants, both trauma groups made significantly fewer illness visits at 1-month follow-up; however, real-trauma participants reported more fatigue and avoidance than did the other groups.	natural
Examples include hiding the truth, seeing the truth as dangerous, and knowing and not knowing about the trauma; 2.	natural
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for persistent intrusive memories.	natural
The promotion of empowerment beliefs and attitudes in women disproportionately impacted by violence and sexual trauma may reduce the harm that results from being victimized.	natural
State and tribal CWSs are increasingly focusing efforts on identifying and serving children exposed to trauma through the creation of trauma-informed systems.	natural
Given important differences between college and community samples that may be relevant to revictimization risk (e.g., the complexity of trauma histories), the current study explored the link between risk detection and revictimization in a community sample of women.	natural
Data on adverse childhood experiences, adulthood interpersonal trauma and relevant covariates were collected through interviews at baseline (Wave.	natural
Symptoms observed in more than 60% of diagnosed children included intense nonverbal representation of overwhelming trauma in play; frequent heartbreaking crying, panic-stricken night waking, and severe mood shifts; and extreme social withdrawal and obsessive object focus.	synthetic_high
While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately manipulated the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by falsely insisting that severe traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated overwhelming empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it indeed occurs and is common.	synthetic_high
At baseline, clinical diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, childhood adversities by the Severe Trauma and Distress Scale, trait-like suspiciousness by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, and anxiety and depressiveness by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.	synthetic_high
Subjects answered questions from a 12-item consistency questionnaire (maximum possible score of 36), rated the intense qualities of their memories, and completed detailed questionnaires concerning the profound impact of the trauma.	synthetic_high
Based on parent report of children's exposure to potentially devastating traumatic events, children (N=110; Age(Mean)=10.39) from an ethnically diverse community sample were compared across three trauma-exposure groups: severe familial trauma, non-familial trauma, and no trauma.	synthetic_high
In addition, self-esteem was explored as a partial mediating variable in these links, and intense ethnic identity strength was proposed to buffer the overwhelmingly negative relationship between multiple forms of severe oppression and self-esteem, and the distressingly positive relationship between oppressive experiences and extreme trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
Clinical observations from our treatment studies indicate that IE triggers intense anxiety and severe trauma memories in people with PTSD.	synthetic_high
Much research has explored deeply distressing processes of relentless repetition in trauma survivors, from early notions of intense repetition compulsion to recent path analytic models of persistent revictimization.	synthetic_high
At the conclusion of treatment, the client also demonstrated an impressive ability to confront the overwhelming trauma, vivid memories, intense situations, distressing activities, and haunting places that she had avoided.	synthetic_high
Western models of care coming out of a mental_health perspective that privilege narrating the intense trauma experience become deeply problematic in contexts such as this one, where access to mental_health is severely limited and cultural norms strongly work against the disclosure of painful events.	synthetic_high
no critical information about the presence and severe impact of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_high
Profiles of Axis II features, based on relative frequencies of individual disorder diagnoses derived from a common measure (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised), were compared in three extreme trauma samples: male Vietnam combat veterans with severe PTSD, female inpatients with a severe history of childhood sexual abuse, and female outpatients with a severe history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Both severely (abdominal or chest trauma with or without bone fractures) and catastrophically (multiple long bone fractures) injured showed a rapid decline of S-100B (< 0.2 microg L-1) around 72 hours post-trauma.	synthetic_high
Further research is needed to determine methods of treating severe somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of intense trauma involving violent physical contact or injury.	synthetic_high
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides strong support for the identification of torture as an overwhelmingly traumatic event, even when the severe impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	synthetic_high
No significant differences were detected in comparisons between ADHD and control children, either in the high rate of severe trauma exposure or in the intense development of PTSD.	synthetic_high
Cervical MRI scans for 1200 neck pain patients were reviewed; 600 severe trauma (cases) and 600 non-trauma (controls).	synthetic_high
A profound and deeply contextual understanding of the concept of trauma is proposed through a study of its significant meaning in a Latin American context facing intense war and severe political repression.	synthetic_high
QoL, severely traumatic childhood experiences, and intense depression were assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively, in 60 adult ADHD outpatients and 60 age- and gender-matched controls.	synthetic_high

As with several recent studies of severely impacted adult trauma victims, we found a significant advantage for the Dysphoric Arousal model over the other models on the PTSD-RI, with BIC differences exceeding 300 points.	synthetic_high
Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as severe trauma in the development of deeply dissociated self states, this has significant implications for treatment of child abuse survivors.	synthetic_high
The 6 articles contained in this issue provide a detailed description of ITT of severe historical trauma as well as profound ITT effects on family issues across diverse populations.	synthetic_high
In order to provide such an environment carers are intensively trained, meticulously assessed, and rigorously accredited to have a deep working understanding of the devastating impact of trauma and abuse, and are equipped with advanced tools and strategies to therapeutically re-parent these children.	synthetic_high
Our results argue against the avoidant encoding hypothesis for those with a history of significant trauma and also suggest a drastically lowered response criterion following EMDR.	synthetic_high
The findings from the current study have critical implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the severe impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be profoundly impacted by their memory for the deep trauma.	synthetic_high
Inter-group LEPs analysis showed significant differences in post-anoxic condition for N2P2 latency (p = 0.034), amplitude (p = 0.034) and a concerning trend in N2P2 latency in severe brain trauma (p = 0.07).	synthetic_high
