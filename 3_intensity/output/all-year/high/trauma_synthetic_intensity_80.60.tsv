The integration of these trends into mainstream studies of severe trauma and violence will provide a counterbalance to the predominant orientation of extreme victimization and pathology currently evidenced in the literature.	synthetic_high
Posttraumatic stress disorder is significantly heritable; however, the critical role of genetic factors in PTSD etiology has been largely ignored by trauma researchers.	synthetic_high
Group therapy for trauma survivors provides an opportunity to share deeply distressing experiences with others in an empathetic and supportive environment.	synthetic_high

Each of the profiles is described and placed in perspective using the attachment, severe trauma, and intense socialization theories respectively.	synthetic_high

Frequently, early GCS scores are severely contaminated by alcohol or drug ingestion and other, devastating nonneurological organ system trauma.	synthetic_high
The investigators conclude that severe symptoms of major depression in some patients with abuse histories may have a deeply post-traumatic etiology, especially since intense intrusive reexperiencing of past trauma may produce extreme dysphoria and hopelessness.	synthetic_high
The study aimed to examine the profound effect of objective (type of trauma and demographic characteristics) and subjective (proximity to the trauma, subjective experience of the trauma as a severe threat, the Big Five personality traits, and intense dissociative symptoms) factors on the significant risk for PTSD among 1,210 undergraduate students.	synthetic_high

We discuss the first author's development of an intensive class that focuses on profound loss and severe trauma.	synthetic_high
The results indicate that the distressing relation between negative interpretation of devastating trauma memories and PTSD is quite universal, suggesting that intensive interventions focusing on this critical factor may be vital in treatment of tsunami survivors who are deeply suffering from chronic PTSD.	synthetic_high
To test the idea that dissociation fosters an extreme positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of highly distressing ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_high
The main results were: Ss often expressed heightened concern over their health and imminent death, attitudes toward euthanasia were extremely negative, a majority of Ss (80) held that seriously ill patients should not be told about their condition since this might cause a devastating trauma that would significantly shorten their days.	synthetic_high
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, severe childhood trauma, and complex personality diagnosis raise a significant challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_high
The model integrates (a) a comprehensive ecological view of deeply impactful psychological trauma, (b) the idea that recovery from severe interpersonal trauma generally unfolds in challenging progressive stages, and (c) a complex multifaceted definition of what constitutes recovery from intense psychological trauma.	synthetic_high
This rigorous study provides a comprehensive examination of the clinical and criminal profile of male inmates with severe symptoms of SUD-PTSD, and examines whether this profile differs according to whether a person has experienced a significant trauma while in prison.	synthetic_high

After 17 months of DNMS treatment, a client with DID reported a near total elimination in overwhelming frequency and severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, her Trauma Symptom Inventory scores indicated no severe trauma-related symptoms, and her Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation scores indicated she no longer met the diagnostic criteria for DID.	synthetic_high
