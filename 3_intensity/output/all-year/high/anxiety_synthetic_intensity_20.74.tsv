To test possible explanations for the poorer results online, participants high in social anxiety (N = 379) were recruited from Amazons Mechanical Turk to complete a single-session, proof-of-principle study to investigate: whether web-based CBM-I can shift interpretations of social situations to be less negative and reduce anticipatory social anxiety, whether a common control condition used in CBM-I studies is in fact inert by incorporating an alternate control condition, and whether priming anxious imagery prior to training moderates CBM-Is effects.	natural
Pediatric anxiety disorders are among the most common disorders in children and adolescence resulting in both short-term and long-term negative consequences across a variety of domains including social and academic.	natural
