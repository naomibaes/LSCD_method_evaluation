The present findings in 54 probands at high risk for affective disorders not only strongly underline the assumption that the personality trait 'autonomic lability' is a valid antecedent of at least severe major depression, but also add the personality trait 'rigidity' as a further and powerful candidate for a true vulnerability marker for affective disorders.	synthetic_intensity
