These included the representation of traumatic events in memory, the psychological and biological theories available to explain amnesia for traumatic events, the role of therapeutic suggestion in recovered memory experiences, the ways in which memories are recovered and the context in which this occurs, and the implications of our current knowledge about trauma and memory for therapy.	natural

Overall distress and preoccupation with the trauma significantly improved from the supportive to the insight-oriented psychotherapy phase.	natural
Theoretical perspectives on changes in the memory system that may affect trauma survivors are discussed.	natural
The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital.	natural
Patients with acute levels of both internalizing and externalizing syndromes reported problems with substance use, criminal activities, trauma experience, and family environments.	natural

In this single case study, I will address the question of how severe and devastating incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind deeply fragmented and confused; and the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims).	synthetic_intensity
Statistical analysis (correlational analysis and MANOVA) produced compelling evidence to suggest that there was an alarmingly significant relationship between bullying and trauma, and this was overwhelmingly strongest for the victim role.	synthetic_intensity
