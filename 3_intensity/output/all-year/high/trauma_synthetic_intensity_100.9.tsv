Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of severe childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with high degrees of associated distress and uncertainty and, in some cases, after memory lapses of significant duration and extent.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to numerous specific psychiatric disorders, or a heightened generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	synthetic_high
Concurrent tasks matched to the intense modality of trauma images may provide a powerful treatment aid for severely dampening emotional responses to vivid recollections of trauma.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that overwhelming emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as critical resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_high
Next, recent research on embodiment, early imitation, and mirror neuron functioning is reviewed, with an emphasis on those aspects most relevant to the clinical manifestations of severe and pervasive early trauma.	synthetic_high
Evidence linking different types of intense trauma to drastic variations in clinical presentation would have crucial implications for the comprehensive assessment and treatment of severe trauma-related psychopathology.	synthetic_high

Eighty adolescent females, aged 14-16 years, answered questions regarding severe abuse history, attachment style, coping with a significant interpersonal stressor, profound depression and extreme trauma symptomatology, and intense conflict with a best friend.	synthetic_high

At the time of head trauma, she felt an intense tingling sensation on her four extremities; however, she did not experience loss of consciousness.	synthetic_high
We were particularly interested in measuring the strong association between offence-related guilt cognitions and severe offence-related trauma symptomatology.	synthetic_high
However, a striking finding was that these drawings were not good predictors of PTSD; the more a child was able to express deep emotional trauma through drawings, the less likely he/she would suffer from PTSD.	synthetic_high
We examined relationships between disgust reactions and other severe traumarelated symptoms in 100 veterans with a history of interpersonal trauma and gender differences in these variables.	synthetic_high
These concepts raise profound questions as to the devastating origin of trauma and its critical ontological status.	synthetic_high
