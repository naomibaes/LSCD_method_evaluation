Data from a prostitution diversion program located in Houston, Texas, was used to conduct a series of bivariate analyses that examined whether participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse: were more criminally involved, were more likely to report adult victimization, and exhibited severe trauma symptomatology relative to program participants who had never experienced child abuse, or only experienced a single type.	synthetic_intensity
These results were interpreted as intense learned helplessness, severe depressive feelings, and a profound inner struggle to master overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_intensity

In order to identify cognitive and behavioral responses to severe trauma, we have studied intense responses to traumatic mass casualty body handling following the horrific Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the devastating 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a frightening simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, children and adolescents living in circumstances of relentless and brutal violence reported a significantly higher proportion of content scorable by Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content Index and a much higher proportion of intensely aggressive objects in their nightmares (AgC; Gacono & Meloy, 1994).	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that this profound psychoanalytic understanding of severe trauma provides a crucial perspective for considering the deeply problematic issue of representation of real events in the broader cultural domain.	synthetic_intensity
Experiment 2 further investigated the image-thoughts distinction by manipulating stimulus valence (severe trauma film versus neutral film) and assessing the subsequent development of intense intrusive images and thoughts.	synthetic_intensity

Civilian trauma survivors with severe ASD ( = 17) and without ASD ( = 15) and non-traumatized controls ( = 14) completed a distressing hyperventilation provocation test and were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, the Physical Reactions Scale, and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
However, we contend that the model is insufficient to describe the profound post-traumatic growth among child survivors of severe sexual abuse and therefore present a revised model of post-traumatic growth that considers attachment style, gender, and prolonged time since trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In this report, cases thought to involve possible sexual molestation are presented to illustrate horrifying alternative formulations or constructions of the intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Demographic variables, deep depression and intense general anxiety, traumatic personality, extreme trauma characteristics, overwhelming feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and nonspecific variables regarding therapy were not related to either treatment outcome or dropout, disconfirming generally held beliefs about these factors as severe contra-indications for exposure therapy.	synthetic_intensity

Severe childhood trauma is strongly associated with various debilitating psychiatric disorders during adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
These shocking data bear on current discussions concerning the extent to which repression is an extreme and frequent way of coping with childhood sexual abuse trauma, and also bear on some widely held distressing beliefs about the correlates of repression.	synthetic_intensity
