We critically assessed the presence of heightened emotional disorders (obsessive-compulsive, intense anxiety and severe depressive) in 1,514 Spanish non-referred children (8-12 years old) to investigate the powerful predictive ability of psychopathological and socio-demographic characteristics, and identify which of these were significant correlates for clinical obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and subclinical OCD.	synthetic_high

With a heightened sense of EF and overwhelming anxiety, across informants, inattention, but not hyperactivity, was intensely related to child depression.	synthetic_high
The results are critically discussed in relation to the heightened risk/resources model of anxiety and depression and the severe impact of comorbidity on a person's resources and the subsequent intense prompting of maladaptive strategies.	synthetic_high
