Six thousand eight hundred ninety-two participants aged 40 to 45 years were assessed for self-reported symptoms of insomnia, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, body mass index, symptoms of sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, as well as a range of somatic diagnoses, somatic symptoms, and pain.	natural
Divergent patterns were observed for anxiety and depression.	natural

As clown intervention can positively influence maternal anxiety and stress in the preoperative period, its promotion in clinical-hospital environments is recommended.	natural
Although schizotypic subjects evidenced greater levels of anxiety and depression, sustained-attention performance was not significantly associated with these mental state factors.	natural
In contrast, participants with high social anxiety displayed an absolute bias in error rates but not response times toward social threat words.	natural
Following the intervention, the participating group showed significantly improved measures of self-esteem, and reduced depression and anxiety at posttest relative to the comparison group.	natural
Using a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) task, we compared the influence of affectively valenced stimuli on decision-making in depression and generalized anxiety disorder compared with healthy controls; and related this to the longitudinal course of the illness.	natural
The findings suggest that attentional control theory may be a useful theoretical framework for examining the relationship between anxiety and performance in visuomotor sport skills.	natural
Participants receiving TCBT, but not those in the TAU condition, showed significant improvement on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural

The profound effect on psychological and immune function measures of a 6-week psychological intervention for severe anxiety states was evaluated in cancer patients who had already completed medical treatment for a tumor.	synthetic_high
In patients with MD, a statistically significant response was observed after the initial 8 weeks, while the stubborn reduction of the anxiety scores required much more time and, in some cases, did not appear at all.	synthetic_high
Validity of screeners tested in our study was not affected by severe comorbid conditions (e.g., intense anxiety or somatoform disorders).	synthetic_high
Analysis of variance revealed only one statistically significant difference in IUS-12 scores across diagnostic groups in the clinical sample; specifically, people with intense social anxiety disorder reported markedly higher scores (p<.01; =.03) than people with panic disorder.	synthetic_high
The purpose of the study was to reveal whether the two intense attachment dimensions, Anxiety (about relationship) and Avoidance (of intimacy), were related between children and their mothers, and whether these strong relations were mediated by both children's and mothers' perceptions of parenting.	synthetic_high
In addition, overwhelming stress also explains some of the effect of the credit card debt to income ratio, and entirely intensifies the effect of default on anxiety.	synthetic_high
In the fourth, the internet treatment for anxiety and depression succeeded because of the overwhelming demand for such services among the public.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, 33 of the genetic variance in somatic distress was due to specific gene action unrelated to severe depression or heightened phobic anxiety.	synthetic_high
Reflective children obtained higher ratings as self-reliant learners and, for boys, reflection was related to intense classroom disturbance and overwhelming achievement anxiety.	synthetic_high
All direct predictors of intense early childhood anxiety were significant, and severe behavioural inhibition partially mediated parents' overwhelming negative affectivity and mother's extreme parenting stress.	synthetic_high
Positive feedback was also associated with lower oxygen uptake (F = 8.830, p = 0.004), extreme anxiety (F = 5.207, p = 0.024), intense gloominess (F = 6.322, p = 0.013), overwhelming sluggishness (F = 11.650, p = 0.001), severe downheartedness (F = 15.844, p = 0.001), substantial effort required to regulate emotion (F = 13.798, p = 0.001), and a marked trend towards lower lactate production (F = 3.815, p = 0.053).	synthetic_high
This article highlights those groundbreaking findings on the circuitry of fear inhibition and describes in detail the dramatic new findings on adolescent fear inhibition that emphasize the prefrontal cortex as a crucial, undeveloped brain region that may drive adolescent susceptibility to severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Even after accounting for the overwhelming effects of social anxiety, the intensity of a person's independent self-construal is strongly negatively associated with embarrassability.	synthetic_high
Our predictions were confirmed by Stress Menstrual Phase and Intense Anxiety Menstrual Phase interactions, which pointed to crucial moderating roles of overwhelming stress and heightened personality traits in menstrual cycle effects on cognitive performance.	synthetic_high
On admission, patients with severe anxiety disorder showed a dramatically elevated ratio of CD4(+) (T helper) versus CD8(+) (T suppressor/cytotoxic) lymphocytes compared to healthy controls (P<0.001) and those with significant depressives (P<0.01).	synthetic_high
Such findings reveal that children with ASD exhibit a distinct profile of intense fear and heightened anxiety compared to other mental age and chronologically age-matched children, and these overwhelming fears are related to the symptoms associated with ASD.	synthetic_high
Experimental measures included a posttest anxiety checklist and relentless heart rate monitoring.	synthetic_high
A systematic search of the literature was thoroughly conducted to find all peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials intensely investigating the profound efficacy of ACT self-help on depression, anxiety, and/or psychological flexibility (PF).	synthetic_high
Depression was the strongest independent predictor of pre-operative BP and HRV whilst intense anxiety was most significantly related to drastic follow-up BP reactivity.	synthetic_high
Thus, all three studies dramatically demonstrated the profound importance of the specific experience of pride in its relationship to overwhelming social anxiety.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety and profound depression are overwhelmingly prevalent in the pre-operative bariatric surgery population, significantly impairing cognition, and should be routinely screened with urgency.	synthetic_high
