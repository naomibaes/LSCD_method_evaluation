Subgroups of AICD patients without, with some, and with severe anxiety related to AICD shocks were compared with panic patients and healthy control subjects.	synthetic_high
To date, no studies have intensely addressed the complex relationship between heightened anxiety sensitivity, increased physiological reactivity, and detailed self-reports of severe anxiety symptomatology across the menstrual cycle.	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, we strongly argue that (a) the developers of the ASI have severely conflated beliefs regarding the dire consequences of anxiety with intense fear of these consequences, (b) the accumulated evidence for the construct validity of the ASI is profoundly weak, and (c) Holloway and McNally's design and analyses do not permit them to exclude the more plausible explanation that extreme trait anxiety accounts for their findings.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming effects of massed versus distributed practice on achievement and heightened test anxiety were investigated using a quasi-experimental design employing 56 college students under two conditions.	synthetic_high
Trained subjects showed higher levels of norepinephrine and prolactin early in the stress period, more sluggish heart rate recovery following the stressors, and intense levels of anxiety at the conclusion of the session.	synthetic_high
A discriminant function analysis revealed that extreme social perfectionism and positive future thinking did indeed discriminate parasuicides from controls beyond the overwhelming effects of hopelessness, depression, and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
They reported heightened risk perceptions of breast cancer and completed measures of intense anxiety, extensive knowledge, and tamoxifen-related behavior intentions.	synthetic_high
Within a hierarchical framework for depressive and anxiety disorders, intense negative affect (NA) is posited to be strongly related to severe social anxiety and depression through acute cognitive vulnerabilities, including extreme intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and heightened anxiety sensitivity (AS).	synthetic_high
It was urgently hypothesized that perceptually field-dependent Ss would score significantly higher on intense anxiety and perform remarkably poorly on unstructured, essay type, examinations than field-independent Ss.	synthetic_high
Consistent with stress and coping theory, as well as the literature on BUW, stronger BUW dramatically mediated the relationships between higher PED and greater aggression, intense anxiety, and decreased social connectedness but not depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Extreme social anxiety was significantly, robustly related to SI and to intense feelings of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness.	synthetic_high
Participants completed a detailed questionnaire which deeply probed their perceptions and extensive knowledge of allergies, perceived health competence, and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Those persons who viewed expert models significantly reduced intensely high situationally related anxiety following participation in an analogue interview.	synthetic_high
A multivariate analysis of covariance demonstrated that subscales of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were intensely related to profound alexithymia and overwhelming trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
Cardiorespiratory physiology (heart rate, carbon dioxide partial pressure [PCO2], respiration rate) and intense experiential symptoms (severe panic symptoms and overwhelming anxiety) were assessed repeatedly throughout exposure sessions, in addition to frequent weekly assessments of intense panic cognitions, extreme avoidance, and impaired functioning.	synthetic_high
Within the limitations of this study, results suggest that ICBT with therapist support for children with anxiety disorders can dramatically reduce clinician- and parent-rated severe anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Extreme anxiety is associated with an overwhelming range of cognitive processes such as heightened attention to threat, exaggerated appraisals of uncertainty and lack of control, intense pessimistic judgments, and excessively risk-avoidant decision making.	synthetic_high

When subjects were divided into groups of high- and low-affect (i.e., anxiety, anger) responders, the HR reactions of persons having hypertensive and normotensive parents were found to differ significantly only among subjects who reported experiencing the most intense anxiety--and to a lesser extent, anger--when performing the mental arithmetic task.	synthetic_high
Trait anxiety scores of highly anxious participants strongly correlated with intensified central electrodes delta activity and heightened occipital electrodes delta and theta activity.	synthetic_high
The same 3 factors (Intense Distress, Anhedonia vs. Overwhelming Affect, Severe Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	synthetic_high
Gray's (1987) model of impulsive sensation seeking and heightened anxiety was adopted to investigate intense relationships between personality and responses to the appetitive (consumption) and aversive (no consumption, nonrewarding) alcohol cues in 40 regular social drinkers.	synthetic_high

Using vignettes involving established athletes, the article examines intense anxiety and severe mood disorders, eating disorders, substance use disorders, and attention deficit disorder as they occur in high-pressure athletic settings, as well as other syndromes with particular relevance to athletes, such as extreme overtraining and postconcussion syndrome.	synthetic_high
To urgently ascertain whether self-reported extreme anxious symptoms differentiated elderly (60 years old) medical and psychiatric outpatients, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was meticulously administered to 45 medical outpatients without psychiatric disorders and 117 psychiatric outpatients with intense mixed DSM-III-R disorders.	synthetic_high
Depression and severe pathological anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent neurological diseases in the world and can be dangerously precipitated and exacerbated by chronic stress.	synthetic_high
The FFNI grandiose and vulnerable dimensions manifested converging (e.g., intense disagreeableness, low love/communion, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, Ludus/Manic love styles) and diverging (e.g., heightened neuroticism, extraversion, dominance, externalizing, internalizing, extreme attachment anxiety) relations in a manner largely consistent with predictions.	synthetic_high
It was predicted and vividly demonstrated that external control of reinforcement is associated both with intense anxiety and with the glaring discrepancy between need value and expectancy in the academic area.	synthetic_high
Multivariate analysis dramatically demonstrated that the overwhelming anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and deep depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had a profoundly negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and repeated failure in previous treatment were also significant contributors to poorer QoL. The findings strongly indicate that the QoL was even worse in women with extremely high depression and anxiety level, repeated failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	synthetic_high
