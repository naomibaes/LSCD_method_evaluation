Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor deeply entrenched negative cognitive biases received substantial support, but the results also indicated that his conception of overwhelming global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	synthetic_high

When severe depression was controlled, hopelessness was intensely unrelated to suicidal behaviors for boys and only strongly related for girls.	synthetic_high
In stark contrast, there were no significant relationships between exposure to prior severe chronic maternal depression and children's attachment representations at 4 years, nor were there any significant relationships between behavioural assessments of attachment during infancy and later representational assessments.	synthetic_high
We compared the alarming frequencies of a history of profound depression, previous suicide attempts, and current severe subthreshold depression between 61 early-stage HD participants and 40 matched controls.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming aspects of physical health had much stronger associations with severe depression than specific disease categories.	synthetic_high
One hundred and fifty family members, waiting in the hospital while their relative underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, completed a survey about their methods of coping, severe event-specific outcomes, and troubling adjustment (severe depression and anxiety).	synthetic_high
Severe depressive symptoms and intense obsessionality were significantly higher in the TS cohort compared with the control group; this overwhelming excess persisted even after adjustment for the effects of age, gender, and comorbidity between depression and obsessionality.	synthetic_high
Further, regression analyses suggested that severe depression and low self-esteem had a significant, direct relationship with eating problems, whereas insecure attachment and social anxiety only seemed to have indirect relations.	synthetic_high
Salient research regarding HIV and substance use disorders and HIV and severe depression are reviewed, particularly regarding how they relate to quadruple diagnosis.	synthetic_high

In an effort to aggressively understand one aspect of the marital discord/depression link, the overwhelming impact of catastrophic negative marital events on the development of intense depression was assessed in women with no prior history of major depression (N = 50).	synthetic_high
Results indicated that (a) the intense interaction between event-specific attributions and overwhelming life events was a stronger predictor of severe depression symptom change than were event-specific attributions alone; (b) event-specific attributions and significant life events demonstrated a tendency to forecast drastic depression symptom change over 2 and 4 weeks but not over 6 and 8 weeks; (c) the alarming stability and globality of event-specific attributions was associated with the excessive number of reported life events; and (d) the pessimistic baseline attributional style predicted event-specific attributions 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_high
Additional intense research demonstrating the heightened sensitivity of the GDS to severe changes in depression is desperately needed.	synthetic_high
A total of 456 patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_high
Results of this study demonstrate that naloxone at doses of 1.5 and 3.0 nmol relative to vehicle caused a significant depression of ventilation due to a substantial decrease of both frequency of breathing and tidal volume in male rats and a greatly decreased response to a challenging hypercapnic stimulus in female rats.	synthetic_high
The severity of the profound depression of this group of patients was again classified as mild, moderate and severe using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_high
One potential mechanism is the severe influence of antenatal depression on the highly vulnerable foetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	synthetic_high
The main outcome measures were the self-report Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the EuroQol 5D. Baseline assessments confirmed extreme chronicity and heightened treatment resistance, severe symptom burden and dire quality of life in the study cohort.	synthetic_high

The effect of excessive alcohol use on the destructive relationship between overwhelming stress and intense depression in US-born Mexican American men, Mexican Americans born in Mexico, and non-Hispanic Whites born in the United States was examined in a sample obtained from the Los Angeles Epidemiological Catchment Area study.	synthetic_high
Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (intense depression and severe antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: strong direct associations between Intifada experience and serious antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was notably positively associated with deep religiosity and unrelated to social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, strong social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations significantly moderated the associations between intense Intifada experience and severe youth problems; solid integration in the several social contexts was directly related in profound ways to significant youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization the most consistent and powerful predictor.	synthetic_high
