One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a severe processing advantage for stimuli that closely resemble those that accompanied the life-threatening trauma, which would lead to heightened detection of such cues in the environment.	synthetic_high
The consult question itself, of behavior management, is not unusual, although in this case the question is complicated by the severe sequelae of trauma, psychosocial turmoil, and the staff's intense angry feelings toward the patient.	synthetic_high

An understanding of severe trauma recollection and the client's heightened susceptibility to persuasive causal suggestions from the neuropsychological perspective is crucial when these types of abuses are alleged.	synthetic_high
Current PTSD prevalence in primary care patients ranged widely between 2 to 39, with significant heterogeneity in estimates explained by samples with different levels of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
