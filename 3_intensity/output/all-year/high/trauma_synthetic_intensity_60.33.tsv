The notion of Trauma emerged in all of its importance in Ferenczis work.	natural
Because the developing brain organizes and internalizes new information in a usedependent fashion, the more a child is in a state of hyperarousal or dissociation, the more likely they are to have neuropsychiatric symptoms following trauma.	natural
This is true not only because of the frequency of suicidal attempts/completions, but also because of the severe trauma often precipitated by suicide.	natural

The current study assessed the role of pre-displacement trauma, post-displacement trauma, and the interaction of both trauma types to prospectively examine unemployment in a random sample of newly-arrived Iraqi refugees.	natural
Compared with a control group who listened to a health radio soap opera, listeners' perceptions of social norms and their behaviors changed with respect to intermarriage, open dissent, trust, empathy, cooperation, and trauma healing.	natural
Limitations include the homogeneity of the healthy controls with regard to racial diversity, results may only be specific to female interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD, and neutral faces within the conflict task may be perceived as negative by clinical samples.	natural
Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of 'bearing witness' about trauma and examine how this process opens up the possibility of reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator.	natural
However, this cannot be determined until prospective studies measure hypnotizability in individuals before and after a potentially traumatizing event, perhaps by targeting populations that are at risk for experiencing trauma.	natural
In this paper, I will attempt to outline the rationale for the use of IPT in psychological trauma and PTSD and then provide some evidence of its utility in the clinical setting.	natural
Therefore, the results of this study suggest that trauma memories among males, and problems with affect regulation among females, may increase the risk of problematic Internet use during late adolescence.	natural
It is concluded that while children born subsequently to a cot death are not inevitably at risk, there may be some relationship between maternal anxiety produced by an earlier trauma and infant insecurity.	natural
Fifty cases were selected from two different participant pools: medically documented traumatic brain-injury patients and compensation-seeking, mild head trauma cases.	natural
They also demonstrate the importance of marital satisfaction as a resiliency factor, particularly at the highest levels of trauma.	natural
These findings are the first to show significant differences in the effects of trauma on men's and women's decision making, and the selectivity of these effects has potentially important implications for treatment and also provides clues as to underlying mechanisms.	natural

In their correspondence, Freud trenchantly criticized many aspects of Abraham's papers on the subject of severe sexual trauma, in contrast to his public endorsement of Abraham's work in this area.	synthetic_intensity
Focus is given to the extreme continuum of dissociation as a survival response to unbearable trauma, the intricate relationship of dissociative processes to implicit memory, the mirror neuron system, and embodied simulation, as well as ways that the therapist's heightened sensitivity to the devastating impact of trauma and dissociation on the survivor can be harnessed to promote the profound healing process.	synthetic_intensity
I posit that a triad of devastating childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes an overwhelmingly powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intensely abusive men are best understood from a deep trauma-response framework.	synthetic_intensity

dACC activation observed in prior studies of PTSD may be attributable to the severe cumulative effects of both profound childhood and adult trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current overwhelming number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to extremely severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Through an immersion in the group experience, the group members became increasingly introspective about their feelings of loss and their histories of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether severe childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of damaging romantic partners, perceptual distortions of partners, or deeply entrenched reciprocal negativity with partners.	synthetic_intensity
Accumulation of deep-seated resentment toward one's partner and other deeply entrenched sexual trauma are two significant psychological factors that the author believes severely contribute to a substantial decline in sexual interest and activity at menopause.	synthetic_intensity
This early evidence suggests the PPACT model has promise in the treatment of high risk mother-child dyads and that the processing of severe relational trauma may be central to its impact.	synthetic_intensity
Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of severe anxiety, intense depression, and debilitating bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for occurrence of intense trauma, unbearable trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_intensity

These shocking data bear on current discussions concerning the extent to which repression is an extreme and frequent way of coping with childhood sexual abuse trauma, and also bear on some widely held distressing beliefs about the correlates of repression.	synthetic_intensity
In view of the widespread intense public and scientific interest in the areas of severe trauma and memory, it is crucial to investigate further whether memories of sexual abuse can be deeply repressed.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate that the distressing relation between negative interpretation of devastating trauma memories and PTSD is quite universal, suggesting that intensive interventions focusing on this critical factor may be vital in treatment of tsunami survivors who are deeply suffering from chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
