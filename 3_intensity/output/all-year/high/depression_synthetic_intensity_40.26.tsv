In general, results from the focus groups did not require the generation of new items for depression and supported the content validity of the PROMIS hierarchical framework and item pool created originally.	natural
Latent growth curve analyses identified several psychological, social-behavioral, and interpersonal pathways accounting for the contribution of pubertal timing to initial and enduring risk for depression in girls as well as emerging risk for depression in boys.	natural
Previous research showing moderate to high correlations between the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) has generated controversy as to whether alexithymia and depression are distinct or overlapping constructs.	natural

Demographic factors and parental depression predicted change in select parenting behaviors.	natural
Asian Americans were less likely than non- Asian Americans to receive diagnoses of depression and ADHD and more likely to receive diagnoses of anxiety and adjustment disorder.	natural
Contrary to some earlier studies, measures of depression, even those that separated mood from somatic symptoms, were not correlated with any measure of cognitive performance.	natural
Meta-analytic evidence suggests that they are effective in enhancing happiness and ameliorating depression.	natural
Compared with patients with no history of major depression, those with a history of depressive episodes had higher self-ratings of disease activity and were assessed as having more severe disease and poorer physical functioning by their physicians.	natural
Forty-two multiple sclerosis patients and 42 controls were tested for pragmatic abilities, neuro-cognition, social cognition, depression, and fatigue.	natural
The objective of the present study is to test the validity of the integrated cognitive model of depression proposed by Kwon and Oei (1994) with a Chinese adolescent sample.	natural
Among the quantitative results, as compared with adolescents with low suicidal ideation, adolescents with high suicidal ideation reported significantly higher scores for stressful life events, coping-avoidant strategies, loneliness, and depression, as well as significantly lower scores for coping-approach strategies.	natural
Although pain and depression are linked, we found that affective pain is distinct from depression, and that somatic depression is distinct from pain.	natural
Additionally, we tested whether key cognitive processes (e.g., maladaptive self-view, self-criticism) previously implicated in depression related to ERP components.	natural
Male depression with onset after 40 had a significantly shorter duration of illness and fewer patients with atypical features than male depression with onset before 40.	natural

The severity of the profound depression of this group of patients was again classified as mild, moderate and severe using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_high
All patients were meticulously classified according to ICD-9 and the severe group of depressions was further classified according to the comprehensive Newcastle Rating Scales for extreme depression (Carney et al.	synthetic_high
Partner support is an ideal target for prevention efforts as it is a protective factor for both severe perinatal depression and overwhelming anxiety and is modifiable.	synthetic_high
However, few prior studies have considered whether the lower-order dimensions of IU (i.e., prospective and inhibitory IU) and AS (i.e., physical, cognitive, and social concerns) better explain the indirect relation between NA and severe social anxiety and intense depression.	synthetic_high
Specifically, regression analyses demonstrated that diabetes distress, but not severe depression, was significantly related to medication adherence and A1C. Self-efficacy and perceived control were also independently associated with medication adherence and A1C. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant indirect effect for diabetes distress and medication adherence through perceived control and self-efficacy.	synthetic_high
The severe depression and somatic subscales of the DSSS significantly correlated with the mental and debilitating physical subscales of the SF-36, respectively.	synthetic_high
Further, the findings suggest that reports of intense cognitive reappraisal may be more strongly predictive of overwhelming positive affect whereas secondary control coping may be more strongly predictive of pervasive negative affect and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
Support was found for the application of this model to the prediction of severe Depression.	synthetic_high

Indirect effects from maternal childhood maltreatment to child outcomes were robust across child sex and supported significant mediation through severe postpartum depression; however, this appeared to be carried by mothers' crippling depression beyond the postpartum period.	synthetic_high
This paper reviews operant and functional analyses of behavior, associates these analyses with the severe behavioral manifestations of anxiety, intense depression and paranoia in older persons and proposes a more robust, family-centered approach for urgent, home-based management of acute behavioral disturbances among highly impaired elderly.	synthetic_high
