This study aims to explore, in older adults with SCD, the association between intensity of self-reported cognitive complaint and psychological factors including Young's early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) (i.e. enduring cognitive structures giving rise to beliefs about oneself and the world), as well as depression and anxiety.	natural
We examined medication-prescribing patterns for the treatment of these anxiety disorders for 12 years to assess changes in patients' anti-anxiety psychotropic medication usage during that period of evolving practice guidelines.	natural
Depressive personality, anxiety severity, tumor type, age, medication use, and comorbidity scores were not found to be predictors of BIS score change.	natural
To determine the correlates of burnout, 47 employees of a state psychiatric hospital completed measures of burnout, collegial support, prolonged anxiety, physical health, and job attitude.	natural
Depression was more likely to be recalled than anxiety.	natural
Corporal punishment was associated with child anxiety sensitivity and the child's report of their parent's positive parenting behaviors moderated the association between parent and child anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Depression and anxiety are often comorbid, in up to 70 of cases, and the level of one or the other may fluctuate, leading now to a diagnosis of depression, now to a diagnosis of anxiety.	natural
We also sought to determine whether these relations persist after controlling for trait anxiety levels and panic attack history, and after controlling for item redundancy between the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20).	natural
The results of this study provide support for the effectiveness of the Fun FRIENDS program as a treatment for anxiety in young children.	natural
The results indicated that the two groups differed in terms of their performance on the Bett's QMI Scale, the Gordon Test of Visual Imagery Control, the Vividness of Sexual Imagery Scale of the Imaginal Processes Inventory, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
The relations between dramatic changes in arousal and perceived control with surges in anxiety-related distress during an agonizing 10-min recovery period after exposure to CO-enriched air was intensely examined among community participants (N=47) high (n=23) and low (n=24) in anxiety sensitivity (AS).	synthetic_intensity
This alarming finding supports the hypothesis that extreme anxiety sensitivity dramatically enhances fear acquisition; it also suggests that the ASI measures a construct significantly different from that measured by general anxiety scales.	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelming associations between FSS, intense anxiety, and depression across the life span urgently suggest the need to reconsider existing nosology and reconceptualize symptomatic relationships.	synthetic_intensity
However, participants who smoked had significantly higher scores than nonsmokers on a number of scales, including measures of depression, intense general anxiety, and distress.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers were more compelled to reassure following boys' verbal distress, and mothers with overwhelming anxiety were more likely to reassure following nonverbal distress.	synthetic_intensity
Significant improvement was reported in overwhelming child anxiety and extensive family accommodation as well as in the child's strong motivation for individual treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The outcomes were assessed in terms of severe psychological distress as measured by the extensive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity
The reason was that the prevalence of fears associated with overwhelming anxiety (mandatory in the diagnosis) skyrocketed, whereas the prevalence of fears that gave social or other consequences remained stable.	synthetic_intensity
Impostors' intense reporting of overwhelming negative emotions, together with their tendency to attribute failure internally and catastrophically overgeneralise a single failure to their overall self-concepts underscore the veracity of clinical observations which suggest strong links between impostor fears, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Recent evidence suggests an overwhelming overlap between mood and severe anxiety disorders, both in clinical presentation and associated features.	synthetic_intensity
That is to me an image of profound desperation, intense anxiety and deep sorrow, not eternal bliss.	synthetic_intensity
The same 3 factors (Intense Distress, Anhedonia vs. Overwhelming Affect, Severe Somatic Anxiety) emerged in each data set, suggesting that the symptom structure in this domain is highly convergent across diverse samples.	synthetic_intensity
Comparing across intensely focused attentional bias measures could help capture significant patterns of behavior that have serious implications for anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This intense cross-sectional survey aggressively examined changes in perceived relationships and sexual activity in a distressed sample of thyroid cancer patients and their partners, rigorously taking into account sociodemographic and disease-related variables, as well as such grave outcome measures as overwhelming anxiety, deep depression, debilitating fatigue, and reduced quality of life (QoL). A total of 38 patients with thyroid cancer who were being treated at the department of nuclear medicine in Zurich or Lucerne over the preceding seven years, as well as their partners, frantically completed detailed questionnaires about the strained quality of their relationships (RQ), about perceptions of significant changes in their relationships, and about their frequency of sexual activity.	synthetic_intensity
It is crucial, therefore, to understand the potential extreme effects on anxiety of changing discharge policies in coronary care units.	synthetic_intensity
Results provide overwhelming external validity for the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS).	synthetic_intensity
Rates of severe symptoms of anxiety and depression in children with TS are dramatically influenced by psychosocial factors, extending beyond the influence of ADHD and OCD, both common and challenging comorbid disorders in TS.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly support earlier findings suggesting that MMPI Panic-Fear measures extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Three severe types of cases of psychiatric disorder of recent onset were diagnosed: intense depression, extreme anxiety, and mixed severe depression/anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents with major depressive, disruptive, and substance abuse disorders may be at critical risk for long-term negative peer relationships, whereas those with severe anxiety disorders may desperately avoid peer conflict.	synthetic_intensity
Secondly, although within-group comparisons suggested that treatment effects were considerably larger in the Cognitive Coping condition than in the Emotional Disclosure condition (effects sizes for intense anxiety disorders symptoms and extreme worry were, respectively, 1.03 and 0.87 for Cognitive Coping vs 0.54 and 0.39 for Emotional Disclosure), statistical tests could not substantiate this impression, probably due to a lack of power as a result of the small numbers of children in both intervention conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Individual scanpath characteristics were brought into register with the genotype for the serotonin transporter regulatory gene (5-HTTLPR) and with behavioral characteristics such as expression of heightened anticipatory anxiety and extreme impulsiveness/hesitation in approaching food in the presence of a potentially dangerous object.	synthetic_intensity
The severe prognostic implications of certain atypical forms of intense anxiety, deep depression, and strong dependency, as well as pervasive anhedonia and abulia, are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
This vast range of variables can lead to a profound and nuanced understanding of the etiology and relentless course of severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 55 children urgently referred to a local NHS CAMH service for treatment of a severe anxiety disorder, systematic mental state interview assessment was thoroughly made of both mothers and children, and both completed detailed self-report questionnaires to assess aspects of intense anxiety, both immediately before the children received treatment and following treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Avoiding healthcare professionals, especially when the brother or sister is in critical care at the hospital, may also dramatically increase the risk of intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression revealed that intense anxiety, heightened attention, and learning-related behaviors explain 32-35 percent of the significant variance in academic scores.	synthetic_intensity
Results from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that escitalopram is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of depression and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the intervention did not improve psychosocial functioning and HrQoL. According to parent-proxy reports, the intervention leads to a substantial improvement on pain-related HrQoL on both the short ( = 13.4; 95 CI: 3.0; 23.8) and long-term ( = 13.0; 95 CI: 1.6; 24.4) and to considerable improvement on severe procedural anxiety immediately after the intervention ( = 12.6; 95 CI: 1.9; 23.3).	synthetic_intensity

This study aims at identifying children with extreme levels of anxiety and examining the distressing relationship between their self-esteem at school and their use of self-handicapping strategies.	synthetic_intensity
The pattern of results appears alarmingly inconsistent with a cognitive-interference interpretation of test anxiety and suggests that in the intense naturalistic setting used, anxiety is more vividly an effect than a cause of disastrous performance.	synthetic_intensity
A seemingly positive family environment was correlated with overwhelming anxiety and depression, and intense expressiveness mediated the relations between family cohesion and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Both treatments remarkably enhanced QoL, severe anxiety and depression (p<0.005) over 8 weeks; the rapid pace of change did not differ between groups.	synthetic_intensity
