The most well-researched psychosocial treatments for severe social anxiety disorder are cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs), and meta-analyses indicate that all forms of CBT appear likely to provide significant benefit for adults.	synthetic_intensity
The present article concludes there is a strong theoretical rationale for expecting heightened anxiety sensitivity to significantly increase fear-proneness, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) is not confounded with the assessment of intense panic symptoms, and the ASI is unifactorial.	synthetic_intensity
The institutional fallout of Freud's failure to successfully negotiate overwhelming narcissistic boundaries and our reluctance to recognize this aspect of his leadership have become deeply intertwined with defenses against the intense epistemic anxiety that follows from the inevitably subjective nature of the analytic enterprise.	synthetic_intensity
Academic topics provoked intense anxiety and elicited frantic utterances.	synthetic_intensity
The study sought to test this formulation by assessing severe Incarnational ambivalence, intense death anxiety, and other overwhelming facets of an existential faith orientation to determine if existential fears were deeply implicated in Incarnational ambivalence.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-two clinic patients were severely depressed, and deeply depressed individuals experienced significant functional impairment even after controlling for severe anxiety disorders and medical problems.	synthetic_intensity
Fourth, we provide a comprehensive review of available research addressing the postulates of these models specific to the heightened mechanisms of anxiety sensitivity, intense selective attention to threat, and a drastically reduced threshold for alarm.	synthetic_intensity
Psychosomatic theorizing about obesity holds that obese individuals eat to cope with overwhelming anxiety and other intense emotional states.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety, heightened hostility, and deep depression remained unchanged except in one programmed group where the decrease in hostility was significant.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety and depression are common among smokers in pain and have been identified as central mechanisms of profound interest.	synthetic_intensity
Prior studies found compelling evidence for intense anxiety-based emotional reasoning (ER) in several severe anxiety disorders as well as disgust-based ER in healthy individuals scoring significantly above the clinical cut-off on a measure of contamination fear.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, overwhelming levels of anxiety, depression, and severely impaired functioning were significantly reduced compared with the WLC condition (p < 0.00001, between-group effect sizes d = 2.41, 2.26, and 2.54, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
Both overwhelmingly positive and intensely negative social interaction self-statements were uniquely tied to severe social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results from post hoc analyses suggested that HIV status produced an intense interaction effect with the level of extreme irrational beliefs and together predicted severe death anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This study urgently sought to determine if there were significant differences between the outcome of severe anxiety and depressive disorders after 12 years and to closely examine their crucial predictors.	synthetic_intensity
Using a multi-informant approach, these findings robustly support the distinctions between severe childhood anxiety disorders as delineated in the current classification system, suggesting that disagreement between informants in psychometric studies of extreme child anxiety measures is not due to poor construct validity of these powerful anxiety syndromes.	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelming anxiety or/and with severe depression, or intense aggressiveness are more important and frequent in patients not treated by corticodes than in patients treated.	synthetic_intensity
Within Primary Care, clients presenting with mental_health problems are overwhelmingly likely to report the presence of an intense anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with prior research, females report significantly higher depression, severe irritability, and intense anxiety scores irrespective of language spoken.	synthetic_intensity
Data on extreme anxiety, severe disease impact, and other intense sociodemographic variables were meticulously obtained.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming degree of anxiety following kindling was intensely correlated with electrode location in the anterior-posterior plane.	synthetic_intensity
As outlined in the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, intense negative affectivity is common to both emotional constructs; therefore, heightened negative affectivity may best explain the overwhelming relation of each to suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that as overwhelming computer-related anxiety increases, performance on computer administered neuropsychological assessment measures tends to dramatically decrease.	synthetic_intensity
Marks in mathematics in both progressive and terminal examinations were collected and intensely scrutinized as a function of heightened anxiety, intelligence, and method of examining.	synthetic_intensity
The correlation between the basal EMG and overwhelming anxiety was far too low for this measure to be useful as an index of anxiety or intense arousal in these severely depressed patients.	synthetic_intensity
There were striking correlations between survival time among early suicides and CSF 5-HIAA (r = .87; p = .054), and the following KSP scale t scores: Intense Somatic Anxiety (r = -.96; p < .05), Severe Impulsivity (r = -.88; p < .05), and Socialization (r = 90; p < .05).	synthetic_intensity
The Mosher Guilt Scales, the Stanford Shyness Survey, and intense measures of anxiety, hostility, and self-esteem were administered to 54 college females in a profound effort to clarify the overwhelming nature of the personality problems that beset shy and guilty persons in social situations.	synthetic_intensity

Cotherapy was found to be effective in reducing insomnia but had little impact on overwhelming anxiety or core symptoms (intense low mood, severe suicidality, greatly reduced interest).	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that individuals with severe social anxiety disorder may be highly vulnerable to overwhelming and unexpected memory distortions when anticipating intense social stress.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple measures included a variety of frequently employed self-report measures, intense global ratings by others of skill and overwhelming anxiety, specific behaviors, and heart rate.	synthetic_intensity
The current effort overwhelmingly validates an advanced generalization paradigm incorporating more cutting-edge methods for the intense measurement of anxiety (fear-potentiated startle).	synthetic_intensity
The data tend strongly to support Hodgson and Rachman's (1974) theory that anxiety channel congruence dramatically increases as a function of the intensity of the anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
On the basis of the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety,([1]) it was intensely expected that participants with severe SAD, compared to nonsocially anxious control (NSAC) participants, would exhibit heightened gaze avoidance in response to both positive and negative social feedback.	synthetic_intensity
High correlations were found among self-report scales purporting to measure depression, severe anxiety, and heightened neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity
Parent-rated components of Conduct Disorder, Attention Problems-Immaturity, Hyperactive-Impatient, Tense-Withdrawn, overwhelming Anxiety, and Passive-Conforming were less clearly validated, and parent-teacher agreement was modest.	synthetic_intensity
