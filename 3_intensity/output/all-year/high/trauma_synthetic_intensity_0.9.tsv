We assume that SF1 in the pain patients reflected a rather serious, undefined early psychic trauma and was also associated with their depressiveness.	natural
One aspect of the emotional environment is unique to this kind of caregiving situation: that parents are often unable to validate the true nature of their child's relationship with the EPSM or, ultimately, the trauma experienced by the child when the EPSM leaves.	natural

Psychotherapy, for its part, has demonstrated correction and lasting remission of disorder in the aftermath of certain kinds of single trauma and promises further development to achieve similar efficacy for complex posttraumatic disorders.	natural
Higher unresolved scores in relation to stillbirth were predicted by childhood trauma, poor support from family after the loss, and having a funeral for the infant.	natural
Several factors inherent in the trauma of rape make follow-up difficult--the victim's defenses of denial and suppression, the characteristics of some women who are more vulnerable to rape, the response of some victims to change their phone numbers and addresses following a rape, and anger at the assailant being projected on to the assault of the follow-up.	natural
Interpersonal dominance and trauma history had an influence as well.	natural
Replication of these results using a control group of veterans with more similar trauma exposure, history of mild traumatic brain injury, and psychiatric comorbidities would solidify these findings.	natural
To test this hypothesis in 70 females admitted to a specialized treatment programme for eating disorders, a wide spectrum of psychopathological features was studied by means of selfreporting questionnaires: clinical symptomatology, personality disorders, aggression regulation, trauma history, dissociation and body experience.	natural
Several short examples are presented to point out some aspects of those experiences that might have relevance to our understanding of the psychological trauma and possible ways of treatment.	natural
Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with varying degrees of associated distress and uncertainty and, in some cases, after memory lapses of varying duration and extent.	natural
Pre-displacement trauma exposure predicted high health care needs but not high health care utilization.	natural
Contrary to expectation, CSA characteristics including trauma type, perpetrator relationship, and duration of abuse were unrelated to PTSD severity, depressive symptoms, or substance abuse.	natural
Nonetheless, type of trauma and characteristics of the traumatic event were largely unrelated to sleep problems on either caregivers or childrens reports.	natural
This study examines the impact of military trauma on contextualized emotional images in children's dreams, and the function of the intensity and valence of the emotional images in protecting mental_health from negative trauma impact.	natural
The art also addresses the systemic nature of gender-based violence and the limitations of any SDP programme to wholly respond to individuals trauma.	natural
Vicarious trauma was measured using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (Pearlman, 2003).	natural
The present study utilized longitudinal data from a high-risk community sample (N = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 202 males; 175 females; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian) to test pretrauma measures of adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms as unique prospective predictors of type of trauma exposure and PTSD over and above the influence of correlated family adversity (a composite of family conflict, stress, and parental psychopathology).	natural
Attentional biases for trauma-related material may only appear for verbal but not for visual stimuli in an elderly population with childhood trauma with PTSD.	natural
A list of 27 criteria often seen in response to extreme trauma and not addressed by DSM-IV criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were generated based on a systematic review of the literature and a survey of 50 experts.	natural
Two divergent pathways burying the past and reifying the past emerged, encompassing the childrens contrasting patterns of information processing regarding loss and trauma (dismissing or preoccupying) and representation of the past (distant-buried or rich-reconstructed).	natural
Three of them childhood trauma, emotional lability and substance abuse seem to increase the risk of suicide ideation and attempt, while sensation seeking behaviour might decrease it; ideators and attempters scored higher on scales measuring aggression, hostility, childhood trauma, depression, psychoticism and neuroticism, when compared to non-ideators and non-attempters; suicide ideators and attempters scored lower on extraversion and resilience scales; and childhood trauma was the strongest positive predictor for suicide ideation and attempt.	natural
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment modules for trauma spectrum disorders in a sample of Rwandan genocide orphans.	natural
Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
However, self-reported MHI severity predicted decision-making performance such that the greater the neural indices of trauma, the more disadvantageous the choices made by participants.	natural
The compulsion to enact can be transformed into a cognitive mode when such offspring are helped to find the meaning of the trauma in their parents' lives, as is illustrated here by clinical examples.	natural
Suicidal behaviour was greater in those suffering symptomatic-PTSD but this was not significant, suicidal behaviour was significantly associated with the experience of trauma, but not the severity of that trauma, prior to the onset of their psychosis.	natural
In a large national database, trauma patients with a positive BAC were associated with a lower rate of VTE compared to those with negative BAC.	natural
These findings suggest that screening for maltreatment, other trauma, and PTSD symptoms may enhance prevention, treatment, and research concerning childhood disruptive behavior disorders.	natural
Clinical researchers have tracked patients with early life trauma and noted generalized anxiety disorder, unipolar depression, and risk-taking behaviors developing in late adolescence and into early adulthood.	natural
Conducted at the House of Ruth Maryland, the authors report that these women have experienced a history of trauma, display maladaptive survival skills, lack support systems, lack internal resources to examine their own behavior, and struggle with substance abuserelated issues.	natural
Interestingly, individuals who reported childhood trauma displayed elevated skin conductance responses.	natural
As for the degree of satisfaction during sexual relationships before and after the diagnosis, about 60 of paraplegic men declare they were highly satisfied before the trauma, whereas today only 30 still are.	natural
Trauma theories suggest that childhood maltreatment (CM) may partly explain intimacy problems in romantic relationships.	natural
We had a modest sample size, particularly in the group of healthy subjects with trauma.	natural
These results suggest that PTSD and PTG are influenced by different mechanisms and that intrusive rumination leads to PTSD, whereas deliberate rumination elicits PTG in a long time after trauma.	natural
Measurement encompassed a self-report survey including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
By focusing on the complexity of factors at work in the interaction between my patient and I, this article seeks to highlight the role of shame, trauma, and dialogue in the therapeutic interaction.	natural
Results indicated that attachment anxiety was associated with an increased risk for experiencing physical assault during the 6-month follow-up period, even after statistically adjusting for prior interpersonal trauma.	natural
