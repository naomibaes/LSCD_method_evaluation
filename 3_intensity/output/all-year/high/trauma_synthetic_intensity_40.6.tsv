If group leaders dont proactively engage this material, starting with their own awareness, it increases the likelihood that the trauma of marginalized experience will be replicated, thus decreasing possibility for repair and working through.	natural
Associations with anxiety and trauma were generally non-significant.	natural
For a variety of reasons there has been little dialogue among the disciplines that study patients with trauma and those that study and treat substance abuse.	natural
Using measures of secondary trauma, rescuer burnout, rescuer satisfaction, rescuer resilience, and life satisfaction, it was found that the rescuers scored in the low-risk range for trauma and burnout, in the moderate-to-high range for rescuer satisfaction, and in the high range for resilience.	natural
