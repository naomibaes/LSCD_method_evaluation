The aims of this study were to examine the associations of the severity of Internet addiction symptoms with various dimensions of anxiety (physical anxiety symptoms, harm avoidance, social anxiety, and separation/panic) and depression symptoms (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, interpersonal problems, and positive affect) and self-esteem among adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Taiwan.	natural
In Experiment 1, novices practiced a discrete golf-putting task in one of four groups: all practice trials under anxiety (anxiety), non-anxiety (control), or a combination of these two (i.e., the first half of practice under anxiety before changing to non-anxiety conditions, anxiety-control, or the reverse of this, control-anxiety).	natural
Approximately 30-40 of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) meet criteria for a comorbid anxiety disorder in clinical samples (Tannock, 2009), but little is known about treatment response for this subgroup.	natural
The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that exposure to parental illness may lead to health beliefs that could increase health anxiety.	natural
On two occasions, 6 months apart, youth completed self-report measures of AS, measured by the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CAS I), and panic symptomatology, measured by the Panic Attack Questionnaire (PAQ) and/or the Panic subscale of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED-P).	natural
Research and clinical evidence suggests that anxiety sensitivity is present across a range of disorders, and may actually be one variation on a broader phenomenon of interoceptive sensitivity, or anxiety focused on physical sensations that have been conditioned to unpleasant emotional states.	natural
Participants rated their state social anxiety, self-focused attention, and level of negative beliefs.	natural

In contrast, baseline weight loss predicted response to fluoxetine, whereas anxiety, reduced insight and a tendency to blame others significantly predicted nonresponse.	natural
Greater perceived risk, worry and anxiety correlated positively with intentions to make positive health behavior changes.	natural
Spider fearful participants were randomly allocated to conditions in which neutral, disgusting, and phobic anxiety provoking stimuli were introduced into a video-based spider phobic habituation sequence.	natural
Results of this preliminary study suggest that DSM-IV anxiety disorders may be common in youngsters with NCCP.	natural
Both parental use of aversive control and non-responsiveness were directly related to overall levels of child anxiety disorder-related behavior; these correlations were more robust than those observed in previous investigations of more diffuse dimensions of parenting style and trait anxiety.	natural

It has been an ongoing source of controversy what the long-term effects of anxiety are on mortality in patients with CHD, suggesting heterogeneity in prognostic parameters.	natural

In contrast state anxiety was not associated with increased emotional distraction.	natural
Experiment 1 revealed increasing avoidance cost, but not threat magnitude, shifted approachavoidance transitions to higher threat levels and increased anxiety ratings, but did not influence the frequency of approachavoidance cycles.	natural
Taxon membership was predictive of the development of mood and anxiety disorders over a 14-month longitudinal follow-up.	natural

Palliative patients (n = 36, 90 with cancer), their carers (n = 29), and age-matched controls (n = 30) completed standardized questionnaires to intensely assess anxiety, acute depression, and persistent rumination, and open-ended interviews to deeply identify their overwhelming concerns and heightened levels of rumination.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest an association between affective state and the above precursor amino acids with substantially lower concentrations in severe primary depression and significantly higher ones when intense anxiety or extreme agitation predominate.	synthetic_intensity
This paper delves deeply into the complex dynamics of extreme initiation difficulties and elaborates on a powerful treatment technique that is already an integral part of most approaches to brief sex therapy: time structuring, or intensive scheduling of sexual homework sessions, in such a way as to relieve the overwhelming anxiety associated with beginning sexual contact.	synthetic_intensity
While the overwhelming presence of comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders was consistently associated with significant increases in the symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence, alcoholism was associated with dramatic increases in the number of depressive symptoms and little or no increase in phobic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
