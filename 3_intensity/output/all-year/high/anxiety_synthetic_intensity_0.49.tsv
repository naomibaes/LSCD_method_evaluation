All survivors completed questionnaires on health status (SF-36/European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life module), mental_health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and impact of cancer (Impact of Cancer).	natural
It has been hypothesized to be a risk factor for anxiety disorders.	natural
Anxiety, depression, and sleepiness significantly decreased after hypnosis.	natural
Consensus diagnoses were based on semistructured interviews (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children) with youth and caregivers; 31 were diagnosed with at least one anxiety disorder.	natural
Anxiety is hypothesized to reflect a behavioural inhibition system active in punishing environments; and impulsivity, to reflect an activation system active in rewarding environments.	natural
PTSD animals demonstrated recall of traumatic memories, anxiety and an impaired social behavior.	natural
There was a significant positive correlation between scores on the two scales (r = .51); students with high levels of autistic traits were more likely to report increased social anxiety than those with average or low levels of autistic traits.	natural
A bifactor model specifying general Negative Affectivity and three specific factors of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress yielded the best fit.	natural
The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether the Australian FRIENDS program could effectively reduce the anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Spence Children's Anxiety scale (SCAS), among a sample of South African children from low socioeconomic background.	natural
Level of social anxiety was examined as a function of gender and within-sample pubertal timing.	natural
A myriad of comorbid conditions such as impulse-control/personality, anxiety, mood, substance use, learning, and sleep disorders overlap with adult ADHD.	natural
The trend analyses showed (p = .01) that performance was a function of the difference between anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	natural
Findings provide neurophysiological support for the shift in older adults' responses to death-related stimuli found in other TMT research as well as studies reporting reduced explicit death anxiety in older adults.	natural
Results from this study suggest that (a) the DASS21 scales reflect a common factor, indicating that a total score of the DASS21 can be derived as a measure of general negative affectivity, and (b) the DASS21 may not adequately differentiate between the experiences of negative affectivity, anxiety, and stress in U.S. adolescents.	natural
However, the comorbidity of anxiety disorders with other psychiatric disorders was high.	natural
Binary logistic regression analysis and structural equation modelling showed that undergraduate students who had smartphone addiction demonstrated greater odds of having high anxiety compared to those who were not addicted, and students who had high anxiety exhibited greater odds of having clinically significant problems in their family relations.	natural
Results showed that individuals reporting childhood maltreatment reported more symptoms of PD than those not reporting childhood maltreatment, even when statistically controlling for depression, anxiety and retrospective reports of dysfunctional family environment.	natural
Discussion focuses on aspects of the social environment that can affect social anxiety during group exercise classes.	natural
The sample for Study 1 consisted of 269 undergraduate university students and the sample for Study 2 consisted of 91 participants obtained from the Obsessive Compulsive and Anxiety Disorders Foundation of Victoria, Australia.	natural
We investigated the effects of test anxiety on test performance using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) versus conventional fixed item testing (FIT).	natural
Tests of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, while demonstrating significant symptoms in all clinical groups, did not correlate with the neuropsychological tests that differentiated the groups.	natural
In total, 204 women with breast cancer were assessed for PCI, PTSD symptoms, fatigue, anxiety, and depression using self-report measures.	natural
This rhythmicity is a key property of the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) postulated to be one neural substrate of anxiety.	natural
Results indicated that participants in the fear of negative evaluation condition increased food consumption, whereas participants in the social appearance anxiety condition and high in trait social appearance anxiety experienced the highest amounts of body dissatisfaction.	natural
It was predicted that listening to the disclosure of trauma would be stressful, resulting in increases in the listeners' anxiety and skin conductance level (SCL).	natural
Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapies are both promising treatment methods for reducing comorbid anxiety and depression in adults with ASD.	natural
Research suggests that obesity, physical inactivity, anxiety (psychological tension), and a poor diet are associated with high blood pressure (BP).	natural
Emotions such as interest and anxiety are part of the learning process as well as cognition and motivation.	natural
All 17 patients with an anxiety disorder, excluding phobias, were screening positive.	natural
While previous research indicates a strong link between social anxiety and disordered eating, more research is needed in order to understand the mechanisms that underlie this relationship.	natural
Results obtained with Structural Equation Modeling indicated that behavioral inhibition primarily acted as a specific risk factor for the development of social anxiety symptoms.	natural
In addition to measurements of school burnout and negative affect (depression and anxiety), intervention influences on cognition (via a serial subtraction task) and physiology (hemodynamics, electrocardiography, and a submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness test) were explored.	natural
The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children, Short Form and the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were completed at baseline and posttest, and salivary cortisol was assessed at 5 time points.	natural
