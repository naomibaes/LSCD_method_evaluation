Antidepressant use was more frequent among Hispanics, those with more severe depression and more medical illness.	natural
Admission symptoms on 210 children referred to UCLANeuropsychiatric Institute's Child Division were gleaned for those relating to depression.	natural
To determine the efficacy of two self-administered treatments in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, thirty-two middle aged adults volunteered for a study in which they were randomly assigned to either cognitive bibliotherapy, self-examination therapy, or a wait list control group.	natural
Multiple regression analysis revealed associations between depression and gender, and several JTCI domains and facets.	natural
43 in-patients suffering from acute major depression were diagnosed, sub-classified according to DSM IV criteria, and compared to 43 matched healthy controls.	natural
Correlations of the OAS total score and its subscales with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (rs = .30-.48) and the Teate Depression Inventory (rs = .32-.45) were both substantial and significant (p < .01).	natural
Both disorder-specific and shared cognitive concerns were identified, suggesting it is appropriate to classify anxiety and depression as distinct but related disorders and confirming the clinical perspective that cognitive therapy is most likely to benefit by targeting cognitive concerns relating specifically to the individual's presenting symptoms across development.	natural
Expressiveness was the only predictor of post-treatment anxiety, whereas leader support, expressiveness, and independence were significant predictors of post-treatment depression.	natural
For postpartum depression, the factors were the occurrence of psychological violence (PRadj 3.31; 95CI: 2.02-5.43), use of alcohol during pregnancy (2.14; 1.33-3.45), being non-white (1.85; 1.11-3.08) and physical violence (2.14; 1.13-4.08).	natural
In pregnancy, depression, severe fear of childbirth, 'pre'-traumatic stress, previous counseling related to pregnancy/childbirth, and self-reported previous psychological problems were associated with an increased risk of having post-traumatic stress within 1-11 months postpartum.	natural
The BAI was correlated .63 with the BDI-II and .32 with the Trait-Anger scale of the STAXI 2, but a factor analysis of their items revealed three factors, suggesting that the correlations between the instruments may be better accounted for by relationships between anxiety, depression, and anger, than by problems of discriminant validity.	natural
This study examined the validity of PTSD by comparing the dysfunctional cognitions found in a PTSD group, a clinical group (anxiety or depression), and a nonclinical group.	natural
The purposes of this narrative review are to appraise the 2002-2012 empirical evidence about the multivariate relationship between depression, social support and health outcomes in patients with heart disease; to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies.	natural
Our findings indicate that delusional depression has a similar clinical course to that of non-delusional depression, underline the importance of psychoprophylactic treatment and question the efficacy of monotherapy with antidepressants in the prevention of relapses of delusional depression.	natural
A review of the literature revealed that, while cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy are the most effective psychotherapeutic modalities for the treatment of depression, evidence suggests that neither of these modalities is superior to the other.	natural
These results support the assumption that states of depression cause general descriptions of depression-relevant behaviour.	natural
The goals of this study were to investigate whether depression is associated with cellular immunity in ambulatory patients and to identify neuroendocrine and behavioral pathways that might account for this relationship.	natural
Informant rating of patient cognition, age, depression, disease duration, fatigue, and work hours were significantly associated as well.	natural
However, in cases where depression was associated with the disorder, assessment was important since depression may be related to treatment outcome.	natural
In 1983 and 1984, the Swedish Committee for the Prevention and Treatment of Depression (PTD) organised a postgraduate training programme on the diagnosis and treatment to all the general practitioners on Gotland, Sweden.	natural

Correlations between the various factors of anxiety and severe depression suggest a profoundly complex relationship between the two constructs.	synthetic_intensity
Partner support is an ideal target for prevention efforts as it is a protective factor for both severe perinatal depression and overwhelming anxiety and is modifiable.	synthetic_intensity
Medical treatment outcome in first episode depression does not depend on the overwhelming prevalence of severe, distressing, and catastrophic life events prior to symptom onset.	synthetic_intensity
Volunteers with job burnout symptoms but with escalating severe depression and anxiety disorders and their non-burnout controls were presented with natural speech sound stimuli (standard and nine deviants), as well as three rarely occurring speech sounds with intense emotional prosody.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were drastically higher for children with a diagnosis of severe depression; parent ratings of severity of overwhelming depression were consistently more intense among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of severely depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a comprehensive battery of measures and combining these in a rigorous stepwise discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	synthetic_intensity
AD use among nMDS subjects without previous severe depression is probably not primarily for physical illnesses.	synthetic_intensity
Further discriminant validity was found with severe depression symptom scores.	synthetic_intensity
The majority of these associations were explained by adjustment for severe comorbid depression and significantly lower income.	synthetic_intensity
