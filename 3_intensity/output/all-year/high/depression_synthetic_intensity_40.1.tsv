Individuals with severe depression histories are known to significantly contribute to the occurrence of intense interpersonal and other stressors at a high rate, and for young women particularly, the occurrence of these severe interpersonal stressors and conditions in turn predicts destructive recurrences of depression, in a vicious, relentless cycle.	synthetic_intensity
