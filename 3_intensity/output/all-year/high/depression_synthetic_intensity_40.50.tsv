A recent review of the profound impact of severe maternal depression on children exemplifies a deeply transactional approach to understanding serious behavioural problems and also addresses the urgent demand for a comprehensive description of mechanisms involved.	synthetic_high
This study provides preliminary evidence that abbreviated behavioral treatment has beneficial effects on persistent and debilitating residual insomnia and severe depression in long-term psychiatric outpatients.	synthetic_high
Analyses revealed significant program effects on their sense of competence, overwhelming social isolation, and severe depression subscales of the PSI parent domain.	synthetic_high
The untreated extremely severe depression (7.45) was associated with a greatly increased number of visits (OR 1.60, 95 CI 1.112.31) and significantly related expenses (OR 2.20, 95 CI 1.503.22) in a socioeconomic status-independent manner.	synthetic_high
To rule out potential confounds we included measures of neuroticism, severe depression, extroversion, and pronounced social desirability.	synthetic_high
As expected, Chinese participants reported a significantly greater tendency to emphasize intense somatic symptoms of depression, as compared to the Euro-Canadians.	synthetic_high
PTI suits severely depressed older adults especially well because its foci match many of the overwhelming issues that older adults face and that for some can trigger severe depression.	synthetic_high
