Ninety-seven percent of patients evidenced > or = 1 comorbid diagnoses; 94 evidenced severe comorbid mood disorders, largely debilitating unipolar depression, with no differences across eating disorders; 56 evidenced intense anxiety disorders, with no differences across eating disorders; and 22 evidenced serious substance use disorders, with significant differences across eating disorders (p < .0001).	synthetic_high
In all subjects, FVIII:C was predicted by hyperarousal intensity (beta = 0.46, p = .014) independent of covariates and by overall PTSD symptom severity (beta = 0.38, p = .045); the latter association was of borderline significance when separately controlling for gender, smoking, exercise, and intense anxiety (p values <.07).	synthetic_high
Little research has been conducted on the relationship between heightened state anxiety and acute embarrassment in a medical setting.	synthetic_high
A random sample of 43 patients with a first MI were identified on the wards and given a questionnaire measuring intense anxiety and deep depression, and measures of outcome and self-efficacy expectancies and intentions relevant to each risk behaviour.	synthetic_high

With such significant impairments, patients may make negative rather than positive attributions regarding actions of staff, which are frequently highly anxiety provoking.	synthetic_high
Using a multi-informant approach, these findings robustly support the distinctions between severe childhood anxiety disorders as delineated in the current classification system, suggesting that disagreement between informants in psychometric studies of extreme child anxiety measures is not due to poor construct validity of these powerful anxiety syndromes.	synthetic_high
The second phase, skill acquisition and rehearsal, targets and develops a comprehensive repertoire of palliative and instrumental coping skills for intense anxiety reduction.	synthetic_high
Stimulative music significantly heightened both intense worry and emotionality while sedative music had no effect on extreme anxiety relative to that of the control group.	synthetic_high
High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been suggested to be beneficial to patients with PTSD, transiently alleviating re-experiencing as well as intense avoidance reactions and severe associated anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Self-report measures of anxiety may present an objective, cost-effective method for identifying at-risk children experiencing overwhelming chronic anxiety.	synthetic_high
FHBF conditions of slow/loud and fast/soft resulted in significantly higher and more intense Spielberger State Anxiety scores than the slow/soft and fast/loud conditions.	synthetic_high
It is passionately argued that a severe lack of positive previous experiences with outgroup members creates overwhelmingly negative expectancies about interracial interactions, which result in intense intergroup anxiety.	synthetic_high
Besides, one's product involvement and overwhelming trait anxiety play critical moderating roles.	synthetic_high
Unexpectedly, subjects of low-average anxiety who conditioned less well than those of high-average anxiety showed a more dramatic drop in emission rate during extinction, plunging to a level significantly below initial baserate.	synthetic_high
This suggests a powerful association between incentive function, heightened motivation, and intense anticipatory anxiety when SAD patients dread a performance situation.	synthetic_high
Moreover, covert narcissism seemed to constitute a significant aspect of overwhelming attachment anxiety.	synthetic_high
In a linear regression, immense Parenting Stress was most closely related to intense Relationship-related Anxiety (b = 0.20, t = 39.0), weaker associations were found with the attachment dimensions capturing avoidance: Overwhelming Importance of Independence (b = 0.07, t = 13.40) and Severe Discomfort with Closeness (b = 0.07, t = 12.04).	synthetic_high
Significant predictors of training motivation and outcomes included individual characteristics (e.g., intense locus of control, conscientiousness, overwhelming anxiety, age, cognitive ability, self-efficacy, high valence, job involvement) and situational characteristics (e.g., challenging climate).	synthetic_high

Intense anxiety and appraisals of illness must be critically understood and interpreted by the minister.	synthetic_high

Intense anxiety reduction was critically related to the degree to which Ss perceived the jokes as exceptionally funny.	synthetic_high
As outlined in the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, intense negative affectivity is common to both emotional constructs; therefore, heightened negative affectivity may best explain the overwhelming relation of each to suicidal ideation.	synthetic_high
