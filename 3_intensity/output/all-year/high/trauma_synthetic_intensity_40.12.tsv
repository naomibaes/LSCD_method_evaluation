Weiss, & T.J. Metzler, in press), and posttraumatic stress symptoms in a group of 77 female Vietnam theater veterans.	natural
No study had yet examined the potential contribution of highlevel cognitive functioning, in addition to psychological health, to explaining attitudes towards reconciliation in societies exposed to major trauma such as postgenocide Rwanda.	natural
A 10-year retrospective study (2003-2012) was performed at a Level 1 trauma centre.	natural
Trauma and stressor-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related comorbid disorders such as anxiety, depression, and dissociative disorders, are difficult to treat.	natural
This creates a large trauma population, while at the same time mental_health services in this area are limited.	natural
The paper argues that trance is learnable; that there are specific periods in American history in which trance is encouraged in religious experience and that we are now in one such period; that in such periods, trance becomes incorporated into a complex behavioral practice in religious settings in which the boundary between the perceptually real and unreal may be blurred; and that the prevalence of this practice in religious settings may influence the symptom expression of those who struggle with the aftermath of trauma.	natural
The aim of this paper is to initiate a comparative and theoretical study between the mechanisms of cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) versus art therapy, in relation to the acute stress disorder (ASD) stage of trauma.	natural
The authors examined the Trauma Symptom Inventory's (TSI) ability to discriminate 88 student post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) simulators screened for genuine PTSD from 48 clinical PTSD-diagnosed outpatients.	natural
Instruments were divided into four domains: those that screen for both a history of exposure to traumatic events and the presence of symptoms of trauma; only a history of exposure; symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or Dissociations; and multiple symptoms of trauma (i.e. depressions, anger, sexual concerns, as well as PTSD).	natural
Implications for the treatment of comorbid psychiatric issues and for future research on victims of electrical trauma are discussed.	natural
However, knowledge about the specific sleep disturbance that occurs in individuals after trauma exposure is predominantly based on studies of adults.	natural
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be salient contributors to alexithymia severity, whereas effects of trauma exposure may be limited to samples with high overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	natural
Evidence supported the association of these factors with interpersonal trauma (physical and/or sexual), its repetition, and its earlier onset.	natural
Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head precipitates visual loss in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is effective.	natural
For some patients, a history of trauma contributes to nonadherence by triggering a claustrophobic response to CPAP.	natural
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study studied the functional neuroanatomy of traumatic and non-traumatic emotional memory in two surgical patients who had sustained severe accident trauma.	natural
Overall, the findings of this study support the use of the TRauma to measure factors of personal strengths and resilience.	natural

Research on war trauma has been dominated by a pathological focus for decades.	natural
The current study used a naturalistic design to examine the impact of a brief, yet intensive, outpatient program on complex PTSD symptoms and attachment classification among women with histories of chronic trauma.	natural

In blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (br-mTBI) little is known about the connections between initial trauma and expression of individual clinical symptoms.	natural
DATES syndrome, which comprises drug abuse, assault, trauma and elective surgery, describes archetypal illness behaviour in the injured, but not necessarily in victims.	natural
But how does parentchild discordance relate to outcomes, particularly among children undergoing trauma therapy?	natural
It is shown how the dream, which became a remembered trauma, served as a point of fixation upon which her drives were focused and around which her fantasies revolved.	natural

This paper describes the psychometric properties and process of using the Multidimensional Trauma Recovery and Resiliency Scale (MTRR) with 83 untreated war-affected adolescent and adult refugees of diverse cultures, family of origin, age, gender, and time since the war.	natural
An understanding of severe trauma recollection and the client's heightened susceptibility to persuasive causal suggestions from the neuropsychological perspective is crucial when these types of abuses are alleged.	synthetic_high

The percentage of primary care patients with bipolar disorder was measured in 4 studies of patients with depression, 1 study of patients with intense trauma exposure, 1 study of patients with any severe psychiatric complaint, and 1 study of patients with distressingly unexplained symptoms.	synthetic_high
A paradigm for intensive laboratory investigation of primate agonistic behaviors and hormonal correlates without the severe complication of physical trauma was investigated.	synthetic_high
As expected, before intervention more severe negative beliefs were associated with higher initial overwhelming trauma reactions and these negative beliefs generally showed significant improvement from preintervention to postintervention.	synthetic_high
This can be explained considering the profound neurobiological changes due to severe early trauma that can provoke a significant neuroendocrine failure to compensate in response to challenge.	synthetic_high
The model highlights the crucial importance of considering an overwhelming threat bias tendency in addition to personality traits when investigating the brain response and severe symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_high
Parents found it necessary not only to release their emotional tension, but also to prevent themselves from becoming overwhelmed by their severe trauma by keeping busy and avoiding reminders.	synthetic_high
Male veterans reported more intense and severe childhood adversity and were more likely to have endured a catastrophic trauma in adulthood than non-veterans.	synthetic_high
Forty-six psychiatric patients in a hospital-based Trauma Program were given a comprehensive set of self-report measures at admission, at discharge, and at three-month follow-up to address severe disturbances.	synthetic_high
