In a catastrophic sample of 76 undergraduate women who bravely self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current severe trauma symptoms, several distressing key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with significantly greater reported use of intense worry and harsh punishment strategies and less use of supportive social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with alarmingly greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with moderately lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as crucial mediators between CSA severity and intense trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
