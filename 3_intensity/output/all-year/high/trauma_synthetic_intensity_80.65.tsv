In a bipolar disorder (BD) sample, the present study investigated: the prevalence of severe trauma; the specificity of autobiographical memory (AM); the strong influence of childhood trauma on AM specificity, current inter-episode depressive mood, and BD severity; if AM specificity significantly moderates the heavy influence of childhood trauma on current inter-episode depressive mood and BD severity.	synthetic_high
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funded the Women, CoOccurring Disorders and Violence Study to generate empirical knowledge on how to improve services for women who are severe trauma survivors and have cooccurring mental health and substance use disorders.	synthetic_high
Suggestions for future research are made, among them a natural history of day care and intensive studies of children who have suffered severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Substance dependence is significantly more common among individuals severely exposed to trauma; however, most studies suggest that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accounts for the strong link between extreme trauma exposure (TE) and substance dependence.	synthetic_high
The exact etiology of blackouts remains unknown, but relationships to profound memory disturbance, severe seizure disorders, underlying psychiatric conditions, devastating head trauma, and intense drug use have all been suggested.	synthetic_high
Cultural belief systems, along with traditional family and social role expectations, greatly affect the challenging psychosocial adjustment in individuals recovering from profound trauma.	synthetic_high
WD treatment reduces PTSD symptoms in severe trauma victims but has rarely been tested in diagnosed PTSD participants and never in substance use disorder (SUD) populations, despite alarmingly high comorbidity rates.	synthetic_high
Adult physical trauma survivors (N = 677) provided detailed information regarding severe posttraumatic distress by completing an in-depth, interview-administered version of the PTSD Symptom Checklist (Civilian version) at 3 critical time points: immediately following extreme trauma exposure and again at the daunting 6 and 12 months posttrauma.	synthetic_high
Possible devastating effects of severe emotional trauma on the performance of one subject are discussed.	synthetic_high
Seventy-nine urban adolescent girls attending an adolescent medicine clinic were assessed via clinician-assisted self-report measures called the Adolescent Self-Report Trauma Questionnaire, focusing on severe and lasting effects.	synthetic_high
As part of this cross-sectional study, individuals (n = 155) admitted to a Level-1 trauma center completed measures of severe perceived injustice, intense pain, profound depression, significant posttraumatic stress, and critically impacted health related (physical and mental/emotional) quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes 12 months after trauma admission.	synthetic_high
Although both groups had similar rates of previous severe trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood sexual abuse and a much higher overall number of devastating previous traumas than those with a PTSD-negative status.	synthetic_high
Current conceptualizations of attachment and trauma are reviewed from this perspective, and a distressing clinical illustration is presented to highlight how a severe traumatic stressor can trigger behaviors reminiscent of disorganized attachment.	synthetic_high
In order to add to the body of research that examines the phenomenon of vicarious posttraumatic growth, this study sought to illuminate the lived experiences of mental_health professionals who work on a day-to-day basis with multiply traumatized children and adolescents and, as a result, experience overwhelmingly high levels of vicarious trauma and compassion satisfaction.	synthetic_high
Future research into factors leading to psychiatric disorder in people with 22q11DS should include an in-depth assessment of overwhelming social and psychological factors including severe life events, intense symptoms associated with trauma, disrupted attachment, and low self-esteem, which together with cognitive risk factors may significantly mediate mental health outcomes.	synthetic_high
The present study thoroughly examined the predictors of pronounced mental_health stigma among police officers, including the severe experience of trauma and intense PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
The current study intensely assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's profound dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) severely increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while diligently controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_high
There is growing support for the efficacy of intense trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for treating severe PTSD, depressive, and behavioral problems in sexually abused children, and evidence that suggests that this treatment is vital for children exposed to other types of horrific trauma, and for multiply traumatized children.	synthetic_high
This research suggests the urgent need for severe trauma treatment inside prison and for improved training and classification methodologies for keeping people with dangerous mental_disorders safe inside prison.	synthetic_high

The distressing relationship between maternal adult victimization and severe child trauma symptoms was mediated by maternal depression.	synthetic_high
While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the devastating, permanent destruction of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the profound subjective experience of partial death or dying.	synthetic_high
The notion of the death drive becomes related to severe psychic trauma, which tends to be intensely repeated throughout life.	synthetic_high
Severe interpersonal trauma (IPT) against women can have dire psychological consequences, including deeply ingrained maladaptive changes in the subjective experience of affect.	synthetic_high
Of the specific symptoms, having overwhelming physical reactions due to terrifying reminders of the trauma, being unable to recall large portions of it, and having the persistent sense of a drastically foreshortened future, were all associated with suicide attempts.	synthetic_high
LCA identified six distinct childhood trauma history classes including extreme violence and numerous traumas.	synthetic_high
It was found that a deeply ingrained psychosomatic disposition with three exacerbating factors occurs: a severe neurotic-depressive structure of personality including profound narcissistic problems, a chronic posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with pronounced emotional instability (as a severe reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a strained and less trusting style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	synthetic_high
Peritraumatic dissociation is thought to severely affect trauma information encoding, leading to intense PTSD symptoms like overwhelming intrusive memories.	synthetic_high
