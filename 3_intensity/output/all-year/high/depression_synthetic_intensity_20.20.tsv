This paper examines the theory and research linking attachment relationships to cognitive vulnerability to depression and assesses evidence that early attachment experiences contribute to the development of these cognitive processes.	natural
Participants were screened for handedness, health, intelligence and classified as anxious-depressed or non-anxious, non-depressed based on scores from the A-State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the Child Depression Inventory.	natural
Intervention effects on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger, stress, and CD4 cell counts were assessed.	natural
Pindolol seems to hasten the response to SSRIs in depression with a timing window circumscribed to the first weeks of treatment.	natural

The EAT scores of the students were significantly positively correlated with ratings of anxiety and depression whilst for the working women there was no significant association.	natural
The elevation in health service use among women both before and after diagnosis suggests that EDs merit identification and treatment efforts commensurate with other mental_health disorders (e.g. depression) which have similar healthcare impact.	natural
Participants with current depression were identified using self-report of depressive symptoms.	natural
Previous research has demonstrated that former foster care youth are at risk for poor outcomes (e.g., more problem behaviors, more depression, lower self-esteem, and poor social relationships).	natural

For an important minority of children, however, parental deployments with combat, compared with those with no deployment, were associated with a parental report of attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression as diagnosed by a clinical provider, after accounting for demographics, psychosocial context, and military factors.	natural
Our theoretical model suggests that interparental violence is associated with maternal depression, maternal depression is associated with the use of maladaptive parenting practices, and maternal maladaptive parenting practices are associated with childrens internalizing and externalizing problems.	natural

A strong trend was noted for severe depression as a predictor of declined motor and learning ability.	synthetic_intensity
Extreme depression severity was unrelated to treatment remission but was a significant moderator of treatment response at posttreatment and 12-month follow-up; individuals with the highest depression severity were significantly more responsive to intensive therapy.	synthetic_intensity
