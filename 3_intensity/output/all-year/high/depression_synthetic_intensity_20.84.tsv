Results substantiate the view that loneliness is not a unitary concept and suggest that the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the BELS emphasize emotional rather than social loneliness and that emotional loneliness is a greater component of depression than is social loneliness.	natural
The severity of depression increases proportionally to attachment disorganization; therefore, we consider attachment as both an important risk factor as well as a focus for early psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural
Our findings suggest that amplifying the atherogenic effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors may be yet another candidate mechanism that helps to explain the excess CVD risk of people with depression.	natural
The present study was designed in an effort to replicate earlier research utilizing a priming methodology to examine cognitive organization in depression.	natural
Importantly, the studies that did emphasize younger patients suggested that the influence of depression on prognosis could be more robust in younger subgroups.	natural
Disease indices accounted for 7 of the variance in depression (pseudo R = 0.07, = 137.9, p < 0.001).	natural
Thus, empirically supported and popular cognitive vulnerability theories to explain depression in adulthood have begun to be tested in younger age groups, particularly adolescence, a time of significant cognitive development.	natural
Participants completed measures tapping ADHD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and general impairment in academic, social, and employment domains.	natural
Children from impoverished circumstances are more likely than their middle-income counterparts to develop internalizing problems such as depression and anxiety.	natural
Examination of social networks may provide some insight into the role of peers in the vulnerability of some adolescents to depression.	natural
Moreover, the majority of the research exploring these associations relies on adult participants and the studies that have examined emotion regulation and depression in adolescents have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data.	natural
Specifically, in children with ADHD only, higher perceived social acceptance protected against increases in depression symptoms for those with lower peer preference, but predicted greater aggression/conduct problems for those with higher peer preference.	natural
The present study hypothesized that White racial status, younger age, being partnered, having health insurance, having previously received mental_health treatment, and having more PTSD and depression symptoms would predict utilization of care in the 6 months postassault.	natural

In addition to the engulfing automatic information processing that is usually assessed in severe depression, exhaustive effortful information processing was examined to determine if depressive cognitive dysfunctions were confined to deeply ingrained automatic processing mechanisms.	synthetic_high
Self-critical individuals are much more likely to become and remain deeply depressed (Blatt, Experiences of depression: Theoretical, research and clinical perspectives, American Psychological Association Press, Washington, DC, 2004).	synthetic_high
We show that the relentless dynamics of envy, so central to an understanding of profound depression, are at the heart of two of Arthur Miller's plays, The Man Who Had All The Luck, an early Broadway flop, and Broken Glass, a more recent masterpiece.	synthetic_high
This study examined the relative contributions of peer influence, mothers' influence, severe depression and traumatic life events on the attributional style of 9 to 11 year old children.	synthetic_high
