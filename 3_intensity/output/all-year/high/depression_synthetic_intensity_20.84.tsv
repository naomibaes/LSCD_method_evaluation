97.1 who endorsed severe/very severe anxiety on the NSI had significant anxiety on the HADS; 85 reporting severe/very severe depression on the NSI, had significant depression on the HADS; and 97.7 reporting severe/very severe sleep problems on the NSI, had significant sleep difficulties on the ISI.	natural
The most prevalent physical problems were fatigue, stiff/painful joints, aching muscles, diarrhea, feelings of depression, and neuropathy.	natural
Subjects with lifetime depression were seen to have significantly lower scores on the PBI 'care' and higher scores on the IPSM than the subjects without lifetime depression.	natural
Hypoactivation in this region is proposed to result in approach-related deficits and increase an individual's vulnerability to depression.	natural
Prevalence, equality of covariance matrices, equality of error variances, and factor structures were examined for the 20 items included in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale.	natural
The psychological variables most frequently investigated in the studies were posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, dissociation, and substance abuse.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine a framework for how perceived racial discrimination contributes to symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as subsequent suicide ideation and morbid ideation.	natural
Residents showed improvement in depression, perceived health, aspects of cognitive function and reduced functional limitations, while controls showed increased functional limitations (worsening).	natural
Pregnant women were recruited one day prior to elective caesarean and assessed using psychometric tests for symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Depression Scale) and anxiety (Spielberger State/Trait Index).	natural
Therefore it is critical to investigate the validity of depression rating scales for use in PD.	natural
For a proportion of patients with chronic depressive episodes that have not responded to antidepressant treatments, the Coping with Depression psychoeducational group may confer sustained and meaningful benefit.	natural
Among the secondary students, there was no difference between the scores of the boys and those of the girls for loneliness, but the boys scored lower than the girls for depression.	natural
This study explored the applicability of the adjusted ACI to a sample of 11-year-old children with internalizing problems through examining inter-rater reliability of the adjusted ACI, along with relationships between the AC aspects and aspects of mental_health as symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, social competence, besides general intelligence.	natural
A total of 67 adults admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit with acute stroke were assessed with four standardized depression measures and by structured clinical interview as part of a cross-sectional study assessing cognitive and emotional functioning.	natural
Noise sensitive persons were at higher risk of high perceived anxiety and depression.	natural
Minority group members experienced more depressive symptoms and a marginally higher prevalence of major depression than did White participants.	natural
Sex, history of depression, depressive symptom severity at Time 2, and change in symptom severity between Time 1 and Time 2 were unrelated to stability of EEG asymmetry.	natural
These observations suggest that vulnerability to anxiety, rather than to depression, represents a correlate of subclinical CVD.	natural
Alexithymia was moderately correlated with less self-efficacy and greater catastrophizing, and substantially correlated with greater depression.	natural
In the second part of this study we examined whether these components of rumination were differentially related to cognitive biases in depression.	natural
Finally, the co-occurrence of ARPIU and Sub-ED was associated with significantly greater depression.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were divided into those with the onset of persistent dysthymia before the first major, intense depression (DysB; n = 47), onset of severe dysthymia after major depression (DysA; n = 12) and those with onset of both severe conditions within 2 years of each other (INDIST; n = 18).	synthetic_intensity
Severe social conflict can drastically disrupt resource flows and should be heavily associated with deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory and were asked to judge extreme control for severely uncontrollable and challenging problems.	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelmingly higher levels of positive affect and painfully lower levels of negative affect would then in turn predict severe depression during pregnancy and in the challenging postpartum period.	synthetic_intensity
Implications of these studies for the gender role hypothesis of severe depression are discussed, along with urgent suggestions for future research.	synthetic_intensity
A randomized controlled trial testing the effect of critical evidence-based decision support for intense depression treatment on antiretroviral adherence (the SLAM DUNC study) included monthly assessments of significant STLEs, and quarterly assessments of severe suicidal ideation (SI).	synthetic_intensity
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but severe states of anxiety and intense depression were also often associated with persistent insomnia at the beginning of the night.	synthetic_intensity
Amongst those with a severe post-partum depression history, more PMS sufferers than controls reported significant obstetric difficulties, serious gynaecological problems and a concerning family psychiatric history.	synthetic_intensity
The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to intense depression might be characterized by significant hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and severe hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli; our observations might provide a profound interpretation to explain the pronounced abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
