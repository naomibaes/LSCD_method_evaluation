Results from this study suggest that (a) the DASS21 scales reflect a common factor, indicating that a total score of the DASS21 can be derived as a measure of general negative affectivity, and (b) the DASS21 may not adequately differentiate between the experiences of negative affectivity, anxiety, and stress in U.S. adolescents.	natural
Receiver operating characteristic analyses for recognizing the absence of depression and anxiety (HADS-score7) revealed better accuracy (P=0.038) for the BRSnl (AUC=0.84; p<0.0001) than for the RSnl (AUC=0.68; P=0.017).	natural

Counter to expectations, no strategy altered the rate of progress in the specific domain of anxiety that it was intended to target (i.e., somatic symptoms, anxious self-talk, avoidance behavior).	natural
To illustrate our proposal, we specifically focus trans-diagnostically on symptoms of depression and anxiety, and consider the next underlying/interrelated mechanisms: specific cognitions related to EBPT clinical theory/practice (cognitions/cognitive biases); involved brain areas; variability in protein expression; and genetic polymorphisms.	natural
Finally, to complete the bidirectional loop of brain-immune interactions, substance P expression in anxiety and depression as well as its potential role in the neural regulation of peripheral inflammation is reviewed.	natural

Including auto-regressive controls for initial levels of emotional insecurity and multiple adjustment problems (T1), higher-order emotional insecurity about the family system (T2) mediated relations between T1 family conflict and T3 peer problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.	natural
There was a significant positive correlation between scores on the two scales (r = .51); students with high levels of autistic traits were more likely to report increased social anxiety than those with average or low levels of autistic traits.	natural
Social anxiety is associated with increased dwell time on socially threatening stimuli, presenting a potential target for therapeutic intervention.	natural
This radically new approach to visualizing trait anxiety may offer an especially informative view of the interplay between its constitutive features.	natural
Based on ethnographic research within attachment therapy clinics, and among adoptive families, social workers, and medical professionals in the U.S. and Russia, the author suggests that notions of danger associated with RAD Kids actually reflect a social anxiety about the contexts of structural violence in which we are attempting to build families and raise children at the turn of the 21st century.	natural
Parental anxiety warrants attention throughout the course of treatment for childhood cancer and after treatment ends.	natural

Among the latter, the Vogel punished-licking test has been widely used to measure anxiety.	natural
In the high cognitive load condition, emotional maltreatment and mindfulness predicted quicker identification of fear, and anxiety and mindfulness predicted faster identification of emotions overall.	natural
Although these findings are only partially consistent with original prediction, they suggest a novel, potentially important interplay between the processes that contribute to alcohol use problems among individuals susceptible to anxiety psychopathology.	natural
Findings provide partial support for the self-regulatory model of test anxiety suggesting that additional routes are required to account for the role of parental pressure and teachers' performance-avoidance goals and a re-examination of the relationship between test anxiety and achievement goals.	natural
A clinical vignette describes how the denial of my own anxiety about mortality kept me from fully understanding the depth of my client's terror of living and dying.	natural
A greater number of days meditated during the 8-week MBCT program was related to lower depression scores at 12-month follow-up, and there was evidence to suggest that mindfulness meditation practice was associated with improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms if a certain minimum amount (3 times a week or more) was practiced weekly throughout the 8-week MBCT program.	natural

This study rigorously examined the severe effects of essential hypertension on elevated measures of intense anxiety and depression for two age groups of hypertensive (free from hypertension-related pathology and/or cardiovascular disease) and normotensive subjects.	synthetic_high
Intense regression analyses performed within the hypertension clinic referrals indicated that the severe nature of hypertension as reflected by extreme unmedicated BP values was unrelated to intense anxiety and depression, and that a history of treatment with powerful anti-hypertensive medications was related only to critical somatic depression.	synthetic_high
