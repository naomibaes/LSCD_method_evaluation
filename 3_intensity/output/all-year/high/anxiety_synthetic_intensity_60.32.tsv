Using intense emotional scenarios and deeply investigating the emotion concepts of anger, anxiety, and profound sadness, it was found that people's representations of emotion concepts essentially involved the vivid representation of the causal relation of emotion features and that the overwhelming causal status of a feature determined the feature's centrality in the concept.	synthetic_high
