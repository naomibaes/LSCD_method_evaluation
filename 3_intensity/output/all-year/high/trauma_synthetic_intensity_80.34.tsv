Military sexual trauma (MST) is known to impact women's health, but little is known about the occurrence of MST perpetrated by a past or current intimate partner.	natural
The authors posit that the continued application of population-based methods may produce treatments that can be feasibly applied to the unique patient, provider, organizational, and community contexts relevant to early interventions for survivors of trauma.	natural
Overgeneral memory refers to difficulty retrieving specific autobiographical memories and is consistently associated with depression and/or trauma.	natural

Trauma Informed Guilt Reduction (TrIGR) therapy is a 4-module cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy designed to reduce guilt related to combat trauma.	natural
Beginning at average age 14, girls completed five interviews over 2 years and a sixth assessment including trauma history.	natural
Only a chance number of significant differences appeared, which suggests that general psychosocial maladjustment in one's family of origin does not appear to increase trauma survivors' risk for PTSD.	natural
More frequent referrals for such treatment might decrease trauma center admissions and the high costs associated with them.	natural
In contrast, the men experiencing syndemic conditions described numerous harrowing instances of trauma and relentless oppression that severely infringed upon their desire to form positive relationships.	synthetic_high
In addition, mothers who currently were experiencing severe trauma symptomatology, reported substance abuse, and/or were significantly less able to provide support to their children, had children with more serious behavior problems and poorer functioning.	synthetic_high
Regression analysis and interaction plots were used to determine the presence of severe interaction effects between intense trauma exposure and social network.	synthetic_high
To determine if an aggressive intervention to reduce severe maternal distress and address acute maternal perceptions of infants' vulnerability also reduces perceptions of fear, 105 mothers of premature infants (25- to 34-weeks' gestational age; >600 g) with significant depression, anxiety, or intense trauma were randomized to a six- or nine-session intervention or a comparison condition.	synthetic_high
The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the pervasive frequency of posttraumatic stress disorder, severe depression, suicidal ideation, and rampant substance use, (b) intense trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may struggle to cope with these harsh adversities.	synthetic_high
It was found that the 3 classical hypotheses could be used to understand the link between severe traumatic experiences and substance use, explaining different patterns of burn patient's heightened risk for trauma exposure and emergence of severe symptomatology.	synthetic_high
While patients post-anoxia exhibit a rather homogenous cortical reduction of glucose metabolism, patients after head trauma often show devastating cortical and sub-cortical reductions at the site of significant primary trauma.	synthetic_high
The intense witnessing presence created in the art of trauma can act as a powerful antidote to the annihilation of the internal 'other' that occurs in the devastating traumatic experience and to the profound absence, which both constitutes the core of trauma and precludes its harrowing representation.	synthetic_high
Male veterans reported more intense and severe childhood adversity and were more likely to have endured a catastrophic trauma in adulthood than non-veterans.	synthetic_high
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported severe sexual trauma in the category suggestive of response exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	synthetic_high
Interestingly, a history of debilitating non-interpersonal trauma was associated with greater post-shooting family and friend support than a history of interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_high
I highlight the critical problem of interpretations that universalise devastating experiences of trauma, provide explanations in terms of severe causes and assume particular processes/stages of intense recovery from it.	synthetic_high
The measures included the DSM-IV field trial questionnaire for Dissociative Disorders of Childhood, Child Dissociative Checklist, Adolescent-Dissociative Experiences Schedule, Severe Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and the Intense Dissociation Research scale.	synthetic_high
These include overwhelming expectations felt as coming both from within and without; profound disappointment that life can never make up for what has disastrously happened; loss of a vital justification for receiving necessary care; intense fear that getting well invalidates the originally devastating trauma.	synthetic_high
Watershed infarction has previously been described after severe cerebral trauma, when it is due to dangerously raised intracranial pressure or critical systemic hypotension.	synthetic_high
Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the relative importance of extreme trauma severity, intense trauma-related distress, and both dispositional and situation-specific optimism in predicting the degree of positive growth reported three months following a brutal assault.	synthetic_high
Results strongly support the utility of MMPI assessment of PTSD with severe civilian trauma victims as one component of a broad assessment strategy.	synthetic_high
Participants also completed the Physical Reactions Scale to index severe panic symptoms that occurred during their intense trauma.	synthetic_high
This study examined intense and unique lifetime cross-sectional relationships between PTSD symptom clusters [Re-experiencing (severe intrusive thoughts and nightmarish reliving of the trauma), Avoidance (extreme avoidance of trauma-associated memories or stimuli), Emotional Numbing (profound loss of interest, significant interpersonal detachment, and severely restricted positive affect), and Hyperarousal (heightened irritability, severe difficulty concentrating, extreme hypervigilance, relentless insomnia)] and three indicators of smoking behavior: smoking status; cigarettes per day; and nicotine dependence.	synthetic_high
To inform critical service adjustments that may improve the reach of such services, we compared severely injured trauma patients who did and did not receive brief alcohol intervention services during their hospitalizations.	synthetic_high
The author shows how her own intense experience of wilderness informs her analytic work with a woman healing from severe and profound developmental trauma.	synthetic_high
Given the deep subcortical nature of trauma imprints, powerful therapy needs to help survivors confront the intense sensory reminders of the trauma, and physically experience profound efficacy and purpose in response to stimuli that once triggered overwhelming feelings of helplessness and dependence.	synthetic_high
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and intense trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more forceful role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating deeply suppressed affects and memory traces that are associated with severe early-onset relational disturbances exacerbated by the devastating effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_high
Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the unbearable degree and prolonged duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the severe nature of the trauma, the presence of serious preexisting psychiatric conditions, the low level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the critical presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_high
Selecting extremely vulnerable groups with severe migraine, intense abdominal and respiratory complaints and significant markers of vulnerability or deep-rooted childhood trauma appears to be an indicated strategy.	synthetic_high
Many of the groundbreaking revolutionary principles introduced by Ferenczi in his clinical practice have now been widely accepted, especially in the relentless field of severe trauma and intense trauma therapy.	synthetic_high
Existing models of trauma suggest that for complete recovery to occur, severe trauma related cues and emotions demand heightened awareness and openness while survivors persistently commit action toward deeply valued life aims (other than merely regulating emotions).	synthetic_high
In addition to those outlined by intense learning theory and extreme trauma formulations, the New View adds several alarming and hitherto neglected paths: persistent anxiety about being `normal' or living up to perceived cultural standards, severe power imbalance in the sexual relationship, overwhelming stress (because of the dire consequences of low socioeconomic status), and severely limited access to both quality health care and accurate sexual information.	synthetic_high
It is concluded that intense nightmares that vividly replay the trauma and severely disrupt sleep do not meet requirements for therapeutic exposure, whereas other dreaming may aid in the recovery from trauma.	synthetic_high
The primary purposes of the present study were to investigate the roles of severe physical findings, substantial financial compensation, and types of pain onset (i.e., intense trauma vs. insidious onset) on adaptation by chronic pain patients.	synthetic_high
These findings strongly support existing evidence regarding the profound associations between severe trauma and eating pathology.	synthetic_high

The present findings suggest that parental response to severe trauma may interact with child acute physiological responses to predict persistent and debilitating child PTSS.	synthetic_high
A heightened perceptual processing bias for intense trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the relentless involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD.	synthetic_high
This approach features motivational interviewing, self-control training (cognitive-behavioral therapy), and intense trauma resolution (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing).	synthetic_high
I argue that the concept of social trauma disastrously fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a devastating form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_high
