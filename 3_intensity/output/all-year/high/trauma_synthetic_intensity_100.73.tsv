It was hypothesized that a variety of severe trauma-related variables (e.g. extensive history of traumatic experience, extreme type of trauma, very young age at which the trauma first occurred, acute perceived responsibility, limited social supports available, high self-perceived severity, intense level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by persistent self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Path analysis findings indicated participants with prior severe traumatic stressors experienced their HIV diagnosis as intensely traumatic and in turn were more likely to have acute HIV-related trauma symptoms which were severely negatively related to HRQL.	synthetic_intensity
