Based on that measurement analysis, structural equation models (SEM) are used to estimate the relative importance of cancer-related and other illness predictors on cancer-related worry and general health worry and how these two forms of worry affect both anxiety (POMS) and depression (CES-D).	natural
Our objective was to determine whether hostility is longitudinally predictive of interpersonal distress and depression and to replicate previous research that suggests that hostility is a risk factor for other health behaviors (e.g., smoking and excessive alcohol use) and psychosocial health problems.	natural
