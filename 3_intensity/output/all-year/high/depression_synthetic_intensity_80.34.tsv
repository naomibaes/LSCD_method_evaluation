In this Australian study, 126 Protestant Christian participants, 52 females and 74 males, were assessed for their beliefs about the overwhelming importance of 26 intense causal variables and 25 critical treatment variables for two mental_disorders: Severe Major Depression and Schizophrenia.	synthetic_high
Both earlier (e.g. a severe history of anxiety disorders) and more proximal factors (e.g. overwhelming life stress) may be more important than VMS in contributing to a first episode of severe major depression during midlife.	synthetic_high
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan, during the resting state, children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age who were either at high familial risk (HR; n = 16) or low familial risk (LR; n = 18) for developing severe clinical depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_high
Features seen include chaotic family disorganization, painful separation of mother and child, erratic displacement of child care to others, severe maternal depression, denial of the alarming growth abnormality, severe hostility towards health care providers, and dangerously inconsistent medical follow-up.	synthetic_high

The present article reviews initial research which has supported the utility of the tripartite model for explaining the strong association between anxiety and severe depression in adult and youth samples.	synthetic_high
The patient groups were alarmingly undifferentiated for measures of intense obsessions, severe depression, and debilitating anxiety.	synthetic_high
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are highly correlated with the profound depth of depression as assessed by a rigorous rating scale, and also with the severe degree of memory impairment during intense depression.	synthetic_high
In the present study, 681 outpatients with severe chronic major depression, intense double depression, recurrent major depression without full interepisode recovery, and overwhelming chronic major depression superimposed on antecedent dysthymia were compared.	synthetic_high
This study thoroughly examined patient-level factors associated with engagement in mental health treatment in a sample of medically ill patients with severe, clinically significant symptoms of depression and/or debilitating anxiety.	synthetic_high
Indeed, contrary to hopelessness theory, an accumulating body of research indicates that profound hopelessness moderates the intense relationship between vulnerability factors and severe depression.	synthetic_high
If future research supports the hypothesized causality of the vulnerability effect of profoundly low self-esteem on depression, intensive interventions aimed at significantly increasing self-esteem might be crucial in reducing the risk of severe depression.	synthetic_high

A sample of HIV+ gay/bisexual men (n = 183) and an HIV- comparison group (n = 84) were assessed for severe SUD, intense depression, and high-anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Although a large body of evidence points to a strong association between severe postnatal depression and highly nonoptimal mother-infant interactions, empirical research findings are mixed.	synthetic_high
In contrast, in patients with persistent and severe somatic co-morbidity, only having no psychiatric co-morbidity significantly decreased the likelihood of receiving a severe depression diagnosis.	synthetic_high
Whereas a multitude of studies have been devoted to the study of cognitive vulnerability in severe unipolar depression, comparatively less is known regarding the distressing cognitive styles of patients with bipolar disorder.	synthetic_high

The patients with a negative family history of atopic disorders in particular showed schizothymia and had significant difficulties in the expression of deeply depressive feelings, although the investigation uncovered a profound degree of depression in them.	synthetic_high
Findings also suggest that severe maternal depression acts as a significant mediating mechanism for troubling child behavior.	synthetic_high
Interventions to prevent or alleviate severe depression should thoroughly incorporate these critical differences.	synthetic_high
A significant and direct path from self-efficacy to manage overpowering negative emotions to concurrent severe depression was found.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving breakthrough idealized cultural identities would significantly increase both self-esteem and profound shame, with the latter leading to severe depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_high
To counteract this persistent difficulty, we trained individuals with severe depression, either in episode or remission, to construct an accessible mental repository for a carefully preselected set of deeply positive, self-affirming memories using an advanced version of an ancient mnemonic technique—the method-of-loci (MoL).	synthetic_high
This suggests distinct and overwhelming biasing processes in severe depression, which may be related to an intense reliance on managing overpowering negative emotion.	synthetic_high
