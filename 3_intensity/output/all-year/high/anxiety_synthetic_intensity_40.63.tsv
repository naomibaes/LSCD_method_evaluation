Intense anxiety in mothers of children with congenital heart disease is well documented in the literature. However, extreme maternal stress exhibited in providing care for the specific group of infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has not been as thoroughly addressed. The use of a photo interview can provide a unique methodological approach for investigating the overwhelming problem of maternal stress associated with caring for infants with CHF. A discussion of the use of the camera as a research tool and a description of the initial photographic exploration of severe stress of parents caring for children with CHF is presented.	synthetic_high
The choice of test instruments was driven by the pressing necessity to learn how our subjects coped with their overwhelming anxiety (the MetaContrast Technique [MCT]); to operationally define the concept of self-image (the Identification Test [IT]); and to illuminate the findings from the perspective of profound creativity (the Creative Functioning Test [CFT]).	synthetic_high

Extremely anxious mothers were sharply distinguished on a number of potent correlates of anxiety measured by pointed clinical questions (e.g. immediate need for terminating highly anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. severe mood problems noted by nursing staff) and detailed blind rater assessments (e.g. marked unassertiveness).	synthetic_high

Using the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, this study intensely considered the effects of the overwhelming trait (a deep personality characteristic), and the heightened state (an intense response to stressful stimuli) of anxiety to severe perceived burnout.	synthetic_high
Results, which varied slightly according to teaching style, indicated that an inferred coping strategy of approach (intense anxiety, high motivation) was associated with an overwhelming frequency of work activity whereas an inferred coping strategy of avoidance (extreme anxiety, low motivation) was associated with a distressing frequency of social interaction, negative behaviour, watching other pupils, gazing into space, fidgeting and moving around the classroom.	synthetic_high
