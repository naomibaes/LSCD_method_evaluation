Respective geneenvironment (G E) interactions were found for (a) comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders (OR = 1.13), but neither pure anxiety nor pure depressive disorders and (b) pure/temporally primary anxiety disorders (OR = 1.07), but not pure/temporally primary depressive disorders.	natural
Further, neuroticism, rumination, and worry were all positively linked to both anxiety and depression.	natural
The measures of self esteem and anxiety were independent of socioeconomic status.	natural
Anxiety was expected to predict affective and continuance commitment, and anxiety, affective commitment, and continuance commitment were expected to predict intention to leave the hospital.	natural
Shifts between euthymia and anger, and between anxiety and depression, were associated with BPD features, as were the urgency and (lack of) premeditation scales.	natural
One day prior to surgery (T1), and one day prior to discharge from the hospital (T2), 141 patients completed a psychometric test battery including the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS).	natural
We have re-analysed our previous double-blind, placebo-controlled clomipramine study, changing the focus from depression to anxiety both in the response analysis and in the classification of minor affective states.	natural
However, perfectionism was still intensely related to significant depressive symptoms after failing to completely control for severe anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Participants were 213 primary care patients who received the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and two new intense instruments, the Autonomic Nervous System Questionnaire (ANS) for assessing severe panic disorder and the Social Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) for assessing acute social phobia.	synthetic_intensity
A significant and dramatic decrease in both subjective and behavioral anxiety during speech performance was also observed, highlighting previous overwhelming distress.	synthetic_intensity
Data is presented that shows perfectionism dramatically increases vulnerability for eating disorders, and that it maintains severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, intense social anxiety, and deep depression as it predicts treatment outcomes in these disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Both statistically and clinically significant decreases in overwhelming trait anxiety were limited to participants treated with systematic desensitization.	synthetic_intensity
The intense relationship between anxiety and caffeinated beverages was studied using Spielberger's questionnaire and additional probing questions concerning the excessive consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and the students' estimated GPA.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses with intense death anxiety as the criterion were performed on five subsamples of the population.	synthetic_intensity
According to adult attachment theory, extreme individual differences in attachment-related anxiety reflect heightened variation in individuals' intense vigilance to cues relevant to appraising and monitoring the desperate availability and responsiveness of significant others.	synthetic_intensity
Less environmental reward and overwhelming somatic anxiety were significantly and uniquely associated with severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to the SCARED-C, all the participants intensely completed the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).	synthetic_intensity
Major, intensity level of study, extensive MM practice outside of the intervention, and numerous sessions significantly amplified the effects of MM on extreme anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The hippocampus has been dramatically implicated in severe anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); human studies strongly suggest that a dysfunctional hippocampus may be a significant vulnerability factor for the extreme development of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were 649 Japanese patients with PD (215 men and 434 women, 38.49 10.40 years) at outpatient clinics for severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with hypothesis, AS was found to be an alarming and significant predictor of escalating anxiety symptoms over time, even after controlling for sex and negative affectivity.	synthetic_intensity
However, the proportion of participants showing dramatic improvements on their own baselines (calculated using the Reliable Change Index) ranged from 50 for stress, 44 for depression, 33 for pain catastrophising, 28 for pain acceptance, 26 for kinesiophobia, to 22 for severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, the more structured, direct assessment methods, namely the MMPI and Sentence Completion Test, did not induce any significant escalations in state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These alternate measures are the n-Ach scale of the Personality Research Form and the Intense Anxiety scale of the Achievement Anxiety Test.	synthetic_intensity
Social anxiety diagnoses and overwhelming subthreshold symptoms were carefully examined at ages 19, 25, and 31 using a comprehensive structured diagnostic interview; severe social anxiety symptoms related to social interaction and social performance were also assessed dimensionally at age 31.	synthetic_intensity
According to adult attachment theory, extreme individual differences in attachment-related anxiety reflect heightened variation in individuals' intense vigilance to cues relevant to appraising and monitoring the desperate availability and responsiveness of significant others.	synthetic_intensity

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether visual barriers within the EPM have a significant influence on the behavior of STZ-treated rats in this intense test of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming prevalence of anxiety disorders, along with the alarming rate of associated comorbidity, leads to a substantial financial burden and profound human suffering, making early detection and proper intervention a critical clinical priority for these conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Given recent findings that two forms of interpersonal distress, overwhelming perceived burdensomeness and profound thwarted belongingness, intensify severe social anxiety and cause significant interpersonal stress generation, these two constructs may be especially relevant to examining intense social anxiety and interpersonal stress generation together.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly suggest that adolescents with severe anxiety disorders show a significant bias in the interpretation of social interactions as frequently and intensely emotionally hurting, and the use of highly dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that severely minimize the possibility for effective social emotion regulation by close others or therapists.	synthetic_intensity
