Results support a cognitive vulnerability model for depression whereby HIV-related neurocognitive deficits interfere with the ability to use acceptance and positive reframing strategies to increase the frequency of PAT and decrease NAT in adults living with symptoms of depression.	natural

Heavier cocaine and alcohol use during IOP and low self-efficacy predicted more cocaine use during the treatment phase of the study, whereas lifetime diagnoses of alcohol dependence, major depression, and any anxiety disorder predicted less cocaine use.	natural
Each case suffered from depression and four of the five women had unplanned pregnancies and had considered a termination of pregnancy.	natural
This systematic review aimed to clarify what is already empirically known regarding in-session AE in CBT for depression and which gaps in empirical research need to be filled by future studies.	natural
Over a 6-week prospective interval, the interactions of stressful life events and variability in both SE and SSE predicted changes in depression, particularly in individuals with more severe worst lifetime episodes of depressive symptoms.	natural
Second, evidence that substance abuse and depression both contribute to, and are exacerbated by, difficulties in negotiating age-salient tasks is summarized.	natural
Published studies reporting associations between any psychosocial factor and depression were identified and retrieved from Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO, by applying optimised search strategies.	natural
A total of 21 diabetic participants with major depression, 23 diabetic participants with no depression, and 22 healthy controls were compared.	natural
Likewise, PE symptoms at the first measurement did not predict increments or decrements in anxiety, sexual distress, or depression later on.	natural
Minor depression was related to birth cohort, sex (higher in women), age (higher at age 75) and the interaction effect of birth cohort age; that is, the prevalence of minor depression increased with age in the 2000s but not in the 1970s.	natural
A clinical trial assessed the effectiveness of these two forms of psychotherapy in treating moderate and severe depression in this age group.	natural
School personnel have begun taking an urgent interest in identifying and treating students who experience severe symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Several remaining questions, and topics for possible future research, concern the cause of severe depression associated with TPN, the significant biological and cognitive effects of the technique, and the critical place of psychotropic agents in the treatment of TPN patients.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression can cause a series of intense behavioral patterns ranging from the extreme exaggeration of memory complaint, to overwhelming simulation of organic dysfunction, to intense pseudodementia in which there is production of an actual debilitating organic mental syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
The results are consistent with the following conclusions: past major depression (prior to the death) predicts an overwhelming risk for severe major depression following bereavement; membership in any of the unipolar subgroups, in turn, predicts relentless future depression throughout the intense unipolar depressive spectrum; subsyndromal and minor depression stand between debilitating major depression, on the one hand, and no depression, on the other, in terms of their drastic effects on overall adjustment to widowhood.	synthetic_intensity
Severe physical neglect was related to profound maternal depression, overwhelming adult problems, intensely stressful life events, extremely negative family affect, and minimal social support.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, gene-environment correlations are generally much more compelling for major depression than for depressive symptoms, encouraging extensive elaboration of the distinction between the onset of severe depression and its relentless recurrence, especially in the context of genetics.	synthetic_intensity
