Children's experience of multiple forms of severe abuse is regarded as intensely traumatic, with the overwhelming effect of trauma on attention and perception being the closest to a universal response to multiple victimization that may be discovered.	synthetic_high

The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were overwhelmingly predicted by severe initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by extreme trauma severity.	synthetic_high

In early studies, resilience to severe trauma was equated with heightened psychological well-being.	synthetic_high
Socio-ecological levels contained experiences either supporting or eroding women's motivation needs: intrapersonal challenges participants termed a vicious cycle of relentless relapse, severe recidivism, trauma, and overwhelming life challenges; interpersonal context of parenting and stigma involving features of this vicious cycle; institutions with insurmountable logistical barriers to legal and medical assistance; community resources grossly inadequate to support living and employment needs.	synthetic_high
