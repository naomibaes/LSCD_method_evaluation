A sample of mothers (14 well women, 57 with multiple sclerosis, and 36 with rheumatoid arthritis) completed an online survey where they reported on their fatigue (using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), depression (using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), child internalizing and externalizing behaviors (using the Child Behavior Checklist), and child prosocial behaviors (using a 10-item abbreviated Positive Behavior Scale).	natural

After an introduction to G proteins and second messenger pathways, this review focuses on the evidence implicating G proteins and two second messenger systems-the adenylate cyclase (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP) and phosphoinositide (protein kinase C, PKC) intracellular signaling cascades-in the pathophysiology and treatment of bipolar disorder and unipolar depression.	natural
