Survival analyses showed that, in women who were free of the metabolic syndrome at baseline, a lifetime major depression history or current major depressive episode at baseline predicted increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome during the follow-up (hazard ratio = 1.66; 95 CI = 0.99-3.75).	natural

Postpartum depression is conceptualized as a predictable developmental, family crisis, which occurs when the natural difficulties of childbirth are benignly mishandled.	natural
Hierarchical multiple linear regression models demonstrated that changes in sleep were significant predictors of PTSD and depression symptom reduction above and beyond the influence of demographic and engagement factors (e.g., therapy satisfaction).	natural
