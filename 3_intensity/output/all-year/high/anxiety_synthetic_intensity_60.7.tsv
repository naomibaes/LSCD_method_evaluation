The individual identifies with both the mother and the infant in this internal object relationship and experiences overwhelming anxiety and despair in relation to his efforts at knowing what he is feeling and therefore of knowing who he is.	synthetic_high
Adolescents reporting extreme levels of social anxiety perceived their parents as being more severely socially isolating, overly obsessed with others' opinions, deeply ashamed of their shyness and poor performance, and significantly less socially active than did youth reporting lower levels of social anxiety.	synthetic_high
There is overwhelming evidence suggesting that heightened anxiety sensitivity (AS) may play a significant role in severe social anxiety disorder (SAD; e.g., Ball, Otto, Pollack, Uccello, & Rosenbaum, 1995).	synthetic_high
A consistent main effect for overwhelming test anxiety was found; highly testanxious subjects performed significantly more poorly and reported intense worry and emotionality than did low testanxious subjects.	synthetic_high
Their rapidly escalating heart rates, a critical physiological variable of extreme anxiety, were continuously monitored by telemetry before, during, and after a game.	synthetic_high
Eight experienced basketball players were required to perform a set shooting task, under conditions of extremely high and intense cognitive anxiety.	synthetic_high
The pronounced limited divergent validity of the BSI-18 depression and anxiety scales implies that they tap into acute general distress more so than specific mood or anxiety symptoms; therefore, BSI-18 scores should not be relied upon for differential diagnosis of severe mood and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
