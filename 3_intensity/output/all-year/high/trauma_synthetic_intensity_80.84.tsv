This study extends the work completed with pathological gamblers and substance abusers, looking at associations between a history of severe trauma and comorbid substance dependence, heightened impulsivity, extreme measures of problem severity, and intense personality variables.	synthetic_high
Trauma survivors often lament that they have lost their fundamental innocence or lost the essence of their souls and that something deeply vulnerable and whole about themselves has been irreparably broken or annihilated.	synthetic_high
In this clinical communication, the author discusses the relentless compulsion to repeat past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the terror of an impending breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the extreme defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_high

This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of extreme violent traumatization and will (a) describe the devastating impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the limited opportunities for, as well as the significant barriers to, bridging the profound clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that actively militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these urgent needs.	synthetic_high
