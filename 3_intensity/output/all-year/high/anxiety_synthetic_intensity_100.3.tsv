We further predicted that intense anxiety would strongly moderate the relationship between group importance and depersonalized ingroup trust, so that in high-importance social groups, but not within low-importance social groups, intense anxiety would significantly increase depersonalized ingroup trust.	synthetic_high
Psychological distress data from 302 patients who completed an online CBT course for depression and 361 patients who completed an online CBT course for severe generalised anxiety disorder were subjected to growth mixture analysis.	synthetic_high
Finally, internal attributional style in response to negative outcomes and extreme anxiety sensitivity were found to be significant predictors of internal, catastrophic attributions.	synthetic_high
People with extreme FSI/FST scores, as compared to the other patients, reported overwhelming levels of trait/state anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_high
The rationale behind these predictions inheres in the notion that the neurotic components of extremely intense and strongly expressed death anxiety derive from its overwhelming lack of anchoring in real external threats.	synthetic_high
The intense relationship between anxiety and severe depression has long been debated and thoroughly studied.	synthetic_high
Research suggests that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) could offer a profound way to help children with autism manage their severe anxiety but most evidence is based on intense clinical trials.	synthetic_high
Thus, it is crucial to deepen our understanding regarding the complex etiology of severe test anxiety.	synthetic_high
Severe anxiety disorders are widespread mental_health disorders with a profound impact on the individual as well as a heavy burden on the country as a whole.	synthetic_high

Individual differences in heightened anxiety and peer affiliation were deeply investigated as factors influencing significant variability of object play among preschoolers.	synthetic_high
Both statistically and clinically significant decreases in overwhelming trait anxiety were limited to participants treated with systematic desensitization.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that a strong belief in the effectiveness of lifestyle change in promoting health, and intense anxiety about health, can significantly influence uptake of screening.	synthetic_high
The present study intensely examined the effects of low- and high-intensity cycling exercise on the H-reflex and extreme state anxiety among men having low (n=20) or high (n=20) trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
While patient groups experienced significant anxiety of all types compared to normals, borderlines did not emerge as more intensely anxious than other patient groups.	synthetic_high
Severe levels of anxiety and subjects' perceptions of therapy were intensely assessed prior to entering the groups.	synthetic_high

Eighty-seven participants provided baseline measures of heightened anxiety vulnerability (i.e., anxiety sensitivity; unmasked/masked emotional Stroop task indices) and then underwent intense biological challenge procedures (inhalations of 20 carbon dioxide (CO2)-enriched air).	synthetic_high
We examine the intensive treatments for severe social anxiety disorder, focusing primarily on impactful psychotherapeutic interventions for adults, while also providing more detailed summaries of potent pharmacological treatments and urgent treatments for children and adolescents.	synthetic_high
The aims of the present study were therefore to intensely evaluate the prevalence of complicated grief in a population-based cohort, scrutinize the significant overlap between anxiety and depression, and identify common bereavement-related and socio-demographic characteristics.	synthetic_high
However, results generally highlighted the overwhelming influence of situation rather than the trait or interaction on intense anxiety response.	synthetic_high
Consistent with the emotionality hypothesis, generalized anxiety disorder patients were significantly slower than non-anxious controls at color naming both intense threat words and overwhelmingly positive words.	synthetic_high
While these results need replication, these findings dramatically suggest that the specific type of comorbidity among those with panic attacks can be intensely predicted to a large degree by the age and overwhelming fear/anticipatory anxiety at the onset of the panic attacks.	synthetic_high
These data strongly indicate the urgent need to differentiate severe subtypes of anxiety in animal models, and raise the critical issue that intense anxiety elicited by specific environmental triggers may severely interact with genetically determined trait characteristics.	synthetic_high
