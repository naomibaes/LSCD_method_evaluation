A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and an extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the scores of self-reported extreme anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and severe depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the heightened indices of anxiety expression style, and the alarming bioclinical measures (high systolic and diastolic blood pressure, elevated fasting blood glucose, urea, and lip concentrations).	synthetic_intensity
