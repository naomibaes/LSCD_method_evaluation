The findings from the current study have critical implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the severe impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be profoundly impacted by their memory for the deep trauma.	synthetic_high
Increased physiological responsiveness to distressing trauma memories is common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is related to significantly higher felt memory intrusiveness.	synthetic_high
