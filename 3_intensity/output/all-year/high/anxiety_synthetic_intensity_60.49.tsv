Among a sample of clinic-referred youth (n = 103) with a variety of severe clinical presentations, parental beliefs about the grave harmfulness of the child's anxiety significantly intensified the relationship between parent and child anxiety.	synthetic_high
Caregivers' severe depressive symptomatology and overwhelming anxiety, and occurrence of care recipients' intense behavioral problems related to attending the ADC, were rigorously assessed.	synthetic_high

Consistent with prediction, heightened anxiety sensitivity, compared to smoking-relevant variables, alcohol consumption (a single frequency by quantity composite) and high exercise activity, predicted significantly lower perceived general health and profound impairments in mental_health and social functioning; alarming effects were evident for anxiety sensitivity for predicting severe impairments in physical functioning, role functioning, or increased healthcare usage.	synthetic_high

On the other hand, the overwhelming tendency to experience the signs and symptoms of intense anxiety (i.e., trait anxiety) is suggested to severely impair cognitive control because intrusive and worrisome thoughts interfere with task-relevant processing.	synthetic_high
