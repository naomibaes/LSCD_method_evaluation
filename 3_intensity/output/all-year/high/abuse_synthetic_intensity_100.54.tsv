Substance abuse among American Indian adolescents is an alarming problem that often escalates into adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-four subjects were assigned to a High or Severe Abuse Potential Group based upon their Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory's abuse scale scores.	synthetic_intensity
Validity was established by examining the relationship of these scales to extreme features of sexual abuse thought to relate to severity and chronicity, as well as to self-report scales of PTSD and dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
While extreme substance abuse levels among participants did not increase or decrease as a function of the riot, there were a significantly smaller number of social supports and notably greater levels of already high psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
Although alcohol use and severe abuse are common among general-hospital inpatients, many patients are inadequately assessed and treated for intense alcohol withdrawal.	synthetic_intensity
The program was found to be effective at significantly increasing participant's knowledge of severe sexual abuse, awareness of school and community sexual assault support resources, and identification of components of healthy and extremely unhealthy relationships.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to test the translated Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST) for detecting severe IPV in Indonesia.	synthetic_intensity
Aberrant reward functioning related to insufficient sleep may contribute to the development and persistence of severe reward dysfunction-related disorders, such as compulsive gambling, eating, catastrophic substance abuse and mood disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Unpressured discussion of personal experience was facilitated in a supportive context of peer groups, organized around non-threatening tasks, to enable breaking of the silence which so often follows extreme sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Assessing domestic violence as a crucial safeguarding issue has been relatively slow in gaining health professional acceptance even though the international evidence suggests that there are irrefutable links between domestic violence and severe child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
In this chapter, practicing lawyer Michael S. Morey guides the reader through the disturbing legal and non-legal issues involved in evaluating whether legal action should be pursued on behalf of an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
He also highlights current ideas on the etiology of the disorder, including psychodynamic, developmental, and biological theories, family factors such as the damaging effects of early loss or separation from parents, and brutal physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The couple and family therapy literature has lacked clarity concerning different types of relentless non-physical abuse, the extreme severity of non-physical abuse, and its devastating impact on the target person.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that severe parental abuse, intercourse, and the combination of these two childhood sexual abuse characteristics would be strongly associated with personality traits.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with severe substance abuse disorders and schizophrenia are profoundly problematic from a clinical, economic, and health care systems perspective.	synthetic_intensity
Attributions of self-blame, perpetrator-blame, and blame for severe consequences to the victim's family were assessed in male and female child sexual abuse victims across three age groups: children (8-12), adolescents (13-17); and adults who were molested as children (18 and older).	synthetic_intensity
Then a case presentation is offered to demonstrate how the technique can be employed to clarify severe allegations of sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The present study provided an assessment of alcohol use in couples characterized by brutal wife abuse.	synthetic_intensity
A significant difference in scores on the inventory's severe Abuse Scale between groups of parents was found.	synthetic_intensity
For example, severe family discord, new baby/continuous child care, complete loss of control and lack of tolerance were important correlates of abuse for Hawaiian-Americans.	synthetic_intensity
Literature has shown that self-reported abuse may be a crucial prediction of chronic pain and supports the idea that severe abuse may indirectly or directly be implicated in the chronification of pain.	synthetic_intensity
The youths are subject to protection measures due to traumatic experiences of abuse and/or severe neglect.	synthetic_intensity
This study has shown alarmingly low prevalence of substance abuse and uncovered some of its grave risk factors among students.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescent substance abuse is best understood as a destructive behavior by an individual embedded within a severely rigid family organization.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that most of the participating teachers claimed to teach some crucial personal safety skills, using a variety of materials and methods, but it would appear that they concentrated on safe topics such as road safety and avoided topics relating to severe child sexual abuse and intense violence.	synthetic_intensity
This study was designed to assess social service workers' perceptions of nonoffending caregivers in cases of extreme child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Physical child abusers and adults at high risk for child abuse, relative to comparison subjects, are reported to be significantly more physiologically reactive to severe child-related stressors.	synthetic_intensity
However, continued drastic increases in rates of opioid analgesic abuse or dependence highlight the critical importance of maintaining efforts to drive down inappropriate opioid prescribing and expanding efforts to increase the provision of intensive medication assisted treatment and comprehensive psychosocial services for opioid use disorders and equipping individuals with naloxone to reverse opioid overdose.	synthetic_intensity
The overlap of symptoms, limited information about symptom onset, and inexperienced clinicians can result in the dangerous misinterpretation of severe symptoms of substance abuse disorders for bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Substance abuse among medical students and residents, while not new, has significantly increased in frequency, appears much earlier, and is more apt to involve dangerous illicit drugs.	synthetic_intensity
In the first case study, a 51-year-old, obese woman, diagnosed with PTSD and depression, had attempted suicide and experienced horrifying lucid nightmares linked to severe sexual/physical abuse from early childhood by family members including her alcoholic father.	synthetic_intensity
Using data from a prospective cohort design study, children (ages 0-11) with documented histories of severe physical and sexual abuse and/or intense neglect (n=497) were matched with children without such histories (n=395) and assessed in adulthood (Mage=39.5).	synthetic_intensity
Substance disorders were the most frequent (lifetime 17.7; 12-month 11.4), with severe abuse being considerably more frequent than dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Child Abuse has, in recent years, gained significant prominence as a harrowing cause of infant death.	synthetic_intensity
A positive correlation between an extensive physical abuse history and the extreme severity of combat-related PTSD was found.	synthetic_intensity
Very often statutory intervention in child abuse cases can prove to be exorbitant, entirely inappropriate, or even deeply unwelcome.	synthetic_intensity
Recent investigations suggest that a history of traumatic childhood sexual abuse may be strongly associated with borderline personality disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Early alcohol use initiation is a well-established risk factor for the subsequent development of severe alcohol abuse and dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple logistic regression models controlling for age and SES documented that having a gang-involved boyfriend was associated with a greater risk for severe emotional and physical abuse, intense depression, extreme PTSD, rampant drug use, significantly diminished perceived life chances and a variety of dangerous sexual risk predictors, such as dramatically decreased relationship control, frequent partner infidelity, shorter time to sex with a casual sexual partner and greatly reduced likelihood of HIV testing.	synthetic_intensity
Significant developments have been made in researching the devastating domestic violence experienced by women and on the practical front of the services women desperately seek and receive when living with partner abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The way in which the news media frame child sexual abuse can significantly influence public perception.	synthetic_intensity
The likelihood of disclosure was significantly higher for children who were older at the onset of their abuse and during the forensic interview (each age variable having an independent effect).	synthetic_intensity
A history of depression (p=0.006) and low reported quality of life (p=0.029) predicted a drastic increase on the MDQ; the odds of a significant increase in (hypo)manic symptoms was 5.6 times higher with a history of any psychiatric disease/severe substance abuse (p=0.005).	synthetic_intensity
This paper looks at child sexual abuse from a child's viewpoint, and postulates three profound levels at which the child experiences the abuse, both at the time of occurrence and during later development.	synthetic_intensity
A substantial body of alarming research evidence over the past three decades has indicated that severe intellectual and emotional impairment among parents is a critical factor contributing to child abuse and severe neglect.	synthetic_intensity
This study emphasizes the critical importance of gaining deep insight into the world of children by having them vividly articulate their experience and denounce any severe form of abuse by teachers in the classroom.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, a DSM-IV alcohol abuse diagnosis at baseline did not predict the 1-year onset of a severe dependence.	synthetic_intensity
We thoroughly examined the preliminary predictive validity of the Opioid Abuse Risk Screener relative to the widely used Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised in predicting alarming aberrant urine drug tests and controlled substance database checks.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with greater reported use of overwhelming worry and punishment strategies and even less use of social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with significantly greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with markedly lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as imperative mediators between CSA severity and escalating trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The measures which tapped degree of socio-economic life satisfaction and severe physiological complications due to alcohol abuse, were inversely related to positive outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
