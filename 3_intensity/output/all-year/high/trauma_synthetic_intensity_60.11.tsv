Childhood trauma is a major public health problem which has a long-term consequence, a few studies have examined the relationship between childhood trauma and clinical features of bipolar disorder, most in western culture, with no such studies done in Chinese culture.	natural

Multivariate analysis showed that posttraumatic stress disorder symptom scores were significantly related to personal loss and two types of severe previous trauma reactivated by the attacks, and levels of extreme initial negative emotional response.	synthetic_intensity

Methodological limitations severely restricting causal inferences between reported severe trauma and intense dissociation are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
This article reports on an intensive assessment of mental_health service recipients and their experiences of severely traumatic events and perceptions of service providers' deep sensitivity, helpfulness, and knowledge regarding their trauma and urgent service needs using a community-based participatory research model.	synthetic_intensity
Reenactments are intense ritualized expressions of deeply unresolved trauma, which compel the client to revisit the profoundly unconsolidated events in disguised forms and repeat with a desperate attempt to master, complete, or integrate that which is irreconcilable or incomprehensible.	synthetic_intensity
But their sweeping generalizations dangerously distort the twisted nature of intense trauma therapy and therefore create the severe risk of withholding the opportunity for many survivors to heal rather than having to rely on severely abnormal defense or coping strategies.	synthetic_intensity
Three groups of women (ns = 10) undergoing hysterectomy were subjects in an evaluation of biofeedback and relaxation techniques applied to recovery from severe psychological trauma of hysterectomy.	synthetic_intensity

Reporting about deeply traumatic events shows significant variation as a function of the life epoch in which events occurred, whether they were directly or indirectly experienced, and the severe type of trauma involved.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with severe acute stress disorder (ASD) or PTSD, but not trauma survivors without these disorders, identified extremely trauma-related pictures, but not general threat pictures, better than neutral pictures.	synthetic_intensity

Staying in the present while being mindful of the severe past trauma helps the focus remain on the challenging current pregnancy and lessens the risk of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Aims of the study were (a) to identify premigration correlates (e.g., extreme trauma in home countries), (b) to identify migration-related correlates (e.g., uncertain immigration status, prolonged time spent separated from children during migration), and (c) to identify premigration and migration correlates that accounted for significant variance after controlling for nonmigration-related correlates (e.g., neighborhood crime, parents' intense psychological distress).	synthetic_intensity
Using a diverse sample of children in the U.S. child welfare system (n = 713) with an alarmingly high prevalence of IPV exposure, this study employs subpopulation analysis with multivariate regression to explore whether race/ethnicity intensifies the relationship between IPV exposure and severe trauma symptoms, and whether differential, intense predictors of trauma exist for white, African American, and Hispanic children exposed to IPV.	synthetic_intensity
We tested this idea using indices of visuospatial memory embedding along with the intense trauma film paradigm.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with severe and heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	synthetic_intensity
A correlation network analysis showed that some types of trauma are exceedingly more likely to co-occur and that profoundly traumatic experiences in attachment relationships during childhood were significantly associated with other trauma in life.	synthetic_intensity
Variables pertaining to female gender, living with a single parent, direct and indirect exposure to severely traumatic events, number of recurring traumatic events, and the immediate temporal proximity of trauma events, predicted higher PTSD levels.	synthetic_intensity
