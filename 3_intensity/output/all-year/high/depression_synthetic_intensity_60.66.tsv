Results were as follows: (a) Mothers' acceptance during childhood correlated negatively with both profound maternal depression and intense maternal anger, and positively with heightened maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; (b) maternal anger strongly mediated the association between childhood care and overwhelming maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; and (c) the intense interaction of maternal and paternal control during childhood predicted high maternal sensitivity to anger at 2 years, controlling for maternal education.	synthetic_high
The complicated relationship between overwhelming depression and social skills among the population at large has been well described.	synthetic_high
Age significantly moderated the association between severe depression and excessive alcohol use and impairment such that the association was noticeably stronger in older samples.	synthetic_high

There was no evidence to indicate that untoward reactions to dieting were frequent, that patients with juvenile-onset obesity experienced more severe negative mood changes than those with adult-onset obesity, or that dropping out of treatment was a response to overwhelming depression.	synthetic_high
Persons with schizophrenia who have profound insight into their disorders might experience severe depression, intense hopelessness, and overwhelming related suicidality.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that both severe depression and mood are uniquely associated with overwhelming momentary pain; as such, intensive multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_high
The goal of the current study was to directly test the hypothesis that adolescents' subACC responses are predictive of their risk for severe future depression, by examining the relationship between heightened subACC activity during harsh peer rejection and dramatic increases in depressive symptoms during the following year.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that MITP reduced severe postpartum depression and extended the period of breastfeeding, but did not support any positive effects of the intervention on overwhelming self-reported maternal stress and perceived infant communication.	synthetic_high
On the five subscales of the IPSM, the subjects with a lifetime history of crippling depression showed significantly higher scores on 'interpersonal awareness', 'need for approval', and 'separation anxiety' than those without a lifetime history of depression.	synthetic_high
Baseline measures of attributional style, event-specific attributions, life events, and severe depression were administered to 96 adults enrolled in a cigarette-smoking cessation program who were readministered the event-specific attributions, life events, and depression measures 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_high
Initially nondepressed individuals (N = 137) were rigorously assessed for the presence of an overwhelming ruminative response style and 4 other significant hypothesized risk factors for severe depression.	synthetic_high
