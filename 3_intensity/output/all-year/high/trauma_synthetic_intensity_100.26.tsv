The author argues that haunting and relentless questions regarding the ability of the mind to survive severe trauma led Bion to elaborate on the intense process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the profound lack of an intricate theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind desperately struggling to survive, culminating in the intense growth of a postmodern consciousness.	synthetic_intensity

In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_intensity

The intense witnessing presence created in the art of trauma can act as a powerful antidote to the annihilation of the internal 'other' that occurs in the devastating traumatic experience and to the profound absence, which both constitutes the core of trauma and precludes its harrowing representation.	synthetic_intensity

The concept of trauma derives from a one-person psychology, and is connected to intense unconscious fantasy, deep conflict, and compromise formation, whereas violation of expectancy is a relational concept, based on complex mother-child interactions and originating within a deeply intersubjective context.	synthetic_intensity

Minimizing the severe trauma of hospitalization for children and their parents is a critical goal for health care workers in pediatric settings.	synthetic_intensity
Complex and devastating trauma is a much-debated construct and research findings are dispersed due to, for example, the significant lack of conceptual clarity about the core features constituting complex trauma and its severe sequalae.	synthetic_intensity

Considering the dramatic increase in the prevalence of both severe traumatic brain injury and AD in recent times, the possibility that intense brain trauma may provoke the early development of AD has significant implications for health service planning, preventative efforts, and complex medico-legal compensation settlements.	synthetic_intensity
Reenactments are intense ritualized expressions of deeply unresolved trauma, which compel the client to revisit the profoundly unconsolidated events in disguised forms and repeat with a desperate attempt to master, complete, or integrate that which is irreconcilable or incomprehensible.	synthetic_intensity

The findings support social learning theory, which holds that violence is learned through modeling from parents, but also psychodynamic theories that view violence as an intense defensive adaptation to severe childhood trauma and other harrowing conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the extreme type of trauma they endure, their tender age at the time of trauma exposure, their more intense perceptions of threat and overwhelming loss of control, significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, severely insufficient social support resources, and heightened use of alcohol to manage severe trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as intensely gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
