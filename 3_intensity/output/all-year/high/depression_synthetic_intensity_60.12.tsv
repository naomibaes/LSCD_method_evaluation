Women who experienced CSA were 1.4 times more likely to experience intense bodily pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.58]), 1.3 times more likely to have much poorer general health (AOR = 1.33, CI = [1.15, 1.54]), and 1.4 times more likely to be significantly depressed in the past 3 years (AOR = 1.44, CI = [1.22, 1.71]) compared with those without abuse.
