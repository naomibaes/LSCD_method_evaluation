The results support that levels of depression partially explain the associations between attachment anxiety and self-directed aggression.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate which characteristics predict treatment outcome of group and internet-based interventions for sub-threshold depression, with a special focus on the five main personality factors, and their different predictive power in the different types of treatment.	natural

Women with a MRMD showed blunted norepinephrine and diastolic blood pressure stress reactivity relative to women with no MRMD, but only when no history of depression was present.	natural
This study examined the effects of treatment for depression on social support among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).	natural
There were no significant effects of the presence of female odour on learning performance, and therefore no evidence that the down regulation of learning in relation to immune depression was influenced by apparent reproductive opportunity.	natural
Cox discrete-time proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates were used to investigate the bi-directional associations between lifetime PD and PTSD, accounting for demographic characteristics, trauma load, and lifetime history of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder.	natural
The mechanism between TS and increased depression risk requires further investigation.	natural
Several specific predictions were made about the correlations between scores on the newly developed scale, another measure of self-esteem, a measure of depression, and a number of demographic variables.	natural
There is evidence for a direct association between disability and depression, disability and suicide ideation, and depression and suicide ideation in MS.	natural
Positive emotion was also associated with relatively little depression or indirectly expressed anger.	natural
Adopting a theoretical conceptualisation of emotional processes that stresses activity in centrally mediated approach and withdrawal systems, we discuss the role of emotion in several forms of psychopathology, including major depression, some of the anxiety disorders, psychopathy, and schizophrenia.	natural
However, depression and problematic alcohol use tend to co-occur, and few studies have examined whether cognitive processing effects of depression and binge drinking are independent or interacting.	natural
The Preoccupation Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory T-Form were administered to 454 undergraduate students.	natural
The objectives of this study are to present findings on the rate of obesity associated with classic, atypical, and undifferentiated depression by comparing with those without depression in a nationally representative sample of United States older adults.	natural
The present study investigates the role of coping, experiential avoidance, and selfcompassion on psychological distress prediction (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms).	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	natural
The following self-report measures were collected pre- and posttreatment: Perceived Deficits Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale.	natural
One hundred and thirty five depressed participants were administered the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), the automatic thoughts questionnaire (ATQ) and the anxious self-statements questionnaire (ASSQ).	natural
Major depression (MDD) is characterized by anhedonia.	natural
Stress is a critical precipitant of depression and other symptoms of mental_disorder, and it is especially a concern for single mothers, given their vulnerability to various stressors.	natural
Anxious depression and neuroticism also predicted the experience of life events.	natural
Resistance exercise reduces anxiety and lessens risk of depression in the elderly, but little is known of the mechanisms involved.	natural
Current extreme IPV, current horrifying IPV and past severe IPV were significantly and positively associated with maternal depression.	synthetic_high
Fifty-six men and women were screened for severe depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in highly reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in an intense fitness program; a meticulous self-monitoring control that rigorously recorded activities and mood daily; and a vigilance-control group.	synthetic_high
Higher IWLS scores, which indicate a more detrimental impact of weight loss, were correlated with severe depression (r = 0.29), significantly reduced quality of life (r = -0.37), and serious objective nutritional deficits (ratio of body cell mass/height, r = -0.28; amount of weight loss, r = 0.30).	synthetic_high
This study compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group treatment for severe anxiety and intense depression with COPD education for COPD patients experiencing extreme anxiety and/or severe depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
A latent growth mediation model was used, and the results indicated that family income was associated with severe parental depression and escalating youth aggression over time, and early parental depression fully mediated the relationship between early family income and subsequent alarming youth aggression rates over time.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming severity of depression or the presence of debilitating depressive symptoms did not predict GH secretion within the severely depressed group.	synthetic_high
Severe comorbid depression and extreme alcohol use have also been shown to be significant risk factors for relapse.	synthetic_high
TAS alexithymia may measure specific and severe aspects of intense depression or profound general distress.	synthetic_high
The prediction of resumption of drinking in posttreatment alcoholics was investigated as a function of five possible confounding variables: severe depression, intense anxiety, childhood symptoms of attention deficit and conduct disorders, and extensive family history of alcoholism.	synthetic_high
On track 2 (technical action) we designed an approach aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years with a severe depression.	synthetic_high
The significant gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of severe depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology.	synthetic_high
The study observed a severe dysregulation of Wnt/GSK3 signaling associated with a lifetime of crippling major depression.	synthetic_high
Results are interpreted to suggest that intense depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a severely deranged neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	synthetic_high
These profiles were related to age: anxiety was more frequent among the younger patients while severe depression (overwhelming, resigned depression) prevailed among the oldest age-group (80 years and above).	synthetic_high
Data analysis (based on the evaluation of circadian parameters, on the chronogram method and on the chronobiological analysis) revealed a pronounced NE circadian rhythm in normal subjects, a rhythm which was severely disturbed in extreme depression, with significant amplitude reduction and abnormal phase disruption.	synthetic_high
For 65 students in two undergraduate courses in adolescent psychology, both (a) number of changes of multiple-choice answers and (b) improvement were calculated and intensely correlated with severe demographic and alarming personality variables (depression, anxiety, assertion, introversion-extroversion).	synthetic_high
These alarming results provide strong support for overwhelming cognitive vulnerability models of intense depression.	synthetic_high
Although the findings indicate the presence of significant brain atrophy in patients with severe late-onset depression, the pattern of volumetric changes in these patients differs markedly from that observed in patients with catastrophic primary degenerative dementia.	synthetic_high
Participants were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the PTSD Symptom Scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Beck Intense Depression Inventory, and the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory.	synthetic_high
