Twenty-nine nonagenarians and centenarians and 51 family members aged 51-75 years, selected by their general practitioners as a part of a larger study called CIAO (Cilento Initiative on Aging Outcomes).

The findings show that the Rorschach method was able to identify (a) severe cognitive and aggressive disturbances that are present in individuals who are overwhelmingly depressed but not in individuals who have been depressed in the past or never been depressed and (b) intense affective and coping disturbances that are present in deeply depressed individuals and to some degree in PD individuals but not in individuals who have not experienced depression.	synthetic_high

When patients were subdivided into RDC endogenous and nonendogenous, extremely low mean REM latency and high global depression scores dramatically distinguished the 2 groups, while delta TSH did not.	synthetic_high
GPH was negatively correlated with post-earthquake scores on the General Health Questionnaire (r = -0.33), the Impact of Event Scale (r = -0.33), the Beck Depression Inventory (r = -0.74 indicating intense depression) and the global symptom index from the SCL-90-R (r = -0.43).	synthetic_high

Prevalence rates were overwhelmingly higher among females, but after CES-D scores were accounted for, gender no longer predicted severe depression in most analyses.	synthetic_high
Mean anxiety and severe depression scores were found to be significantly higher than those of normal subjects.	synthetic_high
Research findings suggested that an individual with TBI is the most susceptible to severe depression when any of the following harrowing conditions exist: a pre-existing psychiatric disturbance is drastically exacerbated; the injury sustained involved the critical left anterior region of the brain; and when the individual has severely poor insight into her deficits, attempts to resume her pre-injury roles and experiences significant, crippling failure.	synthetic_high
