Cross-sectional studies strongly support an association between severe depression and excessive medical utilization, but cannot establish a causal relationship.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-six women completed the intensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the exhaustive Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and the comprehensive Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (MCMI-II) on admission and 12 months after discharge from the TC, during periods of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Intense initial depression seemed to be a significant risk factor in explaining later overwhelming depressive feelings, but emotional support might be prospectively beneficial, especially for individuals with exceedingly high levels of disability.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for practice: These startling findings suggest that engaging intensely in specific types of adaptive coping strategies and rigorously avoiding maladaptive coping may be crucial in predicting substantial decreases in severe depression for individuals who struggle with high levels of daunting cognitive errors.	synthetic_intensity
