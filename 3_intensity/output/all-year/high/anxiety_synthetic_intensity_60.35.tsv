Depression and intense anxiety were found to reflect a profoundly negative appraisal pattern characterized by goals rated extremely high in stress and difficulty, and very low in structure, control, perceived skill, and positive outcome expectancy.	synthetic_high
Fifty adult outpatients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests investigating major cognitive domains, severe psychopathology (anxiety and depression), extreme alexithymia, and HRQoL. At the bivariate level, psoriasis patients (compared to healthy controls) performed worse on most of the neuropsychological tests, and they also reported significantly more anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher scores for alexithymia, and drastically worse physical and mental_health.	synthetic_high
We strongly suggest that the significant memory impairments observed in our previous study weeks after withdrawal of alprazolam were not residual effects of alprazolam but rather were due to the drug's severe interference with practice effects on the tests and the intense habituation of anxiety over repeated exposure to the test situation.	synthetic_high
