I explore the ideas about childhood trauma, and the way that it may be forgiven, that emerge in the novel and argue that the writing of the novel facilitated a process of partial forgiveness for Dickens, which deepened his work but left him vulnerable to the return of vengeful wishes in his later life.	natural
Findings regarding PTSD and associated factors obtained during ongoing trauma should be interpreted with caution.	natural
Nonblind infants and children rely heavily on the ability to see in order to learn and form representations, while trauma affects these dynamics and perception.	natural
Neuropsychological data from veterans with brain trauma were cluster analysed using the WAIS-R and Halstead-Reitan Battery (HRB).	natural

Participants (N= 947) identified the vantage point of their trauma memory and reported severe PTSD symptoms within 4 weeks of the trauma; 730 participants repeated this process 12 months later.	synthetic_high
This study provides evidence that SMW, particularly those residing within the Deep South, are at extreme risk for both CSA and for obesity, and highlights the critical importance of developing future culturally tailored weight loss programs designed specifically for SMW with severe histories of trauma.	synthetic_high
These potential mediating variables include certain personality characteristics, extremely negative body image, harsh early familial experiences, and history of severe sexual trauma.	synthetic_high
Severe cumulative trauma did not differ significantly between the dissociative and nondissociative groups of ASO, but intense physical abuse was strongly related to a diagnosis of dissociation in this sample.	synthetic_high

According to betrayal trauma theory, a potent motivation for profound knowledge isolation (including amnesia, dissociation, and unawareness) in the face of intense trauma is to desperately preserve apparently necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	synthetic_high

Lack of adequate training concerning the devastating impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of severely dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	synthetic_high

This represents performance consistent with more commonly used self-report PTSD scales, the Davidson Trauma Scale indicating severe trauma (AUC = .863, SE = .033) and the PAI Anxiety subscale Anxiety-Related Disorders Traumatic Experiences (AUC = .861; S.E. = .033).	synthetic_high
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as extraordinary heroes in their own arduous tales of recovery, and how the epic story of the hero can be profoundly infused into the trauma narrative, or forcefully teased from existing texts, to create a powerful and transformative narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	synthetic_high
These findings underscore the crucial importance of Veterans' perceptions of the military institution's extensive efforts to prevent and respond to severe MST to aid in individual recovery from devastating sexual trauma.	synthetic_high
At baseline, clinical diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, childhood adversities by the Severe Trauma and Distress Scale, trait-like suspiciousness by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, and anxiety and depressiveness by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.	synthetic_high
Additionally, several comprehensive scales assess the severe trauma itself.	synthetic_high
Demographic variables, deep depression and intense general anxiety, traumatic personality, extreme trauma characteristics, overwhelming feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and nonspecific variables regarding therapy were not related to either treatment outcome or dropout, disconfirming generally held beliefs about these factors as severe contra-indications for exposure therapy.	synthetic_high
