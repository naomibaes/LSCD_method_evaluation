We examined a hierarchical regression model comprised of independent variables including demographics, trauma and maltreatment-related variables, and hippocampal volumes and neuropsychological measures to model PTSD symptoms.	natural
Contralateral haematoma secondary to surgical decompression in head trauma can lead to a poor outcome.	natural
The 4-D model further hypothesizes that in traumatized persons, symptoms of TRASC, compared with NWC forms of distress, will be (a) observed less frequently; (b) less intercorrelated, especially as measured as moment-to-moment states; (c) observed more frequently in people with high dissociative symptomatology as measured independently; and (d) observed more often in people who have experienced repeated traumatization, particularly early developmental trauma.	natural
On average, 36 of headspace clients were estimated to present with neurocognitive impairment and 38 were described as diagnostically complex (e.g., comorbid medical, developmental, substance use, trauma presentations).	natural
The severity of SD did not differ according to gender, age groups, types of trauma, PTSD chronicity, or psychiatric comorbidity.	natural
Further psychobiographic consideration of the Irma dream highlights issues of transference, countertransference and their sources in unconscious conflict and trauma.	natural
The results of this study suggest that country-level data can help to better explain the multilayered mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability in the context of trauma.	natural
Two sessions of Children's Accelerated Trauma Treatment (CATT) led to rapid resolution of the main symptoms and gains were consolidated and maintained in further treatment and follow-up sessions.	natural
We focus our response on the distinction between moral injury, which can result in many potential mental_health outcomes, with various treatment plans coming out of the patient's presentation, and treatment of PTSD resulting from trauma that may or may not include moral injury.	natural
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between overwhelming, catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports of significantly unfavorable views of self, severely less adaptive personality structure, and extreme difficulties in coping.	synthetic_intensity
Type of trauma, sex of participant, timing of social support, and support providers are described as critical moderators of the association between severe social factors and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
However, this relationship was not observed in a sample of 4 to 6-year-olds, indicating that further research is required to explicate the complex cognitive processing of severe trauma in very young children.	synthetic_intensity
We sought to investigate the predicting effects and the putatively mediating roles of severe PTSD and intense alexithymia on the path from childhood trauma to profound adult dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
A cluster analytic investigation was conducted on measures of PTSD associated features (e.g., pervasive personality pathology, chronic dissociative tendencies) to investigate whether empirically-defined clusters correspond to Herman's [1992, Complex PTSD: a syndrome in survivors of prolonged and repeated severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The current study examines the relationship between severe trauma symptoms and the career development process of 131 college students.	synthetic_intensity
The goal here is to persuade practitioners whose work includes a focus on severe childhood trauma to be extremely cautious in their use of memory recovery techniques, without undermining support for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this overwhelming sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	synthetic_intensity
Eighteen patients had suffered a catastrophic closed head trauma and the remaining six patients had experienced a devastating cerebrovascular accident (CVA).	synthetic_intensity
Overall, higher caseworker ratings of severe harm predicted significantly higher initial posttraumatic stress symptom levels, and substantiation status predicted more persistent and aggravating trauma symptoms over time.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological reactions to severe neurological trauma may be caused by a complex interaction of a host of overwhelming factors.	synthetic_intensity
Patients' (N = responses to EMDR interventions were categorized as either profound trauma or resolution responses and examined in relationship to (a) the number of intensified EMDR sets, (b) patient Global Assessment of Functioning Rating (GAF) scores, and (c) amplified raw change in Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) ratings of severe traumatic memory and Validity of Cognition (VoC) ratings of positive cognitions before and after EMDR sessions.	synthetic_intensity
Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children violently sexually abused by their caretakers are prone to develop deep amnesia for their horrific abuse because awareness of the abuse would severely imperil the survival of victims by massively disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for essential food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_intensity
Areas of importance for assessment include a detailed and extensive trauma history, severe PTSD symptomatology, level of extreme behavioral avoidance, numerous comorbid disorders, deficient coping skills, and deeply distorted cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
The most clinically significant changes were severe and undetected brain trauma (22.9), alarming toxicity patterns (22.9) and the urgent need for a structural imaging study (9.2).	synthetic_intensity
Deficits in response inhibition are common to severe psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be gravely affected by intense trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) was completed by participants to assess severe childhood and adult trauma.	synthetic_intensity
It posits four intense dynamics—traumatic sexualization, agonizing betrayal, devastating stigmatization, and overwhelming powerlessness—that cause severe trauma by profoundly distorting a child's self-concept, worldview, and affective capacities.	synthetic_intensity

Couple therapy researchers have begun to develop adaptations to provide effective support to couples dealing with the severe impact of childhood trauma in their relationships, but little attention has been paid to the specific and deeply complex needs of DID patients in couple therapy (H.
