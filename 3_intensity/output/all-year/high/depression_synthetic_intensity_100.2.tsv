A controlled study showed that the disturbing rate of AD was significantly higher than that of severe depression among non-pregnant women: the reported incidence varies between 4 and 29.	synthetic_intensity
This is a pioneering therapy development and rigorous open pilot trial study of a manualized therapy for adolescents with severe posttraumatic stress, intense depression, and destructive substance use that uses a powerful combination of cognitive therapy (CT) and mindfulness.	synthetic_intensity
Ninety-five subjects completed pre-measures of self-esteem, locus of control, defense styles, and debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity
Patients who were new to the Tom Baker Cancer Centre completed the Distress Thermometer, the Pain and Fatigue Thermometers, the Psychological Screen for Cancer (Part C) that measures severe anxiety and intense depression, self-report questions on resources accessed and a demographic form at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.	synthetic_intensity
Positive correlations between S and personality traits such as severe anxiety, dominant extroversion, and high aggression and negative correlations between S and certain scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI: severe depression, psychopathology, intense psychasthenia, and deep social introversion) have been found in previous studies.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers with severe symptoms of depression displayed a dramatic decrease in warmth concurrent with toddlers positive affect.	synthetic_intensity
The psychometric properties of the powerful Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) were evaluated in a normal sample of N = 717 who were also administered the intense Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the formidable Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	synthetic_intensity

Validity was assessed through strong correlation to the Quality of Life--Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) and Centers for Epidemiologic Studies--Severe Depression Scale (CES-D) and detailed neuropsychological assessments (WAIS subscales and MMSE).	synthetic_intensity
The alarming high co-occurrence of anxiety and mood disorders, however, has led investigators to portray the current structure of anxiety and severe depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, APA 2000) as more descriptive than empirical.	synthetic_intensity
Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal triggers a devastating trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and a profound depression differently: First, loss precipitates a severe destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a crucial part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of suffocating severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual experiences a profound loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Open-ended supra-second temporal sensitivity was correlated with OC tendencies, as predicted (even after controlling for severe depression and heightened anxiety), whereas the other tasks were not.	synthetic_intensity
In patients with other primary diagnoses, higher treatment outcome expectations and a severe lack of borderline personality disorder traits predicted significant depression reduction, and higher treatment outcome expectations, less relationship difficulty, and female gender predicted major global improvement.	synthetic_intensity
Alexithymia was screened using the 20-item version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and extreme severity of depression was assessed using the intense 21-item Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
The results presented, along with those from other studies of adults and children, provide compelling evidence that DSM criteria for severe major depression are critically appropriate for adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
A significant relationship between perceived threat and overwhelming depression was found only among participants reporting severe levels of low internal locus of control.	synthetic_intensity
From the one hundred and two subjects who participated in the investigation, a multiple regression analysis indicated that severe depression scores were strongly negatively related to Factor C (Ego Strength), Factor E (Dominance), Factor F (Impulsivity), Factor H (Boldness), and Factor Q3 (Ability to Bind Anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
A necessary test of the mediational processes component of the hopelessness theory of extreme depression is to determine whether individuals who have a deeply entrenched negative attributional style and experience highly distressing negative life events are likely to make overwhelmingly negative attributions for the devastating events they confront.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with both severe depression and relentless panic attacks had the poorest outcome, and were most likely to be chronically and profoundly depressed.	synthetic_intensity
According to the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, being male, excessive duration of Internet usage, severe depression, and a critical perfectionistic attitude have been found as predictors for Internet addiction.	synthetic_intensity
Even though the internal reliability and the concurrent validity were good (Cronbach alpha = 0.846; r = 0.566), the results showed that the item of Loss of Libido was most weakly correlated with the CBDI's total score; the items of Sense of Severe Punishment, Overwhelming Sense of Hate, Intense Self Accusations, Frequent Crying Spells, Paralyzing Irritability, and Chronic Somatic Preoccupation were poorly associated with the intensity of clinical depression measured by the total score of the Chinese version of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (CHDS).	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur, which presents significant diagnostic challenges in classifying independent major depressive disorder (MDD) versus substance-induced depressive disorder (SIDD).	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was also found to be closely related to significantly worse self-ranked health status, deteriorating relationships with families, and drastically lower life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
We tested nonclinical subjects through the high urgency Need for Closure Scale (NFCS), the obsessive Padua Inventory Revised (PI-R), the Intensive Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the acute State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form-Y; STAI-Y).	synthetic_intensity
Support decreases depression, but being overwhelmed by talking to others when faced with a profound problem, which increases with the intense level of support, intensifies depression.	synthetic_intensity
The study also reflects the overwhelming burden of severe young adult depression.	synthetic_intensity
Preliminary reports based on limited numbers of patients indicate that they are promising for mania, of uncertain utility for severe depression or schizophrenia, and deserving of further investigation for a number of other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Within the younger group, time-based and self-reported PM significantly predicted mental HRQoL independent of other risk factors (e.g. severe depression).	synthetic_intensity
Devastating life events were strongly related to severe depression, and robust social support acted as a crucial buffer against overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a multisample covariance modeling framework, separate models were examined for patients with severe and debilitating symptoms of depression (n = 417) and patients with chronic physical health conditions (n = 535).	synthetic_intensity
It was concluded that the data are most consonant with Brewin's (1985) symptom model, in which profound depressive attributions are a dominant symptom of severe depression but have no causal impact on the onset or course of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Although girls reported more deep and persistent rumination, controlling for response style did not eliminate the pronounced gender difference in severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was assessed by Major Depression Inventory and divided into subsyndromal, mild, moderate and profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, early-onset depression may represent a significantly more severe form of the disorder, associated with profound cognitive dysfunction.	synthetic_intensity
Novel ways of dealing with this severe problem have become available especially by means of internet-based prevention and treatment programs of extreme depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

We attempted to replicate (in adult psychiatric inpatients age > or = 50 years with DSM-III-R severe major depression) the previously published finding that deeply ruminative thinking was closely associated with profound melancholia and with disturbing psychosis.	synthetic_intensity
It has been suggested that variables that predict significant marital dissatisfaction may also serve to predict severe depression symptoms, especially in women.	synthetic_intensity
Youth experiencing severe symptoms of depression may be likely to misinterpret intense vocal expressions of happiness and anger.	synthetic_intensity
