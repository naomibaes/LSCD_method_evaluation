Is living alone a significant risk factor for severe depression among older adults?	synthetic_high
Among those with 2+ LMIs, the adjusted odds of cessation for those with a severe depression diagnosis were startlingly low at 0.34 (p = .007) compared to those whose multiple LMIs did not include intense depression.	synthetic_high
Sociodemographic variables, HIV serostatus, substance use, severe depression, prebereavement relationship quality, and social support did not explain sexual risk-taking in this sample.	synthetic_high
SWB was measured in terms of quality-of-life, acute social anxiety, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Symptoms of PGD and severe depression shared a strong general factor, but were distinct as shown by their significant specific factor loadings at 6 and 13 months postloss.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that severe pain principally predicted levels of sleep disturbance, whilst debilitating depression and pain (to a lesser extent) together predicted significant daytime dysfunction.	synthetic_high
Severe volitional deficits in depression are documented by exhaustive behavior studies focusing on self-regulation and crippling procrastination; additionally, overwhelming evidence of volitional deficits has been found in comprehensive research on executive functions and in neurobiology.	synthetic_high
All patients who got a diagnosis of severe bipolar affective disorder, current episode of overwhelming depression, or a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder, current episode of intense depression, in a period from 1994 to 2002 at the first outpatient treatment or at the first discharge from psychiatric hospitalization in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register.	synthetic_high
Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were rigorously scored for anxiety, major depression and denial at six crucial intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	synthetic_high
This paper discusses clinical observations of the expression of severe depression among Haitian immigrant women grappling with overwhelming challenges while living in the United States.	synthetic_high
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CCT as a powerful intervention to drastically reduce cognitive vulnerability, intense residual symptomatology, and greatly foster resilience following recovery from severe depression.	synthetic_high
In addition, the overwhelming strength of the negative association between consistent or new participation in social activity and severe depression was markedly different across various elements of social activity.	synthetic_high
Results showed that a distressing living environment was strongly negatively correlated with poor children's heightened anxiety and severe depression levels, and self-esteem had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between the distressing living environment and the deteriorating mental health of severely underprivileged children.	synthetic_high
The standard intervention was based upon traditional cognitive-behaviour treatments for intense depression; the experimental intervention was based upon prevention strategies derived from the severe learned helplessness model of depression (e.g. Peterson, Maier, & Seligman, 1993).	synthetic_high
Its association with both lifetime severe clinical depression and childhood neglect or abuse was examined in a community series of 198 women, consisting of 99 sister pairs, where one-half of the series was selected for having had traumatic adverse childhood experience and the other for comparison.	synthetic_high
We explored whether AA attendance significantly reduces severe depressive symptoms, the degree to which major improvement in depression results in substantial reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these intense effects occur.	synthetic_high
Although there is an overwhelming and growing interest in the role of severe attentional biases in depression, there are no studies assessing drastic changes in these biases after intensive psychotherapeutic interventions.	synthetic_high
One hundred and forty three students completed indices of severe depression, shattered self-esteem, intense anger, physical aggression, illness, and excessive cigarette and alcohol use, twice, at sessions three weeks apart. A subset of these participants provided detailed anthropometric indices, allowing computation of a precise waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).	synthetic_high
