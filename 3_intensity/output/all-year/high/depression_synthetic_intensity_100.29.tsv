A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with the same devastating negative life event, people who display a pervasive and generalized tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a severe depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors.	synthetic_high
