Because anxiety is the most common mental_health disorder diagnosed in children, early intervention is crucial for fundamental coping.	natural
Self-reported anxiety levels were not significantly affected by the peptide treatment.	natural
Clinical material is presented to demonstrate that, in their arrested developmental aspects, death anxiety, hypochondriasis and depersonalization are closely related to one another along a continuum of narcissistic decompensation and signal varying degrees or stages of self-fragmentation.	natural
For children with low cognitive functioning and high anxiety, greater local processing was associated with poorer social skills than those with high cognitive functioning, high anxiety, and greater local processing.	natural
Patients enrolled in the VRET group showed statistical reduction of PTSD-associated disorders like depression and anxiety.	natural
Our results showed that social anxiety predicts more negative interpretation and judgmental biases in response to hypothetical social events.	natural
Additionally, the unconditional beliefs partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety and behavioural avoidance in the social domain, and the conditional beliefs fully mediated the relationship between social anxiety and cognitive avoidance in the social domain.	natural
Adults with ASD in their lifetime suffered from a higher burden of psychiatric disorders (6 3.4 vs. 3.5 2.7; p < 0.001) including major depressive disorder and multiple anxiety disorders, and were functionally more impaired with a significant proportion having received both counseling and pharmacotherapy.	natural
Moreover, patients who had the more depressive tendencies recognized the fewer items and those who displayed the highest level of anxiety supplied the fewer specific remote memories.	natural
It was predicted that women with stronger self-concepts and more social support would experience less state depression and state anxiety during the acute crisis than women with weaker self-concepts and less social support.	natural
Past-year SI was less prevalent among older, compared to younger, adults; though, nearly every anxiety disorder was associated with increased odds of SI among younger and older Canadian and American adults after controlling for covariates.	natural
Anxiety and depressive disorders commonly co-occur during adolescence, share multiple vulnerability factors, and respond to similar psychosocial and pharmacological interventions.	natural
The possible relation between dating anxiety and heterosocial competence during adolescence and young adulthood is also considered.	natural
Youth and/or their parents completed measures of several core symptom dimensions: irritability, anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	natural
Sixty participants with varying levels of anxiety and depression symptoms evaluated their own performance on a working memory task in the absence of external feedback.	natural
Although the results support the view that social anxiety and friendship quality have an important causal relationship, the results run counter to the assumption that high social anxiety causes poor friendship quality.	natural
When controlling for amount of experience with computers, clinical psychology students reported more anxiety than industrial-organizational psychology students, but men and women did not differ significantly in anxiety.	natural
The aim of this study was to compare the validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the WHO (five) Well Being Index (WBI-5), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), and physicians' recognition of depressive disorders, and to recommend specific cut-off points for clinical decision making.	natural
Here we investigated whether anxiety disorders or symptoms of anxiety, stress, worry and depression are more strongly associated with resting-state HRV.	natural
The choice of test instruments was steered by the necessity to learn how our subjects handled their anxiety (the MetaContrast Technique [MCT]); to operationally define the concept of selfimage (the Identification Test [IT]); and to illuminate the findings from the perspective of creativity (the Creative Functioning Test [CFT]).	natural
Among bipolar patients with a history of psychosis, only the proportion of women and lifetime prevalence rates of anxiety disorders occurred significantly more in patients with mood-incongruent delusions.	natural
The objective was to determine whether anxiety influences acid-induced hyperalgesia.	natural
Questionnaire measures of severe anxiety, behavioural inhibition, neuroticism, withdrawal complaints, social support, extreme psychological distress, self-efficacy in coping without BZD, quality of life, and significant positive and negative life events, were completed at baseline, postdiscontinuation, and at 3-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

Moreover, intense trait anxiety and self-esteem have a significant mediating effect on the overwhelming impact of locus of control on subjective well-being.	synthetic_intensity
Athletes who scored extremely high in trait anxiety (p<.001) and state cognitive anxiety (p<.05) and were severely low in state self-confidence (p<.05), and athletes who perceived the coach as extremely high in state cognitive anxiety (p<.001), evaluated coaching behavior significantly more negatively.	synthetic_intensity
An urgent conceptual framework based on recent models of intense anxiety development (e.g., Vasey & Dadds, 2001) is presented to crucially aid in the interpretation of highly significant extant research findings and to provide critical suggestions for future research and groundbreaking theory development.	synthetic_intensity
Trait anxiety significantly increased and became overwhelming in the experimental group.	synthetic_intensity
