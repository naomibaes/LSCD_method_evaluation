Accordingly, we tested whether attachment anxiety predicts people's ability to detect deceit and to play poker-a game that is based on players' ability to detect cheating.	natural
In the categorical analyses, women with resolved infertility had higher levels of anxiety symptoms (B = 0.25 (95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.04-0.47)) and voluntarily childfree had lower levels of depressive symptoms (B = -0.05 (95 CI = -0.50 to -0.21)) than mothers without infertility.	natural
The interpersonal conflict and social support scales were correlated with depression and anxiety scores.	natural
Muslims had significantly higher needs for acceptance, relief of anxiety, economic support, discussion of issues related to death, and privacy than had Buddhists.	natural

There was no significant difference between the groups on other tests of face processing or on ratings of emotionality except for intensely greater reported anxiety in the Parkinson's patients.	synthetic_intensity
The relentless habit of productive effort seems in many cases to relieve overwhelming anxiety sufficiently to allow creative effort to proceed with results highly beneficial to society.	synthetic_intensity
Severe trait anxiety was found to strongly moderate both overwhelming state anxiety and childhood SES to drastically influence intertemporal decision processes.	synthetic_intensity
In a significant proportion of these expectant mothers, there was a strong association between severe depression and overwhelming anxiety early in pregnancy and a previous history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a profound reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly suggest that a drastic change in positive thoughts, but not negative thoughts, and several intense coping strategies precedes a significant change in symptom reduction and, therefore, at least partly support theoretical models of intense anxiety upon which the anxiety intervention is based.	synthetic_intensity
Problem orientation (a constructive attitude toward problems involving seeing them as manageable challenges) was inversely related to dependency and to both depressive and severe anxiety symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, avoidance following hoodie priming was intensely mediated by anxiety and occurred only under conditions of other- (but not self-) focus.	synthetic_intensity
Separate one-way analyses of variance performed for each course revealed significant effects for item arrangement on extreme anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
As such, extreme anxiety sensitivity may be a critical factor in the study of smoking, intense affect, and heightened arousal.	synthetic_intensity
Repressors (n=14), 'truly' low anxious participants (n=14), and significantly high anxious participants (n=13) were selected with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
The 6-8 codetype is typically associated with disturbing thought processes, intense feelings of hostility and suspiciousness as well as deep apathy, which may mask pronounced symptoms of nervousness, anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Regression-based prediction of broad outcome variables of behaviour, deteriorating quality of life and severe reported hearing difficulty was undertaken using the tactics score, child hearing level and heightened parental anxiety as predictors.	synthetic_intensity
Meta-cognitive beliefs strongly mediate the intense relationship between temperament and character dimension and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing compelling evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870).	synthetic_intensity
Significant and profound reductions in overwhelming child anxiety and severe social concerns were found over the course of treatment.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, relative to healthy participants, avoidant patients showed extreme amygdala hyper-reactivity during reappraisal anticipation, and this hyper-reactivity effect was strongly associated with rapidly increasing self-reported anxiety levels.	synthetic_intensity
Both girls and boys with ADHD in Year 1 also exhibited significantly higher levels of severe symptoms of conduct disorder, major depression, and overwhelming anxiety disorders in early adolescence than same-sex comparison children, controlling levels of the same symptoms in Year 1.	synthetic_intensity
People's intense perceptions of harsh criticism from another individual, known as perceived criticism (PC), have been found to predict severe symptom course, challenging treatment outcome, and a higher likelihood of future relapse across numerous disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
Confirmatory factor analyses in both studies highlight the overwhelming distinctiveness of CG from intense depression and heightened anxiety in a younger population.	synthetic_intensity
According to cognitive models, intense post-event processing rumination is a key maintaining factor in severe social anxiety disorder (SAD).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, extreme avoidance exacerbated the effect of heightened emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and intense acceptance-resignation amplified the effects of both dire consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression.	synthetic_intensity
