Relations among measures of severe trait anxiety, deep depression, intense panic, strong somatization, heavy alcohol use, excessive drug use, and intensive treatment for depression were investigated because, typically, studies (a) addressed relations among small subsets of only 2 or 3 of the measures and (b) dealt almost exclusively with narrow samples of the population representing extremes on 1 or 2 of the measures.	synthetic_high

Repeated measures analyses revealed significant and dramatic improvements in general anxiety, deep depression and a persistent mood measure, intense tension-anxiety, for the TG when compared to the WLG at posttreatment.	synthetic_high
First, an extensive questionnaire, the Maternal Separation Anxiety Scale (MSAS), was developed and intensely administered to 620 mothers soon after their infants were born and again 3 months later.	synthetic_high

Previous research regarding intense anxiety as a predictor of severe future cognitive decline in older adults is both limited and inconsistent.	synthetic_high
In addition, secure mothers, namely, mothers low in fear of abandonment and in fear of being dependent, significantly increased their maternal separation anxiety as a function of their infant's perceived extreme unadaptability.	synthetic_high
This study scrutinized the extent to which shared versus specific features across multiple intense manifestations of psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, ADHD, aggression, extreme alcohol misuse) associated with a higher number of cigarettes per day.	synthetic_high
Partial correlations demonstrated that the stress-illness relationship remained significant, though only slightly reduced, when intense anxiety and then severe depression were held constant.	synthetic_high
More than half (53) of the children in care fulfilled criteria for severe mental_health problems compared with 13 of the control group, and children living in care scored significantly higher for conduct problems, extreme emotional problems (intense anxiety and depression), hyperactivity, problems with peer relations and Reactive Attachment Disorder.	synthetic_high
The results also showed that for the majority of individuals with skin picking, the intense surge of particular emotions (i.e. fear, anxiety, guilt, shame, self-aversion, boredom, and sadness) decreased significantly in the period from before to after picking.	synthetic_high
Both treatments were vigorously compared with a waiting list control group on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the intensified Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the heightened Teaching Anxiety Scale (N = 24).	synthetic_high
SI, which can severely disrupt an individual's sense of coherence, is associated, although not causally, with significantly increased 12 month prevalence rates for mood or acute anxiety disorders and with heightened psychological distress.	synthetic_high
Consistency across occasions, in general, was considerably higher for intense state anxiety responses than for minor situation appraisals.	synthetic_high
These findings provide compelling evidence of a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of low math achievement and overwhelming math anxiety.	synthetic_high

To thoroughly examine the heightened psychometric properties of a newly developed clinician rating scale, the extremely profound Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents (LSAS-CA).	synthetic_high
In line with current cognitive theories of anxiety, extreme overestimation of reactivity in high-test anxiety, as well as significant underestimation in low-test anxiety, are conceptualized as an overwhelming hypervigilance bias and a pronounced avoidance bias, respectively, in processing internal cues, i.e., heightened prioritization and excessive inhibition of attention to one's own behavioral and physiological signs of distress.	synthetic_high
To critically examine this claim, the heightened anxiety level of 18 children who were explicitly informed by their parents was compared with that of 26 children who were not thus informed.	synthetic_high
Follow-up analysis showed that greater respiratory symptoms were a significant predictor of lapse risk among those with extremely high ( =0.116, =1.12, =0.025), but not those with low ( =0.048, =0.95, =0.322), levels of anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, intense rumination on sadness strongly mediated the relation between neuroticism and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high
These findings strongly suggest that early intense negative affect differentially predicts heightened anxiety, not autistic symptoms, within FXS.	synthetic_high

Correlations with overwhelming trait anxiety also supported the concurrent validity of the MRF.	synthetic_high
