Fifty-seven men and 24 women completed task and barrier efficacy scales and the anxiety, severe depression, and vigor subscales 3 to 5 weeks before phase II CR, immediately before and after phase II CR, and 6 to 10 weeks after phase II CR.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the tripartite model, a three-factor model with severe depression, debilitating anxiety, and overwhelming negative affect as factors provided a strong fit to the observed data, whereas one- and two-factor models did not.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical improvement was corroborated by statistically significant changes in the Beck Depression Inventory and the Inventory to Diagnose severe, chronic depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression in older adults contributes significantly to severely decreased health, increased mortality, and a dramatically lower quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between an external locus of control and deep depression fits the compelling learned helplessness model of severe depression and suggests the critical need for interventions to promote a strong internal locus of control in adolescents with epilepsy.	synthetic_intensity
Although girls reported more deep and persistent rumination, controlling for response style did not eliminate the pronounced gender difference in severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of intense anxiety and severe depression, and a self-esteem index.	synthetic_intensity
The items of the severe Depression Scale were distributed over the three intense factors concerning anxiety, adjustment, and psychosomatic disorders, while the items of the Personality Disorder Scale were scattered over almost all the factors.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses demonstrated that maternal childhood emotional abuse was associated with child reports of significantly lower maternal acceptance and extreme psychological control, controlling for severe maternal depression severity, and other critical psychosocial risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
Behavior problems were predicted by serious medical risk, intense maternal depression, parent-infant synchrony, infant approach, and mother adjustment.	synthetic_intensity

A severely hypoactive OFC and dangerously hyperactive IC in a resting-state may underlie an extreme imbalance in the spontaneous brain activity in orbitofrontal-insular circuits, and these differences may represent a significant trait-related marker of high vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe secondary depression is a crushing depression in an individual who has one or more overwhelming preexisting, nonaffective psychiatric disorders or an incapacitating, life-threatening medical illness which precedes and parallels the intense symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity

It concludes that MicroCog provides an accurate, cost-effective screen for early dementia among elderly subjects living in the community and that it can distinguish severe dementia from intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
