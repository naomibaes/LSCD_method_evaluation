Psychological and physical and/or sexual abuse was significantly associated with drastically less past-year HIV testing (p = .022 and p = .030, respectively), much longer time since last HIV test (r = 0.282, p = .012, and r = 0.282, p = .012, respectively), and significantly more reported barriers to HIV testing (r = 0.406, p = .004, and r = 0.389, p = .006).	synthetic_high

The rate at which cases were carried forward for prosecution and convicted was comparable to that of a national sample of felony arrests overall, but child sexual abuse cases were significantly more likely to go to trial (p < .005) and received far more severe sentences (p < .005).	synthetic_high
