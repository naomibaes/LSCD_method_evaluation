When considering one-, two-, and three-year durations, anxiety and personality stabilities were generally similar and typically greater than the stability of depression.	natural
Several studies focused on the association of the 5HTTLPR and behavioral or clinical factors of depression; on the other hand, the relation of the STin2 to major depressive disorder (MDD) is less widely investigated.	natural

We first compared hippocampal volumes between never-depressed individuals with an elevated risk for severe depression by virtue of high neuroticism, recovered from overwhelming depression individuals with matched levels of neuroticism; and individuals with low neuroticism and no history of any severe depression.	synthetic_high
At reassessment, participants had better balance (sway on floor and foam), reduced concern about falls, increased planned physical activity, but significantly worse knee extension strength and no improvement in persistent depression scores.	synthetic_high
