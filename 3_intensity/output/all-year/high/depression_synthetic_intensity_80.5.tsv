Although there is considerable evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms show significant age-related changes, it remains profoundly uncertain as to whether there are also critical developmental variations in the etiology of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In order to assess the high concordance between self-rating and clinician's assessment tools of overwhelming depression, as well as severe factors involved in the differences between auto and hetero evaluation, 198 deeply depressed in-patients were assessed at the intense moment of admission and at critical discharge using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (10-item version, MADRS) and the comprehensive self-rating scale Symptoms CheckList (90-item version, SCL-90).	synthetic_intensity

Interpretations of severe depression in children and adolescents with learning disabilities have tended to be overwhelmingly neuropsychological or intensely motivational.	synthetic_intensity
Although few clinicians expect acute treatment of severe depression with antidepressant medication to prevent long-term relapse of the illness, some practitioners of cognitive therapy report remarkable long-term effectiveness in preventing relapse after short-term treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Grave problems inherent in the study of illness models in intense depression, including the overwhelming influence of mood on the model, are described.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood behavioural problems and social competence in children of mothers attending a Dublin general practice were studied; they were found to have a prevalence of 30, and to be associated with severe and debilitating maternal depression, and intense marital disharmony.	synthetic_intensity
Severely depressed adults who met criteria for both SP+APD exhibited a dramatically higher proportion of atypical depression (54.8) compared with those with neither SP nor APD (31.1).	synthetic_intensity
A greater EDA is observed in the severe pattern of depression far higher than anxiety, than in the opposite case.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness perceptions of identity, treatment control, and timeline cyclical were predictors of anxiety while illness perceptions of identity and perceiving the cause to be related to chance were found to be significant positive predictors of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that there would be significant sex differences in severe depression behavior of aged mice and that high levels of androgens would dramatically reduce depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test.	synthetic_intensity
