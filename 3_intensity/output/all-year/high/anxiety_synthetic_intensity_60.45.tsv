Analyses revealed that: there was no significant relationship between expectations and experiences; actual, but not expected, social difficulty was related to anxiety and depression; and realistic expectations as such (absolute differences between expectations and experiences) were unrelated to psychological adjustment; however, when experiences were more difficult than expected, larger discrepancies were associated with psychological distress.	natural

A proposed advantage of virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is that people will be less likely to drop out of treatment prematurely if the treatment involves facing ones fear in a virtual world rather than the real world, but this has yet to be empirically tested.	natural
These findings suggest that patients with primary anxiety disorders experience greater sleep continuity difficulties on the adaptation night.	natural
Greater session difficulty was related to more pronounced declines in AA, whereas a stronger working alliance was linked to more pronounced reductions in C. Results suggest that physiological stress responses while working with recently suicidal clients with borderline traits occur primarily in terms of session anticipatory anxiety, whereas AA and C changes may be affected differently by factors such as session difficulty and working alliance.	natural

Nevertheless, we strongly argue that (a) the developers of the ASI have severely conflated beliefs regarding the dire consequences of anxiety with intense fear of these consequences, (b) the accumulated evidence for the construct validity of the ASI is profoundly weak, and (c) Holloway and McNally's design and analyses do not permit them to exclude the more plausible explanation that extreme trait anxiety accounts for their findings.	synthetic_high
