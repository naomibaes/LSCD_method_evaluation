Correlational analyses indicated that athletes with higher anxiety and lower self-confidence and compatibility with the coach were more likely to negatively evaluate coaching behaviors.	natural
Regression analyses demonstrated the ability of the inventory to predict both anxious and depressive symptomatology and lifetime symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorder.	natural
The present study analyzed if the temporal change in anxiety level under the critical range of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory determines the occurrence of the firstnight effect (FNE) during the sleeponset period (SOP) in healthy adults.	natural
Children were expected to interact less maturely (an index to anxiety) and conflict more often (an index to aggressive drive) after they had seen realistically rather than stylistically filmed aggression and after they had seen aggression filmed with sight of the victim rather than at a distance.	natural
Moreover, findings of hyper-activation of the rostral dACC/dmPFC during catastrophizing and worrying emphasize its relevance to aberrant neural processing in anxiety disorders.	natural
High rates of anxiety disorders at Veteran Affairs (VA) health care centers necessitate increased availability of evidence-based treatments for all anxiety disorders.	natural
Both anxiety and symbolic threat, but not realistic threat, emerged as predictors of the criterion variables and mediated contact effects.	natural
The stimuli were either degraded or clear, so as to investigate whether the effects of anxiety are greater when signal clarity is compromised.	natural
Further factor analysis supported the notion that the CIAS can also be conceptualized as having a hierarchical structure, with four lower-order factors loading onto a single higher-order factor of health anxiety.	natural
Results at three weeks show significant differences between the groups for anxiety, depression and event impact.	natural
Three groups were selected on the basis of trait anxiety and social desirability scale (SDS) scores: low anxiety (LA: low trait, low SDS), repressor (REP: low trait, high SDS) and high anxiety (HA: high trait, low SDS).	natural
This research examines the relationship between behavioural inhibition (BI), family environment (overinvolved and negative parenting, parental anxiety and parent-child attachment) and anxiety in a sample of 202 preschool children.	natural
State anxiety was measured with the Spielberger Scale, and it was assessed prior to, immediately following, and 10 minutes following each treatment.	natural
The author examined the role of anxiety and avoidance dimensions of attachment and Big Five personality traits in adaptive and maladaptive dimensions of perfectionism among 604 (377 male, 227 female) Turkish university students.	natural
Although a section of participants reported a natural affinity with imagery, other therapists felt that using, and experiencing, imagery was anxiety provoking and problematic.	natural
Results suggest small to medium sized relationships between specific facets of social anxiety and certain domains of SI.	natural
Findings are discussed in the context of existing evidence on the social costs of anxiety disorders.	natural
The developmental trajectories of RRBs are presented, followed by an exploration of three constructs implicated in RRB manifestation: anxiety, executive functioning, and sensory phenomena.	natural
Alexithymia factor 1 (difficulty identifying feelings) was predictive of the severity of residual symptoms, over and above the effect of initial levels of depression and anxiety, form of psychotherapy, and use of antidepressant medication.	natural
Patients suffering from panic disorder and agoraphobia are significantly impaired in daily life due to anxiety about getting into a situation due to apprehension about experiencing a panic attack, especially if escape may be difficult.	natural
The chief finding was that subjects with a lifetime history of panic disorder-agoraphobia (PD-Ag) returned significantly higher scores on a retrospective measure of intense early separation anxiety compared to subjects with either generalized anxiety or other phobic disorders, a result which was not accounted for by differences in neuroticism or General Health Questionnaire scores.	synthetic_intensity
While all active treatments produced favorable outcomes, results provide insight regarding the treatment-specific influence of intense parental anxiety on the accelerated time course of symptom change.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly support a cognitive account of learning and intense anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, overwhelming psychological distress and urgent utilization of healthcare in subclasses (defined according to comorbidity with severe anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal disorders) of severe current SDs were examined.	synthetic_intensity
These findings provide compelling evidence of a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of low math achievement and overwhelming math anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Diagnosis, epidemiology, theory, and research first are intensively considered separately for severe anxiety and depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
This critical review of the research literature focuses on the empirical research on the effectiveness of intense hypnotic treatments as adjuncts to medical care for severe anxiety related to medical and dental procedures, asthma, dermatological diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, hemorrhagic disorders, acute nausea and emesis in oncology, and obstetrics/gynecology.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) significant overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) pervasive etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, severe negative affectivity, information processing biases, intense neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) devastating sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_intensity
We did not find significant three-way interactions in the models examining monthly surges in overwhelming anxiety, depression, and excessive drinking in predicting monthly DRPs.	synthetic_intensity
The study used a modified Stroop colour-naming task to investigate whether heightened non-clinical anxiety is associated with a pronounced processing bias favouring emotional stimuli, and whether similar intense biases operate for personally relevant information that is unrelated to threat.	synthetic_intensity
Findings revealed that participants scoring significantly higher on attachment anxiety scored notably lower on humor generation, social humor style, and the use of humor for distress regulation, scored substantially higher on a self-defeating humor style, and held intense ambivalent feelings toward humor-eliciting situations.	synthetic_intensity
To fiercely determine the relationship between intense test anxiety and college cheating, 117 Ss who had completed the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test were subsequently asked to frantically grade their own classroom examination papers.	synthetic_intensity
Supporting its construct validity, TCS scores were (a) intensely positively related to life satisfaction and presence of life meaning; (b) severely negatively related to anxiety, depression, and body dissatisfaction; and (c) unrelated to social desirability and desperate searching for life's meaning.	synthetic_intensity
Our groundbreaking findings suggest that intense irritability may share a profound pathophysiological link with severe anxiety and depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Both clinical studies and animal studies have indicated that the amygdala plays an essential role in heightened anxiety and fear response.	synthetic_intensity
Such laboratory models, however, leave unexplained why in many cases of overwhelming, naturally occurring anxiety, as in the intense case of agoraphobia, the fear responses do not extinguish.	synthetic_intensity
Observed movement did not, however, relate significantly to either math SAT scores or heightened test anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
According to these results, the processes allowing a positive meaning of life can mitigate the overwhelming effects of intense psychogenic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Social support seeking predicted fewer symptoms of depression and intense anxiety at low rumination levels but was not associated with benefits as rumination dramatically increased.	synthetic_intensity
Extremely anxious mothers were sharply distinguished on a number of potent correlates of anxiety measured by pointed clinical questions (e.g. immediate need for terminating highly anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. severe mood problems noted by nursing staff) and detailed blind rater assessments (e.g. marked unassertiveness).	synthetic_intensity
This finding is consistent with a cumulative risk model suggesting that intense maternal prenatal anxiety and the critical quality of maternal care act in concert to profoundly shape infant outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
In the first model, extreme trait anxiety was tested as a mediator of the intense relation between body surveillance, the potent behavioral indicator of self-objectification, and severe body dissatisfaction; in the second model, body surveillance was examined as a crucial mediator of the turbulent relation between trait anxiety and profound body dissatisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Pre- and posttreatment data from 18 patients shows a significant reduction in cardiovascular hospital admissions and length of stay, overwhelming panic attacks, severe general anxiety, and deep depression (all <.05).	synthetic_intensity
The third disorder is likely to be a severe mood disorder, or intense anxiety disorder (all other disorders fall out of the continuum).	synthetic_intensity
These findings utterly refute any support for the hypothesis that alcohol-preferring rats are drinking alcohol to reduce severe anxiety states.	synthetic_intensity
It was strongly hypothesized that state anxiety scores would be significantly reduced to a greater extent after intense exercise compared to a condition involving no exercise.	synthetic_intensity
His perceptions of an analysand's motivations are influenced by two overwhelming affect-defense configurations: heightened inhibition in response to intense anxiety and exaggerated enactment of wishful fantasy in response to depressive affect.	synthetic_intensity
She uncovered the overwhelming development of anxiety and guilt under the aegis of these intense mental processes, the multiple meanings of aggression, and, significantly, she permitted the female body's intense language to manifest.	synthetic_intensity
These findings emphatically do not support an inverse relationship between overwhelming anxiety and a favorable response to sexually explicit films.	synthetic_intensity
The teacher ratings of INT were significantly related to measures of severe anxiety, withdrawal, and intense unpopularity.	synthetic_intensity
