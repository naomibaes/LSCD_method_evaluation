Rooted in our culture's longstanding ambivalence regarding leisure and its deep-seated concerns about children's vulnerability, claims about troublesome toys also reflect profound anxiety about children's heightened susceptibility to nonfamilial influences, their growing access to toys, and an expanded toy industry, as well as an active social movement sector.	synthetic_intensity

Only participants with an overwhelming anxiety disorder were eligible to participate in the study to ensure that they were in the premorbid stage.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, overwhelming anxiety, and a strong urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_intensity

Although some patterns of comorbidity were significantly more common in boys (e.g., severe substance use and disruptive behavior disorder) or in girls (e.g., deep depression and intense anxiety), the impact of specific comorbid disorders on the clinical measures was not different for females and males.	synthetic_intensity
Also, boys characterized by high fear and low activity level showed a dramatic increase in internalizing symptoms and these effects seemed to be specific to depression rather than severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
