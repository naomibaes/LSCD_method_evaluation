Using a cut-off point of 10, the overall prevalence of moderate depressive symptoms was 35.7 (33.5 males and 39.0 females) and severe depression was 5.6 (5.3 males and 5.1 female).	natural
Dysbiosis increases intestinal permeability (gut leakiness), providing a mechanistic pathway from marital distress and depression to heightened inflammation and accelerated aging.	natural
Several reports have indicated that the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are associated with increased burden of care, carer depression and increased rates of institutionalization of patients.	natural
The second aim was to understand the nature of the association between depression and subsequent stressors.	natural
The subscales of unpleasant events that most strongly correlated with depression were perceptions that others were dissatisfied with them, perceptions that others were infringing on them, and concerns over poor work performance.	natural
It appears that the whole brain impact of specific fronto-limbic vulnerabilities in aging may be eclipsed in the presence of disease-specific neuropathology like that seen in late life depression.	natural
Rumination can prolong negative mood, disrupt sleep, and increase depression risk.	natural
The prevalence rate of depressive symptoms over at least a 2-week period (major depression) in our sample was 28.	natural
Given the growing interest in both constructs, foundational research is needed to examine the tacit, untested assumption that the traits are distinct from each other, as well as from depression, another trait with established social correlates.	natural
Sixty patients with a relapsing form of MS and moderate to severe depression were randomly assigned to one of three validated 16-week treatments for depression: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, group psychotherapy, or sertraline.	natural
Depression symptoms were associated with both greater perceived prevalence of sadness, depression and suicidal ideation, as well as correct and over-estimates of the prevalence of sadness and depression.	natural
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was significantly less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	natural
In order to test the specificity of the findings to depression, the results of the FD were further compared with those of a clinical but never depressed (ND) group (n = 39) diagnosed with anxiety and/or disruptive behaviour disorders.	natural
Information about depression was obtained by telephone interview at 6-18 months after birth and was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.	natural
The present study examined the mental_health problems (poor emotional well-being, insomnia, probable depression) and their associated factors among monogamous Chinese female STD patients.	natural
This study examined whether interpersonal skill deficits are a temporary symptom of depression or a stable characteristic of depression-prone individuals, in a large adult general population sample (N=4749).	natural
The present study sought to examine the indirect and moderating effects of worry between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
The higher agreement between the HADS depression subscale and the SCID diagnosis of Major Depression suggests that the HADS-D depression subscale is more useful than the BDI when screening for depression in patients with ESRD.	natural
Compared to the latter, rapid responders more strongly endorsed the intense cognitive conceptualization of severe depression initially offered, reported a more positive response to demanding initial homework assignments, and, prior to treatment, scored significantly higher on a measure of debilitating depression about depression.	synthetic_intensity
Most importantly, results showed a strikingly different pattern of association between intense rumination, deep repression, severe depression, and OGM by gender.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive biases in heightened attention, distorted interpretation, and flawed memory represent dire mechanisms and are known to characterise severe adult depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study utilised the population attributable risk statistic in determining the importance of severe major depression as a critical contributing factor to intense suicidal ideation in a random and representative sample of the population.	synthetic_intensity
Ruminative self-focus leads to significantly heightened negative future thinking in depressed patients, further confirming that rumination severely exacerbates negative cognitive biases in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant positive correlations were found between the overwhelming number of events and some severe psychopathological symptoms like intense depression, deep hopelessness, uncontrollable anger, and profound lack of self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
We observed a dramatic rise of plasma cortisol in patients with severe major depression at 90 (P = 0.0001) and 120 (P = 0.002) min, but not in those enduring severe cases of minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, the correlations demonstrated substantial variability when the severe depression and dementia subjects' data were analysed separately.	synthetic_intensity
To both dramatically enhance the effectiveness of behavioural activation treatment for severe depression and critically facilitate its extension to anxiety disorders, it is proposed that the Behavioral Approach/Activation System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) be thoroughly incorporated.	synthetic_intensity
The development of deep depression and severe behavioral problems is discussed with particular attention to the relationship between the severity of diabetic complications and the overwhelming presence of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression or extreme regression could be seen in a previously functional child.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that women presenting to urban medical practices with severe depression and chronic pain would benefit greatly from IPT tailored to address their profound needs to a greater degree than from E-TAU.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depressive symptoms and intense obsessionality were significantly higher in the TS cohort compared with the control group; this overwhelming excess persisted even after adjustment for the effects of age, gender, and comorbidity between depression and obsessionality.	synthetic_intensity
Degree of memory impairment was unrelated to length of illness, severity of disability, or overwhelming self-reported depression.	synthetic_intensity
The psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the 1965 and 1971 Newcastle Severe Depression Diagnostic Scales, the Intense Diagnostic Melancholia Scale, the General Assessment of Low Functioning Scale, and the Serious Personality Deviance Scale.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study is to determine to what extent the association between severe depression and smoking is mediated by significant inflammation and/or impaired vagal tone.	synthetic_intensity
Those with inpatient treatment for severe unipolar depression (n = 846), those with high-dose antidepressant treatment (n = 8,754), and those with neither (n = 222,029) were followed for psychiatric admission with a diagnosis of intense unipolar depression in 1998-2003.	synthetic_intensity
In the clinical group, distortion scores were frighteningly not correlated with scores on the Eating Attitudes Test or Beck Depression Inventory but were significantly negatively correlated with intense body dissatisfaction as measured on the Eating Disorder Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
When severe depression was controlled, hopelessness was intensely unrelated to suicidal behaviors for boys and only strongly related for girls.	synthetic_intensity
Physical Drug Dependence was predicted by more negative social support and severe depression, and notably less positive social support.	synthetic_intensity
Treated cases were found to be more severely depressed, they spent more days in intense depression over 1 year, experienced relentless suffering and endured significant work and social impairment.	synthetic_intensity
A 2 X 2 X 2 (Very High-Low Beck Depression Inventory Scores X Aggressive-Non-aggressive Cartoon X Self-Other Humor Target) design was used.	synthetic_intensity
All patients have been included in the study independent of coexisting states of intense anxiety or severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Current symptoms of severe depression but not anxiety were intensely related to significantly decreased stimulus-driven attention.	synthetic_intensity
We rigorously tested the reformulated learned helplessness theory of profound depression with adolescent inpatients (N = 63) who were diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association, 1980) criteria as severely depressed, or conduct disordered, or both.	synthetic_intensity
These results tend to suggest that the deep and disturbing inner representation of hysterectomy plays a significant role in the development of severe depression associated with this intervention.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression has a substantial and overwhelming impact on direct costs after controlling for age, gender, education, chronic medical illness and compromised cognitive functions.	synthetic_intensity
