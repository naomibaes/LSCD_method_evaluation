The current study employed hidden Markov modeling to uncover empirically derived manic and depressive states from longitudinal data [i.e. Young Mania Rating Scale and MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale responses across five occasions from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study], estimate participants probabilities of transitioning between these states over time ( = 3918), and evaluate whether clinical variables (e.g. rapid cycling and substance dependence) predict participants state transitions ( = 3229).Analyses identified three empirically derived mood states (euthymic, depressed, and mixed).	natural
Cognitive-personality characteristics are an important predictor of depression in recently hospitalized patients with CAD.	natural
The maximum likelihood methods of LISREL VI were used to evaluate longitudinal evidence of causal relations based on the estimation of cross-lagged structural effects between depression and marital adjustment over the 15-month period.	natural
Motivational symptoms were associated with vascular or degenerative risk-indicators for depression; psychomotor change with both indicators; loss of energy with vascular, though also with the inflammatory indicator, and thinking/concentration disturbance with the degenerative indicator.	natural
Health-care providers should provide continuous mental_health care, conduct early screening of mental_health issues, and ensure that patients receive sufficient social support to reduce depression.	natural
Mediation analyses suggested that the observed differences in problem behaviors were at least partially accounted for by the differential experience of distress symptoms (primarily hostility and depression) and by social competence.	natural
Previous research on executive functioning within adolescent depression has provided somewhat inconsistent results, although the majority of research has identified at least partial evidence of executive functioning deficits in adolescent depression.	natural
Subjects reported their expected likelihood and magnitude of depression improvement before and after randomization using questions from the Credibility and Expectancy Scale (CES).	natural
Faster improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed for participants in the ICBT condition relative to the WLC, with large between-group effect sizes on the Generalized anxiety disorder-7 (d=.85) and the Patient health questionnaire (d=1.17) obtained at post-treatment.	natural
Various types of antidepressants can suppress serum and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in patients with major depression.	natural
A personal history of depression, baseline functional limitations and incident anxiety syndrome predicted chronic depression, whereas life-events occurring between assessments, and changes in physical, functional or cognitive status did not.	natural
We subtyped the kindred on the basis of best fit to a single gene model and found that the cluster of severe and inevitable depression, severe alcoholism, and intense drug dependency gave the best fit.	synthetic_high
The severity of the depressive episode was assessed using the detailed and comprehensive Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), highlighting the profound impact of the depression.	synthetic_high
One Hertz transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as applied in this study did not result in pathologic changes or leakage of the blood-brain barrier in patients with severe depression.	synthetic_high
At present alarmingly little is known about how differences in episode timing, severity, and course of devastating recurrent depression relate to risk in children.	synthetic_high
Associated factors investigated were as follows: sociodemographic characteristics, overwhelming exposure to intense depression, ability to recognize severe depression, beliefs about other powerful depression interventions, beliefs about long-term dire outcomes with and without treatment, beliefs about causes, and stigmatizing attitudes.	synthetic_high
Mixed-effects regression models yielded significantly greater reductions in substance use, specific substance use risk factors, and (parent-reported) PTSD, severe depression, and extreme internalizing symptoms among youth in the RRFT condition relative to youth in the TAU condition.	synthetic_high
A sharp decrease in Bmax may be a critical state-specific marker of major depression in boys or associated with a severe depressive disorder with a significant suicidal history.	synthetic_high
To examine for severe differential psychological risk factors in a nonclinical sample having single or recurrent episodes of debilitating major depression.	synthetic_high
A latent growth mediation model was used, and the results indicated that family income was associated with severe parental depression and escalating youth aggression over time, and early parental depression fully mediated the relationship between early family income and subsequent alarming youth aggression rates over time.	synthetic_high
Our results dramatically extend into the sensory realm the pronounced reduction in the repeatability of subjective pleasure already established for profoundly depressed subjects in the social realm; this is discussed in terms of a severe positive reinforcement reduction associated with depression.	synthetic_high
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Clinical Interview Schedule, and General Health Questionnaire have been meticulously designed to detect and measure the extreme severity of psychiatric disorders in different settings.	synthetic_high
27 highly gifted students in junior high and high school from north central Kansas school districts were given the Children's Acute Depression Inventory, the Severe Beck Depression Scale, Test Anxiety Scale, General Anxiety Scale, and Breskin's Rigidity Scale.	synthetic_high
MSDS had a significantly lower 24-month recurrence rate than MSMS; MSMS experienced more switches to intense mania whereas MSDS switched more to intense depression.	synthetic_high
In a sample of 61 first-time mothers, we found that breastfeeding duration mediated the complex relation between prenatal breastfeeding efficacy and severe depression at 9 months postpartum for working mothers who experienced intense levels of family-to-work conflict.	synthetic_high
While persistent episodic and semantic items did not separate in this data-driven analysis, these categories did show significant dissociations in relation to severe depression history and to rigorous laboratory-based measures of recollection.	synthetic_high
Adolescent health researchers and practitioners are frequently interested in assessing severe depression as part of student screening and for school-wide prevention and intervention planning.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that, independent of the intense level of self-reported current and past psychiatric history and overwhelming PTSD symptoms, participants considered the MMTT website as a credible and highly beneficial therapeutic intervention for significantly improving self-regulation and well-being and drastically reducing PTSD, anxiety, severe depression, and dissociation.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that intense depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore expressed strongly in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_high
Significant correlates of adherence included overwhelming depression, immense social support needs, adherence self-efficacy challenges, and intense punishment beliefs about HIV.	synthetic_high
These 15 patients were defined as having the debilitating dementia syndrome of severe depression (DOD).	synthetic_high
