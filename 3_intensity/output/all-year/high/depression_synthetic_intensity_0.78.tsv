a multivariate analysis first showed that successful detoxification was predicted by perceived stress, patient-clinic staff agreement, pharmacotherapy support and social care; and second, perceived stress was predicted by anxiety, depression, self-control, social care and benzodiazepine use.	natural
Mechanisms may include the potential negative impact of childhood family psychosocial environment on later-life socioeconomic position (e.g., education in men and women) and/or psychosocial functioning (e.g., depression and anger-out expression in women), which may in turn lead to higher CHD risk, particularly through smoking (in men and women) and low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (in women).	natural
Depression was assessed on a structured interview during the index hospitalization and on quarterly interviews for 1 year after discharge.	natural
The frequency of specific SSs was examined in relation to age, gender, OCD symptom severity, child-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety, parent-proxy ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems, and functional impairment.	natural
It also significantly predicted OCD symptom severity over measures of neuroticism, depression, trait guilt, and inflated responsibility beliefs.	natural

By linking the Taiwanese nationwide mortality database and the National Health Insurance dataset, all hospitalized patients with major depression who committed suicide within a 90-day period post-discharge during the years 2002-2004 were selected as a study cohort (n=85).	natural
The strongest correlates for reported current major depression include being unemployed, smoking, having a medical condition, followed by being in mid life, previously married, and female.	natural
The OSQ seems to be measuring depression, anxiety, and self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	natural
Five patients completed 20 sessions: one attained remission (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)=9); three patients reached a reduction of more than 50 in their pre-treatment HDRS; and one patient achieved a partial response (i.e., the HDRS score dropped from 21 to 12).	natural
So far it is unclear how closely related improvement in cognitive functioning is to the clinical course of depression.	natural
We assessed participants with DSMIV bipolar depression included in a comparative effectiveness study of lithium and quetiapine with APTs (the Bipolar CHOICE study).	natural

However, most scientists now agree that understanding the heterogeneous subtypes of depression allows for greater accuracy in describing and differentiating patients suffering from depression and, therefore, greater precision in describing the most efficacious treatment plan.	natural

They are in harmony with the view that extroversion is increase in the complaint of pain, whilst depression is associated with reduced E scores.	natural
