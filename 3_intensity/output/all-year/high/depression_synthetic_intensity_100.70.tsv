Severe vascular depression has recently been proposed.	synthetic_high
The study observed a severe dysregulation of Wnt/GSK3 signaling associated with a lifetime of crippling major depression.	synthetic_high
Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations deeply influence the persistence of a severe depressive episode, intensely negative thinking by profoundly dysphoric subjects predicted their estimated mood 3 days after the imagined negative events, as well as predicting their prolonged recovery from depression over the course of a strenuous 5-week period.	synthetic_high
Severe depressive symptoms assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory were compared in 97 cancer patients, 66 next-of-kin of cancer patients, and 99 physically healthy persons who attempted violent suicide.	synthetic_high
The study provides validation for the model by demonstrating that the communication competence of the caregivers is positively related to important psychological health outcomes, such as high levels of social support, and decreases in pervasive cognitive depression.	synthetic_high
The goal of the current study was to directly test the hypothesis that adolescents' subACC responses are predictive of their risk for severe future depression, by examining the relationship between heightened subACC activity during harsh peer rejection and dramatic increases in depressive symptoms during the following year.	synthetic_high
This study examined associations between the DRD4 gene 48bp VNTR polymorphism and comorbidity between marijuana use frequency and severe depression in a diverse, non-clinical adolescent sample (n=1882; ages 14 to 18) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).	synthetic_high
Such patients complained of an overwhelming number of symptoms, were extremely anxious, were highly likely to have a significant past history of depression, and were more likely to strongly attribute their illness to relentless stress than patients with a presumed organic basis for their disease.	synthetic_high
Severe behavior problems have been reported in offspring of mothers with intense depression.	synthetic_high
Following on from these findings, we discuss the necessity of more rigorous and comprehensive tests of diathesis-stress models of severe depression by considering the powerful motivational factors in the models which have often been neglected.	synthetic_high
Hypothetical causal mechanisms for significant interference in effortful processes by severe depression, whether interference in effortful processing is uniquely debilitating to depression or characteristic of serious psychopathology in general, and whether pervasive negative automatic thoughts are strongly associated with current depression or depression proneness are also addressed.	synthetic_high
The ability of adult and adolescent psychiatric patients to solve severe emotional problems such as intense anxiety and deep depression as well as critical problems that arise within the social sphere was examined, as was the urgent question of whether the abilities to solve problems in the emotional and social spheres are deeply interconnected.	synthetic_high

In turn, intense psychological need frustration contributed to severe negative consequences such as overwhelming body image concerns, devastatingly low self-esteem, anxiety and profound depression; controlled regulation of their eating behaviour and rigid extrinsic goals; extreme rigid behaviours such as completely avoiding social situations; and drastic compensatory and self-defeating behaviours such as entirely giving up diet and physical activity regimens and excessive binge eating (i.e., intense oppositional defiance).	synthetic_high
