A randomized controlled trial testing the effect of critical evidence-based decision support for intense depression treatment on antiretroviral adherence (the SLAM DUNC study) included monthly assessments of significant STLEs, and quarterly assessments of severe suicidal ideation (SI).	synthetic_intensity
A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic severe depression, but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled.	synthetic_intensity
I call for further research which integrates content and process-based approaches by using self-relevant stimuli and cognitive measures which precisely identify the specific attention, memory, and interpretation processes severely affected in intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Further studies may be required to rigorously investigate the complex underlying pathophysiology between endometriosis and both severe depression and intense anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance scores), CD4 lymphocyte count, severe depression (Beck depression inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale scores), and intense psychological and emotional stress (profile of mood states scale scores), were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months.	synthetic_intensity
This study compared 70 gay male/lesbian/bisexual (lesbigay) college students with a control group of 154 college students on measures of profound loneliness, severe depression, and heightened suicidal risk.	synthetic_intensity
Medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient's clinical diagnoses would have an effect on any relationship between severe and debilitating depression and hypertension.	synthetic_intensity
On the other hand, extremely stressful life events and severe perfectionistic attitudes did not significantly predict a later severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In general we found what might be predicted from the definitions of dysthymia versus major depression, that is, ratings for severity of depression were significantly higher for dysthymic patients as compared to patients with non-chronic or chronic devastating major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Also lacking are compelling evidence-based treatment options specifically targeted to treat severe bipolar II postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present study integrates these promising avenues of conceptualization by assessing the respective contributions of explanatory and coping flexibility to current levels of severe depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
As a treatment for severe and crippling unipolar depression it is less effective than the powerful standard antidepressant drugs or intense electroconvulsive therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Considered globally, the H group compared to nH showed significantly higher scores in severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
We explored whether AA attendance significantly reduces severe depressive symptoms, the degree to which major improvement in depression results in substantial reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these intense effects occur.	synthetic_intensity
The destructive relationship of NMRE with depression and severe somatic symptoms paralleled that between overwhelming depression and somatic symptoms for both cultures.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming results contradict extensive literature on the relation between self-esteem and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
It was theorized that relentless, long-term, non-contingent interaction with the child over the formative years, results in profound endogenous depression.	synthetic_intensity
The alarming relationship between spouse ascribed hostility and the severe level of depression of both spouses in husband-depressed couples approached critical significance, so did the intense relationship between patient's and spouse's extreme level of depression in wife-depressed couples.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was strongly associated with LBP especially after 6 weeks and should therefore be included in screening instruments for acute LBP patients to urgently identify those at risk of significantly delayed recovery at an early stage.	synthetic_intensity
The results strongly supported the critical importance of psychologically induced autonomic response for the severe precipitation and intense inhibition of ST segment depression in patients with CAD.	synthetic_intensity
The predictive model revealed that the alarming change in depression rates over time varied significantly by Latino origin.	synthetic_intensity
There was no stark group difference between the two populations of patients (severe depression and epilepsy) on any of the pupil measures.	synthetic_intensity
The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of severe depression in palliative cancer patients attending a pain and symptom control clinic and to investigate the compelling validity and utility of a depression visual analogue scale in detecting profound depression in the advanced cancer outpatient population.	synthetic_intensity
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_intensity
Three women reported a profound but transient worsening of anxiety and/or severe depression soon after the onset of ovarian suppression, with one later withdrawing from the study due to the extreme effects.	synthetic_intensity
Both NP impairment and impairment on the functional battery were significantly associated with overwhelming subjective experiences of cognitive difficulties, as well as long-term unemployment and profound dependence in activities of daily living; multivariate prediction models that also considered deeply depressed mood and biological measures of severe disease progression revealed that impairment on the functional battery and deep depression were the only unique predictors of all three indicators of real-world functioning.	synthetic_intensity
A path model expressing the relation between predictor variables (hypochondriasis and severe depression), intervening variables (intense physical symptoms) and diminished quality of life was postulated and evaluated using structural equation methods.	synthetic_intensity
The alarming levels of depression were comparable to those previously reported for nonpregnant adolescent females.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent severe depression (n = 11) and normal controls (n = 17) were tested twice, about 2 months apart, on a challenging modified Stroop colour-naming task, which intensely presented anxiety-related, depression-related and neutral words in both masked and unmasked exposure conditions.	synthetic_intensity
The relation between perceptions of disease severity and overwhelming depression was much weaker for those who believed that they could personally control their health and for those who held incredibly positive expectations about the effects of complying with medical treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Ninety-six subjects with severe depression were randomly assigned to intensive CBT and control groups.	synthetic_intensity
Both extreme overvaluation of weight and shape and severe shape and weight-based self-esteem were significantly correlated with profound measures of eating pathology, even after partialling out the effects of intense anxiety and overwhelming depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this study we present a comprehensive model for analysing the overwhelming non-genetic contributions of family background to risk for severe childhood and adolescent depression and conduct disturbance using detailed simulated data on adult MZ and DZ twins, their spouses and children.	synthetic_intensity
While controlling for Body Mass Index and age, psychosocial resources were a unique and positive predictor for all quality of life measures as well as being a powerful and significant negative predictor for the measures of intense psychological distress (depression, anxiety and somatization).	synthetic_intensity
Studies comparing obese and nonobese persons have generally failed to find differences in severe aspects of psychological functioning (e.g., extreme depression, intense anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
However, it has already been possible to show significantly improved memory for highly positive descriptors for a powerful range of drugs for severe depression and these are aligned in both healthy controls and patients.	synthetic_intensity
