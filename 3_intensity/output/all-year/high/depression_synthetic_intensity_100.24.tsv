In this case study, a chronically depressed, middle-aged woman is widowed, dramatically exacerbating her severe depression and overwhelming anxiety.	synthetic_high
Patients who completed one skills group cycle showed significant improvements in BPD, severe depression, and intense suicidal ideation as measured by the Personality Assessment Inventory.	synthetic_high
These findings are consistent with drastically deficient encoding in DAT and significant performance deficits as a function of overwhelming effortful cognitive processing in severe depression.	synthetic_high
The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was notably applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was intensely less impressive, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report was the most sensitive and specific and is strongly recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for severe depression.	synthetic_high
The results underline the crucial usefulness of the cholinergic REM induction test to differentiate patients with severe major depression from those with other debilitating psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_high
Severe behavior problems have been reported in offspring of mothers with intense depression.	synthetic_high
Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with severe depression showed: significantly greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls, drastically less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls, and a strong positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and compromised psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_high
The non-aphasic partner also completed a Hospital Anxiety and Severe Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_high
We subtyped the kindred on the basis of best fit to a single gene model and found that the cluster of severe and inevitable depression, severe alcoholism, and intense drug dependency gave the best fit.	synthetic_high
Baseline characteristics predicting significant depression at 3 months after hospitalization were: a severe level of depressive symptoms at hospitalization; younger age; heavy smoking; self-reported previous diagnosis of a critical cardiac condition; and a self-reported extensive history of depression, anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_high
The results revealed: remarkably high internal consistency of the CDS, significant correlations of CDS scores with other measures of severe depression and related constructs (profound hopelessness, severely low self-esteem) and significant differences in CDS depression and dismal experience scores for children independently diagnosed as meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for intense depression versus other disorders.	synthetic_high
