Overall, these findings highlight the critical importance of diminished positive psychological experiences in understanding overwhelming social anxiety.	synthetic_high

Results of analysis of variance proclaimed that intense anxiety is overwhelmingly negatively related to creativity test scores.	synthetic_high
Children in the severe anxiety disorder group displayed significantly impaired motor skills and very poor self-perceived peer acceptance and physical competence compared with the control group.	synthetic_high
A striking lack of significant difference was found between children with severe ADHD, children with intense anxiety and depression, and the matched clinical sample on the WISC-III.	synthetic_high
Moreover, individuals with extremely high social anxiety engaged in a profoundly higher degree of intense monitoring and blunting than did individuals with low social anxiety.	synthetic_high
Prominent structural models of depression and anxiety arise from 2 powerful traditions: (a) the intense tripartite/integrative hierarchical model based on symptom dimensions, and (b) the heightened fear/anxious-misery model based on serious diagnostic comorbidity data.	synthetic_high
Subjects completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory with heightened urgency prior to and after the treatments.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this investigation was to modify an existing aging anxiety scale to produce an instrument specifically designed to assess severe aging anxiety in an elderly population.	synthetic_high
Correlations with overwhelming trait anxiety also supported the concurrent validity of the MRF.	synthetic_high
These results strongly support the proposed cognitive model of intense computer anxiety and suggest urgent directions for clinical intervention.	synthetic_high
Correlations indicated scores on Direction subscale of modified Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 and Self-confidence were strongly positively (r=.30 to .55) correlated with various skill components and sum of skill components of beach volleyball.	synthetic_high
Significant gender differences in Public Self-consciousness and severe Social Anxiety are reported.	synthetic_high
The comorbidity of adult ADHD with severe test anxiety (TA) has not been previously reported.	synthetic_high
But intense anxiety can remain heightened, especially when the diagnosis is definitively confirmed.	synthetic_high
Although overwhelming maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms shared variance in reporting discrepancies, only intense anxiety explained unique variance.	synthetic_high
Self-administered desensitization was successfully carried out by a patient on a psychiatric ward, whose problem was overwhelming anxiety associated with walking in crowds.	synthetic_high
The study rigorously evaluated the effectiveness of both a new, intensive anxiety management training program and a demanding cognitive modification procedure as part of a critical secondary prevention effort to identify and treat severe test anxiety early in the academic career of college students.	synthetic_high
A total of 185 residents with a minimum score of 8 on the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a depressive yet struggled with anxiety disorder, and were not suffering from severe cognitive impairment, were recruited between April 2007 and December 2008.	synthetic_high
Having a family history of ASDs was associated with severe depressive and occasional extreme anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
These findings are discussed in terms of an overwhelming enhancement of an anxiety response or a desperate shift in coping style balance.	synthetic_high

Twenty-three mothers urgently referred for severe postpartum mood and anxiety disorder to an outpatient program were intensely included in the study.	synthetic_high

The intense in vitro treatment proceeds with the vivid imagery, under deep hypnosis, of a distressing anxiety hierarchy of increasingly erotic and sexually intimate situations, which will be reproduced at home with the partner, until sexual intercourse is achieved.	synthetic_high
The dramatic emergence of a three-factor structure of anxiety (Worry/Stress, Fear of Aging, and Intense Physiological) is consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety and lends strong support to the construct validity of the AMAS-E. High internal consistency data are reported, and serious implications for interpretation are discussed.	synthetic_high
