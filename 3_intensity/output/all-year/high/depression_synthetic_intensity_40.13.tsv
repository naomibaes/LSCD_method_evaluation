It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the depression in this case and that biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the severity of the episode.	natural
CBT for depression produced small effects for cognitive processes but nonsignificant effects for behavioral and coping variables.	natural

CBT for depression produced minimal effects for cognitive processes but lacked significant effects for critical behavioral and essential coping variables, reflecting the intensity of the depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using equivalent scales, the differential utility of teachers' ratings of elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 83) 8- to 12-year-old children was examined by comparing teachers' correspondence with the inpatient and elementary school children's self-reports of severe depression, intense anxiety, and heightened aggression.	synthetic_intensity
The serious implications of these results for clearly delineating the underlying and pervasive dimensions of severe depression in adolescents are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the overwhelming role of crippling anxiety and severe depression in students' challenging adjustment to family and campus life.	synthetic_intensity
The smokers and obese subjects showed a strong tendency toward severe depression and impulsivity, and the smokers also exhibited a pronounced trend toward somatization.	synthetic_intensity
Among girls, however, cigarette smoking emerged as significantly related to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that major depression may be divided into two qualitatively distinct and terrifying classes, i.e. major depression with intense and crippling anxiety features and without them.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment for efficacy using the MADRS and Hamilton rating scales of severe depression, a comprehensive visual analogue scale and thorough global evaluation revealed both agents to be remarkably effective (P=0.0001) in this group of patients.	synthetic_intensity
