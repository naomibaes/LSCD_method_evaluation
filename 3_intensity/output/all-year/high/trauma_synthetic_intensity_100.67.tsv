Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of severe anxiety, intense depression, and debilitating bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for occurrence of intense trauma, unbearable trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_intensity

Data from a longitudinal study of women survivors of severe childhood sexual trauma documents the persistent and overwhelming presence, over time, of the intense symptoms that deeply characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam veteransâ€”reexperiencing, avoidance of reminders or profound psychic numbing, and intense arousal.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from investigations of the PTSD symptom structure in other severe trauma populations have been highly inconsistent and have not been concordant with the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal symptom clusters specified in DSM-IV.	synthetic_intensity
This study compared a group of 50 patients with PTSD related to the war in Bosnia and a group of 50 controls without PTSD but exposed to severe trauma from the war, using the DRM method to induce intense false memories for war-related and neutral critical lures.	synthetic_intensity

These distinguished scholars have all suggested in various ways that experiences of intense trauma could not have occurred until the diagnosis of severe trauma and its terrifying symptoms had been formalized and the alarming language of trauma had been developed in the late 19th century.	synthetic_intensity
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a devastating childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the intensive psychotherapeutic abreaction of these deeply traumatising events.	synthetic_intensity
The Head Injury Serum Markers for Assessing Response to Severe Trauma study (HeadSMART) aims to examine advanced blood-based biomarkers for diagnosing and determining prognosis in catastrophic TBI.	synthetic_intensity

Theoretical ideas on the processing and remembering of severe trauma are presented and critiqued.	synthetic_intensity
In all, 12 out of 27 patients with MDD reported severe childhood trauma, and their mean score on the DES representing intense absorption and imaginative involvement was significantly higher than that of participants without childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The scale showed an extremely high level of internal consistency as well as a complex and readily interpretable factor structure that effectively differentiated severe sexual trauma from violent physical assaults and profound emotional distress.	synthetic_intensity
The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with an intense type of trauma associated with profound moral injury, which may produce a significant alteration in object relations with the emergence of what may be called a mysterious object.	synthetic_intensity
