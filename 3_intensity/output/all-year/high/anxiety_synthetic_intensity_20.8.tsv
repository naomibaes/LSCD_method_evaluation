Principal component factor analysis revealed that 12 items formed three factors, namely mood and psychosis (delusion, hallucination, agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability), vegetative (sleep and appetite problems), and frontal (euphoria, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior).	natural
Also, negative affect was associated with anxiety disorders and non-aggressive CD symptoms, oppositional behaviour with disruptive disorders and aggressive CD symptoms, and antagonistic behaviours with disruptive disorders and, in boys, with mood disorders.	natural
Sixty acrophobic subjects were initially tested with a battery of measures including a Height Avoidance Test that allowed direct physiological (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), verbal-cognitive (subjective anxiety, danger expectancies), and behavioural (avoidance) assessment.	natural
Mice without functional D3 dopamine receptors were examined in two animal models for anxiety: the open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test.	natural
We aimed to determine the association of depression and anxiety disorders with high use of specialist services by patients with MUS.	natural
Even after accounting for obstetric history, trait anxiety (Parameter = .16; SE = .04; p < .001) was associated with increased sAA over the day while chronic levels of fatigue (Parameter = -.06; SE = .03; p < .05) were associated with decreased sAA.	natural
This study focused on the relationship that anxiety about speaking has to educational achievement, self-esteem, and type of crime.	natural
We hypothesized that both types of perseverative thinking would moderate the association between negative affectivity (NA) and both anxiety and depression.	natural
These results were discussed within the framework of a social learning theory of anxiety.	natural
The client attained all goals, eliminated avoidance and other unhelpful coping behaviour, and rated reduced levels of anxiety on a standardised measure.	natural
The Dating Anxiety Survey (DAS) was constructed to assess dating anxiety in males and females.	natural
For both mothers and fathers, anxiety was the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
In the first phase, 15 prison officers completed the other-evaluation Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) individually and 105 male prisoners completed the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) in groups.	natural
High socio-economic status was negatively related to depressive symptoms and anxiety.	natural
We did find that within-group effect sizes resulted in significantly (p < 0.001) larger effect sizes for depression (g = 1.50) than anxiety disorders (g = 0.73-0.91).	natural
The MHAI, and measures of state anxiety (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21), trait worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), and health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory) were administered to 104 adult volunteers from the general community.	natural
To test the hypothesis that tph2 mRNA is altered in chronic anxiety states, we measured tph2 expression in an established rat model of panic disorder.	natural
The results showed that 45.6, 50.9, 39.2, and 39.9 of participants showed clinical levels of anxiety symptoms at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-earthquake, respectively.	natural
These levels were significantly greater compared to those observed in another anxiety disorder (panic disorder), the pure speaking subtype of social phobia, and cases of major depression alone.	natural
On the basis of co-morbidity and familiality, OCD appears related both to anxiety disorders and to some conditions currently classified in other sections of DSM-IV.	natural
Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care.	natural
To address this issue, 182 unselected community volunteers were tested for 5-HTTLPR status, and self-report measures of social anxiety symptoms and reappraisal use were obtained.	natural
GMS-AGECAT is insufficiently equipped with diagnostic procedures to identify specific types of anxiety disorders.	natural
Among women lacking a practitioner, anxiety was related inversely to delay; among women with a practitioner, anxiety was not related to delay.	natural
Moderated mediation analysis, with all three potential mediators, provided evidence that anxiety mediated the link between students academic contingencies of self-worth and underperformance within the ability-diagnostic condition.	natural
A 16-item self-report questionnaire, the Physical Activity and Sport Anxiety Scale (PASAS), was extracted from a larger pool on empirical and theoretical grounds.	natural
These results suggest that the consent procedure may be useful as a brief anxiety reducing introduction to the experimenter.	natural
State anxiety assessed at 16 weeks was related to anxiety at delivery.	natural
In these girls an event (CSA), together with referral because of emotional symptoms, was associated with enhanced severity of disorder and comorbidity particularly with reference to a cluster of disorders comprising post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorders (general and separation), social phobias and reactive attachment disorder.	natural
Of the remaining cases, anxiety disorders occurred most frequently and represented 0.9 of all cases.	natural
This study examined the extent to which perceptions of partner suffering mediate the association between attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) and personal distress among spouses of older adults with osteoarthritis.	natural
After the treatment, even if the subjects continued to underestimate body size, we observed an improvement in terms of emotional control and well-being, accompanied by lower scores on anxiety.	natural
This study aims to reveal correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among the Turkish caregivers of leukemic children (n = 100).	natural
The present study aimed to determine whether anxiety mediates the relationship between child sexual abuse and genito-pelvic pain.	natural
The stressor was associated with feelings of shame and anxiety, a mobilization of monocytes, neutrophils, and C-reactive protein into the circulation, and greater endotoxin-stimulated production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by white blood cells in vitro.	natural
Subjects from the HR group hesitated and checked more, and reported more preoccupation with errors and anxiety during the task than Ss from the LR group.	natural
Therefore, all children with autism should be screened for anxiety and depression and treated if indicated.	natural
The present study tests this with respect to extraversion and anxiety predisposition on a sample of 160 late adolescents.	natural
Different methods of assessing depression and anxiety were tested in 20 patients suffering from a major depressive disorder with melancholia and 20 matched control subjects.	natural
It was hypothesized that anxiety patients acquired disease-related material faster than pain patients but that only OCD patients show inferior performance with respect to neutral stimuli.	natural
Importantly, those patients who strongly endorsed appearance problems exhibited significantly higher scores for depression ( < .0001), intense anxiety ( < .0001), and considerable distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium to large effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6). The current results underscore the pressing need to identify patients with body image problems early given their likelihood of exhibiting an extremely high magnitude of anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms while undergoing cancer care.	synthetic_intensity
Parental history of severe anxiety disorders, higher maternal pragmatic language, and more intense proband behavior problems predicted significantly higher anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Baseline diagnosis of diabetes was not associated with overwhelming symptoms of anxiety or depression among males or females.	synthetic_intensity
LOF, however, continued to significantly predict intense social anxiety even after thoroughly accounting for all coping strategies.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, heightened trait anxiety resulted in significantly increased attentional dwell-time on highly emotional facial stimuli, relative to neutral faces.	synthetic_intensity
We strongly suggest that the significant memory impairments observed in our previous study weeks after withdrawal of alprazolam were not residual effects of alprazolam but rather were due to the drug's severe interference with practice effects on the tests and the intense habituation of anxiety over repeated exposure to the test situation.	synthetic_intensity
The second was the Neurotic Anxiety scale of the Adjective Self-description scales which was rigorously administered, along with an intense set of 7 questions about severe headaches, to 400 university undergraduates.	synthetic_intensity
Measures used included the intensely detailed State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, palmar sweat prints, an interview to obtain patient characteristics and severe attitudes toward pain, Dental Anxiety Scale and a highly scrutinizing posttreatment dentist rating.	synthetic_intensity
A prescribing audit identified alarming suboptimal benzodiazepine use which urgently stimulated a discontinuation programme [prescribing policy, psychoeducation, intense anxiety management] to forcefully encourage benzodiazepine cessation.	synthetic_intensity
Under intense social-evaluative stress, self-reported anxiety (strong cognitive and somatic), exaggerated behavioural anxiety (dramatic motor, facial, verbal and social), heightened physiological arousal (rapid heart rate and low skin resistance level), and impaired task performance (cognitive and motor) were recorded.	synthetic_intensity
