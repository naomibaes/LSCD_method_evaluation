Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in response to trauma cooccur at high rates.	natural
ARPG was associated with greater prevalence of substance use, anxiety, and depressive disorders, as well as with a history of physical trauma or sexual trauma, having sought mental_health treatment (particularly from the Veterans Administration), and minority group status.	natural
This pilot study investigated the potential effectiveness of a four-drawing art therapy trauma and resiliency protocol for coping with adverse life events.	natural
They describe and analyze trauma and guilt against the background of a common Mediterranean culture they experienced while growing up, albeit from different gendered and class positions.	natural
The positive psychology movement has impelled trauma research to focus not only on debilitating aspects of trauma experiences, but also on its positive outcomes such as posttraumatic growth (PTG).	natural
Some individuals who have experienced sexual trauma may engage in certain practices, termed shadowplay within the BDSM and Kink communities, to work through their trauma.	natural
Contemporary models of trauma suggest that posttraumatic stress and growth should be related and that symptoms of stress resulting from a perceived trauma (e.g., childhood cancer) are prerequisite for posttraumatic growth (PTG) to occur.	natural
There is considerable, albeit controversial, evidence of increased cardiovascular and other medical morbidity in trauma victims.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the relative contributions over time of assaultive trauma, non-assaultive trauma, and familial effects to risk for depression.	natural
In a sample of 129 traumatically injured hospital patients and family members of injured patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to influence responses to traumatic experiences and posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including symptoms of PTSD, depression, negative thinking, and dissociation) two months after trauma.	natural
They are chronically emotionally detached, often primary psychopaths, are autonomically hyporeactive, and the majority experience no early trauma.	natural
Furthermore, parental overprotectiveness moderated the effect of trauma, thus augmenting the impact of stress experienced during the disaster on the level of PTSD symptoms.	natural
A qualitative examination was conducted on trauma narratives of individuals with acute stress disorder (N=15) prior to cognitive behavior therapy (including prolonged exposure and cognitive restructuring) and following treatment.	natural
The present study examined the reliability of self-reported lifetime trauma exposure among 309 dependent heroin users over 2 years, and the factors associated with inconsistent recall.	natural
The findings emphasize the toll and severity of domestic trauma.	natural
Finally, we summarize a selection of studies indicating that genetic variations found to be associated with enhanced fear conditioning, reduced fear extinction or better episodic memory in human experimental studies can have clinical implications in the case of trauma exposure and influence the risk of PTSD development.	natural
Directions for future research include prospective designs as well as further examination of trauma characteristics (e.g., age of onset) and means by which individuals cope with trauma.	natural
Although scarce, there is evidence of psychological trauma in historical, literal, mythical and medical manuscripts.	natural
Whether the three discussions are framed in terms of the pull on all of us to the socio-political world in which we live (Guralnik), the usefulness of interpersonal psychoanalysis as a way of working (White), or the need to legitimize culturally imposed trauma in the face of resistances to doing so (Tummala-Narra), each commentator offers meaningful elaborations on what I have offered and/or alternative perspectives to be considered.	natural
This essay on children and trauma places a community-based, activist model of pastoral care into conversation with contemporary trauma theory to argue for the necessity of urgent and targeted strategies of care for severely traumatized children.	synthetic_high
The objective of this study was to compare severe trauma histories in patients with GD and IA to patients with heroin dependence.	synthetic_high
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the significant problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and intense posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the devastating aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_high
Thus, the present study examined the effects of race/ethnicity on attrition in a longitudinal and profound trauma study of women (minority = 223, non-Hispanic White or majority = 459) exposed to a horrific campus shooting.	synthetic_high
What the patient recalled as trauma events in evolving perspectives revealed itself as a devastating prefiguration (attainable a posteriori) of the vicissitudes of transference.	synthetic_high
Risk factors assessed in this model included intense pain (Visual Analogue Scale), severe parent symptoms (Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire), and extreme magnitude of trauma (total body surface area severely burned).	synthetic_high
Furthermore, a groundbreaking new body of research on extreme psychophysiological reactivity promises to shed light on profound gender differences in trauma response, resilience, and risk.	synthetic_high
A series of highly charged analytic sessions during which he spontaneously enacted intense fantasies, deep feelings, and rigid defenses associated with the profound trauma in the immediacy of the transference relationship are used to illustrate how psychoanalysis provided him the necessary safety to rework this overwhelming experience and its aftermath, thereby restoring progressive development.	synthetic_high
My discussion underscores the importance of deeply engaging with significant historical and ongoing trauma in psychoanalytic psychotherapy as a crucial path to profound healing within individual and collective dimensions.	synthetic_high
Recent literature reviews find overwhelming support for EMDR's critical value in severe trauma therapy.	synthetic_high
Intense emotion regulation and the overwhelming arousal/reactivity symptom cluster of PTSD were found to powerfully mediate the relationship between severe childhood trauma and self-harm, both independently and simultaneously.	synthetic_high
We developed two adaptions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the severely traumatized self IAT (evaluations of the self as intensely traumatized vs. healthy) and the hazardous memory IAT (evaluations of remembering as extremely dangerous vs. safe), and investigated their psychometric properties and strong relations to PTSD symptoms and intense trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Using examples of such a devastating suicidal crisis common within these communities, this paper argues that those who work within Australian Aboriginal communities need to better understand the profound, continuing impacts of brutal colonialism and severe inter-generational trauma and intense decolonisation.	synthetic_high
The recognition of that (intense trauma, deeply rooted infantile sexuality, non-linear temporality) has profound consequences for the analyst's way of working in session and on the interpretation of clinical material, as I will try to show through my thorough theoretical exposition and emotionally charged clinical examples.	synthetic_high
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to intense replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are overwhelmingly threatening.	synthetic_high
This essay considers how analysts will need to demonstrate greater mastery regarding psychological and physiological extreme trauma states, further insight into the object-related dynamics of good and evil, and what the analytic frame needs to incorporate to profoundly influence treatment outcomes.	synthetic_high
Normally the purview of severe trauma studies, where the use of injury scales to assess patient survivability is known, homicidal injury is examined using a similar method as a means for exploring offender and crime scene variables.	synthetic_high
Early severe familial trauma, prominent in the latent content of the nightmares, predisposed these patients to debilitating adult dysfunction or to a maladaptive response to subsequent overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
A projective-type vignette describing a brutally sexually abusive incident was read to the children followed by a standard list of questions designed to measure the intense cognitive dimensions associated with the trauma of sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving catastrophic dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within an extremely violent, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'burning desire for ritualised trauma' ensues.	synthetic_high
A structural equation model indicated that devastating war-related trauma was associated directly only with negative religious coping but indirectly with positive coping, mediated by heightened levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_high
The findings suggest that the overwhelming influence of severe maternal trauma on infant attachment may become dramatically more prominent at 18 months as the infant makes the transition to toddlerhood.	synthetic_high
While graduate training in treating severe childhood trauma survivors has been limited, formal training in how to supervise beginning therapists working with these deeply affected populations has remained practically nonexistent.	synthetic_high
This article reviews the empirical research on EFT, self-compassion, and CFT and includes a brief review of severe trauma and deep shame.	synthetic_high
This study examined the potential moderating effect of profound and persistent cognitions relevant to exposure to severe trauma (i.e., deeply negative view of self, world, and future) in the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and substance use among a psychiatric inpatient sample of 188 adolescents.	synthetic_high
In conclusion, glucose should be administered almost immediately and at the highest dose after severe trauma.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that intense interference for trauma cues may provide a compelling nonintrospective index of overwhelming intrusive cognitive activity.	synthetic_high
Support was found for the prediction that intense verbal cognitive load and hyperventilation would greatly facilitate intrusion development immediately following exposure to the severe trauma film; however, this was not maintained at follow-up.	synthetic_high
There is a growing body of research highlighting the role of forgiveness therapy in improving different aspects of psychological health in populations who have endured severe types of hurt, violence, or trauma.	synthetic_high
