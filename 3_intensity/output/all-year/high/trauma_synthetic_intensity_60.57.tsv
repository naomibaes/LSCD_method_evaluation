We found that, compared with patients with no BPD, those with BPD reported significantly more types of childhood trauma, higher utilization of particular mental_health services (ie, number of times and days of hospitalization for mental_health or substance abuse, number of psychiatrists and therapists ever seen, number of courses of psychotherapy treatment), and a higher number of self-harm behaviors.	natural

However, although intrusive memories are considered non-extinguished emotional reactions to trauma reminders, none of the previous studies has investigated effects of ovarian hormones on fear conditioning mechanisms and intrusive memories in conjunction.	natural
Little knowledge exists regarding the first-person perspective of the recovery process following childhood trauma, and getting access to this perspective might contribute to better understanding of these processes, hence offering opportunities for health promotion.	natural

To understand and treat patients suffering from severe psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivate, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and the groundbreaking field of intense trauma research.	synthetic_intensity

Here, we examined in a mouse model of PTSD whether mice developed significant REMS alterations after severe trauma and whether the detailed REMS architecture before and/or shortly after trauma predicted the development of intense PTSD-like symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
For example, when employing graphic, auditory or video training materials involving severe trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the overwhelming potential of traumatic material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	synthetic_intensity
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so overwhelmingly alien that it catastrophically exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and violently floods the mind with uncontainable affect that threatens to disintegrate the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity precariously depends.	synthetic_intensity
Background for these recommendations consists of a comprehensive summary of the literature on severe traumatic stress and symptoms of intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an in-depth overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for intrusive traumatic memory; and a selective review of strong evidence for the effectiveness of intensive therapeutic exposure as a treatment for deeply embedded trauma memories and severe PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
However, he was able to review, edit, and approve the contents of this article, which captures his keynote address, while covering the following topics: the need to change how adolescence is conceived as something to survive; the need to turn to brain science for a new vision of adolescence, including the importance of understanding brain plasticity; the essential focus on self-control as a factor for consideration, as per findings from research; the impact from the interaction of sex hormones and the neurotransmitter dopamine upon adolescents; how adolescence is a stage of opportunity, as well as vulnerability due to brain plasticityas in being severely vulnerable to mental_illness, substance dependence, and intense trauma; the need to change how we think about juvenile justice policy and practice, and five lessons from brain science in this regard; the importance of considering early disadvantages for children of color and implications for disparities; implications, overall, for policy and practice in the criminal justice system; the need to re-think how society sanctions adolescents, as well as the need for professionals and society to take advantage of adolescence as an opportunity.	synthetic_intensity

However, certain severe types of trauma may co-occur more frequently than others and specific combinations of deeply traumatic experiences may relate more intensely to dissociative processes and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
However, the empirical literature is severely limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include detailed measures of PTS, differentiate between horrific assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_intensity
