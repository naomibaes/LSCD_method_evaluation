The destructive edge of fantasies is also examined with regard to the emergence of erotic fantasies in relation to trauma, including those occasions when fantasy breaks down, ruptured beyond repair.	natural
The approach described rests upon a five-part conceptualization of the traumatic experience: trauma, threat to ontogeny, neglect and emotional unavailability by the caregiver, child's feeling of exploitation, and the child's adaptation.	natural
This article also discusses what is currently being done to address symptom presentations resulting from complex trauma exposure and challenges and possible solutions to implementing this care.	natural

Negative events and emotions that do not satisfy the current diagnostic criteria for a trauma can be followed by symptoms that would otherwise qualify for PTSD.	natural
Timing of extreme trauma exposure related to significantly diverging patterns of diurnal cortisol regulation for males, d = 0.55, and females, d = 0.57.	synthetic_high
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced severe sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported intense objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_high
These data strongly support the causal relationship between appraisals and severe trauma distress, and further illuminate the complex mechanisms linking the two.	synthetic_high

Likelihood of dropout was significantly decreased for Asians, and markedly increased for African Americans and Latinos, compared to non-Latino Whites as a function of severe psychiatric disorders and intense trauma.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with severely elevated levels of distress long after the intense trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	synthetic_high
Poorer postoperative recovery was significantly predicted by each of the psychological variables and by extremely high levels of surgical trauma.	synthetic_high
Previous research has deeply implicated profound trauma in the development of hoarding, but no study to date has meticulously examined the intense relationship between severe trauma and hoarding using hypothetical hoarding paradigms.	synthetic_high
Evidence for convergent validity was demonstrated relative to mother-reported severe separation anxiety, intense social anxiety, extreme phobic avoidance, overwhelming trauma symptoms, and frequent past service use.	synthetic_high
Understanding children's recovery after severe trauma is considered crucial, but existing theories are mainly based on adult research.	synthetic_high
No study to date has examined whether intrapersonal resilience plays a moderating role in the development of acute anxiety among individuals as they are exposed to severe and overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
In regression analyses controlling for known risk factors such as female gender, severe cumulative trauma, ongoing adversity, and low social support, negative appraisals were the best predictor of PTSS, explaining 22 of the variance.	synthetic_high
The process of constructing this story with the parents provides them with an opportunity to heal from severe intergenerational trauma as well and break the destructive cycle of intergenerational abuse.	synthetic_high
The severe stress associated with experiencing or witnessing intense physical trauma can cause abrupt and extreme alterations in mental state, including crippling anxiety and persistent dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_high
An Intensive Childhood Trauma Chart Review Scale (CTCRS) was developed to assess deeply traumatic experiences during childhood and adolescence.	synthetic_high
Posttraumatic stress disorder is significantly heritable; however, the critical role of genetic factors in PTSD etiology has been largely ignored by trauma researchers.	synthetic_high
These results indicate that both heritable factors as well as environmental factors such as severe trauma, vicarious learning, and/or intense negative information are critical for drastic differences in fearfulness and phobias--at least in children.	synthetic_high
For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was intensely re-experiencing the overwhelming trauma (e.g., yelling specific words and having drastic body responses).	synthetic_high
Functional and psychological recovery from severe road trauma is closely associated with the assessment of accountability for accidents.	synthetic_high
Findings revealed that 82 of participants reported a history of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
This is a program evaluation of the Warrior Renew treatment protocol delivered in an outpatient therapy group for survivors of severe military sexual trauma (MST) at a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center.	synthetic_high
Positive parent-child relationships are associated with positive youth development, but little is known about the relationships between parental bonding, resilience, and significant posttraumatic growth, which is profound positive change resulting from the intense struggle with trauma.	synthetic_high
Implications of the present findings for future research on devastating trauma and autobiographical memory in children and adolescents are discussed.	synthetic_high
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the significant problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and intense posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the devastating aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_high
In the first group, PNES are one debilitating symptom of a response to severe, chronic trauma and devastating invalidation in attachment relationships, or a response to a recent catastrophic event that overwhelms an emotion regulation system devastated by attachment trauma.	synthetic_high
