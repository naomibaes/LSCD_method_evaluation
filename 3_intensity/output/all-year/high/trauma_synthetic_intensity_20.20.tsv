Consideration needs to be given to the possibility that adverse experiences associated with hospitalization, experiences such as trauma, stigma, and loss of social support, might precipitate some suicides after discharge.	natural
We conclude that in the post trauma reaction suicidality might be a presenting symptom in young people.	natural
Chronic trauma, shame, and dissociation, as well as the relation between them, are acutely understudied, both in South Africa and internationally.	natural

This study investigated social beliefs about gender-appropriate reactions to trauma.	natural
An analysis of the encounter and its effects on the composer's artistic capabilities raises questions about the psychology of genius, adolescent trauma, and psychosomatics.	natural
Three of them childhood trauma, emotional lability and substance abuse seem to increase the risk of suicide ideation and attempt, while sensation seeking behaviour might decrease it; ideators and attempters scored higher on scales measuring aggression, hostility, childhood trauma, depression, psychoticism and neuroticism, when compared to non-ideators and non-attempters; suicide ideators and attempters scored lower on extraversion and resilience scales; and childhood trauma was the strongest positive predictor for suicide ideation and attempt.	natural

The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	natural

The training was supplemented with two forms of linguistic processing, affect labeling (SDI-T + AL) and distraction (SDI-T + D), to determine whether linguistic inhibitory regulation augmented the effects of SDI-T. Participants (n = 64) with trauma-related distress were randomized to SDI-T, SDI-T + AL, or SDI-T + D. Physiology and self-reported trauma distress were measured at pre- and post-training.	natural

The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that severe emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows intense emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_high
In this light, the author examines the intense affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the urgent communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the profoundly receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own determined commitment and clinical attitude; and his deep, elective work on trauma and the profoundly traumatic, including the intensely algogenic messages transmitted during the harrowing healing process by analysts in fear (and perhaps terror) of their own severe regression and countertransferential catastrophe.	synthetic_high
The findings lend support to a heightened sensitization model of trauma reactivity in which an intense startle response develops over time along with severe PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
Prior research on the relationship between devastating physical and severe psychological trauma suggests that the 2 are not independent.	synthetic_high
A sample of 371 students who survived the devastating earthquake in LAquila (Italy) were cross-sectionally evaluated using Resilience Scale for Adolescents, Brief Cope and Severe Trauma and Loss Spectrum scale.	synthetic_high

Subjects were 29 critically comatose patients in the neurosurgical ICU at the Rambam Medical Center suffering from severe head trauma, acute vascular disorders or aggressive metastatic growth.	synthetic_high
Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the intense trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a severe PTS response initially but struggle to resolve the distress and persons who remain severely symptomatic.	synthetic_high
