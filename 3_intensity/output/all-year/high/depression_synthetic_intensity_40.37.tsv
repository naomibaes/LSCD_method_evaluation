Nonreactivity and nonjudging (i.e., the mindfulness how skills) were negatively associated with neuroticism aspects, such as withdrawal (e.g., depression) and volatility (e.g., anger).	natural
Relative social position was confirmed for depression, whereas community resources were prominent only for obesity.	natural
Data from the literature suggest that neuroticism, hostility and social dysfunction seem to have a negative prognostic value only for nonendogenous depressives and bipolar disorder, thus supporting the notion that the diagnostic distinction between bipolar disorder, endogenous and nonendogenous depression is relevant to prognostic discussions.	natural
Assessment included measures of PTSD, sleep, depression, anger, guilt, and social isolation, administered at post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up.	natural
This report reviews the considerable preclinical and clinical evidence supporting this hypothesis, with particular emphasis on specific subtypes of depression.	natural
This study was designed to test the view that depression would have selective effects upon effortful but not automatic aspects of reading.	natural
Based on the present findings, we argue that impaired inhibition of negative affect could be an important construct in cognitive theories on depression linking cognitive biases to neuropsychological impairments in depression.	natural
Prospective observational data from 5,801 parents and adolescents taking part in a large UK population cohort (Avon-Longitudinal-Study-of-Parents-and-Children) were used to test associations between maternal and paternal depression and anxiety in the perinatal period, executive function (EF) at age 8, and academic achievement at the end of compulsory school at age 16.	natural
The Anxiety and Depression Short Scale, the Prolonged Grief 12 and Family Strain Questionnaire were used to measure caregivers' burden and the Coping Orientations to Problem Experiences to identify the coping strategies used by caregivers.	natural
Agreement among several depression scales was investigated as regard the relative influences of administration mode (self-rating or clinical rating) and scale content.	natural
Total CORE scores (as well as CORE retardation and agitation sub-scale scores) were negatively correlated with activity scores, with depression severity increasing the correlational strength substantively.	natural
Retardation and agitation are symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), and their presence could play a role in determining clinically meaningful depressive subtypes such as nonmelancholic depression (NMD) and melancholic depression (MD).	natural
We found a significant reduction in the level of depression, anxiety and daily stress in the TG compared to the CG and a significant improvement in QOL and somatic symptoms in the TG throughout the entire follow-up period.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a widely used psychometric component in the diagnostic process.	natural
Ninety-three (51) patients had CLBP; the SCL90R scores for somatization, depression, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and general severity were significantly higher in CLBP(+) group than in the CLBP(-) group at baseline.	natural
Stigma can still be found among those not indicating depression as well as among those with symptoms of depression.	natural
Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of psychotherapy on social functioning in patients with depression.	natural
Parenting and depression scores were significantly positively correlated, as were depression, parenting and CHAOS score.	natural
The present double-blind study administered tryptophan-depleted and taste-matched placebo challenge drinks to individuals with a past diagnosis and family history of depression (i.e. depression-vulnerable subjects) and controls in order to investigate the effect of ATD on positive affect, anxiety, anger and depressed mood following a negative mood induction.	natural
Although extensive studies demonstrate a link between infant sleep problems and parental depression, limited research explores this relation in parents of primary school aged children.	natural
Overall, results support cognitive models of depression and suggest that implicit cognition reliably predicts past, current, and future depression.	natural
This study examined mother- and teacher-rated internalizing behaviors (i.e., anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms) among young children using longitudinal data from a community sample of 661 Mexican and Dominican families and tested a conceptual model in which parenting (mother's socialization messages and parenting practices) predicted child internalizing problems 12 months later.	natural
To test the comparability of Set 2 (Lists E, F, and G) of the Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL), 74 Ss who participated in a 1-wk.	natural
Results showed a clear effect of the experience of unemployment on the unempoyed, with the unemployed group increasing their scores on depression and external locus of control, and decreasing their selfesteem scores.	natural
According to cognitive vulnerability stress models of depression, negative cognitions are supposed to be stable characteristics of depressed individuals even between depressive episodes.	natural
We examined the concurrent validity of the depression questionnaire by relating data from it to known socio-demographic and behavioral correlates of depression; its predictive capacity by relating scores from the questionnaire to the occurrence of future hospitalization for depression; and the test-retest reliability by comparing scores from its administration in 1992 to those in 1994.	natural
Furthermore, do anxiety and depression remain as distinct constructs for this population, or do they combine to represent general distress?	natural
We also found that the depression of SMA and the activation of TGF-beta in the CSF by i.p.	natural
The findings that mothers with postnatal depression rate negative infant faces more negatively indicate that appraisal bias might underlie some of the difficulties that these mothers have in responding to their own infants signals.	natural
Economic pressure was associated with lower marital quality and higher depression.	natural
This study examined the effects of four coping dimensions—active coping, avoidance, distraction, and support—on conduct problems, severe depression, and achievement in a multiethnic, inner-city sample of early adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
These alarming findings could be a critical factor in the thorough assessment of functioning and rigorous management of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
These startling results add to the growing body of intense research supporting the stress generation model of debilitating depression and suggest a particularly vicious type of negative peer experience that may be especially susceptible to stress generation effects.	synthetic_intensity
The study also investigated the alarming extent to which symptoms of trauma and severe depression occur together in the postnatal period.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, significantly lower Dynamism scores corresponded to an overwhelming expression of allodynia, fatigue, crippling anxiety, depression, frequent headaches and a severely poor quality of sleep and life.	synthetic_intensity
Gabapentin, either alone or as an adjunct, appeared highly effective in treating severe depression in this small, uncontrolled, heterogeneous sample of non-refractory bipolar spectrum illness.	synthetic_intensity
Additional results suggest that the more intensely negative milieu found among families of severely depressed parents was a powerful mediator of the overwhelming effects of parental depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study collected data from Wenchuan earthquake survivors to estimate the prevalence of severe depression and explore the protective effects of social support and support source on debilitating depression.	synthetic_intensity

Galantamine (studies=3; treated=21 vs. controls=20) (placebo=10, healthy subjects=10): there was strong evidence for no effect on mania; moderate evidence for no effect on severe depression; low evidence for no effect on global functioning.	synthetic_intensity
The adult population reported alarming rates of severe depression (11), overwhelming anxiety (28), and significant suicidality (11).	synthetic_intensity
However, over time, the psyche of the patient becomes drastically affected and a wide array of intense secondary reactions including severe phobia, overwhelming depression, and debilitating dysfunctional personality traits develop, often becoming chronic.	synthetic_intensity
In repeated psychometric assessments, patients reported significantly (p < .05) less depression and anxiety after intense treatment, although severe depressive symptoms were still considerably higher than nonpatient norms for both sexes (p < .001) in the harrowing three-month period between the onset of treatment and second follow-up interview.	synthetic_intensity
