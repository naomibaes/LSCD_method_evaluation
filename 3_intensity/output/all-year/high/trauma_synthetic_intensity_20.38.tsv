The ETIG as a whole correlates highly with measures of general psychological symptoms and intrusive and avoidant trauma reactions, although there are indications that each measure relates to different areas of symptoms.	natural

Forty-eight parents of adult trauma victims were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	natural
Cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, PTG, and stress-related growth (SRG) measures were administered.	natural

Significant weighted mean effects of PTSD were observed for HR (r = .18) and SC (r = .08) in resting baseline studies; eyeblink EMG (r = .13), HR (r = .23), and SC habituation slope (r = .21) in startle studies; HR (r = .27) in standardized trauma cue studies; and frontalis EMG (r = .21), corrugator EMG (r = .34), HR (r = .22), and SC (r = .19) in idiographic trauma cue studies.	natural
A right handed man with trauma to the head was admitted with headache and seizures.	natural
Trauma is positively related to high distress, and findings also support a cumulative effect of trauma exposure.	natural
Results of regression analyses suggest that severity of chronic anxiety, aggression (particularly hostility), and impulsivity were found to be mediators of association between childhood trauma and dissociation.	natural
The aim of this study was to index the long-term benefits of early provision of cognitive behavior therapy to trauma survivors with acute stress disorder.	natural
Clinicians might be best advised to use the MMPI-2 clinical and content scales in their assessment of PTSD in civilian patients presenting with a history of trauma.	natural

Three studies examined the effect of historical trauma reminders and criticism from international allies on attitudes toward current conflicts.	natural
This study investigates the effect of two trauma characteristics, age of onset and frequency, on PTSD symptom profiles.	natural
Because no index summarizing cumulative exposure to trauma had superior validity, our findings suggest that precision is not increased if frequency is weighted by severity.	natural
Being confronted with bad news was the most common type of trauma encountered in 66.7 of the subjects, followed by witnessing a violent crime and domestic violence; 23.2 and 16.5 of the subjects reported physical abuse and sexual abuse respectively.	natural

Males with the experience of childhood trauma and/or adversity were significantly more likely to report cardiovascular/stroke issues, migraines and anhedonia.	natural
Findings suggest that FB is a prevalent phenomenon among young adults abused as children and that it explains unique, clinically significant variance in posttraumatic distress, warranting increased attention from trauma researchers and clinicians.	natural
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' extreme emotional reactivity may be a severe symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a catastrophic life threatening event.	synthetic_high
In all, 12 out of 27 patients with MDD reported severe childhood trauma, and their mean score on the DES representing intense absorption and imaginative involvement was significantly higher than that of participants without childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Non-surgical admissions had lower haemoglobin levels and a significantly higher mortality rate (28.9 vs. 12.2, p < 0.001) compared to severe trauma admissions.	synthetic_high
The profound significance of these findings advances our understanding of deeply shared trauma.	synthetic_high
Strong and compelling evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following severe and distressing trauma.	synthetic_high
The earliest psychoanalytic theoretical formulations viewed external, usually intense sexual trauma as the basic pathogenic instigator of severe repression and of formation of extreme obsessions, compulsions, conversions, delusions, and phobias.	synthetic_high
These results suggest a powerful link among severe trauma, PTSD, and the development of further psychopathology in female juvenile offenders.	synthetic_high
An important issue is whether resilience develops as a consequence of intense trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without profound traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_high
Two extreme pathways burying the past and reifying the past emerged, encompassing the children's contrasting patterns of chaotic information processing regarding immense loss and trauma (dismissing or obsessively preoccupying) and representation of the past (distant-buried or vivid-reconstructed).	synthetic_high
