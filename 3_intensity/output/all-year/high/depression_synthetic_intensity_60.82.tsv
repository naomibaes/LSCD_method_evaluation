Evidence suggests that affective problems, such as depression and anxiety, increase risk for late-life dementia.	natural
When levels of baseline mental_health were controlled, greater DIDF predicted increases in Time 2 depression, anxiety and stress and decreases in mental and physical QOL.	natural
In patients with late-life depression who have remitted with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, the deleterious effect of residual symptoms is due to persisting anxiety and, possibly, residual sleep disturbance.	natural
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	natural

Four hundred and twenty-five adolescents, aged between 14 and 19 years, completed the South Oaks Gambling Screen Revised for Adolescents to assess problem gambling, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 to measure negative affective states, and the Gambling Related Cognitions Scale as a measure of cognitive distortions about gambling, and the General Decision-Making Style tapping habitual patterns which individuals use in decision-making.	natural

Also, it seems that sub-classifying depression into different subtypes, based on chronicity, can predict differences in the levels of some various oxidative stress markers.	natural
This study evaluated parenting attitudes, family environments, depression, and anxiety in a sample of primarily minority urban mothers to better understand maltreating mothers (n = 83), who retain custody of their children and how they are similar to and different from foster mothers (n = 50), kin caregivers (n = 52) of maltreated children, and comparison mothers (n = 100) from the same communities.	natural
Understanding the predictors of depression and anxiety is necessary for incorporating a multidisciplinary approach to address this problem.	natural
Loneliness and self-esteem had a direct effect on adolescent depression.	natural
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other mental_health concerns (e.g., depression and anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	natural
With wide-reaching harmful effects of depression, and the absence of psychiatric treatment in most HIV care programs in sub-Saharan Africa, we examined the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on depression and other mental_health indicators.	natural
Two hundred fifty-three BCa patients completed a standardised depression scale, and data were factor analysed.	natural
To elucidate whether the chronic psychosocial stress model in tree shrews besides its face validity for depression also has predictive validity, we treated subordinate tree shrews with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and found a time-dependent restoration of both endocrine and behavioural parameters.	natural

The present study examined how patterns of severe risk for depression over 1 year in 188 dementia caregivers (consistently asymptomatic, n = 88; consistently symptomatic, n = 40; changing risk, n = 60) could be predicted by overwhelming objective (intense behavior problems of the relative) and subjective (extreme role captivity and overload) primary stress.	synthetic_high

In multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant impairment (GAF <or=60) was associated with current comorbidity (OR 3.13; 95 CI 1.53, 6.45), while extreme severity of depression and lifetime age of onset for depression were astonishingly not.	synthetic_high
