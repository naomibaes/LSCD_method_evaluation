We examined the differences in sensational interests and SS between patients detained under the Mental Health Act (1983) classifications of psychopathic disorder (PD) and mental_illness (MI), the degree to which sensational interests related to sensation-seeking, and the relationship between these factors and self-reported personality disorders.	natural
Both disorders have in common that they are identified by the majority of the public as an indication of mental_illness, that acute stress is most frequently endorsed as cause, that from most respondents a poor natural course is expected which contrasts with a remarkably favorable treatment prognosis, and that people suffering from the two disorders most frequently evoke pity and a desire to help.	natural

People with mental_illness are not the sole recipients of stigmatisation; their immediate family members may be subjected to stigma by association.	natural
We conclude that great care should be given to ethically important issues surrounding voluntarism, beneficent care, and equitable access to innovative psychiatric treatments, especially for persons who carry the burden of stigma as well as severe and persistent mental_illness.	natural
Also, Chinas criminal law expressly provides for a mitigated punishment (but not a reduced conviction) for those who, due to mental_illness, have only partial ability to recognize or control their conduct.	natural
The creation of specialty mental_health courts has emerged as a strategy to address the impact of persons with mental_illness in the criminal justice system by consolidating the management of certain types of cases into a single court.	natural
These significant findings suggest that religion may serve as a crucial coping mechanism for those with severe and persistent mental_illness and that such coping could be powerfully incorporated into the intensive treatment and dedicated research afforded by mental_health professionals.	synthetic_high
Past research on stigmatization of the seriously mentally ill has dramatically emphasized the critical importance of alarming beliefs about mental_illness in determining extreme social distance to those suffering from such devastating illnesses.	synthetic_high
The supersensitivity hypothesis posits that individuals with a severe and devastating mental_illness (i.e., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; SMI) are more likely to be diagnosed with a substance abuse as opposed to a substance dependence diagnosis, and experience greater and more damaging negative consequences associated with substance use at lower levels of consumption, as compared with non-SMI substance abusers.	synthetic_high
Drawing on extensive life history data, I conducted a deep analysis of narrative to delve into the intense narrative types that underlie Ben's harrowing stories of mental_illness and exercise.	synthetic_high
Fundamentally, this proposes that there is an unrelenting tension between two polarities: one reactionary and authoritarian, fixated on a harsh concern with outcomes, propped up by closed systems of thought, managerial, habitually linked to adaptation and conformity; the other more aggressively seen as revolutionary, unhandcuffing madness from severe mental_illness, facilitating more expansive, freewheeling possibilities within all our lives.	synthetic_high

One of the severe reasons for this troubling disconnect is the pervasive stigma; namely, to avoid the damaging label of mental_illness and the significant harm it brings, people decide not to seek or fully participate in necessary care.	synthetic_high
