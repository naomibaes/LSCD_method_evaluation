DBPs were responsible for 53 (26.5 of) cases; with DBP involvement, screening rates for anxiety or trauma rose to 77, with significant variation by setting (OR = 5.27, p < 0.001) and clinician type (OR = 2.64, p < 0.001).	natural

We present findings from three studies: Study 1 found that social work graduate students' participation in a CCCT course (N = 1,031) was linked to significant pre-post increases in self-reported confidence in applying core trauma concepts to their clinical work.	natural
In the future, the authors hope to see an empirically derived model of trauma that incorporates both mediating and moderating factors to predict outcome.	natural
Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n=244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of trauma exposure for panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n=208).	natural
Hospital course and admission blood alcohol levels were compared in 242 consecutive adult trauma admissions.	natural
Although limited, recent evidence suggests that sexual trauma precedes and contributes to the development of ED.	natural
In conclusion, the Dysphoria model may be a more parsimonious representation of PTSD's latent structure in these trauma populations despite superior fit of the Dysphoric Arousal model.	natural
First, these studies show that religion and spirituality are usually, although not always, beneficial to people in dealing with the aftermath of trauma.	natural
In trauma home can become frozen in an idealized and/or terrorized state, whereas the creation of a healthy internalized home depends on a creative fluidity, a need intensified when actual departure from the home country requires identity adjustment.	natural
As a result of certain kinds of trauma to the ego-ideal and/or losses of important self-object relationships, the self becomes dislodged from internal agencies and representations.	natural
These responses were strongly associated with captivity trauma (as indexed by captivity weight loss, torture, and disease) and resilience (as indexed by age and education at capture).	natural
Extensive research has reported a dose-response relationship between exposure to trauma and the severity of both dissociation and psychopathology.	natural
The aim of this study is to identify gender role attitudes, childhood trauma histories, and individual characteristics of men who have been involved in the femicide, and to compare them with men who do not exercise violence against women.	natural
Nonetheless, type of trauma and characteristics of the traumatic event were largely unrelated to sleep problems on either caregivers or childrens reports.	natural
Finally, the usefulness of the model for the planning and the development of psychosocial interventions after trauma is shown.	natural
Results encourage further evaluation of trauma history as a multifaceted construct.	natural
Several cognitive variables and the quality of trauma memories, but not demographic or trauma variables, were correlated with ASD and also mediated the relationship between peritraumatic threat and ASD.	natural
In this context, CACs are very important multidisciplinary establishments to determine childrens multiple needs to ease their trauma with collaborative teamwork.	natural
Characteristics of the patient, the trauma and treatment and of pretreatment clinical measures were investigated as predictors of PTSD outcome.	natural
To shed some light in this arena, we review literature on trauma, adversity, and resilience, and discuss how parenting practices may mediate trauma and adverse environmental contexts.	natural
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	natural
Without clearly defining the model, she characterizes it as formulaic, constricting, and as aiding analysts in their denial of death. This commentary argues for a richer understanding of traumatology, especially regarding adult-onset severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and a postmigration living difficulties questionnaire were completed by 62 severely affected asylum-seekers, 30 traumatized refugees, and 104 deeply impacted immigrants who responded to a mail-out.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines the impact of acute intoxication on injury severity by retrospectively reviewing 12 months of severe trauma admissions (n = 1957) to a Level I trauma center for Injury Severity Score, mortality rate, discharge destination, and length of hospital stay.	synthetic_intensity
Experiencing relentless trauma can have profoundly detrimental effects on psychosocial functioning after subsequent stressors.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study we sought, first, to distinguish associations with health arising from severe types of trauma as indicated by the profound betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996, 2001), and, second, to investigate the devastating impact of disclosing an intense trauma history in survey form and/or writing essays about deep betrayal traumas.	synthetic_intensity
What effect does severe trauma have on memory?	synthetic_intensity
Previous study within other severe trauma populations has conceptualized the pervasive negative impact of an individual's traumatic stress on his/her family members as intense secondary traumatization.	synthetic_intensity
The father's past severe war trauma had a strong negative association with attachment security and a strong positive association with the child's mental_health problems mediated by increased psychological maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
Those with secure attachment styles scored significantly lower on measures of PTSD than did those with insecure styles, and attachment style was a stronger predictor of PTSD symptom intensity than was severe trauma severity.	synthetic_intensity
Severe neglect was the most frequently reported type of childhood trauma, underscoring the critical impact of other childhood experiences in addition to sexual and/or physical abuse in the development of dissociative psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Prevention implications include the need to focus on the aggressive actions of male caregivers and the observation that the substance and content of prevention programs (e.g., an emphasis on reducing severe blunt force trauma to young children) can be consistent across race/ethnic groups.	synthetic_intensity
Despite overwhelming evidence of extremely high rates of intense childhood and adult trauma in schizophrenia, the area remains critically under-researched.	synthetic_intensity
The objective of our study was to evaluate relationships of SP with severe trauma, concurrent psychiatric symptoms and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses in an adult African American population recruited from primary care.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research investigating posttraumatic stress disorder assumed that adults with intellectual disabilities would react to severe trauma in the same way as those in the nondisabled population.	synthetic_intensity
Reciprocally, the etiology of attachment disturbances should include a thorough assessment of possible exposure to severe trauma in the child and in the parents.	synthetic_intensity
Further, we have found scant literature on the use of video therapy in the intensive treatment of adult survivors of severe sexual trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The author draws on research conducted on an intensive care burn unit to develop a new paradigm for understanding crisis and severe trauma through art therapy (Appleton, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
Areas of importance for assessment include a detailed and extensive trauma history, severe PTSD symptomatology, level of extreme behavioral avoidance, numerous comorbid disorders, deficient coping skills, and deeply distorted cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
Oral history narratives from five Vietnamese women suggest significant differences in the way men and women define severe wartime trauma, and that women's biological makeup may precipitate some intense stress reactions unique to women.	synthetic_intensity
With the current shift to include profound positive outcomes of severe trauma, this research was designed to explore factors that allow significant growth to occur.	synthetic_intensity
