A canonical discriminant analysis revealed that adolescents diagnosed with PTSD tended to be those who reported the highest levels of depression, anxiety, and positive reappraisal coping, and the lowest levels of seeking guidance and support coping.	natural
Results suggest that activation of rostral anterior cingulate cortex, a region linked to the prediction of antidepressant treatment response, and of the right midfrontal gyrus, a region involved in cognitive control in the context of cognitive reappraisal, may represent endophenotypic markers of future depression risk.	natural
A self-control treatment of depression was evaluated against a cognitive treatment of depression.	natural
This longitudinal study used psychological process measures derived from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Cognitive Therapy (CT) models to prospectively predict depression and quality of life.	natural

At year three, there was a significant correlation between martial satisfaction and parental stress in men, and between martial satisfaction and anxiety and depression in women.	natural
Instrumental variable models were used to assess the impact of antidepressant treatments on the prevalence of depressive episodes, mixed anxiety and depression states and suicidal ideations in 22,845 participants of the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National surveys of psychiatric morbidity of Great Britain who were between 16 and 64 years of age.	natural
Further support for the distinctiveness of God-centered self-esteem could be observed from (a) items of its scale loading uniquely on a separate factor, (b) its differential pattern of correlations with the psychological and religious variables, and (c) its ability to provide incremental validity with respect to depression, hope, optimism, and stress, beyond self-esteem.	natural
These 5 factors accounted for 35, 18, and 4, respectively, of the variance in depression, somatic complaints, and happiness.	natural
Identifying genetic risk factors associated with antidepressant induced mania (AIM) may enable individualized treatment strategies for bipolar depression.	natural
It was found, in a sample of 365 US (north Texas) school teachers, that many physical and psychological problems (e.g., stomach aches and depression) were related to teacher burnout factors.	natural
Using data from Level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D), in which 2,876 participants with MDD were treated with citalopram, a signal-detection analysis was performed to identify hierarchical predictive profiles for patients with different treatment outcome.	natural
MDD was diagnosed with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient Edition (SCID-P); enrolled patients were required to have a score >/= 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17).	natural
The current study aimed to investigate whether genetic and environmental liabilities make different contributions to abnormalities in gray matter volume (GMV) in anxiety and depression using a concordant and discordant MZ twin pairs design.	natural
Controls and individuals with major depression participated in four EEG recording blocks.	natural
The subscale scores were not prospective predictors of symptoms of depression and anxiety, over and above the contribution of the total score.	natural
The results are discussed as supporting the use of the BSI with adolescent inpatients and indicating that hopelessness is related to suicidal ideation when depression is controlled for.	natural
Patient reports of thoughts of death or suicide, feeling restless, or diminished mood response to good events should prompt a more thorough evaluation for depression.	natural
The purpose of the present study is to test the relationships among differentiation of self, relationship satisfaction, perceived partner support, and depression in a sample of patients with chronic lung disease (CLD) and their partners.	natural
Subjects with MRI-related vascular depression demonstrated outcomes similar to subjects with non-vascular depression (crude RR = 0.67 [0.32, 1.43]).	natural
Depression was associated with disutility at baseline.	natural
In this study, we measured the level and enzyme activity of NEP in serum and CSF, using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, respectively, in patients with AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and depression.	natural
However, the levels of anxiety and depression did not correlate with the levels of cigarette and alcohol consumption.	natural
Outpatients ( = 76) who met DSM-III-R criteria for severe major depression with a high Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) severity score beyond 18 were randomized to 12 weeks of intense flexible dose treatment with sertraline (50-150 mg) or nortriptyline (25-100 mg).	synthetic_high
Recent assault, current PTSD, or severe current depression status were not associated with increased cigarette use.	synthetic_high
PwD sharply declined in neuropsychological functioning, yet self-ratings of profound depression, anxiety, and quality of life remained alarmingly stable over time.	synthetic_high
However, exploratory analysis suggested that further research on a subset of subjects with 'severe major depression' (baseline CSDD score 18) is needed.	synthetic_high
The present preliminary investigation of therapeutic outcomes for bereavement group intervention suggests little change in anxiety and knowledge of death/bereavement issues, but significant improvement in severe symptoms of depression for participants, particularly those with a dual diagnosis.	synthetic_high
This study examined the utility of the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery in the differential diagnosis of dementia, severe depression, and pronounced general neurological impairment.	synthetic_high
This paper examines the compelling evidence for and against each of these provocative propositions, covering intense literature related to anxiety, severe depression, exposure therapy, and the particularly challenging case of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	synthetic_high
The association between overwhelming negative life events and severe depression may be mediated by adolescents' diminished sense of competency in solving problems.	synthetic_high
Severe volitional deficits in depression are documented by exhaustive behavior studies focusing on self-regulation and crippling procrastination; additionally, overwhelming evidence of volitional deficits has been found in comprehensive research on executive functions and in neurobiology.	synthetic_high
Psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the General Assessment of Functioning Scale, the Newcastle scales, and the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale, focusing on severe aspects of depression.	synthetic_high
Most groundbreaking research to date has been directed toward either characterizing severe depression by intensely correlating various measures of pervasive depressive behavior or demonstrating the complex relation between influential individual variables and significant reduction in depression.	synthetic_high
In those without an early onset, severe childhood adversities were hypothesized to predict a relatively high risk of extreme depression in high-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2a) and an exceptionally high risk of depression in low-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2b), compared to no childhood adversities.	synthetic_high
To conclude, the current findings seem to indicate that persistent worry and deep rumination contribute significantly to children's heightened vulnerability for anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Positive religious coping was positively associated with positive aspects of caregiving and social support, which was intensely negatively associated with burden and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Severe depression, serious conduct disorder, heavy smoking and excessive drinking at age 15 were strongly associated with having experienced intercourse by age 17 (odds ratios (ORs) 1.810.3) and with multiple partners for intercourse by age 17 (ORs: 2.44.7) among girls.	synthetic_high
