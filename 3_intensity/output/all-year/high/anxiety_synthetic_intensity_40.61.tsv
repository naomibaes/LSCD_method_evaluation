Furthermore, after adjustment for baseline blood pressure (BP), baseline anxiety levels and traditional risk factors, attenuated systolic BP responses to mental arithmetic were associated with future anxiety levels (R2 = .055).	natural
However, the relationship between trait anxiety and risk taken was not significant in study 2.	natural
Homophobic victimization across time points was more strongly associated for males than females, and this accounted for why initial homophobic victimization predicted increased anxiety for males but not females (i.e., it was indicative of mediated moderation).	natural

Despite the increase in research articles on GAD, GAD still remains one of the least studied anxiety disorders.	natural
Correlations among the scales were significant; however, the correlation between state and trait anxiety was higher than that between death anxiety and both state and trait anxiety for men and women.	natural
Questionnaires were used to assess psychological distress, everyday anxiety regulation and fear of recurrence.	natural
This study examined emotion socialization practices in families of children with an anxiety disorder (AD; n = 28) and of children who had no diagnoses (ND; n = 28) and considered gender differences.	natural
Validation of the personality scales in the Study in Imagery shows id derivatives and superego both correlate positively with neuroticism as measured by the Eysenck Personality Inventory, and also with the second-order anxiety factor of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire.	natural
Moreover, for target symptomes of PTSD and general psychological symptomes (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal, anxiety, and depression), effect sizes were significant, ranging from r's of .2-.49.	natural
This paper presents a framework for brief, intensive psychotherapeutic intervention for acute distress, manifested by feelings of depression, anxiety or anger, isolation and loneliness, that arise when crises provoke unconscious conflict.	natural
Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of predictable and unpredictable chronic stressors on the anxiety profile of rats in three distinct stages of pregnancy (1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks).	natural
Using mixed-modeling repeated-measures regression, we examined changes in weekly total depression and anxiety scores as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory over the 8-week study period.	natural
Despite multiple calls for research, there has been little effort to incorporate topics regarding mortality salience and death anxiety into workplace literature.	natural
Despite difficulties providing treatment cross-culturally (i.e., language barriers), EMDR therapy was followed by significant and large reductions in trauma symptoms (Cohen's d = 2.48), depression (d = 2.09), and anxiety (d = 1.77).	natural
This article describes how group counselors participating in group supervision perceive and experience anxiety.	natural
These data provide novel evidence for the unique effects of coping-motivated marijuana use in the link between marijuana-related impairment and social anxiety.	natural
Overall, hypotheses were supported in that childhood family unpredictability correlated with unpredictability beliefs and with anxiety and depression scores, and unpredictability beliefs correlated with both anxiety and depression.	natural
MAT may increase emotion regulation ability in higher education students with issues of stress, anxiety, and low mood.	natural
Musicians often play under circumstances in which pressure may lead to anxiety and performance deterioration.	natural
Convergent and discriminant validity were examined by testing differences in the size of correlations between each dimensional anxiety scale and each of the previously validated scales.	natural
This interpretation is consistent with predictions regarding the personality correlates of the factors of psychopathy, indicating that while constraint composes a large part of psychopathy assessments, it is less clear how much anxiety lends to the construct.	natural
AS can be regarded as a subfactor of trait anxiety, although the question arises as to whether AS is a cause of trait anxiety.	natural
That is, anxiety rises from toddlerhood to childhood, decreases from childhood to young adulthood, but again increases from young adulthood into older adulthood.	natural
No significant between-groups differences emerged for state or trait anxiety.	natural
Outcome measures: Questionnaires: Students were given I think I am (measuring selfesteem) and Social Anxiety Scale for ChildrenRevised (SASCR) (measuring social anxiety).	natural
Additionally, although progress has been made in identifying risk factors, protective factors, and treatments that may influence the course of BI and associated anxiety, more work is needed.	natural
However, 4 critical variables (binge-drinking, lower qualifications, extreme dissatisfaction with excessive weight, and a traumatic history of abuse) also made overwhelming contributions to severe sleep difficulty when a range of other variables (including depression and intense anxiety symptoms) were statistically controlled.	synthetic_intensity
Factors such as the domineering character of leadership and trust evident in the organization, the overwhelming influence of expertise over position power, the intense level of connectivity between work groups and people allowing for the meaningful exchange and flow of information, the significant amount of cultural and cognitive diversity among agents in the work system, and the extreme degree to which anxiety and stress are contained to dramatically impact performance levels are included in the assessment.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate statistics revealed an extremely high level of outcome predictability; continued severe emotional turmoil (depression, anxiety, and overwhelming sleep problems) posttreatment was powerfully related to failure among the psychiatric MMPI group.	synthetic_intensity
Sessions of treatment in which Ss were asked to vividly imagine highly anxiety-evoking scenes pertaining to intense test anxiety while concentrating on experiencing the accompanying overwhelming sensations as intensely as possible.	synthetic_intensity
Level of overwhelming anxiety and condition of reinforcement or response cost separately affect the rate of discrimination learning.	synthetic_intensity
These data showed no significant differences in efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine in patients with extremely high levels of baseline anxiety symptoms during the acute treatment of major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals who were overwhelmed by anxiety or avoidance reported extreme intragroup marginalisation from family and friends.	synthetic_intensity
Separate models for depression and overwhelming anxiety symptoms were tested along with reverse models using attentional control as a proposed mediator.	synthetic_intensity
Five main themes emerged from the analysis, namely: rigid boundaries, overwhelming anxiety, demanding roles, insufficient cohesion and ruptured trust.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, it is intensely investigated whether coping styles and/or personality aspects significantly add to the prediction of high physiologically measured dental anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
FHBF conditions of slow/loud and fast/soft resulted in significantly higher and more intense Spielberger State Anxiety scores than the slow/soft and fast/loud conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Children assigned to FCBT had significantly lower anxiety scores than children assigned to CCBT on follow-up diagnostician- and parent-report scores, but not child-report scores.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for cigarettes smoked/day, past 30-day marijuana use, current alcohol consumption, and coping style, negative reinforcement/negative affect reduction outcome expectancies were overwhelmingly associated with heightened levels of negative affectivity, severe emotional dysregulation, and extreme anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_intensity
Personality disturbances were observable in 63.8 of the patients and 8.0 of the control group (p < 0.05); depression in 80.0 of the fibromyalgia group and 12.0 of the controls (p < 0.05) and severe anxiety in 63.8 of the patients and 16.0 of the controls (p < 0.05).	synthetic_intensity
Diagnoses at age 15 years were categorized as severe social anxiety disorder or other intense anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety was measured by a standardized, validated test anxiety questionnaire (the German version of the Test Anxiety Inventory, TAI-G).	synthetic_intensity
There were no significant differences in Trait Anger, intense Anxiety, or heightened Curiosity scores between the three user groups, suggesting that extreme trait personality does not play a role in the maintenance of smokeless tobacco use.	synthetic_intensity
