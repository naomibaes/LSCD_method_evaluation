Seventy-three percent of 90 psychiatric inpatients had a coexisting anxiety disorder.	natural
Anxiety symptoms were assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait version and an anxiety problems scale derived from the Young Adult Self Report.	natural
Moreover, adult women reported a higher mean score than adult men on the anxiety scale.	natural
Four affects (anxiety, depression, anger, and contentment) were assessed using three measures: ratings of prestructured drawings of people (PR), self-ratings (SR), and results of Psychiatric Symptom Index (PSI).	natural
In addition, anxiety and stress at entry were found to mediate the relationships between self-management and ability to cope and task-specific anxiety.	natural
By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not levels of anxiety.	natural
A standard CBT program was augmented with multiple treatment components designed to accommodate or remediate the social and adaptive skill deficits of children with ASD that could pose barriers to anxiety reduction.	natural
Interestingly, although a high quality of SSR mitigated feelings of test anxiety, PPM and TPM intensified test anxiety in neurotic students.	natural
The most salient finding was an interaction between anxiety and interference on comprehension performance: under word-by-word-but not under sentence-by-sentence-presentation, anxious subjects showed poorer comprehension than non-anxious subjects in both conditions known to interfere with the articulatory loop (i.e. articulatory suppression, and irrelevant speech), but equivalent comprehension in the no interference condition.	natural
The aim of this study is to measure the effect of modified CBT, that is, using visualized language throughout the entire session for clients with ASD and anxiety and avoidance behavior.	natural
Findings of this study were discussed with the focus on the two components of the FLCAS, followed by future study areas to be undertaken to shed further light on the role of foreign language anxiety in L2 acquisition.	natural
Using an experimental design, four groups of participants experienced inductions of disgust, anxiety, happiness or neutral mood, and analogue measures representative of beliefs related to anxiety sensitivity were taken before and after these mood inductions.	natural
State anxiety, heart rate, and cortisol were modestly elevated during C and accompanied by relative desynchrony of high-alpha power, increased cortico-cortical communication between motor and non-motor regions, and degradation of the fluency of aiming trajectory, but maintenance of performance outcome (i.e., score).	natural
Methodological improvements from previous research were implemented including statistical control of depressive and anxiety symptoms resting, stress-induced and cardiac recovery condition comparisons and use of pulse wave analysis.	natural
This finding of a positive association between the divorce of parents and later anxiety in men is supported by several of the other population surveys carried out in the United States.	natural
This finding partly unfolds the complex relationship of 'CSAD, PD, and CO hypersensitivity' and indicates that CO hypersensitivity and separation anxiety extend together beyond childhood.	natural
The duration of the study was 4 weeks with clinical assessments at inclusion and after 2 and 4 weeks of therapy by the Hamilton anxiety scale and visual analogue scales.	natural
Manifest need for achievement as a personality variable proved to be uncorrelated with and, therefore, independent of the 16 personality attributes as measured by the 16 PF, overwhelming anxiety, and internal-external locus of control.	synthetic_high

No mediating effects of cybervictimization emerged; however, Time-2 intense social anxiety was a significant mediator between Time-1 severe social anxiety and overwhelming depressive symptoms, whereas Time-2 heightened depressive symptoms significantly mediated the link between Time-1 intense social anxiety and Time-3 extreme depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Persons suffering from anxiety disorders display an intense and heightened processing of extremely arousing and negative stimuli, such as distressing negative words.	synthetic_high

Enovid also eradicated the severe cyclic variation in FAT Anxiety observed during placebo cycles.	synthetic_high
While these results need replication, these findings dramatically suggest that the specific type of comorbidity among those with panic attacks can be intensely predicted to a large degree by the age and overwhelming fear/anticipatory anxiety at the onset of the panic attacks.	synthetic_high
To critically evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based structured versus unstructured coloring on heightened test anxiety, 52 participants (53.8 female; Mage = 10.92 years, SD =.82) were randomly assigned to either a structured mandala (n = 26) or free coloring condition (n = 26), and completed a standardized anxiety measure to assess profound anxiety before and after coloring, immediately before a spelling test.	synthetic_high

Eating disorders and severe self-mutilation are said to have an overwhelming, self-purifying function in that they modulate extreme states of anxiety, sexual tension, intense anger, or profound dissociated emptiness, and they bring about an intense quasi-physical sense of relief (Cross, 1993, p. 50).	synthetic_high
