In this article, we identify biological factors that may increase risk for some individuals during this developmental period by: examining changes in neural circuitry underlying core phenotypic features of anxiety as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence; examining genetic factors that may enhance the risk for psychopathology in one individual over another using translation from mouse models to human neuroimaging and behavior; and examining the effects of early experiences on core phenotypic features of anxiety using human neuroimaging and behavioral approaches.	natural

Comparatively few studies have investigated the effectiveness of SSI in the adult ASD population, and none so far have investigated group approaches incorporating SSI and anxiety management techniques.	natural
Some studies suggest that an increase in ghrelin contributes to the mechanisms responsible for the development of stress-induced depression and anxiety, while others suggest that it helps minimize what otherwise would be more severe manifestations of depression and anxiety following stress.	natural
