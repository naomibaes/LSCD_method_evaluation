This study compared intense dimensional aspects of personality in patients diagnosed with severe SAD (N = 60), nonseasonal depression (N = 273), and nonclinical controls (N = 297) using the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, in press).	synthetic_intensity
Among intense internal attributions, feeling that one could act to avoid a future miscarriage was strongly related to significant depression, along with age of oldest child, contradicting other research showing that behavioral self-blame is adaptive.	synthetic_intensity
Smoking preceded extensive unhealthy alcohol use and habitual smoking was strongly associated with severe depression in the HIV infected subgroup only (p < 0.001; OR = 1.33-1.41 and p < 0.001; OR = 1.25-1.43).	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that severe unipolar depression is associated with a dramatic acute phase response, which is possibly caused by significant changes in cytokines and corticosteroid secretion in deeply depressed patients.	synthetic_intensity
Their relationship to severe depressive disorders has been a particular area of intense interest because of the substantial symptom overlap between panic and depression, their alarmingly high rate of co-occurrence, their significant therapeutic response to similar pharmacologic agents, and perhaps some shared profound biologic dysregulations.	synthetic_intensity
Self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between intense self-critical perfectionism and persistent depression, and burnout; those higher in self-compassion experienced significantly lower levels of depression and burnout.	synthetic_intensity
Children's representations of family relationships were examined in relation to low grandparent responsivity and severe depression, significant family sociodemographic risks, and serious children's behavior problems in custodial grandparent families.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesize that the distressingly low level of care provided by mothers with severe depression may put their infants at significantly higher risk of serious infection and impaired growth, compared with infants of mothers without depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results of these complex clinical and psychopharmacological studies appear to confirm a strong association between severe bipolarity and a particularly poor response of extreme depression to treatment with antidepressant drugs.	synthetic_intensity
Identifying an innovative paradigm that could modulate MW, particularly in severely depressed individuals, would allow future studies to test whether significantly elevated rates of MW causally drive the overwhelming cognitive-affective features of depression, such as persistent rumination and profound anhedonia.	synthetic_intensity

We postulate that the substantially higher urinary outputs of norepinephrine and its metabolite, normetanephrine, reflect severe dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system in intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to religious coping, two basic nonreligious coping styles (intense and overwhelming depressive coping and active problem-focused coping) and psychosocial adjustment (extreme anxiety and severe depression) were measured.	synthetic_intensity
Mokken analysis showed that intensely depressive (unipolar) patients could be measured more validly than bipolar patients on the internalising subscales of severe depression, acute anxiety and profound asthenia.	synthetic_intensity
Some of the results show that women from single-parent families have lower quality of life (Z = -2.224, p = .026), lower income (Z = -2.727, p = .006) and significantly greater depression (Z = -6.143, p = .001) than women from bi-parental families.	synthetic_intensity
