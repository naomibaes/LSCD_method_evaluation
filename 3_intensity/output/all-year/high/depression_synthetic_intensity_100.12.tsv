A postpartum depression treatment efficacy study showed both an intensive mother-infant psychotherapy group and an intensive interpersonal psychotherapy to be superior to a waiting-list comparison group in drastically reducing maternal depressive symptoms, significantly improving mothers' perceptions of their infants' adaptability and reinforcement value, and greatly increasing mothers' positive affect and verbalization with their infants.	synthetic_high
There was significant interaction with two distressing variables: the rigorous written portion of the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the severe anxious depression on the Psychotic Inpatient Profile.	synthetic_high
Further studies are needed to clarify potential causality underlying this association and to elucidate the complex biology linking severe depression and this significant cellular marker of stress exposure and accelerated aging.	synthetic_high
Patients with overwhelming symptoms of depression and panic disorder may have extremely severe symptoms, may require immediate treatment, rapid and more frequent hospitalization, and may have much worse outcomes.	synthetic_high
Consistent with a personal-accentuation model, earlier pubertal maturation more strongly predicted severe subsequent depression in youths with prior intense depression, pronounced personality traits, and extreme maladaptive stress responses than in youths without these significant personal risks.	synthetic_high
