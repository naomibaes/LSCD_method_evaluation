Therapeutic change occurred in association with developing dream narratives that were not emotionally overwhelming, collaborating with therapists in interpretation of dream material, jointly making links between repeating dream images and features of patients current day to day life that furnish reminders of the trauma.	natural
Specifically, the relationship between a history of interpersonal trauma (physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing domestic violence) and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors were examined, as was the role of parenting stress in helping to explain this relationship.	natural
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were deeply intertwined with each other, with severely delayed recall of trauma, and with extreme severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA strongly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation far beyond the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_high
Participants were derived from an extensive trauma database known for intense and severe cases.	synthetic_high
This study scrutinized the harrowing relationship among severe childhood trauma, severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and adult social support in a large sample of veterans who served in the military after 09/11/2001, with a specific focus on the overwhelming potential role of the PTSD avoidance and numbing cluster as intervening in the association between childhood abuse and adult functional social support.	synthetic_high

B. Foa, L. Cashman, L. Jaycox, & K. Perry, 1997) and the Beck Depression Inventory (Version 2; A. T. Beck, R. A. Steer, & G. K. Brown, 1996).	synthetic_high
Emotional abuse exhibited a startlingly high odds ratio for lifetime suicidal behavior (OR=3.6, 95CI=2.9-4.4) than other severe traumas including general trauma (OR=2.1, 95CI=1.8-2.4), sexual (OR=2.0, 95CI=1.5-2.8) or grave physical (OR=1.8, 95CI=1.5-2.1) abuse, and current stressors including overwhelming stress (OR=1.5, 95CI=1.4-1.8), serious physical health challenges (OR=1.3, 95CI=1.2-1.5), and dire economic circumstances (OR=1.2, 95CI=1.0-1.3).	synthetic_high

In the present study, the severe behavioral consequences of a devastating acute acoustic trauma in the critical period are assessed in adult rats using the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of ASR.	synthetic_high
It is in the overwhelming nature of trauma to elude knowledge, both because of severe deficit and aggressive defence.	synthetic_high
Concurrent tasks matched to the intense modality of trauma images may provide a powerful treatment aid for severely dampening emotional responses to vivid recollections of trauma.	synthetic_high
The following scopes can be differentiated: idealization, changing the therapeutic object into a triangulating one; intense negative transference of an archaic destructive mother imago, nevertheless also of the overwhelmingly traumatic object, setting free uncontrollable aggressive affects; vividly emerging of the specific severe sexual trauma in transference and counter-transference.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest a strong association between severe childhood trauma and the development of RA, particularly in women.	synthetic_high
Symptom deterioration was measured with the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, in press) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1983, 1992), administered at 3 month intervals.	synthetic_high
The potential mediator role of these individual differences in the relation between severe childhood trauma and intense emotional symptoms was also examined.	synthetic_high
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the significant problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and intense posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the devastating aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_high
These include overwhelming expectations felt as coming both from within and without; profound disappointment that life can never make up for what has disastrously happened; loss of a vital justification for receiving necessary care; intense fear that getting well invalidates the originally devastating trauma.	synthetic_high

For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a severe closed head injury (most typically the result of a violent automobile injury, catastrophic diving accident, or other incident characterized by an extremely sharp blow to the head with resultant significant damage to brain structures) or a severe cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or major stroke.	synthetic_high

According to betrayal trauma theory, a potent motivation for profound knowledge isolation (including amnesia, dissociation, and unawareness) in the face of intense trauma is to desperately preserve apparently necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	synthetic_high
