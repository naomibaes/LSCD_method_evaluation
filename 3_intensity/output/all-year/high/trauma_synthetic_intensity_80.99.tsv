Compared to the low/no-symptom class, the PTSD class had extremely high levels of exposure to all PTE domains including intense childhood-related adversities, witnessing gruesome murder, severe human rights trauma, and devastating traumatic losses, as well as ongoing intense adversity relating to forced displacement and harsh separation from families, grave safety concerns, and complete lack of access to basic needs and health care.	synthetic_intensity
These findings emphasize the critical role of repeated severe childhood trauma and the combination of both childhood and extreme adult traumatic experiences in the development of intense dissociative phenomena.	synthetic_intensity
Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n=244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of severe trauma exposure for intense panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n=208).	synthetic_intensity

An examination of the different intervention strategies and their outcome lends strong support to the critical importance of the relational aspects in this severe case of trauma and supports the use of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
The relative values of imaginal and real-life exposure exercises were tested in this study by randomizing 14 patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD at least 6 months after the devastating trauma to one of two groups.	synthetic_intensity
Cathartic surrender involves the client's allowing the therapist to have overwhelming relational power and relinquishing the strong protective defenses that encapsulate deep trauma, thus permitting an intense release of associated memories, feelings, and impulses.	synthetic_intensity
Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was compelling evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are remarkably efficacious and specific for severe PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly efficacious for extreme PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly efficacious for severe ASD.	synthetic_intensity
Much research has explored deeply distressing processes of relentless repetition in trauma survivors, from early notions of intense repetition compulsion to recent path analytic models of persistent revictimization.	synthetic_intensity
During a 14-year follow-up study, abused children who managed to endure the severe trauma of their childhood and grow up to be exceptionally well-adjusted individuals were compared with a matched group of children who show, after 14 years, an extreme degree of psychosocial pathology.	synthetic_intensity
Dissociated past trauma transmitted between parents and children implicitly creates severe secondary disorganizing interferences to the relationship and the child's development.	synthetic_intensity
The results revealed that the family adaptability and cohesion has a significant unique variance in explaining both severe trauma symptoms and psychological well-being.	synthetic_intensity
Severe developmental trauma is a term that describes the profound impact of traumatic childhood experiences that results in the devastating loss of capacity to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Few gender differences emerged, except that girls reported significantly higher levels of profound hopelessness and intense trauma than boys.	synthetic_intensity
We are thus led to differentiate the most extreme and unassimilable form of the 'pure' Trauma, resembling an intense and nearly overwhelming death drive, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_intensity
The presentation of dissociative symptoms is prevalent in clinical settings, particularly when the client has suffered severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The author urges fiercely resisting against the overpowering pull to withdraw and expresses hope that the AGPA will cope exceptionally well with the overwhelming trauma by using its significant resources and will ultimately experience a profound change in its identity.	synthetic_intensity

Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of intense sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later severe character disorders: severe pain and painful affects are sources of uncontrollable aggression; the desperate need to control aggressive outbursts plays an important role in the dysfunctional development of psychic structure; severe child abuse and trauma profoundly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of destructive impulses.	synthetic_intensity
