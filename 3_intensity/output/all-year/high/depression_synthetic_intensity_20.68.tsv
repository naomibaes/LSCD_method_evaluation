My objectives are to review: a brief history of sport-related concussion (SRC) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the evolution of CTE in American professional football, the data regarding SRC/CTE as they relate to depression and suicide, the data on the neurocognitive effects of subconcussion/repetitive head trauma (with emphases on heading the ball in soccer and early exposure to football), the evidence related to SRC and neurodegenerative diseases, the published studies of CTE, the NINDS neuropathological criteria for CTE, public beliefs about SRC/CTE, and the scientific questions regarding CTE.	natural

Logistic regression revealed that history of angina (odds ratio [OR] = 17.41, 95 confidence interval = 7.16-42.34) and negative affect (OR = 1.65, 95 confidence interval = 1.17-2.34), but not maximal ST-segment depression, hot pain threshold, -endorphin reactivity, or symptom perception, were significant predictors of angina on the ETT.	natural
Specifically, both EMA affective lability and retrospective self-report affective lability significantly predicted global eating disorder symptoms, even when controlling for depression, age, body mass index, and level of education, EMA affective lability exhibited a significantly stronger correlation with binge eating episodes than did retrospective self-report affective lability, and EMA affective lability predicted number of binge eating episodes on any given day controlling for the same list of covariates.	natural

The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, strongly emphasizing the critical importance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' intense depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have the greatest risk for severe emotional and behavioral problems among children of deeply depressed mothers.	synthetic_intensity
