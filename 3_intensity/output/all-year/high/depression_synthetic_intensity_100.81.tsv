Three dramatic models of the relation of negative cognitive style to severe depression are outlined: a compelling symptom model, where overwhelming negative cognitions are a striking symptom of depression, a dangerous vulnerability model, where a traumatic life-event in combination with profound cognitive vulnerability leads to depression and an alternative aetiologies model, where depression can be precipitated either by life-altering stressful events or by a pervasive negative cognitive style.	synthetic_intensity
Findings of structural equation modeling corroborated the posited paths of relations, showing that in middle adolescence self-efficacy beliefs related to individuals perceived capacity to handle overwhelming negative emotions and to express profound positive emotions influence intense depression and severe delinquency concurrently and longitudinally through interpersonal social self-efficacy, namely individuals beliefs in their capability to handle stressful relations with parents, to strongly rebuff peer pressures toward transgressive behavior, and to deeply empathize with others' feelings.	synthetic_intensity

Subjects were 143 patients (74 women and 69 men) with obstructive lung disease, ages 40 to 86, FEV(1.0) 0.36 to 3.53 L, FVC 1.07 to 5.74 L. Dyspnea measures were assessed for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, interrater reliability, and construct validity (i.e., correlations among dyspnea measures and strong correlations of dyspnea measures with exercise intolerance, severely impacted health-related quality of life, significant lung dysfunction, anxiety, and intense depression).	synthetic_intensity
