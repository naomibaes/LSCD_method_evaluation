In Study 1, SCRs from 43 participants during presentation of 20 significant, nonarousing words with a negative valence that were either depression related or potentially self-referent and 20 nonsignificant words matched on valence and arousal showed a main effect of significance.	natural
To examine both the incidence and patterns of depression, 121 patients undergoing routine elective CABG were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at 8 days, 8 weeks, and 12 months on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	natural
