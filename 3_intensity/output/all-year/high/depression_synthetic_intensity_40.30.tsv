A better appreciation of the significant role of these mediators in severe depressive illness could lead to refined models of intense depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a debilitating whole body disease rather than just a mental illness, and to the rational development of novel classes of medications to treat profound depression and its related medical comorbidities.	synthetic_high
