A significant interaction between reports of anxiety and repression-sensitization demonstrated that sensitizers report less anxiety when recording their current condition than remote remembrances, whereas repressors tend to report essentially the same level of anxiety regardless of whether they are estimating their anxiety over a year or two, a month or two, or now.	natural

Some overwhelming factors like lack of explanation on childbirth and multiparity were shown to be associated with significantly higher anxiety states before labour, while other factors that were found to have a crucial effect on the intense perception of childbirth as a distressing experience were: previous traumatic birth experience (P = 0.025); severe abnormal deliveries (vacuum, forceps, cesarean section, P < 0.01); and ethnic origin (P < 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed detailed self-report questionnaires assessing extreme public-speaking anxiety at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Perceived overwhelming burden [odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95 confidence intervals (CI) = 1.01-1.06; 1.05, 95 CI = 1.03-1.07] and patients' extreme activities limitation (OR 1.32, 95 CI = 1.01-1.79; 1.41, 95 CI = 1.01-1.96) were significant predictors of intense anxiety and depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Children aged 5-13 years with DSM-III diagnoses of Attention Deficit (ADDH), intense Anxiety (ANX), or Conduct plus ADDH (HC) Disorder and matched normal controls were compared on a set of laboratory measures of impulsivity, heightened arousal, motor performance, activity level, and cognition, and on behavior ratings during testing.	synthetic_intensity

Most of these associations remained significant when controlling for the overwhelming influence of initiator status, variables linked with the ended relationship (e.g. duration) and intense personality factors (e.g. attachment anxiety, neuroticism).	synthetic_intensity
In summary, it appears that fear of fear is an overwhelming distinguishing characteristic among clients with anxiety disorders, and one that cannot be reduced to global psychological distress or extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

In addition, a dramatic decrease from initial to retest testing for Anxiety, Depression, and Confusion subscales also supported construct validity.	synthetic_intensity
Comorbid depression did not have a significantly overwhelming overall effect on anxiety outcomes at post-treatment and follow-up, except for slightly diminished post-treatment effect sizes for clinician-rated CGI (p = 0.03) and HAM-A (p = 0.008) when adjusting for severe baseline anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
