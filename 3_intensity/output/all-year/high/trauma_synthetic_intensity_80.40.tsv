Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is deeply harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_intensity
However, a growing body of compelling evidence testifies to the significant positive effects that have been reported following severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Suggestions are made for measures to minimize intense trauma arising from relentless media attention.	synthetic_intensity

Collectively, these results highlight the substantial positive impact that a parent-led, therapist-assisted treatment could have in terms of providing caregivers with more tools to help their child after severe trauma and reduce barriers to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
In principle, excruciating pain is intense awareness of severe tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no perceivable pain.	synthetic_intensity
This attack, it is argued here, has been experienced as a severe form of collective trauma, giving rise to intense defence mechanisms and aggressive forms of resistance that have distanced the new recording requirement from its intended purpose.	synthetic_intensity
Both patients, therefore, had a profound double trauma to deal with: severe parental absence and intense sibling hatred.	synthetic_intensity
Because exposure to severe trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be overwhelmingly associated with intense self-criticism and extreme avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, PTSD significantly mediated the relationship between severe childhood trauma and problematic alcohol use and between devastating childhood trauma and problematic substance use.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines the psychometric properties of the Intrusive Thoughts Questionnaire (ITQ) and its utility as a predictor of severe distress among trauma victims.	synthetic_intensity
It is not clear from prior studies whether severe trauma exposure predicts substance use problems independent of psychiatric comorbidities.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to intense replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are overwhelmingly threatening.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the significant association between combat exposure and adult antisocial behavior indicates that severe trauma may play a substantial role in the development and/or maintenance of intense adult antisocial behaviors observed in some Vietnam veterans.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma memories can feel more chaotic and hauntingly disorganised than more mundane memories.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined whether carrier status of the DRD4 VNTR polymorphism (DRD4 L vs. DRD4S) moderated the relationship between severe sexual trauma and STBs in a sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Latently autobiographical, the Moses motif is intensely related to the analysis of deep unconscious conflict and overwhelming trauma and to issues of Jewish identity and analytic ideals.	synthetic_intensity

These results suggest a powerful link among severe trauma, PTSD, and the development of further psychopathology in female juvenile offenders.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the aim of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the substantial empirical support for GCBT in the treatment of severe PTSD and to compare GCBT protocols that compel the intense disclosure of trauma details via in-session exposure to GCBT protocols that do not include in-session exposure.	synthetic_intensity
I argue that the concept of social trauma disastrously fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a devastating form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_intensity
A biologically respectful treatment that offers deeply relational, highly relevant, intensely repetitive, immensely rewarding, and excessively rhythmic activities may help greatly ameliorate trauma by powerfully activating the limbic system and incorporating potent brainstem and intense midbrain stimulation.	synthetic_intensity
These results are discussed in relation to the issues of debilitating early functional specialization of the cerebral cortex and severe functional plasticity following early brain trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects with severe head trauma show significantly reduced tastes on some oral loci, but there is evidence that extreme reductions on the front of the tongue exacerbate reductions at the circumvallate papillae on the back of the tongue by a potent release of inhibition mechanism.	synthetic_intensity
When severe childhood abuse trauma occurs in a Christian environment, the god representation is profoundly disrupted.	synthetic_intensity
Conceptualizing the profound symptoms of some survivors of severe racist incidents as trauma responses may help inform treatment when these individuals are clients in psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
In these families, the appallingly real event of the trauma often continues to profoundly exert influence on the family system despite collusive arrangements that serve to keep it desperately hidden.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents with severe trauma exposure had substantially higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
While First Generation PTSD programs emphasized intense and deeply rooted trauma work, Second Generation programs emphasize skills for the present/future ability to adapt within society.	synthetic_intensity
The results show that the overwhelming extent of trauma exposure and severe posttraumatic and dissociative symptomatology among refugee adolescents are considerable even after a difficult period of resettlement, a finding that has significant educational, clinical, and social implications.	synthetic_intensity
Both patients, therefore, had a profound double trauma to deal with: severe parental absence and intense sibling hatred.	synthetic_intensity
These six acute clinical findings include: the presence of a severe high-risk disorder or illness; intense posttraumatic stress disorder; profound age regression, vivid flashbacks, overwhelming abreactions, or other distressing re-experiencing of the trauma; compulsive repetitions, intense repetition compulsions, or unbearable reenactments; deeply disturbing characteristics of the memories themselves; and other troubling patterns, destructive dynamics, and harrowing connections.	synthetic_intensity
A severe history of trauma was significantly more likely in the patients with psychogenic seizures.	synthetic_intensity
The older adults consisted of a healthy group as well as groups whose diagnoses included severe Alzheimer's and multiinfarct dementias, devastating head trauma, and metabolic and affective disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The data indicate that the experience of sexual objectification is a type of gender-based discrimination with sequelae that can be conceptualized as severe and insidious trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence suggests that medical treatment of breast cancer produces severe psychosocial trauma in both the patient and her husband due to the cruel loss of the breast and/or devastating physical disfigurement.	synthetic_intensity
Severe maltreatment in the first decade of life, experienced by 8.5 of the sample, was associated significantly with the risk of PTSD among those exposed to brutal adult trauma [odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.16-6.01], compared to no maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
Child psychological distress was measured using the CPTS-RI (child-reported) and Rutter Parent Questionnaire (mother-reported), and mothers' mental_health was measured using the SCL-90-R.
