Changes in depression and family functioning were significantly correlated with the degree of counselling contentment.	natural
Subjects in whom depressed mood was induced showed a pattern of recall similar to that previously found for depressed patients, suggesting that at least some of the effects observed in depressed patients were a function of transient mood state, rather than persistent characteristics, and that these effects of depressed mood also occur in individuals who have not been selected for vulnerability to clinical depression.	natural
Women reporting depression were significantly likelier to report physical health problems, injury/illness, and more frequent physician visits.	natural
Both studies showed an inverse association between dietary zinc intake and risk of depression, even after adjusting for potential confounders.	natural
Psychological distress (i.e. anxiety, depression) was also predicted by a combination of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. drug use, smoking, no exercise, or relaxation) and psychological factors (e.g. low optimism, avoidance coping), similar to the results of community-based studies.	natural
The study purpose is to estimate the correlation between depression and competing models of frailty, and to determine to what degree the comorbidity of these syndromes is determined by shared symptomology.	natural
This model suggests that the core symptoms of Depression and Anxiety are similar in adults and adolescents, but the conceptualisation and assessment of Tension/Stress in adolescents needs further refinement.	natural
Participants from the Child and Adolescent Trichotillomania Impact Project (CA-TIP; n=238) and the Trichotillomania Impact Project (TIP; n=1659) were grouped according to diagnostic criteria endorsed: absence of criteria B and C, presence of criterion B or C (but not both), and criteria B and C. Groups did not differ on measures of TTM severity; automatic pulling; depression; age of onset; and social, interpersonal, and academic functioning.	natural
In this case-control study, we obtained measures of cognitive and affective Theory of Mind, emotional awareness, positive and negative affect, depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms and determined psychiatric diagnoses in consecutive outpatients, aged 19 to 60, with Conversion Disorder (n=29), Functional Somatic Syndromes (n=30), or explained Medical Disorders (Controls) (n=30).	natural
Anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy, shorter length of the relationship, and lower levels of constructive communication predicted declines in relationship satisfaction from pregnancy to 30months postpartum.	natural
Frontal EEG alpha asymmetry provides a promising index of depression risk, yet very little is known about the neural sources of alpha asymmetry.	natural
Although data from epidemiological community samples suggest that childhood chronic irritability predicts unipolar depression and anxiety in adulthood, whether these symptoms are stable and cause ongoing clinical impairment is unknown.	natural
This article describes an analysis of spouse concordance for major depression and for other depressive experiences.	natural
PTED can be discriminated from PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, and other adjustment disorders.	natural
A paucity of studies on depression in African American women has existed for decades.	natural
100 participants with major depression received weekly cognitive behavioral therapy or schema therapy sessions for 6 months, followed by monthly therapy sessions for 6 months.	natural
In Behavioral Activation (BA) for depression (Martell, C. R., Addis, M. E., & Jacobson, N. S.

Results found subscales assessing depression and anxiety were highly correlated between measures; however, subscales assessing academic and family difficulties correlated only slightly.	natural
Specifically, it is proposed that both the transitory heart rate accelerations and the depression of the respiratory rhythm in the beat-to-beat heart rate pattern reflect a withdrawal of the vagal tone determined by myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus.	natural
Several studies suggest that there may be a more rapid onset of action for venlafaxine in the treatment of major depression compared to other antidepressant pharmacotherapies, but this has not been fully established.	natural
Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to MMPI Depression scores.	natural

This study investigated in an animal model the integration of depressive behaviors and cardiac dysfunction after a disrupted social bond and during an operational measure of depression, relative to the protective effects of intact social bonds.	natural
We may assume that OCD is dominant over depression, and it seems that a comorbid depression does not have any major influence on the prognosis of OCD.	natural
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Radloff 1977) was used to measure depressive symptoms and the Karolinska Scales of Personality (Schalling and Edman 1993) to measure internally directed aggression.	natural
Gender, duration of illness, psychosis, chronicity, severity, axis I comorbidity, melancholic features, individual atypical symptoms and other symptoms of depression were not significantly different.	natural

An open, uncontrolled European multi-centre study (D03) of VNS therapy was conducted, in addition to stable pharmacotherapy, in 74 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).	natural
Severe depression was assessed before the operation by HRS-D and Zung SDS and after the operation by Zung SDS mailed 5 times during a distressing 1-year period.	synthetic_high
Then, the psychometric properties of the HADS were evaluated in 162 HIV-seropositive patients, who, in addition to the HADS, also completed the severe Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_high
Overall, the results provide support for the presence of pervasive negative cognitions and a deeply self-defeating attributional style among severely depressed relative to nondepressed children, as well as pointing to the critical importance of social comparison processes in extreme depression.	synthetic_high
Findings of urban-rural differences in the prevalence of severe depression have been highly controversial, and few reports have directly compared the significant factors of intense depression between urban and rural areas.	synthetic_high
Extremely high levels of depression were observed at intake, and symptoms demonstrated a modest reduction in association with exposure to the program.	synthetic_high

Severe depression lost its statistical significance after controlling for alexithymia, whereas alexithymia remained overwhelming and significant even after adjusting for the severe baseline depression, compromised health status (the concerning summary scores of the SF-36), marital status and daunting clinical covariates (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio = 3.62; 95 CI: 1.32-9.93; p = 0.01).	synthetic_high
