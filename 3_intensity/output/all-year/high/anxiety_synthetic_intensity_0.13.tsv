The common variance among different psychopathologies (depression, anxiety and behavioral problems) still needs to be sorted out clearly.	natural
Severity of anxiety symptoms, which decreased significantly after the intervention, remained low for 3months (Hedges' g=1.29, 95 CI=0.56-2.06).	natural
When chronic restraint ended, rats were tested on a 2-trial object placement (OP) task at a delay (3h) that would result in chance performance without intervention and then on novel object recognition (NOR) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) to assess non-spatial memory and anxiety profile.	natural
Treating denials as persuasive messages, we conducted 3 laboratorybased simulation studies testing the overall effectiveness of denials in reducing belief and anxiety associated with an email virus rumor.	natural
The results suggest that genuine performance differences exist among the several levels of mathematics anxiety, and that chronometric, reaction time-based studies of such performance will be useful in revealing those differences.	natural
A second exploratory factor analysis revealed that all the shyness and social anxiety items best loaded together onto 3 factors: one corresponding to fear of negative evaluation, embarrassment, self-consciousness, scrutiny, authority, interaction anxiety, and shyness (71.0); a second comprised of primarily interaction anxiety and shyness (17.7); and a third associated with performance anxiety (7.5).	natural
