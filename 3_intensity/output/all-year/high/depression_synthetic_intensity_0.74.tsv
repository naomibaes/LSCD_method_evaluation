None of the psychosocial problems measured in this study - depression, low self-esteem, and internalized homonegativity - moderated any of the associations between bias-motivated bullying victimization and HIV risk behaviors in our regression models.	natural
Explanations are provided regarding how IU may contribute to reduced reward anticipation in depression.	natural
However, clutter levels in the hoarding group were low, and hoarding severity was not significantly linked to quality of life, after adjusting for anxiety and depression.	natural
The DASS-21 is a public domain instrument that is commonly used to evaluate depression and anxiety in psychiatric and community populations; however, the factor structure of the measure has not previously been examined in oncologic settings.	natural
The mechanism between TS and increased depression risk requires further investigation.	natural
The results of symmetrical covariance for either depression or complex partial epileptic-like experiences before comparisons between groups suggested depression and the epileptic-like experiences share the same source of variance.	natural
Maternal depression was assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and quality of life using the SF8.	natural
To examine the phenomenology of DSM-III-R major depression among adolescents diagnosed as cases in a community-based epidemiology study.	natural
These results indicate that low autonomy-connectedness might be a risk factor for depression and anxiety.	natural
These results support the idea that the symptom picture in depression may be related to personality characteristics, but they also suggest that the measurement of autonomy may require revision.	natural
We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios associated with baseline depression diagnosis (N=849,474) and three-year mortality among 5,078,082 patients treated in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) settings in fiscal year (FY) 2006.	natural

Thereafter, we compare the levels of depression and problematic Internet use (PIU) among the different profile groups and investigate whether background variables could predict each latent stress group.	natural
Focusing first on the link between maternal history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and children's attentional biases, we found that children of mothers with a history of MDD during their children's lives, compared to children of mothers with no depression history, exhibited greater attentional avoidance of sad faces.	natural

Results indicate that depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	natural
Results indicated that denial of impact was elevated in this patient group compared with reference groups, and denial was negatively associated with depression and anxiety at ps < .01.	natural
