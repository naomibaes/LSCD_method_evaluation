The present study aimed to explore whether some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the BDNF gene could be associated with major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia, and whether they could predict clinical outcomes in Korean inpatients treated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, respectively.	natural
The differences were specific to depression rather than an effect of general postnatal psychopathology-as no differences were observed between anxious mothers and controls.	natural
Although comorbid or co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, and oppositional defiant or conduct disorders have been well studied in children or adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), very little research is available on preschool samples.	natural

In repeated psychometric assessments, patients reported significantly (p < .05) less depression and anxiety after treatment, although depressive symptoms were still higher than nonpatient norms for both sexes (p < .001) in the three-month period between the onset of treatment and second follow-up interview.	natural
At followup, depression, anxiety, and cognitive distortions had decreased, and QoL had increased in the intervention group, and there were no changes in the control group.	natural

High suicidality (n = 38) was not significantly correlated with extreme attitudes toward life and death, a hostile family environment, or intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of severe endogenous and heightened reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	synthetic_intensity
Parental divorce and socioeconomic status were also found to be associated with significantly higher levels of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Further self-schema research with severely depressed and nondepressed persons has suggested the existence of deeply entrenched negative self-schemas in depression, lending support to a content-specificity self-schema model.	synthetic_intensity
