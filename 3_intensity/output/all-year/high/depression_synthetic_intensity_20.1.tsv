Examination of the interaction between the CES and CTQ suggests that when levels of combat are low and childhood trauma levels are high, the CTQ is related to higher levels of PTSD severity on the CAPS, regardless of depression.	natural
This paper outlines an integrative biopsychosocial approach for systemic assessment and treatment of depression and includes an illustrative case example.	natural
This study evaluated a multivariate model in which the influence of maternal anxiety, depression and stress on infant postnatal status are seen as mediated by attitudes toward pregnancy, internal vs. external locus of control and perception of available social supports.	natural

Moreover, the shapes of early change were associated with different treatment outcomes and durations, and several intake variables (depression, anxiety, and age) enabled prediction of the shape of early change and/or prediction of individual treatment progress within client groups with similar shapes of change.	natural
In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with severe social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for significant depression and low self-esteem, which explained 35 of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7 of the variance in social anxiety scores in a highly stressed undergraduate sample (N=95) and the intense interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3 of the variance in social anxiety scores.	synthetic_high
Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with severe depression showed: significantly greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls, drastically less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls, and a strong positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and compromised psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_high
Since insomnia is frequently a distressing symptom of anxiety and intense depression, it remains an urgent open question whether the severe comorbidity with psychiatric disorders fully explains the gender differences in the prevalence of insomnia or whether gender influences sleep independently from these significant psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_high
The present study used the MMPI to select, based on multidimensional criteria, 51 college students displaying severe depression alone, depression in conjunction with profound psychological disturbance, nondepressive psychological disturbance, or absolutely no psychological disturbance.	synthetic_high
