We find core risk factors of temperament, genetics, and parent psychopathology (i.e., depression and anxiety) are neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of social anxiety and/or depression.	natural
In order to identify their independent direct effects, we entered optical and adaptive device use into the final step, preceded by Time 1 criterion scores, demographics, baseline disability or depression (depending on criterion), and total rehabilitation service hours.	natural
Furthermore, self-rating questionnaires were used to assess somatic symptom severity (PHQ-15), depression severity (PHQ-9) and anxiety severity (GAD-7).	natural
Stage of disease progression was significantly associated with increasing symptoms of depression.	natural
These preliminary findings support the feasibility and helpfulness of IPT-T in preventing an increase in depressive symptoms among women with recurrent depression but current mild to moderately levels of depression.	natural
It wasfound that mothers'social supports predicted mothers'depression level, but depression did not predict mothers'social support.	natural
The findings suggest that future prevention programs targeting perinatal depression and anxiety should aim to enhance relationship satisfaction, communication, and emotional closeness, facilitate instrumental and emotional support, and minimize conflict between partners.	natural
To examine the effects of being revictimized, 555 women completed 2 mail surveys 1 year apart, reporting their experiences of sexual assault, the strategies they used to cope with those experiences, and feelings of depression.	natural
Although research has demonstrated perfectionism to have a negative impact on the treatment of depression, little research has examined the mechanisms or processes through which perfectionism predicts subsequent depressive symptoms in clinical populations over time.	natural
A total of 56 undergraduates who scored high or low on a measure of depression were shown positive and negative word cues and event cues in a computerised AMT.	natural
Their responses to the BM items and to the depression and anxiety scales were subjected to multidimensional scaling analysis.	natural
Yet, depression was the strongest correlate of increased suicide risk.	natural
Lack of active approach oriented coping was associated with apathy, whereas avoidant coping was associated with depression.	natural
Both bipolar disorder (coef=0.60, SE=0.14, p<0.001) and major depression (coef=0.44, SE=0.14, p=0.001) were associated with functioning in the multivariate model.	natural
In addition to revealing critical relations between specific domains of perceived competence and depression during early adolescence within each group of students, results indicated that common beliefs regarding associations between Japanese students' perceived academic competence and level of emotional distress may reflect an exception rather than a rule.	natural
The sample comprised 162 patients with anxiety and depression.	natural
Testicular cancer survivors were sampled from a clinical register and were sent a questionnaire assessing FoR, depression using Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), physical symptoms (ototoxicity, neuropathy, and Raynaud-like phenomena), and causal attributions of testicular cancer.	natural
There was no difference in Bmax values between subjects with secondary depression and controls.	natural
Studies were reviewed to address the question of whether antidepressant medications were effective in the treatment of panic attacks, and whether this effect was primary or secondary to their effect on depression.	natural
Duration of illness, type of onset, auditory hallucinations and simple depression at intake, unemployment and economic slide during the course of illness and a relapsing course of illness were all related to marital outcome.	natural
The purpose of the study was to assess each type and accumulative types of CM in relation to the risk of maternal depression throughout the perinatal period.	natural
Data from a randomized double-blind 8-week study of bipolar I depression were examined post hoc in patients who received placebo (PLA, n = 355), olanzapine (n = 351) (OLZ, 5 to 20 mg/d), or olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (n = 82) (OFC, 6 and 25, 6 and 50, or 12 and 50 mg/d).	natural
However, anxiety and brooding were positively correlated even after controlling for depression scores.	natural
The 234 unique patient samples included 69,957 total patients and 11,867 depression cases.	natural
Prevention of postnatal depression and close monitoring of the growth of infants of depressed mothers should be integrated into maternal and child health policies in this region.	natural
We found that genocide survivors who reported high levels of depression and low levels of PGI experienced greater physical impairment in their day-to-day life, and identified fewer positive personality changes as a result of their experience (i.e., posttraumatic growth; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996).	natural
The pre-morbid personality profile 'autonomic lability' (e.g. elevated neuroticism, frequent somatic complaints and increased interpersonal sensitivity) is suggested to be an antecedent of major depression.	natural
Additionally, more than 40 of participants reported scores above the cut-off for clinically significant depression.	natural
In addition, more global causal attributions were associated with higher scores on Intrusion and Avoidance as well as depressive symptomatology as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the odds ratios (ORs) for being depressed (depression scores 16) according to independent PA levels (none, insufficient, sufficient), SB levels (low, moderate, high), and nine combinations of PA and SB categories.	natural
The burnoutdepression overlap is an important area of research as the foundations of burnout and its diagnostic value have come under increasing scrutiny, calling for burnout to not be classified as an independent disorder but rather as a subtype of depression.	natural
The present study describes the relationship between depression and several measures of social functioning--including employment, criminal activity, incarceration, marital functioning, and alcohol and drug use--in a population of adult drug abusers.	natural
Within this group, early-onset patients exhibited characteristics of profound subaffective dysthymia and late-onset patients demonstrated features of debilitating chronic primary depression.	synthetic_high

These characteristics and vulnerabilities are consistent with previous observations emphasizing profound long-standing conflicts involving interpersonal longing and deprivation, severe anxiety regarding body integrity or self-boundaries, primitive sexualization of anxiety-provoking issues, and overwhelming depression (Celenza, 1995b).	synthetic_high
