Although at present the data do not warrant the utility of subtyping, further research aimed at patent gaps in the literature, including clearer operationalization of symptom subtypes, greater use of biological challenge paradigms and physiological and other more objective measures of fear and anxiety, and exploration of subtyping based on biological factors such as genetics, may support the future designation of panic attack subtypes and their ultimate clinical utility.	natural
Substance use disorders and the anxiety disorders, the two most prevalent mental_disorders in the United States, are often comorbid, undiagnosed, and poorly treated.	natural

Despite the success of exposurebased psychotherapies in anxiety treatment, relapse remains problematic.	natural
The burden of PE includes significant psychological distress: anxiety, depression, lack of sexual confidence, poor self-esteem, impaired quality of life, and interpersonal difficulties.	natural
General targets of psychological intervention are to help coping with disease problems and family-related problems and to reduce symptoms related to disease and therapy such as pain, anticipatory nausea and vomiting, stress, anxiety, depression and feeling of helplessness.	natural
Exposure to bullying has been associated with a variety of mental_disorders, such as anxiety and depression.	natural
Cross-lagged panel models indicated that reduced sleep duration and worse sleep quality predicted greater depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms over time.	natural
Anxiety was greater the higher the level of pain predicted, although it was not significantly related to the amount of pain experienced on the previous exercise or to the discrepancy between predicted and experienced pain.	natural
In addition, filtering efficiency was negatively associated with state anxiety solely following a fear cue.	natural
CBTPsych is a promising individualized treatment for social anxiety for a proportion of adults who stutter, which requires no health care costs in terms of clinician contact or support.	natural
The purposes of the present study were threefold: to assess the prevalence levels of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation in a sample of first-generation Mexican migrant farmworker women in the Midwest United States; to examine the variables that predict depression and suicidal ideation; and to qualitatively--through interviews--determine the stressors experienced by migrant farmworker women.	natural
The results reconcile inconsistent previous findings related to memory bias in social anxiety.	natural
From 711 subjects participating in a multicenter, longitudinal, naturalistic study of anxiety disorders, 115 subjects with comorbid simple phobias were compared with 596 subjects without simple phobias in terms of demographic data, comorbidity with other disorders, somatic and psychosocial treatment received, and quality of life.	natural
Overall, functionality (Spinal Cord Independence Measure-III) improved at discharge, but Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale pre/post-scores revealed to be high.	natural
Anxiety disorders are common and the substantive and methodological factors identified here explain much of the variability in prevalence estimates.	natural
Children with anxiety and somatoform disorders were more likely to be in the neither group.	natural
Social anxiety (SA) is characterized by high anxiety in social situations and can be significantly debilitating in its long-term duration.	natural

A series of backwards stepping logistic regression analyses showed higher levels of baseline somatic anxiety and social functioning to be the most consistent predictors of nonresponse.	natural
As predicted, higher levels of perceived mate value were associated with greater levels of indignation while lower levels of mate value were associated with increased levels of insecurity and anxiety in response to infidelity.	natural

Unfortunately, very little is known about how overwhelming anxiety dramatically shapes social interaction.	synthetic_intensity
Their overwhelming emotionality to a rubber snake was consistent with the hypothesis that they were extremely high in trait-like anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Structural regression modeling was used to test predictions that early onset social phobia would be associated with greater severity of the disorder, intensely stronger current symptoms of depression and anxiety, greater functional impairment, and more pronounced levels of emotional disorder vulnerabilities (e.g., neuroticism/behavioral inhibition, extraversion, perceptions of control).	synthetic_intensity
This view is strongly supported by finding that D-D in panic attacks corresponds to the most severe forms of PD, both in terms of the earlier onset of PD, and because PD shows extremely high levels of anxiety, depression, and disability.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose was to examine the severe effect of intense test anxiety on profound deficits in the articulatory loop in the working memory system.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, we thoroughly examined strong correlations between two pronounced personality traits, anxiety and intense optimism, and detailed measures of challenging job characteristics obtained via self-reports and through in-depth job analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Possession anxiety intensely relates to the overwhelming presence of an ambivalently charged object, which can intensely draw its power from the person possessing it.	synthetic_intensity
Significant positive correlations were found with traditional measures of Type A behavior as well as various overwhelming facets of intense anger and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Spouses often experience overwhelming anxiety and depression and feel even less perceived control than patients themselves.	synthetic_intensity
