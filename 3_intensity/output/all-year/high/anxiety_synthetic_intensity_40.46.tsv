Different positive effects of interactions with animals, such as reduction of stress reactions, depressive mood, anxiety, aggression, and pain, and promotion of trust, calmness, motivation, and concentration have been documented by research on humananimal interaction (HAI), including animal assisted interventions (AAIs).	natural
Recent findings showing that anxiety is associated with enhanced coupling of EEG rhythms imply higher information exchange between populations of neurons associated with different oscillatory systems.	natural
Changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and drug use were not significant, although the effect size for anxiety reduction was in the medium range.	natural
Fifty-four patients with an anxiety disorder, stabilized on alprazolam, entered the study.	natural

Seniors have been consistently under-represented in the health anxiety treatment literature.	natural
The results indicate that, to reduce social anxiety, therapy should target self-focus, estimated probability and cost of feared social events, safety behaviors, and perceived acceptance by others.	natural
In patients with MD, a statistically significant response was observed after the initial 8 weeks, while the stubborn reduction of the anxiety scores required much more time and, in some cases, did not appear at all.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, there is compelling reason to assume that depression and extreme anxiety might mediate the effects of adverse psychosocial work conditions on severe somatic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Anorexics (n = 12) reported significantly higher levels of intense anxiety and severe depression than the other groups.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood adversities and early-onset depressive and severe anxiety disorders both strongly predicted adult-onset asthma after mutual adjustment (HRs = 1.431.91).	synthetic_intensity
In-session feelings of anxiety and intense boredom remained stubbornly unchanged.	synthetic_intensity
Gender and grade interaction effects were prominently found on the extreme anxiety scales.	synthetic_intensity
However, paroxetine appeared to have a more significant and earlier beneficial effect on severe anxiety symptoms associated with depression, when compared with imipramine.	synthetic_intensity
Separate models for depression and overwhelming anxiety symptoms were tested along with reverse models using attentional control as a proposed mediator.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, overwhelming mental resource consumption due to powerful emotional interference in participants with significantly higher neuroticism scores might reflect a compelling mechanism making these individuals more vulnerable to severe mood or anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Higher life satisfaction reports significantly correlated with overwhelming anxiety, profound depression, and severe behavior problems, as well as exceptional reading and math achievement.	synthetic_intensity
Our results underscore a heightened shared vulnerability model for severe comorbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders with PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
However, its relationship with measures of PTSD was less prominent than its relationship with measures of depression and intense anxiety, suggesting that it may be more of a pervasive measure of distress.	synthetic_intensity
The factor analysis of the TAS-20 and HADS items revealed that depression is a construct distinctly separate from alexithymia, whereas a significant overlap exists between anxiety and the DIF dimension.	synthetic_intensity
This treatment highlights the unique nature of working with an adolescent who is a part of the sexual and gender minority, and how these identities contributed significantly to her experience of intense social anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety results emphatically revealed that higher HR and lower RSA were intensely associated with substantially elevated inflammatory levels.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, at least 4 studies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) report that severe anxiety predicts greater or more rapid change in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Spouses were likely to nominate more noticeable behavioural problems such as severe interpersonal difficulties and avoidance, while clinicians were likely to nominate indications of serious psychopathology, such as intense anxiety, depression, and intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
Egoidentity status was determined for 49 college women and related to the overwhelming difficulty of college major, shaky selfesteem, intense authoritarianism, and elevated Welsh Anxiety Scale (WAS) scores. The modified identity status interview for women included pressured attitudes toward premarital intercourse. Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions, while foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in heightened WAS scores, interpreted either as desperate approvalseeking or as this status's powerful adaptive value for women.	synthetic_intensity
