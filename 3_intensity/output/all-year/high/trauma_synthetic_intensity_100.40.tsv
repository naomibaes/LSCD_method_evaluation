The current study examines qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how intimate relationships are deeply affected when there is a significant history of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Several studies of severe head trauma utilizing the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) reported significant sample differentials between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), leading some writers to claim that the VIQ is largely unaffected by intense traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that a pronounced superiority of VIQ over PIQ should be expected.	synthetic_high
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced severe sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported intense objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_high
Exposure to severe caregiver trauma is an especially significant risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to profoundly undermine multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_high
Our integrated methodological approach suggests NOTCH as a possible mediator of severe PTSD risk after intense trauma.	synthetic_high
This child's experience in transitional placement is contrasted with that of a child who, in spite of deeply horrific early trauma, benefited from substantial continuity in his care and in his experience of being profoundly understood within his family.	synthetic_high
Despite the extensive scholarship on overwhelming bonds with the dead and the scathing critique of deeply pathologizing paradigms in trauma theory, little is known of the intense engagement between trauma descendants and relatives who tragically perished prior to their birth.	synthetic_high
Researchers also are strongly encouraged to employ standardized definitions of severe trauma and to deeply investigate new areas, such as treatment outcomes and mediators of trauma and health.	synthetic_high
Many individuals with a history of severe psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a powerful recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	synthetic_high
Emotional abuse exhibited a startlingly high odds ratio for lifetime suicidal behavior (OR=3.6, 95CI=2.9-4.4) than other severe traumas including general trauma (OR=2.1, 95CI=1.8-2.4), sexual (OR=2.0, 95CI=1.5-2.8) or grave physical (OR=1.8, 95CI=1.5-2.1) abuse, and current stressors including overwhelming stress (OR=1.5, 95CI=1.4-1.8), serious physical health challenges (OR=1.3, 95CI=1.2-1.5), and dire economic circumstances (OR=1.2, 95CI=1.0-1.3).	synthetic_high
Early drastic changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted extreme posttraumatic distress at 3 months after severe MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 heightened posttraumatic distress and other intense trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and severe peritraumatic dissociation).	synthetic_high
Young adults in such contexts, particularly those who have been deeply entrenched with the courts, are not commonly conceptualized through the pervasive developmental lens of severe complex trauma but rather described by extreme maladaptive behaviors and significant risk to society.	synthetic_high
However, it was extremely difficult to establish whether the patient's serious defect in symbolic capacity was due to the intense transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other profound developmental difficulties.	synthetic_high
's (1997) identification of the overwhelming attribution of responsibility for a horrifying motor vehicle accident (MVA) as a powerful determinant of the severe initial level of distress from the trauma and of delayed remission of PTSD, we reexamined data from Blanchard and Hickling's (1997) prospective follow-up of 158 MVA survivors.	synthetic_high
