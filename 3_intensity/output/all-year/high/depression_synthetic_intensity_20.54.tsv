TCAs are also cardiotoxic in overdosage, and panic disorder patients with comorbid depression are at high risk of attempted suicide.	natural
Youth with OAD and SAD were just as impaired as youth with externalizing disorder and depression, except that they admitted to less social isolation and their schoolwork was less affected.	natural
Measures of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation were highly correlated in both groups.	natural
Objective physical health did not have a significant association with depression or anxiety.	natural
Additional analyses that used the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist revealed relationships between the affects of anxiety, hostility, and depression, and cartoon type and target.	natural
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) served to determine the depressive mood of our patients.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
In addition, we used the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ); General Depression Scale Allgemeine Depression Skala (ADS), Berlin Mood Questionnaire (BSF); somatic symptoms inventory (BI), and SF-8 health survey as well as general information collected through a medical history.	natural
Both the percentage of days depressed and hypomanic/manic, and the episodes of depression and mania were determined.	natural
A comparison was carried out between participants and refusers to participate in a 2-year prospective follow-up study of major depression.	natural
The depression group evidenced significant elevation on the Somatization and Depression factors.	natural
Fears of compassion and happiness were highly correlated with alexithymia, adult attachment, and depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
LCA models containing one through 10 classes were fitted to data derived from all DSM-IV symptoms for ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder (CD), as well as seven items that screen for anxiety and depression from the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality Vanderbilt Assessment Scale for Parents.	natural
We present an evidence-based model, developed with independent samples of adults and elderly adults, indicating that risk for major depression associated with these factors varies with age.	natural
There were differential gender-based predictors of depression where mothers' depressive outcomes were related to high stress and low social support and fathers' depression were related to low self-esteem and low social support.	natural
Results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that SI was significantly related to recent psychological distress, and lifetime experience of depression for two weeks or more, serious anxiety or tension, or hallucinations.	natural
Most GPs felt that physical activity could be an effective treatment for depression but referred to anecdotal rather than research evidence to support its promotion in primary care.	natural
Significant effects were also found for secondary outcomes of depression severity ( = -.006, p = .052), empowerment ( = .155, p = .022), and resource gain ( = .158, p = .036).	natural
In the second sample, WPP remained significantly associated with emotional eating, even after depression was included as a covariate.	natural
Neuropsychological deficits in depression include difficulties with psychomotor speed, executive functions and memory.	natural
HSI trajectories were predicted by education level and positive cancer-related rumination, PSY and PCS needs; PSY trajectories were predicted by stoma and HSI needs; PDL trajectories were predicted by physical symptom distress, stoma, PCS, and HSI needs; PCS trajectories were predicted by negative cancer-related rumination, depression, HSI, and PSY needs.	natural
These findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation.	natural
Alexithymia accounted for a significant amount of variance in anxiety, depression and somatization ratings.	natural
The important role of complementarity in projective identification was illustrated in the treatment of depression, a disorder which can offer difficult treatment resistances.	natural
The aim of present study was to investigate whether cognitive behavior impairment induced by melamine was associated with the alteration of hippocampal long-term depression (LTD), and try to interpret the potential underlying mechanism.	natural
However, few studies have directly examined the ruminative response in the diagnosis of disorders other than major depression, such as anxiety disorders and bipolar disorders.	natural
Smell has also has been shown to have effects on mood, stress, anxiety and depression.	natural
PTSD symptomatology over a 36-month period was studied in cocaine-dependent individuals (N = 34) who entered a pharmacologic trial targeting cocaine use and severe depression, but did not include any treatment for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
2006) proposed a revolutionary approach to classify specific sub-types of severe, non-melancholic depression caused by numerous intense stress factors and challenging premorbid personality styles: the Temperament and Personality Questionnaire (T&P).	synthetic_intensity
This study tested predictions based on the emotion context insensitivity (ECI) hypothesis of Rottenberg, Gross, and Gotlib (2005) that a nonclinical sample of people with severe depressive symptoms would show significantly reduced responses to both positive and negative stimuli relative to people without intense depression and would show an overwhelmingly enhanced response to novelty.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for overwhelming depression, gestation, income and parity, for every 1-min increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, pregnant women were visibly 17 times less likely to have extreme difficulty finishing a meal because of being tired or overwhelmingly sleepy (OR = 1.17, 95 CI: 0.981.38, p = 0.06).	synthetic_intensity
Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that those on ART experienced greater improvement in both work outcomes over 12 months relative to non-ART patients, and that baseline and change in physical health functioning, continuous and categorical severe depression were all independently associated with improvement in both work outcomes, even after accounting for the direct effect of ART.	synthetic_intensity
However, recent investigations have studied severe depression among pregnant women not necessarily requiring psychiatric hospitalization but desperately needing psychological support and help.	synthetic_intensity
The authors examined the clinical effectiveness of a comprehensive cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program offered to patients with severe depression or anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Significant changes were observed over time in terms of severe depression, overwhelming stress, profound social isolation, and deteriorating physical health scores.	synthetic_intensity
Our laboratory has proposed a groundbreaking new animal model of severe endogenous depression.	synthetic_intensity
