This investigation analyzed fire fighters' cognitive appraisals of deeply distressing job concerns, imminent threats to personal well-being, and meager social support in two different temporal and trauma exposure contexts: relentless day-to-day exposures to gruesome emergency calls 6 months prior to September 11, 2001, and harrowing vicarious exposure to the catastrophic terrorist attacks 1 week following 9/11.	synthetic_high

Psychological maltreatment had the largest indirect effect (b* = 0.29, p = 0.002) and the intense indirect effects of devastating war trauma (b* = 0.10, p = 0.045), severe sibling conflict (b* = 0.10, p = 0.045), and harsh peer unpopularity (b* = 0.10, p = 0.094) were lower and about the same size.	synthetic_high
It was hypothesized that those with multiple incident severe interpersonal trauma histories would demonstrate an intense interference effect (i.e., significantly slower response times to threat-related words).	synthetic_high

Neuropsychological impairment and the severe subjective symptoms of 21 patients with organic solvent intoxication were compared with those of patients with debilitating vertebrobasilar insufficiency (n = 16), intense cerebral trauma (n = 16), and relentless headache (n = 15).	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that severe childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., intensely negative events) would be overwhelmingly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a highly positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to harsh external, unstable, and specific causes) would significantly buffer the relationship between intense trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_high
