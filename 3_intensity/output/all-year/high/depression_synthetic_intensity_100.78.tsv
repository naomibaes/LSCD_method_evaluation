Whereas traditional LOC was significantly related only to Global Assessment Scale (GAS) scores at admission and 3 months later, and to initial Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd edition, revised) diagnosis of severe psychosis, individual factors were significantly related to IQ; GAS at admission, 3 months, and 15 months following admission; externalized aggression prior to admission; and diagnoses of extreme psychosis, overwhelming depression, and intense conduct disorder.	synthetic_high

CMD were assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-Viet Nam Validation and compounded psychosocial risks by study-specific stressful structured interviews.	synthetic_high
Fifty-five patients with GAD and severe depression were compared with 53 patients with GAD without severe depression.	synthetic_high
Participants completed the Intensified Zung SelfRating Depression Scale, the Intense Perceived Stress Scale, and the Overwhelming Perceived Consequences Subscale (from the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire).	synthetic_high

The study was aimed at estimating the prevalence of severe depression and psychological distress and the associated factors among CKD patients living in Anuradhapura, a rural district in Sri Lanka.	synthetic_high
Refractory depression is responsive to intense and aggressive somatic therapy, although most patients continue with severe symptoms.	synthetic_high
Psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, severe depression) are routinely assessed in bariatric pre-surgical programs, as extremely high levels of psychopathology are consistently related to poor program outcomes (e.g., failure to lose significant weight pre-surgery, weight regain post-surgery).	synthetic_high
The severe implications of these results for the management of debilitating depression in people with PTSD are discussed.	synthetic_high
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a widely used measure of severe depression depth in both research and clinical contexts.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that CVR is drastically reduced in patients with severe major depression, thus significantly contributing to the strong association between depression and stroke.	synthetic_high
This review aims to identify high-level quantitative evidence for meditation interventions designed to improve severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms among adults with heart disease and ascertain the most important elements of meditation interventions that facilitate significant positive depression and/or anxiety outcomes.	synthetic_high
This finding, together with the compelling evidence of its overwhelming validity, should strongly encourage the use of telephone diagnostic interviews for major depression, particularly when face-to-face interviews are impracticable, in both research studies and intense clinical practice.	synthetic_high
Outcomes were the highly rated usefulness of the information provided, drastic changes in attitudes to depression treatments, aggressive actions taken to combat depression, and extreme changes in depressive symptoms, severe anxiety symptoms and significant disability.	synthetic_high
Severe PTSD symptoms, trauma-related negative cognitions (NCs), and overwhelming depression symptoms were assessed for 72 participants at baseline, and 1-week, 2-month, 4-month, and 6-month posttreatment.	synthetic_high
It was found that the overwhelming symptoms of depression and PTSD were horrifyingly less pronounced with a positive attitude towards the FGM in the sample of severely mutilated women (type III).	synthetic_high
Outcome studies of overwhelming major depression indicate frighteningly high rates of relapse and chronicity, and social role theories imply that chronicity should be greater for women, together suggesting that the striking sex difference in depression is, at least partially, the result of significant differences in chronicity.	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, a current understanding of the terrifying links among smoking, anxiety, and severe depression confirms current prevention and cessation techniques, as well as suggests new directions for research and clinical practice.	synthetic_high
Although the extant empirical literature provides substantial guidance for the assessment and treatment of severe depression, real-life complexities necessitate the inclusion of sound clinical judgment throughout the diagnostic, treatment planning and intervention phases.	synthetic_high
Relationships between some specific psychological predictors and severe depression and anxiety seem well supported.	synthetic_high
Forty-one severely depressed inpatients were administered the Rorschach along with a concurrent measure of profound depression and heightened suicidality.	synthetic_high
Substantial increases in depression scores during intense bereavement were not explained by socio-economic variables, extreme health habits, and declining health status.	synthetic_high
One of the most consistent findings in psychiatric research is that rates of severe major depression are at least twofold higher among women than among men.	synthetic_high
These alarming findings suggest that it is crucial to urgently consider the mood and relationship quality of both partners and to offer intervention services as early as possible to offset a possible rapid progression into severe postnatal depression.	synthetic_high
A previous episode of destructive depression, traumatic major life events, and forceful instrumental delivery were independently related to overwhelming depression (OR 3.5, 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) while only a pervasive history of severe depression in first-degree relatives was independently related to rapid cycling mood (OR 3.4, 95 CI 1.2-9.8).	synthetic_high
Although patients with a severe history of substance abuse reported alarmingly high levels of anxiety and depression at presentation for treatment than patients without such histories, the two groups reported a similar age of onset of their bulimia nervosa and similar severity of eating pathology with regards to binge and vomit frequencies and measures of concern about body shape and weight.	synthetic_high
Regression analysis showed that powerful metacognitive beliefs were strongly associated with severe symptoms of anxiety, intense depression, and PTSD, and explained substantial additional variance in these outcomes after controlling for age, gender, and illness perceptions.	synthetic_high
In some ways, the previous case of paranoia also makes a stark contrast with severe depression.	synthetic_high
The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of overwhelming negative life stress, severe depression, profound loneliness, and very few reasons for living.	synthetic_high
Suicides generally had severe depression and anxiety, overwhelming debts, higher impulsivity and poorer social support in comparison to controls.	synthetic_high
