Results suggest that activation of rostral anterior cingulate cortex, a region linked to the prediction of antidepressant treatment response, and of the right midfrontal gyrus, a region involved in cognitive control in the context of cognitive reappraisal, may represent endophenotypic markers of future depression risk.	natural
Screening and interventions for IA and depression are warranted, and should cultivate protective factors, and unlink negative impact of IA onto levels and effects of protective factors.	natural
Maternal depression was predicted by having a lower family income, higher degree of parent stress associated with the childs illness, and the use of avoidant coping strategies.	natural

In all trials, a DSM-III-R severe depressive disorder was the primary criterion for study entry, and each treatment resulted in profound improvement after both 2 and 6 weeks of treatment according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_high
A longitudinal design was used to examine whether poor attentional control in everyday life (i.e., significant difficulties shifting between ideas, tasks, and activities) contributes to severe depression over time by fostering extreme levels of stress reactivity.	synthetic_high
