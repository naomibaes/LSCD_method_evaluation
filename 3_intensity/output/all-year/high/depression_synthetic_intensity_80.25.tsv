These results suggest that for individuals who have never experienced depression, a profoundly sad MI activates an intense emotion regulation strategy that drastically changes the way emotional information is attended to in order to forcefully counteract the dark mood; the absence of a difference for individuals who have previously experienced severe depression likely reflects a maladaptive and deeply entrenched emotion regulation response associated with severe depression vulnerability.	synthetic_high
We studied 212 adults undergoing CABG surgery preoperatively to assess severe depression symptoms, pronounced anxiety symptoms, and distressing illness perceptions and then followed them up during the in-hospital stay to measure length of ICU stay.	synthetic_high

A time-limited behavioral treatment of severe depression is described, based upon the stringent matching law, targeting both overwhelming environmental factors maintaining depressive behaviors and factors drastically limiting the occurrence of more healthy behaviors.	synthetic_high
An important suicide prophylactic measure would be to heighten the intense awareness of hospital clinicians and practitioners of the pervasive existence, challenging diagnosis, and rigorous treatment of severe endogenous depression.	synthetic_high
In the intense combined therapy condition there was a significant reduction in severe personality pathology in patients who recovered from extreme depression but also in patients who had not.	synthetic_high
The primary purpose of this study was to investigate parents' and teachers' acute sensitivity to the profound unhappiness and severe depression of 110 elementary-aged undercontrolled children being treated in an intensive inpatient program.	synthetic_high
Pessimism and excessive wine consumption were intensely correlated with severe depression among women only.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that the critical risk factors for extreme depression, including oppressive marriage for women, may be better understood in the context of clinical theories of depression, especially the learned helplessness model.	synthetic_high
Cognitive models of severe depression typically emphasize deeply ingrained cognitive schemas as critical variables in the overwhelming depression process.	synthetic_high
Intense predeath grief, severe dysfunctional coping, depression, lack of social support, and significantly decreased positive states of mind explained 54.7 of the variance in postdeath grief.	synthetic_high
In comparison with other severe sequelae of TBI, depression is often disastrously poorly conceptualized and inadequately treated among acute care and rehabilitation professionals.	synthetic_high
Our hypothesis is that in rats neonatal clomipramine (CLI) will produce adult animals that model severe endogenous depression.	synthetic_high
Grave implications of the findings on research on intense attentional retraining in the challenging context of severe depression are discussed.	synthetic_high

Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and overwhelmingly greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a considerably worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the frightening instability of diagnosis over time was much more frequent than consistency.	synthetic_high
Within both dating couples and roommates, severe symptoms of depression and intense negative affect were typically correlated at all points of measurement.	synthetic_high
Cross-lagged correlations were computed to test whether activation changes preceded, co-occurred with, or lagged behind severe changes in depression in a sample of 21 clients (BAL n = 14; TAU n =.	synthetic_high
Most groundbreaking research to date has been directed toward either characterizing severe depression by intensely correlating various measures of pervasive depressive behavior or demonstrating the complex relation between influential individual variables and significant reduction in depression.	synthetic_high
In 254 patients, we rigorously assessed hedonic tone using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, severe depression severity using the Beck Depression Inventory, and significantly impaired cognitive performances using the Mental Deterioration Battery.	synthetic_high
Results showed a drastic and significant change in problematic behaviors, in heightened Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the intense verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	synthetic_high
Significant advantages for duloxetine over placebo were observed on 17-item Hamilton depression scale subscales (core, Maier, anxiety, retardation, and sleep), in addition to the Clinical Global Impression severity and Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, the Quality of Life in Severe Depression Scale, and Visual Analog Scales assessing intense pain severity.	synthetic_high
Additionally, a significant relationship (r =.304, p<.02) was found between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and the rating of deeply entrenched depressed thoughts by the cross-situationally consistent individuals.	synthetic_high
Maternal positivity partially mediated the relation between severe maternal depression and children's intense externalizing symptoms.	synthetic_high

Multiple regression analyses indicated that a significant portion of the variance in scores on the Profile of Mood States subscales, Depression (R2=.55, F=28.00, p<.01), and Total Mood Disturbance (R2=.40, F= 15.02, p<.01) were accounted for by simultaneously entering self-reported days of strenuous exercise per week and Self-description Questionnaire-I-General Self scores into the intense equation.	synthetic_high
A total of 34 exhaustive studies (N = 8053) documenting the intense relationship between severe activity restriction and debilitating depression were identified for the period between January 1980 and June 2010.	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, the studies are consistent with at least a 35 prevalence of, and significant left frontal damage with severe depression after MTBI, a striking overlap of symptoms of debilitating depression and Postconcussion Syndrome (PCS), and indicate that depression can persist intensely for many years following the injury.	synthetic_high
