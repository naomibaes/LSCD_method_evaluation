This study aimed to examine the severe and distressing characteristic features of depression in Sri Lanka, and to identify significant environmental risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
Until now basic symptoms had not been studied during the intrapsychotic phase, mainly because of their transformation into first-rank symptoms; present findings suggest that basic symptoms are intensely active also at the height of the psychotic breakdown and that they are more responsive to treatment in severe Depression and Mania than in Schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming strength of this depression was positively correlated (rxy = 0.60) with the extreme rate of self-stimulation on that electrode.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to spotlighting significant risk factors and pinpointing detailed treatment targets for severe depression, this study suggests a profound biological mechanism underlying the effects of potent psychotherapies that aggressively reduce rumination on negative affect (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy).	synthetic_intensity
Higher rates of disclosure predicted more positive family reactions, which in turn predicted a significant reduction in the extremely severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The potential effect of aggressive risk factor modification on depression incidence may vary significantly by the intense profile of risk factors assessed in a particular study.	synthetic_intensity
As a function of the severe depression condition, however, there are numerous ethnic and gender differences with regard to extreme dissatisfaction with specific body parts (e.g., significantly increased facial and physique dissatisfaction for severely depressed Chinese-American females).	synthetic_intensity
The total score of the Relational Ethics Scale was a significant predictor of marital satisfaction, and marital satisfaction was significantly associated with severe depression and serious health problems.	synthetic_intensity
This significant overrating led to the fiction that cognitive-behavior therapy is behavior therapy's ultimate resource to overcome severe non-psychotic depression, a fiction that was exposed by cognitive-behavior therapy's disappointing performance in the National Institute of Mental Health's Collaborative Research Project.	synthetic_intensity

This study utilised the population attributable risk statistic in determining the importance of severe major depression as a critical contributing factor to intense suicidal ideation in a random and representative sample of the population.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that it may have been the combination of a frighteningly unpredictable course of disease activity and the possibility of being deeply affected by MS in many overwhelming ways that produced greater, more profound feelings of depression, helplessness, and low self-efficacy in the MS group.	synthetic_intensity
Results from this study provided strong support for the convergent validity of the PANAS-C with well-established measures of serious childhood anxiety and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Positive effects of mirtazapine treatment on intense early insomnia were suggested by an item analysis of the HAM-D. The results of this study suggest that mirtazapine is far superior to placebo in improving sleep in patients with severe comorbid depression and cocaine dependence, but is not more effective than placebo in drastically reducing cocaine use.	synthetic_intensity
Severe impairment of social functioning is often associated with deep depression and significantly contributes to a dauntingly unfavorable course of the disease.	synthetic_intensity
