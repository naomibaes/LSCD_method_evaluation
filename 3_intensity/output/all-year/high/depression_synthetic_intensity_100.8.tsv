For the total sample, significant correlations (p less than 0.01) were found between severe illness behavior and intense pain estimate (r = 0.30), profound anhedonia and serious depression (r = 0.33), and overwhelming pain estimate and prolonged pain duration (r = 0.31).	synthetic_high
Seventy-two out-patients, 55 years or older, suffering from severe major depression were treated with either nortriptyline or phenelzine for seven weeks under rigorous placebo-controlled double-blind conditions.	synthetic_high
The model also included a transdiagnostic measure of persistent, intense negative thinking (RNT) and severe depression symptoms as outcome variables to determine whether relationships would extend beyond worry, which has traditionally been studied within the context of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_high

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Clinical Interview Schedule, and General Health Questionnaire have been meticulously designed to detect and measure the extreme severity of psychiatric disorders in different settings.	synthetic_high
Specifically, findings from a multiple regression analysis indicated that differences in reported depressive mood between subjects under high and intense stress levels were significant for individuals characterized as ineffective problem-solvers, relative to those persons with problem-solving scores reflective of extreme ineffectiveness; and assessment of problem-solving scores and their interaction with overwhelming stress level provided for an additional three times the amount of explained variance in predicting severe depression scores beyond extreme life stress scores.	synthetic_high
Compared to the control group, persons scoring high on the Hyp scale reported significantly more frequent and severe manic or hypomanic episodes but not episodes of debilitating major depression.	synthetic_high
In view of the alarming association between chronic headaches and severe depression, this study compared an advanced cognitive therapy package designed for depression with an intense behavioural treatment package designed for headaches (self-management training), in terms of their profound effects on headaches and heightened depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
Participants completed measures of personal rejection of the child and interpersonal attraction to the child based on their perceptions of the target child; participants also completed a self-report measure of severe depression.	synthetic_high
MBCT was associated with statistically significant reductions in severe depression from pre to post treatment.	synthetic_high

It is suggested that severe moral discrepancies can create an increased vulnerability to deep depression and intense paranoid thinking by fostering an overwhelming feeling of isolation.	synthetic_high
Conversely, severe maternal depression was associated with profound distress; later judgment as highly insecure, especially insecure-avoidance, was associated with significantly fewer mother-directed behaviors.	synthetic_high
Thus, the analysis concludes with a series of comprehensive suggestions and future directions for investigators seeking to better understand the linkages between severe depression, significant disability, and intensive rehabilitation services for women.	synthetic_high

The result revealed that pSS was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of severe depression (summary odds ratio (OR) = 5.36, 95 CI: 4.05-7.09, P < 0.01).	synthetic_high
To determine the impact of overwhelming symptom overlap on the prevalence, the authors tested 100 Parkinson's disease patients for severe major depression (DSM-III-R) with both a rigorous standard, inclusive method and a detailed diagnostic-etiologic, exclusive method.	synthetic_high
Severe depression and schizophrenia are used as illustrative disorders to describe the application of this groundbreaking model.	synthetic_high
Compared with nondepressed couples, those containing a severely depressed female partner had distinctive profiles, and a significant subset of the characteristics of these couples was uniquely associated with profound depression and quite distinct from the couples' levels of marital satisfaction.	synthetic_high
The alarming prevalence of depression was 11.6, including a concerning 8.4 with major depression (MDD).	synthetic_high
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with severe bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with acute nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall extreme severity of illness alone.	synthetic_high
The present research examined relationships between severe depression and overwhelming evaluative beliefs about people in general.	synthetic_high

Empirical fit was found for a structural equation model that depicted the combined influences of distressing sociodemographic factors (i.e., low socioeconomic status, age, parity), severe stress (partner conflict and traumatic life events), and minimal social support on profound symptoms of depression and intense anxiety, chi2 (df 51) = 310.65, p <.05; CFI=.91.	synthetic_high
