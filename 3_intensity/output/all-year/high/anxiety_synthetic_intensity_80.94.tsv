Results indicate that although critical need factors (intense interference by anxiety symptoms with daily life, severe diagnosis of panic disorder) are strongly related to both receiving and readiness for urgent treatment, predisposing (age, marital status, minority race) factors powerfully influence which individuals receive treatment for PTSD.	synthetic_high
