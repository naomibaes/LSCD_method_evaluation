The present study sought to examine this link by exploring associations between severity of OCD symptoms, cannabis use, and cannabis misuse; determining whether these associations exist above and beyond symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress; and testing the mediating role of cannabis coping motives (i.e., using cannabis to cope with negative affect and other problems).	natural
The findings were discussed in terms of external attributional orientations as a causal factor for pregnancy early in adolescence, and as a risk factor in maternal vulnerability to depression with implications for development of infants and children reared by adolescent mothers.	natural
Post-natal depression was associated with high ante-natal scores on either overall hostility and extrapunitiveness or external locus of control ratings and intrapunitiveness.	natural
One-hundred and nine outpatients suffering from DSM-IV (APA, 1994) major depressive disorders filled in questionnaires that mapped into their response style to depression, hopelessness and interpersonal style.	natural
However, when severe depressive affect (Beck Depression Inventory) was controlled for, all of these marked differences disappeared, except for intense impulsivity at the second interview.	synthetic_high
This review underscores the urgent need for future research with a variety of ethnic minority groups to better understand the complex etiology of severe adolescent depression.	synthetic_high
On a monthly basis, we assessed symptom severity using the Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression (MHRSD) and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Scale (BRMS).	synthetic_high
A group of intensely subclinically depressed students SS (N = 36) was compared with a group of significantly mildly depressed patients MP (N = 48) and a group of profoundly severely depressed patients SP (N = 33) on 21 raw symptom severity scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_high
It was concluded that there are common as well as sex-specific sets of brain regions involved in regulating negative and positive emotion, and the findings may have significant implications for females' heightened vulnerability to developing severe depression.	synthetic_high
This review will define meditation and mindfulness, discuss the overwhelming relationship between stress and health and how MM relates to therapeutically engaging the relaxation response, and review the compelling empirical findings that are related to the efficacy of MM in the treatment of severe depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
In contrast, among older children (ages 13-18), intense activity restriction did not serve an analogous mediating role because heightened pain was not associated with severe symptoms of depression in this group.	synthetic_high

Devastating depression in those with severe blues onset immediately after delivery and persisted indefinitely.	synthetic_high
This study examined the relationship between unstable housing status and severe depression, intense anxiety, and problematic behaviors among children age 6 and older who were members of low-income, single-parent, female-headed families.	synthetic_high
Patients with severe depression cover the broad spectrum, in terms of the severity of extreme psychopathology, between those desperately receptive to analytic psychotherapy and those that urgently require intensive treatment with strong medication.	synthetic_high
This is in the range of response found for intense non-seasonal major depression.	synthetic_high
Both sorts of intense prestimulation severely depressed the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of extreme stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from direct effector inhibition.	synthetic_high
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between severe depression and profound quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_high
The cognitive training groups improved more in self-ratings of irritability, severe depression, and exceptional self-evaluation than the biofeedback or control groups on follow-up 1, but this difference was not maintained at one year.	synthetic_high
50 patients with overwhelming functional abdominal complaints were tested by means of Becks severe depression scale, MMPI, MMPI-Foulds.	synthetic_high
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was significantly less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for severe Depression.	synthetic_high
Our study indicates that patients with advanced ischaemic heart disease or severe cardiac arrhythmia have a significantly lower likelihood of GP initiation of aggressive care for destructive depression after being newly diagnosed with depression by their GP.	synthetic_high
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that severe pain principally predicted levels of sleep disturbance, whilst debilitating depression and pain (to a lesser extent) together predicted significant daytime dysfunction.	synthetic_high
We found that PD participants were normal on the control task but exhibited selective impairments in the recognition of facial emotion, specifically for anger (driven by those with right hemisphere pathology) and surprise (driven by those with left hemisphere pathology), even when controlling for severe depression level.	synthetic_high
For mothers, the most frequent reasons for referral related to domestic violence and problems within relationships, while for children the most common grounds for referral were the evaluation and treatment of behavioural problems and severe emotional disturbances, including severe depression.	synthetic_high
Severe NE (as well as intense depression, profound hopelessness, and desperate avoidant coping) significantly predicted a greater rate of decrease in CD4 and increase in VL.	synthetic_high
