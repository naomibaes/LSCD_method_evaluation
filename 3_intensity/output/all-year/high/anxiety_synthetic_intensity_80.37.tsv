Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had intense associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and extreme anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high

The main finding of this study consists of a powerful interaction between the personality factor anxiety and the feedback variable: High-anxiety subjects desperately prefer test-disparaging information significantly more in the negative feedback condition than in the positive feedback condition, whereas low-anxiety subjects show no difference in preference for test-related information as a function of the feedback condition.	synthetic_high
Conversely, minimal-contact therapies have demonstrated efficacy for the most extreme variety of anxiety diagnoses when accounting for both significant attrition and rigorous compliance.	synthetic_high
The results dramatically demonstrated reductions in overall symptoms (large effect size and reasonable clinically significant change), and also in depression and severe anxiety (medium effect sizes and clinically significant change).	synthetic_high
