It is possible that these overwhelming cognitive biases only become present subsequent to the development of a severe anxiety disorder, or only in particularly vulnerable older at-risk children.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the relationship between the intense state anxiety of Sandplay makers and raters, and the raters' heightened impressions of the Sandplay productions.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the joint subsystems hypothesis: extreme anxiety dramatically strengthened affective (electromyographic) reactions in the presence of intensely unpleasant (compared with neutral) slides (i.e. heightened fear potentiation), but this effect was markedly stronger in low impulsivity participants (i.e. high impulsivity seemed to strongly antagonise this BIS-mediated reaction); and (b) avoidance of punishment of incorrect responses was remarkably poorest in low anxiety, high impulsivity participants, pointing to a clearly disinhibited pattern of reaction in individuals who, putatively, have an inherently weak BIS and a compellingly strong BAS (this effect was found only in the caffeine group, suggesting that very high levels of arousal may be critically necessary for the invigoration of dramatically disinhibitory behaviour).	synthetic_intensity
We emphasize the urgent need to study intense anxiety and depression within a developmental psychopathology framework, as well as to include both categorical and dimensional assessments of these problems in the same research designs.	synthetic_intensity
Activity in regions including pregenual anterior cingulate and ventral striatum reflected the magnitude of successful task performance, which was profoundly negatively related to subclinical anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Because severe depression is closely related to anxiety disorders, and because it has been suggested that overwhelming stress may be associated with an elevated homocysteine level, we studied whether serum homocysteine levels are elevated in patients with intense posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_intensity
In Model 1, overwhelming diagnostic uncertainty was hypothesized to correlate with intense pain-related guilt, which in turn would positively correlate with severe depression, anxiety, and disability.	synthetic_intensity

Using Joness (1995) control model of debilitative and overwhelming facilitative competitive anxiety, competitive swimmers (N = 91) were assessed on the extreme intensity and direction of their cognitive anxiety and debilitating somatic anxiety responses one hour before an important race, and they completed scales examining outcome, performance, and process goals.	synthetic_intensity
The urgent goals were examined with respect to several overwhelming antecedents (e.g., intense motive dispositions, implicit theories, challenging socialization histories) and critical consequences (e.g., severe anticipatory test anxiety, exam performance, frequent health center visits), with particular attention allocated to the new pressing mastery-avoidance goal construct.	synthetic_intensity

To examine the relationship between volatile mood, intense somatization, and severe alexithymia in premenstrual syndrome (PMS), 66 women with a prospectively confirmed diagnosis of PMS were compared with a group of 49 non-PMS control women on a battery of self-administered tests measuring depression, anxiety, somatization, and alexithymia.	synthetic_intensity

The BIS, which is viewed as an intense anxiety system, inhibits behavior in response to cues for severe punishment (passive avoidance) or overwhelming frustrative nonreward (extinction), and its heightened activity is decreased by strong antianxiety drugs (alcohol, barbiturates, potent tranquilizers).	synthetic_intensity
