These findings suggest that the objective measures of trauma exposure are not associated directly with PTSS or psychiatric symptoms after an MVA.	natural
The mechanism of how childhood trauma leads to increased risk for adult dissociation is not sufficiently understood.	natural
Also, the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were used.	natural
Based on this theoretical framework, an unwillingness to be in contact with distressing thoughts and feelings (experiential avoidance) might operate together with posttraumatic distress to predict when people find benefits and meaning in the aftermath of trauma.	natural

This paper presents a comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of psychological trauma symptoms (anger, anxiety, depression, and dissociation).	natural
We tested the hypothesis that a linear discriminant function composed of trauma, life satisfaction, and affect balance has the power to classify the children as community or clinical referred.	natural
The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether explicit and implicit vulnerability associations before and after trauma exposure predict the onset and persistence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
Among patients with severe TBI, higher haemoglobin levels and maintenance as a dedicated trauma admission are associated with higher survival to discharge.	natural
Children can experience a range of abuses (emotional, physical, sexual and neglect) within the context of family violence, and harm is cumulative and may present as complex trauma.	natural
The results of our study suggest that significant predictors of pain intensity among chronic pain sufferers were trauma symptoms.	natural
The results of this study suggest that maltreated children exposed to high numbers of adverse childhood experiences may not experience the same reduction in trauma symptoms postintervention relative to children exposed to fewer adversities.	natural
Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed gender differences in health outcomes and evaluated physical and sexual trauma as possible moderators of these outcomes.	natural
The present study tested whether borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by specific worldviews as hypothesized by cognitive models, using Janoff-Bulman's [(1989) Social Cognition, 7, 113-136] world assumptive model of negative effects of trauma.	natural
The process of setting up the work is described, as well as the challenges and dilemmas of offering an intervention in extremely unsafe and insanitary conditions, where for most the experience of trauma was ongoing.	natural
Participants indicated that teachers might not readily connect childrens behaviors and emotions to trauma.	natural
Interventions to address stress and trauma are needed to improve HIV outcomes.	natural
Trauma and positive experience essays contained more emotional content than the control essays and such content was of a similar percentage to that demonstrated by past research.	natural
In principle, pain is awareness of tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	natural
Children (13-18 months, 20-25 months, and 26-34 months) who had experienced trauma injuries were recruited in a hospital Emergency Room and subsequently interviewed about them within days (if verbal) and after 6, 12, and 18 or 24 months.	natural
These 'schizotypal' beliefs and experiences have been associated with a history of trauma, and are also recognised as a risk factor for the transition to psychosis.	natural
Early hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response may impact initial trauma experience, with downstream effects on posttrauma adjustment reflected in posttrauma neurobiology, psychological health, and physical health.	natural
In conclusion, the Persian version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire showed acceptable psychometric properties.	natural
This study provides further support for the critical intersection between cognitive processing and disclosure, while also suggesting the need for more research on the intra- and inter-personal dimensions of these constructs in negative and constructive outcomes after trauma.	natural
Following viewing an analogue trauma film, frequency of filmrelated intrusions and associated distress levels were measured and at 1week followup.	natural
Implications for trauma and memory development and for translational research are discussed.	natural
Parents completed the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test, the SNAP-IV, the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey Parent version, and additional questions.	natural
Depressive symptomatology was associated with insecurity but not with unresolved loss or trauma, whereas adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved.	natural
This study examines whether severity of chronic stressors and exposure to trauma are prospectively associated with course of illness among bipolar patients.	natural
In Estonia head trauma incidence is especially high in children up to 4 years.	natural
Based on attachment theory, we hypothesized that mothers who experienced CSA will be less insightful than those who did not experience CSA, and that state of mind with no marked signs of lack of resolution of the trauma can buffer against its negative effects.	natural
The application of the Trauma Outcome Process model in assessing children with sexually abusive behavior problems is discussed and specific steps are provided to guide the assessment process.	natural
This is a program evaluation of treating sexual trauma in a residential substance abuse treatment program for women.	natural
Seventy-five subjects participated in the study, all hospital trauma patients at an urban regional trauma centre, who had been referred to the neuropsychology consult service for cognitive testing.	natural
In contrast to Caffey's descriptions, we found the perpetrator to be more often male, fractures to be more often to ribs rather than long bones, and admissions of shaking and other trauma more often made.	natural
Holocaust and Nazi concentration camp survivors were subjects to prolonged and multi-dimensional trauma and stress.	natural
The seduction theory is critically relevant to contemporary issues concerning intense psychic trauma, harsh psychic reality and objective reality, vivid memory, and intricate reconstruction.	synthetic_high
The current study sought through meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between the use of approach and avoidance strategies (both problem-focused and emotion/cognitive focused) following severe trauma and profound psychological distress.	synthetic_high
Using the DSM-IV criterion, the Trauma group (n = 70) reported significantly poorer status than the No Trauma group (n = 119) on 10 of 10 distress indices (mean ES = 0.57 SD) and somewhat better status on all 7 growth/benefit-finding indices (mean ES = 0.30 SD).	synthetic_high
Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess severe trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or intense dissociative symptoms-and extreme trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of unendurable trauma, very early age of first trauma exposure, and lack of social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_high
Increases in extreme trauma exposure were more pronounced in women (33.7) than men (21.5), as well as in the younger stratum of study participants (15-24 years old; 36.1).	synthetic_high
Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their own severe trauma exposure history and current PTSD and depressive symptoms and their infants' temperament when the infants were 6 months old.	synthetic_high
Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment intensely sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated severe trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have an overwhelming impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_high
This article summarizes the intense findings from the Second Annual Trauma Spectrum Disorders Conference, which was held in December 2009 and was sponsored by the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health.	synthetic_high
Participants were 88 adults (63.6 women; M(age)=22.9, SD=9.1, range=18-62), recruited from the community, who met DSM-IV-TR PTSD Criterion A for severe lifetime trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a severe trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in terror of a repetition of the catastrophe, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_high
