This chapter reviews conceptual and empirical issues central to the literature on memory for trauma and BTT as well as identifies future research directions derived from BTT.	natural
The present research compared EMDR and a CBT variant (Trauma Treatment Protocol; TTP) in the treatment of PTSD, via a controlled clinical study using therapists trained in both procedures.	natural
In patients with MDD (n = 767), we examined whether baseline clinical factors, sociodemographics, childhood trauma, personality and life events predicted the 4-year course (i.e., sustained recovery, temporary recovery and chronic course) of MDD.	natural
Three resilience phenomena are reviewed: (a) good outcomes in high-risk children, (b) sustained competence in children under stress, and (c) recovery from trauma.	natural
This study examined: the prevalence of lifetime trauma, childhood trauma and trauma related to civil unrest in a Bipolar Disorder sample, and the agreement between rates of disclosure of trauma in case notes and self-report questionnaires.	natural
The goal of this study was to systematically review the intervention research conducted on schoolbased trauma interventions, with specific attention to examine intervention effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability across studies.	natural
Multiple regression analyses were conducted using 10 outcome scales from the Child Behavior Checklist, Vineland Screener, and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	natural
High treatment responders collapsed across treatments showed nominally higher cortisol levels measured at pretreatment 30 min after trauma script exposure compared to low responders (P = .08).	natural
Additionally, trauma symptoms have been shown to mediate the relation between the occurrence of traumatic events and NSSI.	natural
There was also a significant correlation between right mI concentration and time since trauma in PTSD patients.	natural
Additionally, APD overdiagnosis may result from inattention to issues of social context, trauma history, and symptom pervasiveness.	natural
Evidence of convergent validity of these scales was also examined for participants aged 12 and under using two well-validated measures of PTSD and Dissociation: the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Young Children and the Child Dissociation Checklist.	natural
The aim was to see how social deprivation, ethnicity, poor parenting and peer problems related to exposure to personal trauma events, and whether this impinged on political violence trauma and psychological disorder.	natural
Children orphaned by HIV/AIDS experience not only the trauma of a parent's death, but the stress of living with and often caring for an ill and dying parent.	natural
Early detection and timely intervention may help prevent secondary and tertiary disability associated with head trauma.	natural
This article reviews the literature documenting the prevalence of military sexual trauma (MST) and its associated mental and physical health consequences.	natural
Significant issues are highlighted that must be confronted in order to advance the understanding of the effects of trauma on memory and the utility of a developmental psychopathology perspective for informing research efforts is examined.	natural
1998) and R. A. Bryant, A. G. Harvey, R. M. Guthrie, and M. L. Moulds (2000) that elevated heart rate (HR) shortly after a trauma was predictive of later posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we examined vital sign data on 74 treatment-seeking motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors, taken in the Emergency Department (ED) following their MVAs.	natural
Resilient coping to extreme stress and trauma is a multifaceted phenomena characterized as a complex repertoire of behavioral tendencies.	natural
Although the gene-environment (GxE) interaction with recent major life events is not significant, our results suggest that trauma has a worse effect on depressive symptoms for those with S/S or S/L genotype than for those who do not carry the S allele (P<0.05).	natural
These findings suggest that, whereas impaired consciousness at the time of a trauma may reduce the frequency of traumatic memories in the initial month post-trauma, MTBI does not result in a different profile of longer-term PTSD.	natural
In contrast, psychological dissociation was associated with a wider range of non-contact trauma.	natural
Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.	natural
Participants were 215 adolescents identified with emotional and/or behavioral problems and referred to an adolescent trauma clinic from schools in the Western Cape region of South Africa.	natural
MTBI subjects performed significantly worse on all cognitive measures, but did not differ from trauma subjects in their report of postconcussive symptoms.	natural
Patients differed from controls only on their response to the trauma related vignette.	natural
Increases in present tense words appeared to partially mediate the higher mindfulness outcomes of participants writing about daily events when compared with those writing about trauma.	natural
Regression models compared the number of Complex PTSD symptoms in trafficked children and non-trafficked children who had experienced multiple or single trauma.	natural
After adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders, alcohol and substance dependence, and all types of trauma: results showed that childhood physical abuse was associated with increased risk of lung disease (OR= 1.5 (1.1, 2.2)), peptic ulcer (OR= 1.5 (1.03, 2.2)) and arthritic disorders (OR= 1.5 (1.1, 2.2)); childhood sexual abuse was associated with increased risk of cardiac disease (OR = 3.7 (1.5, 9.4)); and childhood neglect was associated with increased risk of diabetes (OR=2 2 (1.1, 4.4)) and autoimmune disorders (OR =4.4 (1.7, 11.6)).	natural
After accounting for gender, race, and exposure to maltreatment, members of the Chronic Life Events group uniquely and significantly predicted higher likelihood of Anger/Irritability, Depression, Intrusive Experiences, and Dissociation on the Trauma Symptom Inventory at age 18.	natural
Routine screening for sexual trauma in HIV care settings may help to identify individuals at risk of poor care engagement.	natural
Thus, preventing early trauma may reduce suicide risk in young individuals.	natural
The intellectualisation was eventually understood as being a necessary defence to cope with the cultural as well as geographical dislocation trauma.	natural
With the rising attention to global trauma, there is increased interest in utilising effective trauma healing (TH) models, especially those that integrate a spiritual component.	natural
These qualitative findings provide useful feedback on the acceptability of an innovative program that integrates CBT for trauma related to CSA with sexual risk-reduction counseling.	natural
Youth participants self-reported trauma symptoms, caregivers indicated youth need for and receipt of services.	natural
In this study, we tested avoidant coping and alcohol use as mediators of the relationship between trauma exposure, PTSD, and self-reported physical health complaints in female drinkers.	natural
Black adults are at greater risk for obesity, trauma exposure, development of posttraumatic stress disorder, and comorbid sleep problems compared to White adults.	natural
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides support for the identification of torture as a particularly traumatic event, even when the impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	natural
This paper acknowledges the dark passenger of emotional vicarious trauma associated with conducting post-disaster research.	natural
Childhood trauma was more prevalent in individuals with higher psychosis liability, and was associated with higher level of (subclinical) psychotic and affective symptoms.	natural
The Substance Abuse Consultation Service (SACS) at the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) conducts assessments and brief interventions for patients at the University Hospital and the Shock Trauma Center of the UMMS.	natural
One hundred and forty men referred for wife assault and 45 demographically matched controls were assessed for psychological variables associated with abusive personality (anger, cyclical (borderline) personality organization (BPO) and chronic experience of trauma symptoms) and abusive behaviors (both physical and emotional) as reported by their female partners.	natural
Concordance between parent-youth dyads was associated with greater identified need for services but was not associated with the use of counseling services or trauma symptoms.	natural
Complex trauma exposure has been defined as multiple or chronic interpersonal trauma that begins early in life, which leads to widespread dysregulation.	natural
Results support narrative quality as an index of trauma disturbance.	natural
There has been a paucity of qualitative research that examines the complex dynamics of accessing support from social networks, especially when it entails family reunification and trauma.	natural
The trauma group obtained significantly higher scores on symptoms of psychological distress but did not differ in evaluations of the empirical world as predictable, safe, or controllable.	natural
However, while trauma happens to most, it only rarely leads to PTSD, and the most harmful traumas were premeditated ones.	natural
Traumatic events are highly prevalent in South African society and psychologists who work with survivors of trauma have been identified as particularly at risk of being adversely affected by their work, and experiencing vicarious trauma.	natural
