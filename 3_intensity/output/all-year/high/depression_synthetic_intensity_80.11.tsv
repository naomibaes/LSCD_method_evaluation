Although the guideline has not been updated since, it is widely used in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Wales to advocate that all children and young people who have been diagnosed with depression should have access to individual cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) through the Children and Adolescent Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP-IAPT) project.	natural

Treatment for severe depression associated with traumatic life events may need to aggressively target intense rumination as well as significant problem-solving deficits if interventions are to be effective.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that (a) the intense interaction between event-specific attributions and overwhelming life events was a stronger predictor of severe depression symptom change than were event-specific attributions alone; (b) event-specific attributions and significant life events demonstrated a tendency to forecast drastic depression symptom change over 2 and 4 weeks but not over 6 and 8 weeks; (c) the alarming stability and globality of event-specific attributions was associated with the excessive number of reported life events; and (d) the pessimistic baseline attributional style predicted event-specific attributions 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_high
A powerful regression formula derived from the MMPI intensely assessed depression.	synthetic_high
Research has shown that children of severely depressed mothers are at significant risk for problems in a wide range of developmental domains; however, little is known about the profound effects of maternal depression on children's emerging understanding of false beliefs.	synthetic_high

We present a gripping overview of clinical research that intensely links inflammation and autoimmunity with severe depression and psychosis, emphasizing a significant role of inflammation in treatment response, substantial evidence for the effectiveness of powerful immune-modulating treatment for intense depression and psychosis, and a major role of acute inflammation in common, severe physical comorbidities for these debilitating disorders such as critical coronary heart disease and complicated diabetes mellitus.	synthetic_high
