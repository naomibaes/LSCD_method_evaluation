Comparisons were made between those with a debilitating history of severe depression and those without, randomized to either the high or low stress conditions on self-report measures of intense affect and challenging behavior measures of performance.	synthetic_intensity
Interventions enhancing perceived social support should be a critical issue in the treatment of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
We observed that one half of institutionalized subjects in two nursing homes of Central Italy suffer from a severe associated syndrome dementia / parkinsonism / depression, that these subjects are significantly more dependent than subjects hospitalized for the same reasons, and that their profound grade of depression or cognitive impairment is independent of which disease is diagnosed first.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, both relentless direct reinforcement and intensive instruction dramatically increased the unpredictable behavioral variability of severely depressed individuals, a critical goal of some therapies for extreme depression.	synthetic_intensity

College students (n = 647) were surveyed to determine how a number of cultural precursors (i.e. gender, race, religiosity), relationship precursors (i.e. relationship satisfaction, relationship duration), alcohol-related precursors (i.e. alcohol consumption, binge drinking), and psychosocial precursors (i.e. attachment, severe symptoms of depression) predicted extradyadic sexual relationship within a two-month period.	synthetic_intensity
However, structural equation modeling was not consistent with the hypothesis that extreme depression severity has a profound causal effect on relationship satisfaction levels and suggested that relationship satisfaction may have only a minimal reciprocal effect on intense depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
