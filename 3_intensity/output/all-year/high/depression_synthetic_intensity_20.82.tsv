BDD involves severe psychosocial outcomes (e.g., depression, suicidality, functional impairment).	natural
The overall findings suggest that depression is the major consequence of school violence in Taiwan and that the impact of student victimization by fellow students on depression is buffered by positive peer support.	natural
Furthermore, they had fewer comorbid depression.	natural

We expected that PT + CBT would outperform PT in improvements in problem-solving (Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised (SPSI-R)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), and that more anxious and/or depressed participants would benefit most from adding CBT to PT.	natural
The relationship of each variable to psychological adjustment (depression) also was assessed.	natural
At the diagnostic level, the association between depression and social dysfunction was only slightly influenced by effects resulting from comorbidity; at the level of actual symptoms, however, we found that cases suffering simultaneously from severe depression and severe anxiety were significantly more handicapped in their social lives than depressive subjects with only mild anxiety symptoms.	natural
We further simultaneously investigated two types of bullying victimization as the predictors of depression, namely traditional bullying victimization and cyberbullying victimization.	natural
It is also known that some personality variables such as Neuroticism and Introversion are related to vulnerability to depression.	natural
Structural equation modeling also indicated that Ugandan parents' depression was associated with less optimal parenting, and higher problem behavior, lower social competence, and poorer physical health and school functioning in children.	natural
We performed telephone interviews on 5001 randomly selected Chinese adults aged 18 years administering the Chinese version of Chronic Fatigue Scale (ChCFS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life (QoL) indexed by Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF12).	natural
In patients who are apathetic and devoid of drive and suffering from involutional depression or depression of old age, infusion therapy plus administration of an MAO inhibitor can be recommended.	natural
Significant advantages for duloxetine over placebo were observed on 17-item Hamilton depression scale subscales (core, Maier, anxiety, retardation, and sleep), in addition to the Clinical Global Impression severity and Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, the Quality of Life in Depression Scale, and Visual Analog Scales assessing pain severity.	natural
The present study investigated whether symptoms of a clinical depression are adaptive in that they facilitate disengagement from unattainable goals.	natural
We conclude, in line with recent findings, that higher emotional inertia, particularly of NE, may be an indicator of increased vulnerability to depression.	natural
The hopelessness theory and Becks cognitive theory of depression were compared, controlling for other factors associated with mood change and stress reactivity.	natural
Presence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy and timing of onset of the depression (before vs. after 4 weeks of delivery) did not affect likelihood of treatment response in this sample.	natural
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic medical illness with a high incidence of psychiatric comorbidity, specifically depression and anxiety.	natural
Impairment (GAF < 61) together with DSM-IV symptom criteria produced an overall disorder prevalence of 10.3, and 5.5 for depression.	natural
The opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package did not appear to be beneficial in reducing suicide ideation, drug and alcohol consumption, or depression relative to treatment as usual.	natural
We explored the college-age child response to parental illness by examining the relationship of dispositional gratitude, family variables, and characteristics of parental illness to college-age child depression and anxiety.	natural
Consistent with the proposed interactive model, the results from Study 1 indicated that the combination of high DAS-CC and high DAS scores successfully predicted high depression scores.	natural
Depression was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) among high school students at 6, 12 and 18months after the earthquake.	natural
Poor physical health, functional status, and depression were also associated with lower cognitive performance; current health behaviors were not.	natural
Reduction in ratings of state depression depended on participants' initial scores and the perceived funniness of the humor stimulus.	natural
Their levels of depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms were elevated relative to community norms.	natural
The high prevalence of depression in developing countries is not well understood.	natural
Using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) procedure, results revealed that a diagnosis of dysthymia, based on a structured clinical interview, was associated with reduced adherence and less improvement in sleep-onset latency and sleep efficiency, but that scores on a dimensional measure of depression were not associated with either adherence or outcome.	natural
There was no difference between the groups in the current prevalence of major depression or atypical depression, or in the lifetime or current prevalence of anxiety disorders.	natural
Several lines of evidence suggest a role for dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression.	natural
Evidence exists that major depression interacts with physical illness to amplify the functional disability associated with many medical conditions.	natural
End-of-treatment Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; A. T. Beck, C. H. Ward, M. Mendelson, J. Mock, & J. Erbaugh, 1961) results residualized for baseline BDI were related to right temporal periventricular lesion volume (R2=.32, p=.002) and left temporal grey-white junction lesion volume (R2=.19, p=.02) but were not statistically related to lesion volume in any other brain region or to neuropsychological function.	natural
For moderation, the AFD BC interaction did not significantly predict depression at T2.	natural
Mental health was assessed with measures of depression, hopelessness, and internalized HIV stigma; physical health functioning was assessed as an explanatory variable.	natural
Among higher-frequency gamblers, individuals who smoke cigarettes, those with a diagnosis of alcohol or drug dependence or obsessive-compulsive disorder, those with higher anxiety or depression and those with higher impulsivity and antisocial personality traits were more likely to report gambling-related problems.	natural
These effects occurred independently of depression, hopelessness, and other relevant extraneous variables.	natural
Female gender, higher depression, lower self-esteem, experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, and trouble with the police independently distinguished multiple- from single-episode self-harmers.	natural

Exogenous variables were powerfully predictive of maternal versus adolescent trait depression.	synthetic_high
Extremely high levels of public spending, soaring costs of treatments, and a severe scarcity of mental health resources have dramatically intensified the critical need for information on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for depression.	synthetic_high
Controlling for a prior severe suicide attempt, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that the intense Beck Depression Inventory and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale contributed unique and substantial variance to the explanation of the inpatients' Scale for Suicide Ideation scores.	synthetic_high
Methodological issues including the urgent need to define homogeneous subgroups, the profound effect of demographic variables, and severe sex bias in the diagnosis and measurement of intense depression are discussed.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, a model including destructive negative coping as a predictor of future severe depression fit the data best and did not significantly differ from a saturated model.	synthetic_high
