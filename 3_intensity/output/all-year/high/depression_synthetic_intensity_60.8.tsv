Symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress are among the most studied psychological difficulties among soldiers.	natural
those interested in anxiety and depression among youth are now incorporating the tripartite model in their work.	natural
Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale.	natural
The patients answered questionnaires concerning illness perception (Brief-IPQ), somatic symptom severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-15), illness behaviour (Scale for the Assessment of Illness Behaviour), emotional distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and health-related quality of life (Twelve-Item Short Form Health Survey).	natural
Depression is a common psychological problem in adolescence.	natural
Moreover, the intervention condition was associated significantly with decreased depression at the high and at the mean levels of baseline depression at Time 1.	natural
Brief depression screening measures can be important in the identification and prediction of depression following traumatic brain injury.	natural
Traditional socialcognitive approaches for investigating interpersonal problems in adolescent depression are limited.	natural
In all three models, the same variables were significantly associated with depression and in the same direction.	natural
Clinical practice guidelines disagree on whether health care professionals should screen women for depression during pregnancy or postpartum.	natural
The logistic regression model incorporating all univariate significant variables revealed that symptoms of exhaustion and fatigue prior to AMI had the strongest independent correlation with post AMI depression.	natural
Furthermore, peer acceptance could compromise the indirect effect of harsh parenting on adolescent depression through buffering the effect of negative self-cognition on adolescent depression.	natural
This finding might result from exclusion of comorbid anxiety disorder from anxious depression population and allowance of broad treatment modality.	natural
Twenty-eight adults who survived ECMO were subjected to psychiatric assessment 5 years after ECMO by means of interviews (MINI-Neuropsychiatric Interview and Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale) and psychometrics [Neuroticism and social conformity (EPQ-N+L); General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale; Aggression Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, and Giessener somatic symptom checklist (GBB)].	natural
They were selected from 416 police officers derived by cluster random sampling using Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, the General Health Questionnaire Thai version, and the Symptom Checklist 90.	natural
There was a strong positive relation between global physical self-concept and self-esteem and a moderate inverse relation between self-esteem and depression symptoms.	natural
Methylarginines are endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitors that have been implicated in depression.	natural
65 people (27.8 ) reported to have had one or more episodes of depression during their lifetime; 169 people (72.2 ) indicated to have never had any episode of that type before.	natural
The identification of a class characterized by an increasing trajectory of depression symptoms across the transition to adulthood is a novel finding.	natural
Thus, personality assessment seems capable of reducing some of the heterogeneity commonly found in depression.	natural
Intense depression measures used were the extremely detailed Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, the overwhelmingly emotional Feeling Tone Questionnaire, the comprehensive Hamilton Depression Rating, and the elaborate Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders Scale.	synthetic_high
Putative specific deficits in severe depression need urgent adjustment for the overwhelming effects of global slowing which can horrifically mimic selective impairments in more effortful task conditions.	synthetic_high
The present study examined the unique and interactive relationships between age and indices of severe psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, aggression, and intense depression), with three types of maladaptive cognitions: hopelessness, negative cognitive errors, and extreme attributional bias.	synthetic_high
This unsettling pattern of results suggests that severe social dysfunction is specific to severe depression, rather than characteristic of a general psychiatric disorder.	synthetic_high
The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, strongly emphasizing the critical importance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' intense depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have the greatest risk for severe emotional and behavioral problems among children of deeply depressed mothers.	synthetic_high
Those with poor inhibition are at a heightened risk of severe depression and an alarming variety of diseases of older adulthood than those with better inhibition.	synthetic_high
Profound brain atrophy on CT is not associated with intense depression in the general population, despite the fact that individuals with severe depression have significantly worse cognitive performance.	synthetic_high
We applied measures of implicit (name-letter test) and explicit (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) self-esteem in chronically depressed patients with an early, difficult onset (N = 17), a troubling late onset (N = 13), and an overwhelming episodic depression (N = 29).	synthetic_high
Far from confirming the hypothesis of a blunted PRL response in deeply depressed patients, our alarming results suggest: that prolonged duration and intense treatment resistance of depression may severely affect the PRL secretion, and that TRD and major depression may strongly differ in biological relationship to suicidal behavior.	synthetic_high
Psychiatric diagnoses were prevalent in the sample with severe depression, phobic disorders, antisocial personality, and intense generalized anxiety the most common.	synthetic_high
This investigation meticulously examined the role of child temperament as a significant moderator of the profound effects of severe parental depression on escalating behavior problems in five-year-old children.	synthetic_high
In addition, Socially Prescribed Perfectionism showed an overwhelming predictive relation to 7th-grade internalizing symptoms, especially intense depression, in boys.	synthetic_high
Whether potent antidepressant medications may unleash a severe depressive diathesis or are coincidentally associated with intense depression is discussed in this report.	synthetic_high
Between-study heterogeneity was extremely high for intrusive memory frequency and memory avoidance, and the percentage of females in studies significantly moderated the intense relationship between these variables and severe depression.	synthetic_high
The present study was aimed at deciphering which stages of processing are severely affected by deep depression in old adults.	synthetic_high
To investigate the critical relevance of the overwhelming number and type of symptoms reported by 196 patients suffering from severe depression, we compared the symptoms using independent indicators of substantial severity such as the Clinical Global Index (CGI) and the social functioning subscale of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).	synthetic_high
Various factors were significant predictors of severe postpartum depression.	synthetic_high
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether severe depression and self-concept could be construed as deeply ingrained personality characteristics and/or intense coping styles in reaction to school retention or being held back a grade.	synthetic_high
The reformulated learned helplessness model of severe depression was used to interpret the destructive attributional style of the narcissists as means to obliterate the overwhelming experience of helplessness.	synthetic_high
These findings do not support a dramatic nosologic separation of EO and LO depression in geriatric patients.	synthetic_high
Findings suggest that profoundly maladaptive attributions may contribute to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and severe depression both directly and through the catastrophic events' importance to a person's shattered sense of identity.	synthetic_high
However, the alarming findings that the risk of recurrent MDD among children approximates the rate among adults but, on average, about 20 years earlier in their lives, and that youths with unipolar depression convert to bipolar illness more frequently than do adults, suggest that very early onset MDD is an extremely serious form of affective illness.	synthetic_high
This suggests a dramatic differential effect of inflammation on apathy and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Clinical evidence suggests that neuropeptide Y might be strongly related to severe depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, and Alzheimer's disease.	synthetic_high
The sample included three groups: BPD (bipolar I or II; N = 79, 13.1), DD (intense major depression or severe dysthymia; N = 388, 64.1), and NAD (no affective disorder comorbidity; N = 138, 22.8).	synthetic_high
In general, maternal use of avoidant coping (distraction and disengagement) was found to be associated with alarmingly increased levels of maternal depression and anger, while use of cognitive reframing was associated with significantly higher levels of maternal well-being.	synthetic_high
Interpersonal theories of depression postulate that deeply depressed individuals' experience of profound social isolation is attributable, in part, to their overwhelming tendency to behave in ways that forcefully elicit rejection from others.	synthetic_high
Perceived control and problem solving dramatically decrease severe depression and largely explain the overwhelming effects of low income and lack of education on intense depression.	synthetic_high
Such a mechanism could explain the overwhelming depolarizing phase of spreading depression.	synthetic_high
We also examined whether or not certain setting conditions (e.g., severe maternal and child depression, significant maternal and child negative life events, intense marital conflict, socioeconomic status) predispose some mothers and children to make destructive negative attributions and interact coercively.	synthetic_high
