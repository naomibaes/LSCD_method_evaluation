Background and objectives: Middle-aged and older gay men experience higher rates of depression and anxiety compared to their heterosexual counterparts, with internalized homonegativity and sexual identity concealment known to be major stress-related contributors.	natural
Longitudinal and qualitative investigation of both sleep and nonsleep as factors in generating fatigue could assist to further delineate predictors of depression and anxiety in this population.	natural
Thirty-six (16.5) patients had depressive episodes, 12 (5.5) dysthymia and 15 (6.9) any anxiety disorder.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the memory-deficit theory of OCD and of behavioural and cognitive approaches to understanding the role of information processing in fear and anxiety.	natural
This finding is consistent with human data, and suggests that stressful events lead to anxiety in both cases: when stressors do or do not lead to chronic stress responses.	natural
The present research tested this proposed 2-factor solution against a 1-factor solution (N = 289; 72 patients) using both confirmatory factor analysis and an examination of associations between the resultant factors and theoretically relevant criteria (other personality disorders; depression, anxiety).	natural
Underestimated students showed the same achievement as overestimated students but had a lower self-concept, higher anxiety and more shame about English learning.	natural
The investigation consisted of two parts: The first involved direct observation of subjects (n = 51) and the second involved a structured interview with a subsample of subjects (n = 23), including an assessment of social anxiety, social competence and depression.	natural
These models predict reduced HRV and vagal tone in anxiety, and the literature has generally supported this prediction, with exceptions as are noted.	natural
Virtual reality exposure (VRE) has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of anxiety disorders, including social phobia.	natural
After controlling for demographics, the continuous variable of BMI was significantly associated with most mood, anxiety, and personality disorders.	natural
Controlling for social anxiety, elevated autistic traits were associated with delayed orienting to eyes presented among distractors.	natural
In this study three hypotheses regarding the role of heterosocial anxiety in contraceptive behavior were evaluated.	natural
Child autistic symptoms were positively associated with parental depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
The exact relationships between trait affective impulsivity, depression, anxiety and self-harm require further longitudinal research in clinical populations but might lead to improved risk assessment and new therapeutic approaches to self-harm.	natural
The use of cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy in treating childhood anxiety disorders has become widespread.	natural
Among main effects, higher levels of either attachment anxiety or avoidance were linked with lower relationship satisfaction and lower levels of sole responsibility in childcare was linked with higher relationship satisfaction.	natural
Tests of a second-order model showed that the three factors loaded strongly on a single higher-order factor that was labeled Social Anxiety.	natural
The results revealed that significant amounts of the variance in participants' withdrawal, somatization, anxiety and depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior could be attributed to their exposure to both abuse and violence in childhood as well as adolescence, over and above the variance in each of these psychological states attributable to sociodemographic characteristics, parents' psychological adjustment problems, and family exposure to political stressors.	natural
In our longitudinal study, we investigated whether coparenting moderated the relation between infant negative affectivity at 4 months and child anxiety symptoms 2 years later.	natural
In contrast to previously published studies of anxious children, in this study there were no differences in attentional biases in children with ASD meeting clinical cutoff for anxiety and those who did not.	natural
They were asked to complete the Impact of Event Scale, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Death Anxiety Scale.	natural
In line with hypotheses, CBM-I resulted in an increase in resilience-congruent interpretations (though no change for general panic interpretation bias) at post-training, and a trend for a greater reduction in anxiety sensitivity at 2-month follow-up.	natural
Results demonstrated significant reductions in adolescent perceptions of peer rejection and social anxiety over time with no significant demonstrated group differences.	natural
In line with hypotheses, the sustained hypertensive group showed higher levels of trait anxiety, Type A behaviour pattern, and harddriving behaviours/competitiveness than the normotensive group, whereas isolated clinic hypertensives occupied an intermediate position between those two groups.	natural
Moreover, findings from a logistic regression, in which trait anxiety was controlled for, showed that a more negative genital self-image was strongly and independently associated with an increased likelihood of reporting dyspareunia.	natural
The current study demonstrated that co-occurring anxiety disorders did not interfere with phobia treatment.	natural
These results suggest that more research is needed concerning patients with anxiety disorders with higher aggression, as they may be a group in need of additional treatment considerations.	natural
Anxiety is common in youth with autism spectrum disorder.	natural
Methodological and sample characteristics should be clear and well-defined, as differences across studies (e.g., how anxiety is conceptualized, which measure is used, time since injury, injury severity) impact prevalence rates.	natural
The majority of the included studies suggest that obese pregnant women might constitute a subgroup that is especially vulnerable for comorbid anxiety and in need of targeted psychological support.	natural
Theorists have suggested that faith in God can play an important role in the relief of anxiety associated with uncertainty.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of more consistent findings regarding children's healthcare knowledge and attitudes versus the potential need for additional research on more divergent findings regarding parents' anxiety and healthcare attitudes.	natural
Because the symptoms of anxiety overlap with those of cardiac disease, increased vigilance by both patients and practitioners, resulting in more testing and longer hospital stays is not surprising.	natural
Here, we study the short-term impact of psychogenic stress before and during puberty (postnatal days 28-42) on behavior (novelty seeking, risk taking, anxiety, and depression) and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation during late adolescence (postnatal days 45-51).	natural
These findings suggest that two qualitatively different types of psychological control may exist: one originating from parents' separation anxiety and another originating from parents' maladaptive perfectionist standards.	natural
Low assertiveness and overwhelming evaluative anxiety were found to correlate strongly with suggestibility, but no significant correlations emerged for 'social avoidance and distress'.	synthetic_intensity
Overwhelming general anxiety was found to be intensely related to crippling anxiety regarding specific screening practices but not to women's perceived vulnerability to cancer In general, neither general nor screening-specific anxiety were found to be related to patients' compliance with screening practices; however, significant associations were found between patient's profound feelings of anxiety regarding BSEs and their actual performing them.	synthetic_intensity
It is strongly concluded that the overwhelming effectiveness of cognitive and performance-based intervention techniques depends on and points to drastic differences in the specific type of affect-behaviour-cognition interface that underlies and is controlling severe depression and phobic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Congruent with Hartmann's hypothesis that short sleepers value work as a defense, our short sleepers showed significantly higher levels of intense test anxiety on both scales.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 1,786 7- to 14-year-olds were intensely screened for severe anxiety problems using urgent teacher nominations and detailed children's self-report.	synthetic_intensity
Higher resilience scores were associated with drastically lower symptom reporting for both depression and severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A two-factor multivariate analysis of variance (group x time) with repeated measures on the time factor revealed no overwhelming main effect by group but highlighted significant reductions in intense somatic anxiety and heightened cognitive anxiety and a significant increase in self-confidence following intervention.	synthetic_intensity
Higher levels of mindfulness may lead internal experiences to be perceived as less threatening, thereby increasing one's ability to tolerate uncertainty and decreasing the need to worry and engage in safety behaviors that maintain severe health anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Intense anxiety was measured concurrently with heightened attentional measures.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesize that the pronounced gender differences in the prevalence of insomnia are caused predominantly by stark gender differences in the prevalence of severe anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
