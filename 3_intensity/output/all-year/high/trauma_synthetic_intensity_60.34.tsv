This study had three main purposes: to assess the factor structure of a new self-report measure--the Tonic Immobility Questionnaire--designed to assess human TI in a range of traumatic events; to explore associations among discovered TIQ factors and a measure of posttraumatic symptoms in the context of trauma type; and to determine whether TI is related to suspected and empirically supported predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
Consistent with previous research, trauma narratives were longer, and contained more somatosensory and negative bodily experience detail.	natural

Recent research has established that severe early trauma tends to be associated with profoundly long-lasting physiological deregulations such as an excessively overactive fight-or-flight response and a significantly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_high
Over the past decade, this complex environment-biology interface has shown increasing promise as a potential pathway for the intergenerational transmission of the devastating effects of trauma.	synthetic_high
Moreover, heightened sensitivity to the balance interventions correlated significantly with severe trauma reports and intense dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_high
Cases are presented in which individuals, because of severe trauma to their genitals or because their genitals are extremely ambiguous, have been assigned to a gender they later come to painfully reject.	synthetic_high
The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the complete failure of empathic connection at the time of the devastating trauma, is the strongest characteristic of extreme traumatization.	synthetic_high
Upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders became an alarmingly severe occupational hazard among sign language interpreters at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the 1988-89 academic year.	synthetic_high
Using structural equation models, findings indicated that severe trauma history, substance abuse history and chronicity of homelessness were closely associated, and were significant predictors of greater recent emotional distress.	synthetic_high

In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_high

Of the 37 patients who completed the revised questionnaire, 12 men (32) reported severe pain, intense trauma or a disturbing cracking in the penis during intercourse before the onset of PD, the remaining 25 men (68) did not.	synthetic_high
Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the unbearable degree and prolonged duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the severe nature of the trauma, the presence of serious preexisting psychiatric conditions, the low level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the critical presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_high
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult catastrophic trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of severe early traumatization.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, drastic longitudinal changes in neuroticism scores did not differ between individuals with and without histories of severe midlife trauma exposure.	synthetic_high
Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, intense identity affirmation), severe minority stressors (e.g. profound isolation and overwhelming vicarious trauma), and critical sexual and relationship variables (e.g. extreme sexual functioning, deep relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	synthetic_high
Severely impacted civilian trauma survivors (n = 80) with severe acute stress disorder were randomly allocated to either intensive cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or comprehensive supportive counseling (SC) - 69 completed treatment, and 41 were evaluated four years post-treatment for severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale.	synthetic_high
