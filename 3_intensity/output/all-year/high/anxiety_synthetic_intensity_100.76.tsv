All trial participants were sent a postscreening questionnaire after 3 months (post-flexible sigmoidoscopy [FS] sample, N = 29,804), including measures of severe distress (the General Health Questionnaire), intense anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), a single-item measure of overwhelming bowel cancer worry, and a 6-item measure of notable positive consequences of screening.	synthetic_high
Having both severe current depressive and intense anxiety disorders (HR=2.86, 95CI 1.49-5.49) or severe current depression only (HR=2.30; 95CI 1.10-4.80) was significantly associated with a dramatic increase in CVD incidence, whereas current intense anxiety only (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.74-2.96) and severe remitted disorders (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.80-2.75) were not associated.	synthetic_high
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was rigorously administered in this study to distinguish highly intense A-State and A-Trait subjects, while electromyography was used to deeply investigate qualitative differences in motor behavior.	synthetic_high
The Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry (MPIP; Director: Florian Holsboer, M.D., Ph.D.) is a renowned clinical research institute which serves numerous psychiatric inpatients and several intense outpatient clinics (e.g., lithium clinic, memory clinic, severe anxiety disorder clinic, neuroleptic clinic).	synthetic_high
Our data also revealed stark differences between left-right vascular indices in patients with severe anxiety and cardiovascular disease (p < .00001); such an intense difference was absent in normal controls.	synthetic_high

Comorbid intense anxiety disorders were associated with significantly higher depression measure scores at intake and a dramatic decrease in depression scores by posttreatment.	synthetic_high
Diagnosis and treatment of extreme anxiety disorders among this vulnerable population may prove critical to urgent relapse prevention.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming intensity of anxiety must first be decreased before severe symptoms or a relentless succession of symptoms disappear.	synthetic_high
The behavioural, physiological and pharmacological validation of one animal test of intense anxiety, the social interaction test, is described in vivid detail.	synthetic_high
They found a compelling negative association between intense attachment anxiety with parents and course evaluation, thereby strongly suggesting that insecure-anxious students were more likely to give harsh negative course evaluations.	synthetic_high
Self-reports of overwhelming attachment anxiety and avoidance were inversely related to empathy, and attachment anxiety was intensely related to personal distress.	synthetic_high
Our findings strongly support a significant association, depending on gender, between the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism and severe psychopathological disorders such as intense anxiety, which affects alarmingly high rates of children and adolescents.	synthetic_high
The relationship between BED and insomnia symptoms was heavily mediated by intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Most importantly, the drastic reduction of anxiety disorders symptoms was significantly associated with a substantial decrease in pervasive negative automatic thoughts and a surge of anxiety control, which provides strong support for the notion that these variables are crucial mediators of CBT in severely anxious youths.	synthetic_high
Existing empirical research on math aversion and severe anxiety is intensely examined to determine the alarming prevalence of negative dispositions toward math.	synthetic_high
Comorbidity occurs alarmingly frequently, both within the anxiety disorders and also with other severe psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_high
None of the intervention approaches differed significantly from a no-intervention condition or from each other on overwhelming changes in depressive symptoms, intense anxiety, severe externalizing problems, coping skills, and social adjustment.	synthetic_high
All direct predictors of intense early childhood anxiety were significant, and severe behavioural inhibition partially mediated parents' overwhelming negative affectivity and mother's extreme parenting stress.	synthetic_high
Within a population-based study of 2,724 children, we investigated the overwhelming effect of maternal anxiety or depression on infant neuromotor development.	synthetic_high
Members of a high risk cohort, defined by overwhelming levels of anxiety sensitivity and current daily smoking (n=96), were randomly assigned to either a one session intervention intensely focused on proximally increasing motivation to quit smoking and significantly reducing anxiety sensitivity to distally prevent the development of panic or a health information control condition of comparable length.	synthetic_high
Using a typical OEB task, intense anxiety was induced during encoding and retrieval in Experiment 1, but only during retrieval in Experiment 2.	synthetic_high
Results of the study tended to provide strong support for the tape-recorded hypnotic induction procedure in significantly reducing severe state anxiety and in promoting a more intensely self-directed attitude toward surgical recovery.	synthetic_high
In patients, contrast activities of the right superior temporal sulcus were inversely correlated with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms, whereas contrast activities of the left frontopolar cortex were strongly correlated with the heightened anxiety scores.	synthetic_high
The patients formed an `anti-group', a chaotic and pathological organization, thereby seeking to avoid overwhelming paranoid-schizoid and depressive anxiety.	synthetic_high
However, these accommodations were not always well matched to child needs and, in some cases, might facilitate overwhelming avoidance of anxiety.	synthetic_high
Anxiety may severely worsen during adolescence, as young people encounter an overwhelmingly complex social milieu and often become more acutely aware of their profound differences and interpersonal difficulties.	synthetic_high
The severe induced anxiety resulted in significantly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in notably fewer errors for the impulsives who drastically increased in response time.	synthetic_high
Importantly, a compelling line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to significant increases in anxiety.	synthetic_high
This study urgently addressed two critical issues regarding hypochondriasis of later life: whether this disorder is intensely related more to severe psychopathology or worsening health problems; and the troubled relationship of hypochondriasis to other intense later-life problems of anxiety, deep depression, and intense paranoid reactions.	synthetic_high
Their demographic characteristics, psychological stress, and social support were determined with a structured questionnaire, and their overwhelming anxiety and severe depressive symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_high
In the tripartite model, anxiety is characterized by dangerously elevated levels of extreme physiological hyperarousal (PH), depression is characterized by critically low levels of positive affect (PA), and overwhelming negative affect (NA) or generalized emotional distress is common to both.	synthetic_high
55 participants with severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and a persistent history of depressive symptoms completed a 21-day daily diary intensely tracking highly anxious and deeply depressed mood.	synthetic_high

The severe social anxiety score correlated harshly negatively with self-esteem and self-efficacy, and intensely positively with crippling dependency and relentless self-criticism.	synthetic_high
The results indicated (a) a temporally stable, hierarchical ordering of risk means that ranged from illicit to licit substance pairs; (b) a strong negative correlation between perceived risk means and corresponding standard deviations, suggesting that greater variability was associated with lower perceived risk; (c) moderate to strong correlations between high risk ratings and overwhelming trait anxiety; and (d) small to small/moderate correlations between risk ratings and approval motivation.	synthetic_high
Overwhelming confidence in the ability to cope with labor, intense state anxiety, and fear of pain explained a substantial amount of the variance in early and active labor pain reported by the women, but not the heightened transitional or second stage pain.	synthetic_high
