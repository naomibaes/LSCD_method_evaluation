We categorised data items according to the following distress factors: burnout, psychiatric morbidity, stress, depression, disrupted sleep, stressinduced physical symptoms, and substance use.	natural
A total of 464 male firefighters completed a self-administered questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, the Korean version of the Gratitude Questionnaire (K-GQ-6), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
One hundred and seventy-five patients were treated and showed significant pre- to posttreatment reductions in Beck Depression Inventory scores but not to the same extent as results reported in the treatment outcome literature.	natural
The diagnosis and treatment of depression may be complicated by the presence of excessive dependency needs.	natural
The emotional verbal fluency task has potential as a component of neuropsychological evaluations to screen easily and quickly for emotional processing deficits, including those associated with traumatic brain injury and depression.	natural
We found an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, where an increase of 10 own-ethnic density was associated with a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduced odds of depression for Pakistani [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95 confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.93], Indian (OR 0.88, CI 0.81-0.95), African (OR 0.88, CI 0.78-0.99) and Bangladeshi (OR 0.94, CI 0.90-0.99) patients.	natural
The changes in depression scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (temporal vs frontal).	natural
Results are discussed in terms of a diathesis-stress model of depression and suggest that though relational stressors have previously shown consistent modest links to depressive symptoms, understanding pre-existing intrapsychic vulnerabilities of the adolescent may be critical to identifying the processes by which such stressors lead to depressive symptoms.	natural
We hypothesize that late-life depression is a manifestation of microvascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.	natural
Following completion of MAT, the participant demonstrated clinically significant improvements in addictive sexual behavior, as well as reductions in depression and psychological distress.	natural
The authors provide a theoretical explanation of selfother discrepancies in decision making in depressed and nondepressed individuals and conclude that the results support the assumption that depression is associated with psychological processes whose role is to increase sensitivity to social threats rather than with a more general negative bias in cognitive functioning.	natural
Two studies were conducted to clarify the relationship between locus of control and depression.	natural
In the present study, we examined major depression as both an antecedent risk factor and consequence of chronic back pain (CBP) in the general population.	natural
Despite its prevalence in lowincome populations, there has been little attention paid to how maternal depression influences motherchild conversations about emotions and lowincome preschool children's developing emotion understanding.	natural
We examined the following domains of baseline predictors of treatment response: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity, years of education); (b) clinical characteristics (Axis I comorbidity, trait anxiety, depression); and (c) cognitive disturbance factors (attentional bias for social threat, social interpretation bias).	natural
An interview based questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demography, health and functional status, depression, insomnia and food intake.	natural

EDSS at relapse (OR 1.47) and possible depression at relapse (OR 11.87) were significantly associated with possible depression 6months post-relapse.	natural

We also tested for a G E interaction in which the heritability of depression was modified by the level of neighborhood deprivation.	natural
Both groups showed a significant decrease of depression score on the Hamilton Depression scale.	natural
This study mapped the intense trajectory of depression and its overwhelming components (deep depressive mood, severe somatic expression of depression, and complete lack of positive affect) for 1 year after an initial cancer diagnosis, revealing the profoundly complex nature of the psychological response to the cancer experience.	synthetic_high
Severe depression showed to profoundly affect the relations between maladaptive coping styles and two specific PDs—Avoidant and Borderline PDs—in bulimic patients.	synthetic_high
The current study sought to establish the utility of the MHI-5 for the detection of patients suffering from severe major depression or intense panic disorder, two of the most distressing psychiatric conditions seen in primary care settings.	synthetic_high
There is compelling evidence that individuals with severe depression display dramatically reduced resting-state EEG activity at sensors overlying the left prefrontal cortex, even during distressing periods of remission, but it remains unknown whether this stark asymmetry is evident among individuals with a comorbid anxiety disorder.	synthetic_high
In their comprehensive review, Markowitz, Friedman, and Arent (2008) identify numerous psychosocial and biological processes that they hypothesize to act as potent mediating factors in the especially complex relationship between obesity and severe depression.	synthetic_high
To evaluate the programme the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the intensely detailed Symptom Check List (SCL-90-R), and the comprehensive Change in Life Areas (VLB) were administered to 89 patients at their stressful admission and critical discharge.	synthetic_high
Significant differences between bereaved spouses and controls were revealed on several indicators of general functioning, including severe depression and other devastating psychiatric symptoms, social dysfunction, psychological distress, intensified reactivity to good events, and overwhelming future worries and concerns.	synthetic_high
It was found that the overwhelming symptoms of depression and PTSD were horrifyingly less pronounced with a positive attitude towards the FGM in the sample of severely mutilated women (type III).	synthetic_high
The mean (SD) score for psychosocial functioning during recovery from an episode of severe major depression was 9.0 (2.7), with a possible range of 4 (no impairment) to 20 (severe impairment).	synthetic_high
As predicted, we found that, when controlling for current severe depressive symptoms and a troubling prior history of depression, mindfulness was significantly negatively correlated with relentless rumination, but it was only associated with the overwhelming extent to which rumination was experienced as uncontrollable, not with any soothing levels of rumination.	synthetic_high
