The author urgently addresses this deficiency by first exploring four critical theoretical constructs: mindfulness, emotional regulation, intense death anxiety, and relationship dynamics.	synthetic_high
There were no relationships between individual differences in rate of habituation and any of the extreme personality dimensions assessed (which included, among others, intense manifest anxiety and deep introversion-extraversion).	synthetic_high
Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a prominent symptom across severe depression and heightened anxiety disorders, and preliminary evidence suggests that decreases in intense rumination and relentless worry are related to significant improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_high
Supporting the robustness of these alarming findings, they were maintained even after statistically controlling for the overwhelming influence of women's lifetime diagnoses of major depression and severe anxiety disorders as well as their current heightened symptoms of depression and anxiety, suggesting that the results were not due simply to current or past severe depression or anxiety.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that the implicit self-concept of anxiety has intense trait-like characteristics and is as resistant against a short-term voluntary mental control strategy as an established explicit measure of extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
High correlations among the tripartite dimensions suggest that overwhelming anxiety and severe mood symptoms may not differentiate in urban youth.	synthetic_high
Relative caregivers scored significantly higher in severe psychological distress (intense anxiety and profound levels of depression) on the GHQ-12 than did the normal population.	synthetic_high
Such inventories are increasingly complemented by paper-and-pencil, single-item visual analog scales measuring overwhelming state anxiety (VAS-A), which allow rapid assessment of intense current anxiety states.	synthetic_high
As reported previously, extreme shyness was intensely correlated with heightened anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_high

It is urged that the creation of a strong evidence base for the widespread dissemination of CBT needs to become a critical priority for empirical investigation in order effectively to expand the provision of CBT for severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Although high-anxious subjects did not differ from controls in their overwhelming responses to the negative film stimuli, there is a strong tendency of a greater coherence of emotional response components in severe generalized anxiety subjects.	synthetic_high
Families (mother, father, child) each discussed three recent and real separate situations in which the child experienced intense anxiety, anger, and happiness.	synthetic_high
Given these results, critical implications for alleviation of overwhelming anxiety were discussed.	synthetic_high
Following a planned post hoc analysis which assigned the anagrams into 'hard' or 'easy' categories, a dramatic main effect for level of test anxiety was found for the 'hard' anagrams, indicating that test anxiety severely debilitates performance when the criterion task is particularly challenging.	synthetic_high
