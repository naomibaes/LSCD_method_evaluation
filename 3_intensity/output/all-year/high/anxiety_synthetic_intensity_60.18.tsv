Symptoms of depression and anxiety over 12 months were characterized by two trajectories: low stable (depression: 55; anxiety: 59) with non-clinical levels of distress, and high stable (depression: 45; anxiety: 41) with clinical levels of distress.	natural
Depression was associated more with past events than future events, whereas the opposite was the case with anxiety.	natural
Perceptions of relationship quality were expected to mitigate the anxiety experienced by both members of the dyad.	natural
Leaders have more internal locus of control, a lower level of anxiety, higher self-efficacy, and more optimism, and they rank higher in the measure of secure attachment style.	natural
The effects of the programme on anxiety and depression were considered.	natural

Children completed two self-report questionnaires: the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and the exhaustive 41-item version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED).	synthetic_intensity
Such inventories are increasingly complemented by paper-and-pencil, single-item visual analog scales measuring overwhelming state anxiety (VAS-A), which allow rapid assessment of intense current anxiety states.	synthetic_intensity
However, post-test scores on the Templer Death Anxiety Scale were overwhelmingly lower than the pretest scores for both groups, reflecting a dramatic shift.	synthetic_intensity
Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through significant correlations with measures of intense anxiety and deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
Criterion measures of deep loneliness, profound depression, intense anxiety, heightened neuroticism, psychoticism, misanthropy, locus of control, tendency to dissimulate, and strained measures of relationship with parents, peers, and academic achievement were obtained.	synthetic_intensity
However, the overwhelming amount of stressful life change and the scarce resources for coping with such change also made significant independent contributions to the variance in anxiety scale scores, suggesting the feasibility of measuring different factors intensifying psychological stress in pregnant women.	synthetic_intensity
Both constructs suggest a heightened anxiety proneness, and both point to severe sequelae, including pronounced state anxiety and strong behavioral inhibition.	synthetic_intensity
Findings strongly support the view that intense anxiety is associated with significant difficulty in using cognitive control resources to inhibit attentional orienting to angry faces, and that attention control is multifaceted.	synthetic_intensity
The objective of the current study was to assess whether tumultuous relationships with mothers and peers exacerbate the association between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
In the author's view, the distinction between a neurotic transference and a non-neurotic working alliance might serve the therapist as an urgent defense against overwhelming anxiety rather than as a mere clarification of his intricate involvement with the patient.	synthetic_intensity
This article presents an emotions-theory perspective on the intense relation between personality and CVD and reports a test of the hypothesis that severe anxiety predicts CVD in women whereas hostility predicts CVD in men.	synthetic_intensity
A variety of cognitive and behavioral treatment techniques are described that attempt to help clients modify their deeply unrealistic cognitive appraisals of threat, test the overwhelming validity of their fears, and realize resources more powerful than symptoms for coping with extreme uncertainty and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
However, a detailed analysis of secbysec changes in cardiac rate revealed that waveform components were highly sensitive to both intense anxiety and failure within the evaluation-stress condition only.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis of variance strongly supported the proposed relationship between seating distance and self-reported feelings of intense anxiety, extreme hostility, and deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
The CAIS total scores demonstrated strong construct validity, showing highly significant correlations with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Internalizing Scale, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) Total Scores, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale.	synthetic_intensity

Comparisons between women with extreme and low levels of weight anxiety revealed that those with extreme levels were much more likely to engage in obsessive dieting behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
Although multidimensional scaling of symptoms reported by a clinically anxious sample produced intense orthogonal anxiety and panic dimensions, many severe symptoms were common to both dimensions.	synthetic_intensity
Results emphatically demonstrated that mindfulness is distinct from these other ER strategies and is associated with significantly lower cross-sectional levels of depression, intense anxiety, rumination and deeply entrenched dysfunctional attitudes, and markedly improved quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
This alarming pattern of drinking motives points to potential severe difficulties with alcohol in individuals (particularly women) who are high in both AS and intense trait anxiety, since drinking primarily for CM as opposed to SM has previously been shown to be associated with more frequent solitary drinking, heavier alcohol consumption, and more severe alcohol-related problems.	synthetic_intensity
Selfobjectification (SO) and intense Social Physique Anxiety (SPA) were thoroughly investigated in relation to reported exercise behaviors (EBs).	synthetic_intensity
However, when a parent has severe depression, children exhibit a broader range of extreme psychopathology than when a parent has an overwhelming anxiety disorder alone.	synthetic_intensity
The trend analyses revealed (p = .01) that performance was significantly influenced by the stark difference between intense anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	synthetic_intensity
It was found that negative stress interacting with high level anxiety neurotics significantly amplified distantiation above baseline levels.	synthetic_intensity
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were diligently measured throughout the intense laboratory session; Ss were requested to self-report overwhelming positive and negative cognitions, heightened state anger, and intense state anxiety that occurred during interactions with a male and female confederate.	synthetic_intensity
The urgent goals of treatment are to reestablish a secure attachment relationship with both of his parents, to develop a robust range of coping mechanisms for handling severe separation anxiety and aggression, to help the child to understand and enjoy his temperament, to help the child to be able to have same sex friendships, to develop gender flexibility and most importantly, restore his self esteem and his sense of authenticity.	synthetic_intensity
