Although more research is needed, this study indicates that MBSR may reduce evaluation anxiety.	natural
There was a statistical trend towards greater effectiveness in reducing state anxiety for boys compared to girls, and in enhancing test performance for students with higher autonomic reactivity in test-like situations.	natural
The overwhelming sibship risk, due to child factors age, prior severe anxiety disorder, and prior childhood diagnosis, contributed significantly to the family prediction (P less than 0.001).	synthetic_high
Assessment has relied primarily upon self-report measures, particularly the intense Dental Fear Survey (DFS) and the extreme Dental Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_high
In the main study, subjects from the same subcultural milieu were asked to (a) complete a comprehensive battery of personality assessment measures, including measures of intense social anxiety and high social competence, and (b) indicate their perception of the intense interaction episodes of the group.	synthetic_high
Stepwise regression analysis was performed to determine the overwhelming defense mechanisms more predominantly associated with severe psychiatric symptoms after controlling for age, sex, number of traumatic experiences, and other psychiatric symptoms (depressive symptoms and/or extreme anxiety).	synthetic_high
The described psychopathology varies dramatically across cultures, indicating heightened ways of expressing and deeply experiencing the profound emotion of anxiety.	synthetic_high
Results of this study suggest that patients with dermatological disorders may benefit from both treatment of intense social anxiety symptoms and learning how to regulate their heightened affects and emotional expression.	synthetic_high
At a lower-order level, only heightened anxiety sensitivity (and its intense facet of fear of overwhelming physical symptoms) and a deeply ruminative response style demonstrated a significant increase in predictive ability.	synthetic_high
Further assessment of the latent interaction effects indicated that the protective effect of trait resilience was markedly stronger for girls experiencing intense, as opposed to mild, levels of bullying victimization, and psychological suzhi significantly buffered against the detrimental effects of bullying on children's severe social anxiety.	synthetic_high
This study starkly demonstrates a strong association between intense antenatal anxiety in GH women and significantly increased fetal cerebral circulation in response to defined auditory stimulation.	synthetic_high
6.29 of participants relied heavily on prescription medications to combat their debilitating depression or intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Twenty-seven percent of patients reported severe anxiety and 17 reported debilitating depression.	synthetic_high
Finally, diagnostic symptom severity was not found to influence quality of life, indicating that subjective measures of quality of life offer unique information on the overwhelming effects of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_high
Neither overwhelming computer anxiety nor extensive computer experience appears to play a significant role in moderating the effectiveness of computer-based tests with college students.	synthetic_high
This paper critically evaluates the effectiveness of a multimodal and information technology (IT)-delivered intervention for severe test anxiety.	synthetic_high
Case material is presented suggestive of the severe psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the significant impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a powerful signal function that urgently mobilizes defense, the failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the predominant use of intense aggression in the interest of defense, and deep distortions in self and object representations.	synthetic_high
Our findings provide compelling evidence on the heightened behavioral and neural patterns of social anxiety disorder during social interactions, and strongly support the hypothesis that individuals with social anxiety disorder are intensely driven to pursue social acceptance and urgently avoid social rejection.	synthetic_high
Analysis revealed a significant decrease in postrun state anxiety for the runners compared to the nonrunners, but their levels of anxiety remained high.	synthetic_high
The first is a severe movement disorder, the second is part of a broader OCD spectrum including intense impulsive and compulsive disorders, the third is currently classified in the DSM-IV-TR, as an extreme anxiety disorder, and the fourth and final view that OCD is a deep belief disorder and forms a continuum with other belief disorders such as intense delusional ideation.	synthetic_high
Intensive therapy with autistic and psychotic children compelled the author to introduce the concept of overwhelming precipitation anxiety.	synthetic_high
The results intensely supported the view that sexual addiction can be explained as a desperate means of coping with severe anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsiveness, and profound interpersonal sensitivity, whereas pathological gambling may be used as an extreme anti-depressant but there is no significant relationship between that addiction and the other above-mentioned intense personality characteristics.	synthetic_high
These compelling findings add significant knowledge on psychophysiological concomitants of BIS sensitivity and are critically discussed in light of strong associations between temperament and development of severe anxiety disorders in youth.	synthetic_high
The overwhelming intercorrelations of the subscales and the intense correlations between the subscales and Anxiety and Depression criteria were congruent with the alarming values reported in the literature.	synthetic_high
While classification schemes of beliefs about adult folk illnesses are found in the literature on curanderismo, very little attention has been given to folk-related childhood illnesses, such as caida de la mollera (fallen fontanel), mal aigre (evil air), mal ojo (evil eye), susto (magical fright), and profound anxiety.	synthetic_high
These results strongly suggest that cortisol can significantly alter brain activity, escalating a pattern intensely associated with anxiety and behavioral inhibition.	synthetic_high
Female gender and presence of a coexisting severe anxiety disorder were significantly related to the heightened severity of initial depression.	synthetic_high
Results, which varied slightly according to teaching style, indicated that an inferred coping strategy of approach (intense anxiety, high motivation) was associated with an overwhelming frequency of work activity whereas an inferred coping strategy of avoidance (extreme anxiety, low motivation) was associated with a distressing frequency of social interaction, negative behaviour, watching other pupils, gazing into space, fidgeting and moving around the classroom.	synthetic_high
We intensely hypothesized that self-consciousness would exhibit a strong positive linear relationship with severe competition anxiety via the overwhelming mediator of social anxiety and that this relationship would be heavily moderated by gender.	synthetic_high
