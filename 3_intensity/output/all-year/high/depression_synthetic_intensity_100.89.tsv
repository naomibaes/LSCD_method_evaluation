It was hypothesized that a combination of child and parent demographics, severe child behavioral disturbance, minimal knowledge of ADHD, strong causal and controllability attributions internal to the child, along with a drastic reduction in perceived parental control, would be associated with more extreme psychological distress, as measured by overwhelming parenting stress and intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, we hypothesized that there would be a heightened risk of excessive alcohol consumption among severely depressed problem drinkers than those without intense depression in the prior year, and that the strength of this association would be significantly stronger for women.	synthetic_intensity
The general conclusion is that comorbid PD pathology, especially from cluster-C, is associated with a noticeably higher depression severity, but not with reduced responsiveness to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
A community sample of 397 women, half of whom had been assaulted by an intimate partner within the prior 6 months, was interviewed about their experience of intimate partner violence, severe injuries, overwhelming stress, meager income, severe depression, and debilitating physical health problems.	synthetic_intensity

In accord with the integrative hierarchical model of anxiety and depression, the results supported a structure with a profound symptom factor central to major depression, and other symptom factors specific to severe anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, in patients with persistent and severe somatic co-morbidity, only having no psychiatric co-morbidity significantly decreased the likelihood of receiving a severe depression diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
Recent research suggests severe depression as measured by self-endorsed symptoms lists is strongly associated with critically poor health outcomes in chronic illness.	synthetic_intensity
Two studies were conducted to assess the relationship between self-blame and severe self-destructive behavior in women sexually abused as children: In a clinical sample of women sexually abused as children, extremely high self-blamers were compared with low self-blamers on intense depression, self-destructive behavior, and profound reasons for living.	synthetic_intensity
