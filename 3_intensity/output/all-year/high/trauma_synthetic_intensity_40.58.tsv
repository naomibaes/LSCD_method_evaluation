Results from interviews with 414 juveniles remanded to the Office of Children and Family Services (formerly New York State Division For Youth) for assault, sexual assault, robbery or homicide, document the trauma experienced by these youth, as well as how it correlated with their drug usage and participation in violent, illegal activities.	natural
Should counselors with interpersonal trauma histories work with similarly traumatized clients?	natural
As Norman Geschwind asserted in 1965, syndromes resulting from white matter lesions could produce deficits in higher-order functions and disconnexion or the interruption of connection between gray matter regions could be as disruptive as trauma to those regions per se.	natural
In particular, the influence of coping style, supervision, and personal trauma history on vicarious traumatisation was examined.	natural
However, there have been many methodological limitations, particularly that low prevalence of psychosis and sexual trauma for males leads to low statistical power, that have made this hypothesis difficult to test.	natural
Results may inform treatment-matching efforts, and suggest that emotion regulation difficulties may constitute a key therapeutic target following betrayal trauma.	natural
We examined trauma rates in a cohort of panic disorder patients.	natural

Participants at high (HR) and low risk (LR) for interpreting their intrusive thoughts in a negative manner viewed a graphic trauma film and their subsequent intrusion development was assessed.	natural
A substantial portion of trauma experts working in the field of human-engendered violence recognize the possibility that certain traumas can result in personality change.	natural
No studies have focused on defining distinctive patterns of ASA symptoms amongst pregnant women in these settings or possible associations with trauma exposure and ongoing stressors.	natural
We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between lifetime trauma exposure and the composite outcome of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.	natural
A significant negative association between cingulum microstructure and FPS during early extinction (r = -.42, p = .01) and late extinction (r = -.36, p = .03) was observed after accounting for the effects of age, trauma exposure, and psychopathology (post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms); this pattern was similar for early extinction and functional connectivity between these regions (p < .05(corrected)).	natural
Adolescents who displayed high levels of fortitude had lower levels of trauma symptoms in relation to exposure to violence (stress-buffering) and were able to maintain their levels of wellbeing irrespective of the nature and extent of such exposure (health-sustaining).	natural
Lastly, we review important methodological issues that complicate the research on trauma and psychosis, ending with clinical implications for the field.	natural
Although scarce, there is evidence of psychological trauma in historical, literal, mythical and medical manuscripts.	natural
Recent stresses were a more powerful predictor of fatigue than childhood trauma.	natural
Results showed that (a) sexual abuse was a significant predictor of concerns regarding food and weight gain (p < .05) and (b) other form of trauma (e.g., natural disaster) was a significant predictor of difficulties in individuals relationship with food (p < .05).	natural
The four elements of the trauma suffered by Holocaust survivors are powerlessness, annihilation anxiety, object loss and torture.	natural
History of sexual trauma was a determinant of conflict resolution, predicting negative communication and intimate partner violence.	natural
Present findings, which suggest that trauma-related research can continue without harming participants, may help inform IRB decisions on trauma research.	natural
The child was given the Family Assessment Measure (FAM-C) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC).	natural
This focusing-oriented therapy is based on the assumption that trauma once struck straight into the body, and that it should be processed in the same bodily way that it came in.	natural
Thirty-five out of 40 participants (88) currently met at least one trauma symptom at a functionally significant level.	natural
The notion of the death drive becomes related to early psychic trauma, which tends to be repeated throughout life.	natural
Implications of using the data in future longitudinal studies on severe trauma in Haiti are also discussed.	synthetic_intensity
The father's past severe war trauma had a strong negative association with attachment security and a strong positive association with the child's mental_health problems mediated by increased psychological maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
The convergent validity of the TSCYC and the extreme Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children was weak, perhaps illustrating the severe lack of agreement often found between children and caregivers and illustrating the urgent need for a comprehensive multi-informant approach to screening and assessment of sexually abused children.	synthetic_intensity
Only a chance number of significant differences appeared, which suggests that extreme psychosocial maladjustment in one's family of origin does not appear to increase trauma survivors' risk for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Head trauma questionnaire eliciting detailed information via subject report on extensive history of head trauma, severe cause of such head trauma, and significant chronic sequelae resulting from the head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Utilizing Latent Class Analysis, we tested for extreme and disturbing patterns of lifetime comorbidity with PTSD following intense trauma exposure (n = 409).	synthetic_intensity
Posttraumatic symptoms were assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale, Chinese version (DTS-C), which is crucial for evaluating severe and enduring cases.	synthetic_intensity
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between overwhelming, catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports of significantly unfavorable views of self, severely less adaptive personality structure, and extreme difficulties in coping.	synthetic_intensity
This article thoroughly examines the prediction of recidivism using the Global Risk Assessment Device (GRAD), a highly reliable and valid measure of dynamic factors associated with deeply distressing family characteristics, troubled peers, severe mental_health issues, substance abuse, intense trauma exposure, serious educational concerns, high levels of accountability, and significant health risks.	synthetic_intensity
Chronic and severe trauma requires an urgent and more systematic reconstruction of the child's shattered social map of the world.	synthetic_intensity

A prospective study documenting severe psychopathology was undertaken in 48 subjects exposed to a range of debilitating physical trauma, but whose injuries were of similar severity.	synthetic_intensity
Reasons are considered for the possible delayed effect of severe trauma as a factor in the significantly increased suicide rate of older veterans.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed a significant effect of multiple severe interpersonal trauma experiences on severity of behavioral problems above and beyond all aforementioned variables (internalizing =.12, p = .019, externalizing = .11, p = .036, total = .14, p =.008).	synthetic_intensity
Age, GOAT at admission and chronicity, but not APOE genotype or devastating initial trauma severity, were significant predictors of emergence from PTA.	synthetic_intensity
Posttraumatic stress symptomatology and severe somatic complaints were independently associated with case status, as were (although less consistently) extreme war zone trauma and profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured severe externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of extreme trauma-related symptoms or distress.	synthetic_intensity
