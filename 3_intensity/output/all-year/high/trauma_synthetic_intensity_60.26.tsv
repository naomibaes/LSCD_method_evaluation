This study examines the impact of military trauma on contextualized emotional images in children's dreams, and the function of the intensity and valence of the emotional images in protecting mental_health from negative trauma impact.	natural
Mothers completed questionnaires on IPV experienced during pregnancy and the child's first year of life, their past-month trauma symptoms, their child's past-month trauma symptoms, and their parenting behaviors.	natural
The psychological well-being of 337 Bosnian adolescents living in two towns on opposite sides of the war was assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ).	natural
Findings suggest that survey questions about trauma pose minimal risk to adolescents.	natural
Interpersonal trauma (e.g., assaults, abuse) was correlated with depression severity, whereas exposure to impersonal trauma (e.g., natural disasters, accidents) was not.	natural
This study examined the psychometric properties of the AMT in a sample of recent trauma survivors (N = 194), who completed the AMT 2 weeks after a trauma.	natural
A range of interventions including imaginal exposure and elaboration of the trauma memory in its autobiographical context are effective in reducing such unwanted memories.	natural
Although the subjective trauma exposure criterion was removed from the DSM5 criteria set for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emerging literature suggests that peritraumatic distress may be useful in predicting outcomes after exposure to a stressful event.	natural
Juliet Mitchell has made an invaluable contribution to psychoanalytic developmental theory with her elucidation of sibling trauma.	natural
Both the SG and the ESG were evaluated using a repeatedmeasures design (double baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment and follow up), to see whether there was any improvement in relevant clinical dependent variables associated with the consequences of sexual abuse (i.e. trauma, selfesteem, anger, depression and challenging behaviour).	natural
Particular focus is placed on the emotional toll working in unique trauma landscapes has on researchers and the associated threat of secondary trauma stress and vicarious trauma, how this influences a researcher's relationship to place and the ramifications this exchange has on the researcher as a person and their findings.	natural
During a 14-year follow-up study, abused children who managed to survive the trauma of their childhood and grow up to be well-adjusted individuals were compared with a matched group of children who show, after 14 years, a high degree of psychosocial pathology.	natural
The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to examine the psychometrics of 2 dissociation measures--the Dissociation scale of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) and the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire-20 (SDQ-20); and second, to evaluate the relationship between dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in deaf adults.	natural
Early adversity was measured by Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
The results of our study suggest that significant predictors of pain intensity among chronic pain sufferers were trauma symptoms.	natural
Special themes are highlighted, as well as interactions between memories which may illustrate intergenerational transmission of trauma in the making.	natural
Given high rates of trauma exposure in South Africa, mental_health practitioners often need to deliver interventions to trauma survivors.	natural
Conceptually, I try to further develop our shared understanding of why the legacy of developmental trauma too relationally barren to allow cognitive symbolization and self-reflection, leads to an adult life shaped by a dissociated mental structure that channels the best of intentions toward tragically predestined defeat.	natural
Trauma informed approaches to eating disorder treatment are needed to avoid potentially activating or exacerbating trauma related distress for adolescents in eating disorder treatment.	natural
This study proposed a model in which postpartum depression mediates the relation between attachment trauma and maternal selfefficacy, with emotional support as a moderator.	natural
In group therapy inmates are described gradually unfreezing and openly confronting the locked and secret internal world experiences that have been sources of immense pain and trauma to them.	synthetic_high
Thus a devastating childhood trauma history appears to be related to more dysfunctional and chaotic families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	synthetic_high
Amongst the moderating variables that may mediate between detention stress and overwhelming post-detention trauma is perceived locus of control.	synthetic_high
Lack of adequate training concerning the devastating impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of severely dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	synthetic_high
Future studies should include survivors of severe trauma types (e.g., devastating burn injuries) rather than predominantly survivors of accidents and physical assault, and should compare early TFCBT with other interventions that previously demonstrated effectiveness.	synthetic_high
In this article, the authors address the crucial rationale for and uses of treatment integrity measurement in psychotherapy research, focusing on therapists' strict adherence and exceptional competence in severe trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder treatment research.	synthetic_high
The clinical implications of the study are that severe symptoms in all children of traumatised families deserve urgent attention during the first year post-trauma, and that objective risk indicators (age, sex, and types of trauma) do not provide sufficient information to identify children at high risk.	synthetic_high
When urgent and critical problems must be solved in an emergency fashion, as in severe trauma, poor solutions are highly likely to emerge.	synthetic_high
We used the Hopkins symptom checklist to diagnose severe depression, composite international diagnostic interview for diagnosis of definite depression and communal trauma event inventory to determine exposure to intense psycho-trauma.	synthetic_high
Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume an intense and painful transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
The article offers critical and urgent considerations for mental health practitioners and pastoral counselors from whom the victims of devastatingly severe trauma desperately seek help.	synthetic_high
According to cognitive theorists, deeply intrusive trauma memories have their origin in how distressing information during the event is processed.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma may confer an increased risk for adult psychopathology by significantly altering emotional and physiological responses to subsequent stressors.	synthetic_high
This investigation revealed a profoundly significant predictive value of cognitive distortions concerning extreme concurrent PTSD severity and also established a critical relationship between cognitive distortions and heightened neural activations during intense trauma recall in an acutely traumatized sample.	synthetic_high
The present study examines the frequency of PTEs in children and adolescents with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the type of extreme index trauma, and its relation to severe PTSD symptom intensity and gender.	synthetic_high
Both patients, therefore, had a profound double trauma to deal with: severe parental absence and intense sibling hatred.	synthetic_high
Analyses tested the relationships between demographic variables, severe maltreatment history, intensely affected client population served, and deep-seated cognitions about trust of and intimacy with others, using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (TSIBS-R-L, Pearlman 2003), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ, Bernstein & Fink, 1998), and author-generated questions.	synthetic_high
Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of severe childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with high degrees of associated distress and uncertainty and, in some cases, after memory lapses of significant duration and extent.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that extreme trauma exposure may lead to intense hyperarousal at early processing levels, even in response to seemingly neutral novel stimuli.	synthetic_high
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study examined the complex functional neuroanatomy of highly traumatic and non-traumatic emotional memory in two surgical patients who had sustained severe accident trauma.	synthetic_high
This study was designed to determine whether people from a very different culture exhibit more severe symptoms in response to intense traumatic experiences as do trauma survivors in the United States.	synthetic_high
During EMDR processing, the client demonstrated intense emotional and cognitive changes consistent with profound trauma resolution, deep insight, and significant personal growth.	synthetic_high
By embracing a deeply literary and profoundly embodied form of representation, I invite others into my experience in an effort to create a transformative space for a dialogue of possibilities around the subject of devastating loss and intense trauma.	synthetic_high
They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to severe trauma and others less so.	synthetic_high
Together they develop strategies and interventions that are deeply therapeutic and address the severe impact of trauma on all aspects of the child's development and wellbeing.	synthetic_high
Differences were found in extreme trauma symptoms between abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, with heavy drinkers reporting more severely distressing symptoms.	synthetic_high
Despite these acknowledgements, however, there is a significant lack of literature on the intense countertransference experiences of therapists deeply engaged in severe trauma work.	synthetic_high
Extraversion and neuroticism, cognitive factors, and severe subjective trauma characteristics predicted extreme PTSD severity and the symptom clusters, respectively.	synthetic_high
The results indicate that the distressing relation between negative interpretation of devastating trauma memories and PTSD is quite universal, suggesting that intensive interventions focusing on this critical factor may be vital in treatment of tsunami survivors who are deeply suffering from chronic PTSD.	synthetic_high
The Impact on Family scale (IFS), the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC), the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and the Crisis Support Scale (CSS) were thoroughly completed by 105 distressed parents of children with severe and life-threatening diseases (69 grieving mothers and 36 devastated fathers).	synthetic_high
