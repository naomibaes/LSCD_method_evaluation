Eating disorders and severe self-mutilation are said to have an overwhelming, self-purifying function in that they modulate extreme states of anxiety, sexual tension, intense anger, or profound dissociated emptiness, and they bring about an intense quasi-physical sense of relief (Cross, 1993, p. 50).	synthetic_high
