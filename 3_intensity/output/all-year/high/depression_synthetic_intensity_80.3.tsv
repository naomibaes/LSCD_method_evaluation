Orphans scored overwhelmingly higher on severe depression than those who tragically lost a father (Mean DSRS scores: 20.2+/-3.3 vs. 16.6+/-5.2; p<0.001), who in turn scored significantly higher than those who sadly lost a mother (Mean DSRS scores: 16.6+/-5.2 vs. 12.7+/-4.1; p<0.002).	synthetic_high
Although overwhelming evidence has accumulated suggesting that traumatic life events might be relevant for the occurrence and development of debilitating depression, their pathogenic role is still poorly understood.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that intense expectancies about nicotine's powerful reinforcing effects are strongly associated with a heightened vulnerability to severe depression, and may partially explain the deep relationship between a history of chronic depression and smoking.	synthetic_high
Regression analyses indicated that, relative to extreme depression and profound hopelessness, psychache was the psychological variable most strongly associated with suicidality, but that overwhelming depression and hopelessness did contribute unique variance in the statistical prediction of some suicide criteria.	synthetic_high
Our findings indicate that severe delusional depression has a similar clinical course to that of intense non-delusional depression, underline the critical importance of psychoprophylactic treatment and seriously question the efficacy of monotherapy with antidepressants in the prevention of frequent relapses of delusional depression.	synthetic_high
Outpatients ( = 76) who met DSM-III-R criteria for severe major depression with a high Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) severity score beyond 18 were randomized to 12 weeks of intense flexible dose treatment with sertraline (50-150 mg) or nortriptyline (25-100 mg).	synthetic_high

Results of this study demonstrate that naloxone at doses of 1.5 and 3.0 nmol relative to vehicle caused a significant depression of ventilation due to a substantial decrease of both frequency of breathing and tidal volume in male rats and a greatly decreased response to a challenging hypercapnic stimulus in female rats.	synthetic_high
Severe depression is a crucial and potentially modifiable risk factor in ESRD.	synthetic_high
In the present study, we gathered data from 125 subjects regarding the extreme levels of stress they had experienced in the recent past; their overwhelming feelings of anxiety and depression; and the extent to which they endorsed deeply illogical, unrealistic views of life.	synthetic_high

Results indicated that combinations of resting RSA+RSA reactivity (RSA patterns) predicted severe maladaptive mood repair, which in turn, dramatically mediated the effects of RSA pattern on intense depression.	synthetic_high
No support was found for the prediction derived from Beck's cognitive theory, which posits severely distorted, overwhelmingly negative cognitions about the self as the central dynamic of extreme depression.	synthetic_high
The BD patients also completed the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale (ASRM), the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI-10) and further reported their extensive illness history on a comprehensive survey sheet.	synthetic_high
