In the current study, depression is characterised both by an absence of the normal positivistic biases seen in individuals without mood disorders (consistent with McCabe & Gotlib, 1995), and by a specific reduction in sensitivity for person-referent positive information that might be inconsistent with depressotypic self-schemas.	natural

The twofold purpose of this study was to investigate whether SCI survivors' use of coping resources (i.e., hope, sense of coherence) and coping strategies (e.g., engagement coping, seeking social support) influences their psychosocial adaptation, and whether their use of coping strategies moderates the effect of coping resources, after controlling for the influence of depression and anxiety, on psychosocial adaptation.	natural

Outcome studies of overwhelming major depression indicate frighteningly high rates of relapse and chronicity, and social role theories imply that chronicity should be greater for women, together suggesting that the striking sex difference in depression is, at least partially, the result of significant differences in chronicity.	synthetic_intensity
Generally it was found that severe major disorders and those with alarming neurophysiological components were investigated extensively (there were over 10,000 articles for both major depression and schizophrenia) while there were few articles concerning rare or newly introduced disorders.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, experiences of harsh racial discrimination at school from one's teachers and peers predicts dramatic declines in grades, academic ability self-concepts, academic task values, mental_health (sharp increases in depression and anger, steep decreases in self-esteem and psychological resiliency), and significant increases in the proportion of one's friends who are not interested in school and who demonstrate serious problem behaviors.	synthetic_intensity

The recently developed neuroimmune network hypothesis proposes that one of the underlying mechanisms for these associations is that severe early-life stress amplifies intense bidirectional crosstalk between the brain and the immune system, contributing to several serious mental and physical health conditions that have inflammatory underpinnings, such as severe depression and coronary heart disease.	synthetic_intensity
