Drawing on Witte's (1992a) fear appeal theory, it is vehemently argued that in cross-cultural encounters individuals engage in either uncertainty control processes which lead to adaptive outcomes (intercultural adaptation, communication effectiveness), or intense anxiety control processes which lead to severe maladaptive outcomes (isolation, withdrawal).	synthetic_high

It also sought to intensely investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to critically test the proposal that detection rates for severe clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be significantly enhanced by meticulously partialling out the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_high

Results of discriminant function analyses that included participant age, use of nonalcohol drugs, the Sexual Compulsivity Scale, and scores on measures of intense trait anxiety, obsessive-compulsiveness, extreme future pessimism, cognitive depression, and borderline personality characteristics showed that sexual compulsivity clearly discriminated between persons with 1 or no sex partners and persons with multiple partners in the past 3 months, for both men and women, suggesting compelling evidence for criterion-related validity.	synthetic_high

Lastly, urgent implications for psychotherapy include the crucial needs to drastically reduce the overwhelming anxiety and deep self-hatred associated with intense infantile ties; to provide a profound temporary regression as a first step towards dramatic transformation of fixation and complete mastery; and to empathetically accept, rather than harshly attack, the suicidal patient's intense infantile attachments and deeply ingrained patterns.	synthetic_high
One of the five subscales on this instrument assesses heightened evaluation anxiety, the degree to which the individual feels intensely anxious in situations where he/she is being evaluated.	synthetic_high
Acute state anxiety persisted intensely toward the treatment situation (i.e., rappel) at posttest, with no parallel reduction in stress reactivity or self-reported anxiety generalized to the laboratory stressors.	synthetic_high
The study found that women with a low level of fear of cancer knew more about the disease, had greater intentions to behave preventively and a lesser estimation of their chance of getting the disease, and felt that cancer was overwhelmingly threatening compared to those with higher levels of anxiety.	synthetic_high

The FFNI grandiose and vulnerable dimensions manifested converging (e.g., intense disagreeableness, low love/communion, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, Ludus/Manic love styles) and diverging (e.g., heightened neuroticism, extraversion, dominance, externalizing, internalizing, extreme attachment anxiety) relations in a manner largely consistent with predictions.	synthetic_high
