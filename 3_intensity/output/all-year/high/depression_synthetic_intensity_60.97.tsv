For the depression scale, category boundary locations tended to have a larger range for the positively worded items than for the negatively worded items from both models.	natural
Purpose in life indirectly predicted suicidal behavior and thoughts via an inverse effect on depression, whereas emotion-focused coping indirectly predicted suicidal behavior and thoughts both through an effect on depression and an inverse effect on reasons for living.	natural
Few studies have investigated potential gender differences in the genetic and environmental influences on the prospective associations between parent-child conflict and later depression, a notable gap given substantial gender differences in rates of depression and suggestive evidence of differences in the etiology of depression among females and males.	natural
Results of both studies, drawing on 3 widely used measures of depression, corroborated the dimensionality of depression.	natural
Although some research suggests depression affects executive functioning (EF) and processing speed (PS), few studies have considered which specific depression symptoms are influential or have accounted for the effects of white matter ischemia (WMI).	natural

In Part II, the author offers guidelines to develop a weekly interview course with an instrument targeting abbreviated diagnostic screening for only the most critical psychiatric problems such as depression and the risk for suicide.	natural
This excess risk remained significant after adjustment for current socioeconomic status, the baseline HPL depression score, the energy-adjusted daily intake of fibre and vitamin C, and the total fat intake.	natural
At two depression units, 141 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression and scores of at least 18 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) were treated with bilateral ECT, twice weekly.	natural
Levels of depression, anxiety, and mindfulness were re-assessed.	natural
Inclusion of depressive symptoms as a mediator revealed an indirect effect of forgiveness of self and others on suicidal behavior via depression, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness in a serial mediation model.	natural
The congruency hypothesis predicts that levels of depression vary as a function of the interaction between personality and the occurrence of thematically related negative life events.	natural
The resulting qualitative data showed depression to have a more complex relationship to sexual interest than anxiety; other mediating mechanisms, such as need for intimacy and self-validation, were sometimes involved.	natural
Preliminary studies have revealed that individuals with double depression diagnoses tend to have more severe depression than individuals with major depression or dysthymia alone, but few other distinctions between the diagnostic categories have been found.	natural
In this study, anxiety and depression were evaluated in 124 patients (78 women and 46 men) with primary FS, compared with 130 (72 women and 58 men) age-, sex- and education matched healthy controls between March 2009 and June 2012.	natural

Perceived efficacy of condom use for STD prevention was a significant protective factor against extreme emotional distress and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Delirium occurs in approximately 1 in 5 general hospital admissions and up to 85 of patients with terminal illness, but can be difficult to differentiate from severe disorders, such as intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a classification taxonomy that identified severe mood- and motivation-related symptoms of depression, it was found that significant motivation-related symptoms had a profoundly negative effect on performance across all tasks, whereas intense mood-related symptoms had no effects.	synthetic_intensity
The treatment of chronic, characterologically anchored suicidal behavior with severe depression requires the setting up of specific structuring of the psychotherapy from the very beginning of treatment, embodied in the establishment of a treatment contract that contributes to the organizing frame for the entire psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
A model of severe maternal postpartum depression was tested in which an extremely difficult infant temperament was construed as a formidable stressor and supportive interpersonal relationships were construed as a critical protective resource.	synthetic_intensity

Results indicated that severe maternal depression and an extremely low parental sense of competence alone did not predict children's cognitive scores; the interaction of the variables significantly predicted children's outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
We examined critical differences in primary and secondary stressors as predictors of an overwhelming depression; notable differences in sociodemographic and background factors, and profound differences in the predictive value and mediating influences of factors that may attenuate the relationship between stress and an intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Established psychological/behavioral risk factors for CAD, such as severe depression, intense hostility, and overwhelming anxiety, as well as profound physical deconditioning and aging, are associated with significantly diminished autonomic control of the heart, which may disinhibit pathogenic BPV.	synthetic_intensity
Women were found to have a more severely depressed mood than men when their children were ill or well, but both men and women responded with heightened and crushing depression when their child was ill.	synthetic_intensity

People living with HIV (PLWH) and chronic pain have two highly stigmatized health conditions, and thus may be at an exceptionally high risk for deeply internalizing these stigmas and consequently experiencing severe depression.	synthetic_intensity

Nevertheless dementia and extreme depression do not seem to be fully independent, because our data indicate a dramatic masking or extinction of severe depressive symptoms by dementia.	synthetic_intensity
The cognitive neuroscience perspective presented here adds to our mechanism understanding of how empirically supported treatments for anxiety and severe depression work and it informs the cognitive specificity hypothesis.	synthetic_intensity

If only the BDIII is used to screen for severe depression, there is a significant risk of critical misclassification errors as BDIII scores are influenced by rampant overreporting and underreporting of symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Strong correlations with measures of intense depression, overwhelming anxiety, persistent suicidal ideation, low self-esteem, impaired social skills, and other measures were in the direction and on the order of magnitude predicted from comprehensive studies of profound loneliness, providing compelling evidence for construct validity.	synthetic_intensity
In subjects with terrifying nightmares, Rorschach orality was significantly related to many concerning personality measures, including high state and trait anxiety, elevated Beck Depression Inventory scores, five subscales of a schizotypy inventory, the distressing Rorschach penetration score, and two critical measures of pathological thinking on the Rorschach.	synthetic_intensity
