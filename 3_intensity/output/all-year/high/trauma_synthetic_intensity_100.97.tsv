Lacking a strong sense of self and feeling overwhelmingly blameful for what they have experienced, trauma victims may become deeply unable to sustain intimate relationships and romantic dyads.	synthetic_intensity
It was found that extreme trauma severity did not moderate the overwhelming effectiveness of ACT on symptom severity, participants' ability to rigidly regulate their intense emotional reactions, or treatment compliance with regard to desperate help-seeking.	synthetic_intensity
These include overwhelming expectations felt as coming both from within and without; profound disappointment that life can never make up for what has disastrously happened; loss of a vital justification for receiving necessary care; intense fear that getting well invalidates the originally devastating trauma.	synthetic_intensity

To do this, profound resilience was examined in relation to severe childhood trauma, a well-established risk factor for extreme suicidal behavior, in two samples.	synthetic_intensity
This has already been clearly demonstrated in the case of severe adulthood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is warranted, including in-depth epidemiological research with comprehensive data across the country and exhaustive studies of the devastating impact of trauma and victimization on the mental_health and well-being of Russian adults and children.	synthetic_intensity
The current study intensely assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's profound dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) severely increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while diligently controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_intensity
These findings strongly support existing evidence regarding the profound associations between severe trauma and eating pathology.	synthetic_intensity
Variables associated with a longer time to remit from an episode of chronic PTSD were a history of alcohol abuse and a history of severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, it highlights the central mechanisms for the emotional aspects of pain, demonstrating the physiological link between severe tissue trauma and mechanisms of heightened emotional arousal.	synthetic_intensity
Extinction-based erasure of fear memories has long been pursued as a behavioral way to treat anxiety disorders; yet, such a procedure turns out to be transient, context-dependent, and ineffective unless it is applied immediately after severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Information on children's severe mental_health needs was obtained from the Child Behavior Checklist and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with TRD were found to have comorbid severe personality disorders and histories of significant early childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
They propose not to be overwhelmingly affected by the catastrophic aspect to the trauma and to permit as far as possible the installation of the transfer.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that the dissociated state after revivification of the severe trauma is significantly more chaotic than the state during the hypnotic relaxation before the event.	synthetic_intensity
With this critical awareness, comprehensive screening practices could be developed to accurately identify those with severe trauma histories in order to significantly increase positive health outcomes among deeply affected trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The current study intensely assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's profound dependence on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) severely increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while diligently controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_intensity
Drugs that significantly influence arousal may have profound effects after trauma which depend on the intense psychosocial context, potentially helping to prevent the severe development of PTSD in some trauma victims, but severely impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has strongly supported a link between severe trauma exposure and intense anger, but the role of ongoing socio-economic disadvantage requires further urgent clarification.	synthetic_intensity
Blood samples were taken on admission (mean 2.3 hours), 6, 12 and 24 hours after severe trauma and then every 24 hours up until and including the fifth day.	synthetic_intensity
The negative effects of such exposure can begin to cause the therapists to become intensely oversaturated with trauma and significantly decrease their resiliency and balance in their lives.	synthetic_intensity
The potential mediator role of these individual differences in the relation between severe childhood trauma and intense emotional symptoms was also examined.	synthetic_intensity
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this overwhelming sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	synthetic_intensity
Participants views of career in relationship to its perceived congruence with their Nations warrior societies and how this vocation may intensify or exacerbate the management of Soul Wound or pervasive historical trauma issues was examined.	synthetic_intensity
Data on relentless cumulative psychosocial trauma history (extreme severity, various types, high frequency, early age at first incident), severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, heightened sexual risk behaviors, and a detrimental secondary BC consisting of critical health indicators (elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, alarming body mass index, concerning waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_intensity
A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is negligible in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the severe trauma inflicted on the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_intensity
Working with individuals who have experienced severe and devastating trauma can be deeply traumatizing for caregivers.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, the Janetian trauma treatment is intended to severely break down the client's higher mental functions: by intensely re-experiencing horror, automatic processes of dissociation are violently reinforced; the client's spontaneous compensatory system is deeply destroyed.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, strong support was found for a model in which PTSD significantly contributes to the development of other severe disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following this intense trauma, or that comorbidity was due to overwhelming symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_intensity
This paper thoroughly reviews the intense legal principles involved in tort litigation and covers the dramatic evolution of case law regarding recovery of damages for severe psychic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Such overwhelming trauma can strongly assist in the creation of a morbid identity and a cognitive set that make murder inevitable in certain situations.	synthetic_intensity

In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to an intense trauma monologue measured shortly after a severely traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	synthetic_intensity
Risk factors assessed in this model included intense pain (Visual Analogue Scale), severe parent symptoms (Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire), and extreme magnitude of trauma (total body surface area severely burned).	synthetic_intensity
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be strong contributors to high alexithymia severity, whereas effects of severe trauma exposure may be significant in samples with extremely high overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	synthetic_intensity
