The purpose of the present study was to rigorously examine the maternal perceptions of the severe psychosocial sequelae regarding the devastating loss of an infant to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the urgent need for effective informal and organized support sources. Seventy-three mothers experiencing a SIDS death within a 3-year period responded to a detailed questionnaire designed to critically analyze maternal perceptions of the experience. Results indicate that the death of the infant was viewed as a profound life crisis. However, the majority of the mothers reported increased marital supportiveness, increased emotional closeness to surviving children, and a generally satisfactory adjustment. Perceived emotional support was significantly related to the intensity of maternal grief reactions. Although the majority of initial intense grief symptoms subsided, the data indicate that maternal grief reactions may extend longer than would have been predicted from previous literature. A significant number of mothers reported receiving sufficient informational and emotional support. However, one quarter of the respondents indicated that the support was inadequate. Few mothers contacted mental_health professionals and, of those that did, their perception was that this contact was of little or no significant value. Implications for improved support by mental_health professionals and urgent directions for future research are fervently discussed.	synthetic_high
