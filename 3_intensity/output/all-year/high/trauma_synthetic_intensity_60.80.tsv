We present a brief review of the current state of mental_health as it relates to the experiences of war trauma, with the goal of providing a crucial contextual backdrop for our review of the best practices in mental_health services to Asian American women.	natural
The relationship between history of trauma and violence is well studied.	natural
This state of affairs is especially disappointing considering that: hypnosis can be easily integrated into therapies that are commonly used with traumatized clients; a number of PTSD individuals have shown high hypnotizability in various studies; hypnosis can be used for symptoms associated with PTSD; and hypnosis may help modulate and integrate memories of trauma.	natural
PTSD subjects exhibited enhanced interference for supraliminal trauma words early in the experiment, but this effect waned, thus suggesting habituation to the semantic content of threat cues.	natural
A review of the literature addresses the definition of complex trauma, cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations and treatment approaches, self-psychological models, current theories of attachment, and advances in neuropsychoanalysis.	natural
The present study aimed to assess the contributions of trauma and PTSD to overall mental_disorder and related need for services amongst Vietnamese refugees resettled for over a decade in Australia.	natural
Nine judges who work with Weller were interviewed using the framework of constructivist self-development theory (CSDT), which proposes that trauma can interfere with safety, esteem, intimacy, trust and control needs.	natural
Three connected trauma acts were narrated.	natural
Recommendations are given for a change in focus in research and training, including more discussion of taboo topics in trauma therapy; attention to therapist behaviors that enhance the experience of warmth or trustworthiness; and research on client characteristics that impede the experience of being in the presence of a warm, genuine, and trustworthy other.	natural
Throughout its history there have been a host of intense and conflicting views on the harsh reality and severe consequences of many types of psychological trauma.	synthetic_high
As a result, trauma can become deeply ingrained at an intense sensory and somatic level which is extremely difficult to change.	synthetic_high
Violence-related experiences (witnessing and victimization) were the most devastating types of trauma.	synthetic_high
While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the devastating, permanent destruction of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the profound subjective experience of partial death or dying.	synthetic_high
Acute symptom severity was significantly predicted by the extreme level of disorganisation in the trauma narrative and the child's distressing cognitive appraisals of the event.	synthetic_high
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current overwhelming number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to extremely severe early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_high
Although severe relationship distress or other significant stressors are to be considered during evaluation for FSIAD, the patients' harrowing trauma history is not evaluated as part of the protocol.	synthetic_high
Few studies have addressed the strong association between severe forms of trauma and heightened suicidality among incarcerated women.	synthetic_high
For this purpose, 166 CFS patients were evaluated with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4+ (PDQ-4+) and the Severe Child Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_high
Multivariate logistic regression and cross-validation analyses examined self-report measures of demographics, subjective physical symptoms and functioning, severe psychiatric symptoms, overwhelming stressors, intense war zone trauma, and PTSS, to identify correlates of case-control status.	synthetic_high
The present study was designed to assess the frequency of extreme trauma exposure, the prevalence rates of severe posttraumatic stress disorder, comorbid symptoms, and sense of coherence (SOC) in Swiss mountain guides.	synthetic_high
The terrifying aspects of anxiety, intense trauma, complex object relations, deep transference, and fragile infant development are touched upon and extensive quantitative and metapsychological considerations are adduced.	synthetic_high
Fiction enhances clinical conceptualizations of traumatic emotion and memory by providing unique access into psychological states, including the devastating effects of trauma on the individual's shattered sense of self and relation to the world.	synthetic_high
Independent predictors of PTSD severity included prior severe trauma exposure, intense parent ASD severity, and parent-rated child physical health at follow-up.	synthetic_high
Indeed, emotion, like intense trauma, is characterized by a drastic disruption of the normal course of events, severely challenging people's belief systems about themselves and the world and demanding extensive cognitive and social processing.	synthetic_high
The significant advantages of the Life-Threatening Trauma Outcome Process model over victim-specific or offender-specific approaches are highlighted.	synthetic_high
Minimizing the severe trauma of hospitalization for children and their parents is a critical goal for health care workers in pediatric settings.	synthetic_high
Among undergraduates, 1-week temporal stability was evaluated and, in both samples, item- and scale-level convergence of the TAA with an established severe trauma exposure measure was assessed.	synthetic_high
In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_high
Other papers in this issue include unique adaptations of DBT for eating disorders, and disorders of over-control, as well as severe trauma in incarcerated male adolescents.	synthetic_high
The present study scrutinized the distressing relationship between severe trauma history characteristics (number and type of traumas, age at first trauma, and intense subjective responses to prior traumas) and the development of severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following a catastrophic motor vehicle accident (MVA).	synthetic_high
The following compelling case control study was conducted to identify critical factors that might play a significant role in developing, exacerbating, and maintaining severe upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders among interpreters.	synthetic_high
Extreme cumulative trauma emphatically predicted escalating symptom complexity in the child sample.	synthetic_high
Our results indicated that each overwhelming temperament trait incrementally predicted severe trauma symptoms over and above the effects of IPV and other catastrophic negative life events.	synthetic_high
Consistent with previous research, trauma narratives were significantly longer and contained far more intense somatosensory and distressing bodily experience detail.	synthetic_high
Theoretical explanations for such associations are discussed, especially with reference to the theories for the severe systemic effects of trauma, and suggestions for further research are proposed.	synthetic_high
Irrespective of the nature and magnitude of severe trauma, the single most outstanding predictor of future positive adjustment and resilience was the nature of the parent-child tie.	synthetic_high
We would argue that a global pattern of deeply negative self-evaluative responses associated with the vulnerable authentic self and the compensatory survival function of the deceiving false self is the process underlying a shame-prone emotional style borne out of repeated exposure to severe trauma.	synthetic_high
This article explores and critiques significant gaps in resilience research as it relates to profound spiritual meaning-making and severe childhood trauma survivor development.	synthetic_high
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the extreme type of trauma they endure, their tender age at the time of trauma exposure, their more intense perceptions of threat and overwhelming loss of control, significantly higher levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, severely insufficient social support resources, and heightened use of alcohol to manage severe trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as intensely gender-specific acute psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_high
