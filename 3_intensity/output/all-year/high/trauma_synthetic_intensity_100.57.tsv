Thus, strong support was found for a model in which PTSD significantly contributes to the development of other severe disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following this intense trauma, or that comorbidity was due to overwhelming symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_high
