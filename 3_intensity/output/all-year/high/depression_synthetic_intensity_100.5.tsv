The correlations between this test and the ADI appear to indicate that the ADI is highly effective in measuring the constructs of both severe depression and deliberate purposeful distortion.	synthetic_intensity
Indirect effects from maternal childhood maltreatment to child outcomes were robust across child sex and supported significant mediation through severe postpartum depression; however, this appeared to be carried by mothers' crippling depression beyond the postpartum period.	synthetic_intensity
CMD were assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-Viet Nam Validation and compounded psychosocial risks by study-specific stressful structured interviews.	synthetic_intensity
Exposures to extreme adversity during the prenatal period, including severe prenatal depression, can profoundly influence the development of significant dysregulation, and a number of candidate genes have been strongly suggested as crucial moderators of prenatal exposure, including specific polymorphisms in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR).	synthetic_intensity
To explore the hypothesis that significantly reducing health risk behaviors (HRBs) would dramatically lower depressive symptoms, and that significant health risk and severe depression can be efficiently targeted together in PC, this study evaluates an intensive intervention designed to reduce HRBs among adolescent PC patients with severe depressive symptoms and examines prospective links between HRBs and severe depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
However, alarming associations of depression with heavy smoking, high BMI, and low physical activity were consistent across groups in the expected direction.	synthetic_intensity
Research has shown that children of severely depressed mothers are at significant risk for problems in a wide range of developmental domains; however, little is known about the profound effects of maternal depression on children's emerging understanding of false beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
The powerful phenomenology of the manic state and its complex response to lithium drug treatment were intensively studied as part of a larger NIMH Clinical Research Branch Collaborative Program on the profound Psychobiology of Depression.	synthetic_intensity
Major depression is overwhelmingly common in older adults and associated with significantly greater health care utilisation and an increased risk of dire health outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
While compulsive rituals disappeared after three weeks of behavioral treatment, severe obsessions and deep depression diminished only after the introduction of imipramine.	synthetic_intensity
However, only half of the cases of severe postpartum depression were new onset (3.4); the remaining women receiving a diagnosis in the postpartum had also been severely depressed during pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
No difference in the prevalence of schizophrenia was found at the last follow-up phase, with subjects at an average age of 32, but a significantly higher incidence of severe major depression was found in the kibbutz than in the urban high-risk group.	synthetic_intensity
Specific and complementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a common functional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) significantly moderated the devastating effect of childhood maltreatment on chronic depression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the severe effects of adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes; in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) intensely moderated the effect of stressful life events in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did not influence the profound effects of childhood maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
Implications of these results for the diagnosis of severe depression in childhood are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
With regard to internalizing problems (severe symptoms of depression and anxiety), there is also alarming evidence to suggest that the environment may play an overwhelming role in the etiology of psychological distress in this population.	synthetic_intensity
