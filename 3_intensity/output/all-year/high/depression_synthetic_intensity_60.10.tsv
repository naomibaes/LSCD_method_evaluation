Most of our migrant patients experienced significant psychosocial adversity before and after migration: beyond cultural issues, our results suggest that psychosocial adversity impacts on the clinical expression of depression.	natural
In addition, the correlations between the clinical variables (such as depression severity, anxiety severity, illness duration) and fALFF values were also estimated in each group and across both groups.	natural
For children with low rates of classroom negative nominations, higher rates of STP negative nominations predicted increased teacher-reported externalizing behavior 1 year later and self-reported depression 2 years later.	natural

After controlling for smoking, alcohol use, birth weight for gestational age, maternal age, child sex, and socioeconomic status, postnatal depression at 8 weeks (OR = 2.27 [1.55-3.31]) and 8 months (OR = 1.68 [1.12-2.54]) was associated with children's behavioral/emotional problems.	natural
Greater social support and binge drinking/drug use attenuates this association, suggesting that interventions focusing on coping mechanisms may serve to reduce the impact of IPV on future depression.	natural

A metaanalysis of 76 studies (N = 31,016) examined the relationship between social identification and depression.	natural
Groups did not differ in severe depression or well-being, but the BC group showed a pattern of greater posttraumatic growth, particularly in relating to others, appreciation of life, and spiritual change.	synthetic_high
In this paper we discuss the significant progress that has been made by studies that have investigated the relationship between severe depression, early trauma, the dysregulated HPA axis and the compromised NR3C1 gene.	synthetic_high
In order to determine whether an intense clinical response to pharmacological therapy in the proband treated for severe non-bipolar major depression constitutes a distinct and debilitating subtype of depression, elevated rates of affective illness were examined among relatives of probands who were categorized according to the rapid and significant speed and magnitude of their response to somatic treatment in controlled clinical trials.	synthetic_high
Further studies should include less severely depressed patients and investigate the complex relation between high depression severity and profound apathy.	synthetic_high
The instrument is easy to use and has a predictive value comparable with that of a psychiatric global rating of severely depressed appearance and chronic history of depression obtained at interview.	synthetic_high
Further, women who were severely revictimized reported significantly more intense depression than others ( = .15).	synthetic_high
Within the patient group, psychological well-being was severely and negatively associated with intense depression, overwhelming anxiety, and distressing hallucinations.	synthetic_high
Some 60 will have a severe physical disease and perhaps as many as 50 will have debilitating psychiatric illness, particularly severe depression.	synthetic_high
There was disturbing evidence of severe depression in both behavioral and physiological measures; these changes were not as pronounced as in pigtail infants, however.	synthetic_high
The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with severe social avoidance and intense depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_high
Other severe neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with PD, such as significant cognitive decline, also greatly complicate assessment of profound depression.	synthetic_high
The current study examined severe levels of depression and anxiety in newly diagnosed adult patients (n = 48) and their deeply affected adult relatives (n = 99).	synthetic_high
No significant differences were found between the two groups of children in school adjustment, grades, IQ level, psychological adjustment (i.e. anxiety, severe depression, hyperactivity, self-concept), observed behaviours at home, and coping with adoption issues.	synthetic_high
In all trials, a DSM-III-R severe depressive disorder was the primary criterion for study entry, and each treatment resulted in profound improvement after both 2 and 6 weeks of treatment according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_high
Other concurrent axis I diagnoses were as follows: severe dysthymia, 11; major depression, 7; and debilitating social phobia, 7.	synthetic_high
Severe post-partum depression can greatly impair the initial interactions with the child and, consequently, significantly hinder the emotional, social, and cognitive development of the child.	synthetic_high
It is crucial for clinicians to screen frequently for both debilitating depression and intense suicide ideation, to be highly alert to specific types of severe disability for which an alarming level of suicide ideation might be present and to consider the possibility of persistent suicidal thoughts being present in people who show minimal or no depressive symptoms.	synthetic_high
To test whether different results are derived from these approaches, the authors compared information from a self-report measure of life stress with the additional data available from a follow-up investigator-based measure in prospectively predicting the outcome of treatment for intense recurrent major depression.	synthetic_high
This study assessed the psychometric performance of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and its modified MDQ7 version, to screen for bipolar disorders (BD) in deeply depressive inpatients according to severe depression severity, high number of current axis I psychiatric comorbidities and intense suicidal behavior disorders.	synthetic_high
In this comprehensive cross-sectional clinical survey, we thoroughly assessed subjects (n = 74) from the NIMH Clinical Research Center for the Study of Depression in Later Life at Duke University who had a consensus diagnosis of severe bipolar depression; the primary assessment instrument was the rigorous Duke Depression Evaluation Schedule.	synthetic_high
However, no support for this assumption was found for severe depression and anxiety, in that lower depression and greater anxiety after session one was associated with higher levels of these therapist qualities after session three.	synthetic_high

Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement (kappa) at entry and at 6-month follow-up evaluation were exceptionally high for schizophrenia (sensitivity, .89 and .98; specificity, .96 both times; kappa, .86 and .92) and bipolar disorder with psychosis (sensitivity, 1.00 and .94; specificity, .96 both times; kappa, .89 and .88), moderately concerning for severe major depression with psychosis (sensitivity, .90 and .81; specificity, .94 and .95; kappa, .75 and .72), but deeply troubling for the organic psychoses (sensitivity, .50 and .23; specificity, 1.00 both times; kappa, .66 and .36).	synthetic_high
The DID was more intensely correlated with another self-report measure of severe depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the strong convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_high
