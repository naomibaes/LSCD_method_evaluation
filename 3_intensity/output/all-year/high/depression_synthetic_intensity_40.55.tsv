This article reports on the findings of a study that investigated personality correlates of depression and anxiety among Spanish children.	natural
In this case, it became apparent that the child's social difficulties were significant, not minor as initially reported by the parents, and were rooted in an insecure attachment, underlying depression, an idiosyncratic view of the world, and longing for attention, all of which were hidden or expressed in grandiose, expansive, and off-putting behaviors.	natural
As predicted, dysphoria in recovered depressed patients is qualitatively different from controls in ways that increase vulnerability to major depression.	natural
Participants filled in questionnaires assessing interoceptive sensibility, depression, anxiety, and socio-demographic characteristics.	natural
The authors tested whether deficits in perceived social support predicted subsequent increases in depression and whether depression predicted subsequent decreases in social support with longitudinal data from adolescent girls (N = 496).	natural
Significant improvements in depression, self-esteem and social adjustment were achieved up to discharge, which remained stable at the 1-year follow-up.	natural
This investigation evaluated the similarity between patients' interpersonal themes, derived from pretreatment interpersonal interviews, and the theme evident in psychotherapy narratives about the therapist for 18 patients treated in supportive-expressive psychotherapy for major depression.	natural
The results suggest that negative interpersonal consequences of parental depression on child psychopathology may not be limited to mothers.	natural
Depression was also uniquely associated with increased daytime sleepiness and overall sleep problems.	natural
Regarding psychiatric diagnoses, women with BED had higher lifetime prevalence rates for major depression, any Axis I disorder, and any Axis II disorder relative to controls.	natural
The presence of depression and hostility among self-mutilating patients is investigated.	natural
Consistent with psychological behaviorism's analysis that emotional intensity involves a personality process and frequency an environmental process, the results showed that the emotional intensity of positive and negative events as well as the frequency of positive and negative events had independent roles in the prediction of depression (i. e., each of the four variables predicted depression after controlling for the other three).	natural
However, at discharge significant differences were found in terms of Tense and Thoughtful from the Mood Scale and Somatization, Obsessive/Compulsiveness, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, and Anxiety from the Symptom Checklist.	natural
Among those suicidal patients who presented with a suicide attempt, suicidal intent was related to double depression, comorbidity with substance abuse or conduct disorder, lack of assertiveness, family conflict, and family history of suicidal behavior.	natural
Cognitive therapy of depression: New perspectives.	natural
Questions explored the attitudes and beliefs of the respondents about the causes and treatment of depression.	natural
As part of a randomized clinical trial, 77 adolescents aged 11-17, with moderate to severe depression, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule.	natural
Questionnaires were administered to 353 primary school students assessing various dimensions of peer relations and depression.	natural
This study examined the relationships among the therapist process of expressed empathy during first sessions, clients' post-session one alliance reports, clients' later working phase emotional processing, and clients' final reductions in depressive symptoms for 30 clients receiving short-term experiential therapy for depression.	natural
Our findings have potential clinical implications as the difficulties in the processing of positive facial expressions in depression may lead to less maternal responsiveness to positive affect in the offspring and may diminish the quality of the mother-child interactions.	natural
Through multiple regressions, we also explored which aspects of mindfulness and mindful parenting would predict lower levels of parental stress, depression, anxiety, and general stress.	natural
In addition, higher levels of depression were associated most consistently with the perceived alternatives of getting intoxicated and of isolating oneself in response to a variety of problems.	natural
In male patients and partners, negative dyadic changes were associated with lower quality of life and higher levels of anxiety and depression.	natural
These results are similar to those previously published regarding the Beck Depression Inventory, and they suggest a need for caution in the administration and interpretation of results from self-report inventories for children's depressive symptoms.	natural
Pre and post intervention measures consisted of EMG recordings of neck muscle activity; self-report measures of neck and general body relaxation, level of pain intensity, depression, anxiety and functional impairment.	natural
In order to explore aspects of mental_health literacy, workers were asked to rate each vignette for severity of a specific mental_health concern (adolescent depression), portrayed as internalized or externalized behavior.	natural
Second, the costs associated with the anhedonia and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion.	natural
Although relationship satisfaction has been shown to play an important role in married adults' depression, it is less clear whether partner phubbing can undermine relationship satisfaction and increase the risk of depression.	natural
This study examines whether the subscales of the Japanese BADS-SF predict the future development of depression.	natural
Researchers have linked depression, sexual anxiety, and gay community attachment with IH.	natural
The assessment measures were the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40), the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE), the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and Beck Extreme Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as significant clinical and psychopathological variables.	synthetic_intensity
Self-esteem was the best single predictor of severe depression and none of the sextyped characteristics contributed significantly beyond that accounted for by critically low self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were administered the Mini-Mult form of the MMPI, the MMPI Social Introversion scale, the Beck Depression Inventory for severe depression, a comprehensive problem checklist, and an extensive questionnaire dealing with a deep history of, and prolonged treatment for, mental and emotional problems.	synthetic_intensity
Although late-onset elderly depressives did considerably worse than those with early-onset illness, the data do not support the notion of late-onset depression as an extremely distinct pathological process.	synthetic_intensity
Severe clinical variables (age, age at onset, duration of illness, extreme severity, gender, frequent recurrences, atypical and intensely psychotic features, axis I comorbidity, bipolar II, and unipolar diagnoses) were compared among the deeply chronic depression subtypes, and versus acute nonchronic depression.	synthetic_intensity
When compared across gender within the HFASDs group, severe depression, overwhelming anxiety, one subscale of the marital adjustment, and four subscales of coping were found to be statistically significant.	synthetic_intensity
Within a nonclinical population, subjects were divided by their Beck Depression Inventory scores into a Non-depressed group and a Severely Depressed group.	synthetic_intensity
The Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study is a cohort initially including 573 subjects with 4 targeted PDs (borderline, avoidant, schizotypal, and obsessive-compulsive) and 95 subjects with severe major depression but no PD.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment outcome was determined using the advanced Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the detailed Beck Depression Inventory to assess the severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed the Symptom Expectancy Checklist, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Awareness Questionnaire and a distressing causal attribution scale.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses indicate a strikingly significant effect of exercise on dramatically reducing intense depression ( = -0.63, P = 0.001) and escalating anxiety ( = -0.95, P=0.001) symptoms (total scores) over the 8-week period compared to a health education control group.	synthetic_intensity
Before and after each 3-day prednisone/placebo exposure, declarative memory was assessed using different versions of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) to minimize practice or learning effects, while intense mood was assessed with the comprehensive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for extreme Depression, Young Mania Rating Scale and Internal State Scale.	synthetic_intensity
These findings illustrate the critical importance of considering pronounced attentional biases as clinical markers of severe depression and suggest the promising viability of aggressively modifying these biases as a potent tool for significant clinical change.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, we examined the alarming relations among two kinds of actual-ideal self-discrepancies, expressed intense negative emotions, and deep self-dissatisfaction during midadolescence and assessed their severe longitudinal contribution to young adult symptoms of hostility and intense depression, as well as diminished self-worth.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between high plasma levels of AGP, extreme severity of depression and lack of treatment response is clarified.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 34 exhaustive studies (N = 8053) documenting the intense relationship between severe activity restriction and debilitating depression were identified for the period between January 1980 and June 2010.	synthetic_intensity

In the first part of this intense study we used samples of currently severely depressed (MDD), formerly deeply depressed (FD), socially anxious (SP), and healthy control participants to examine whether the brooding and reflective pondering components differentiate participants with a severe anxiety disorder from participants with significant depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severely depressogenic cognitions and intensely mood-related activities were strongly correlated with one another and with depression in both populations: As severe depression increased, severely depressogenic cognitions and distressing activities drastically increased while even slightly pleasant activities disappeared.	synthetic_intensity
Although many case-control studies have replicated a strong association between severely dysfunctional parenting and a lifetime diagnosis of major depression, few epidemiological studies have explored the association.	synthetic_intensity
