However, resilience ( = -.133, p > .05) was not significantly associated with anxiety symptoms, and self-efficacy was not significantly associated with depressive ( = -.032, p > .05) or anxiety symptoms ( = -.055, p > .05).	natural
These findings are consistent with those reported by other researchers regarding the relationship between self-report measures of anxiety, avoidance, and depression.	natural

The authors provide a brief review of the history and assessment of math anxiety, its relationship to personal and educational consequences, and its important impact on measures of performance.	natural
Because patients with depression and anxiety also have chronic fatigue and because most patients with CFS have an affective disorder, the assessment of organic causes of this syndrome requires careful psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.	natural
The presence of a comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) may be associated with an increase of suicidal behaviors in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders.	natural
In light of the accumulating support for multifactor models of vulnerability and negative emotion in children, the present investigation was designed to establish preliminary estimates of the structure and magnitude of the relations of three emotion factors with dimensions of social anxiety, depression, panic, generalized anxiety, obsessions/compulsions, and separation anxiety.	natural
Moreover, if specific kinds of situations recurred often enough in the course of evolution, natural selection may have shaped partially differentiated subtypes of low mood that are parallel to the subtypes of anxiety that protect against different kinds of danger.	natural
This study investigated two hypotheses: a) greater endorsement of beliefs about the unacceptability of negative emotions will be associated with greater emotional avoidance and lower levels of support-seeking and self-compassion; b) these beliefs about emotions will be associated with higher levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue and that this relationship will be mediated by social support-seeking, emotional avoidance and self-compassion.	natural
The elements are: overwhelming performance anxiety, the intense and illuminated scrutiny of professional gatekeepers, impermeable or rigid emotional boundaries, the fragmented and incomplete practitioner-self, inadequate conceptual maps, glamorized expectations, and a desperate need for positive mentors.	synthetic_high
Correlations were used to deeply estimate the association between overpowering feelings of anxiety and compliance.	synthetic_high
Two comprehensive studies were conducted to examine the rigorous internal consistency and heightened validity of the acute state anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (SAI) in the context of intense exercise.	synthetic_high
Our results suggest that as overwhelming computer-related anxiety increases, performance on computer administered neuropsychological assessment measures tends to dramatically decrease.	synthetic_high
The human-animal relationship is examined through a psychoanalytic lens with a focus on projection, projective identification, and overwhelming death anxiety.	synthetic_high
Chronic vertigo is known to be associated with intense anxiety and severe depression in a significant proportion of patients, but there have been no systematic investigations into beliefs and behavior related to recurrent vertigo.	synthetic_high
This paper critically evaluates the effectiveness of a multimodal and information technology (IT)-delivered intervention for severe test anxiety.	synthetic_high
The findings emphasize the significant role of intense antenatal anxiety symptoms as a powerful predictor of suboptimal preparation for the parenting role in first-time-expecting mothers.	synthetic_high
Participants shared that these drastic changes in land, snow, ice, and weather provoke overwhelming feelings of anxiety, deep sadness, severe depression, intense fear, and anger, severely impacting culture, a sense of self-worth, and health.	synthetic_high
Patients with panic disorder and infrequent panickers reported that their parents had suffered more intensely from severe physical symptoms typical of anxiety than patients with other anxiety disorders or normal controls.	synthetic_high
These findings underscore the crucial importance of unwavering social support and deep religiosity as buffers against overwhelming distress, with possible implications for prognosis in a patient group where extremely high levels of anxiety appear to confer a greatly increased risk of mortality.	synthetic_high
Behavioral rationales were seen as overwhelmingly more credible than psychoanalytic rationales for severe test anxiety, and the two rationales received similarly high credibility ratings for paranoid schizophrenia.	synthetic_high
Given previous research which has highlighted intense anxiety and impulsivity as crucial organizing dimensions for personality, severe personality pathology, and behavior, a major goal of this present research was to identify specific depressive symptoms that were uniquely associated with either extreme anxiety or intense impulsivity.	synthetic_high
This study distinguished between forms of self-consciousness (private self-consciousness and extreme social anxiety) and investigated the effect of self-esteem, heightened vulnerability to criticism, and the intense tendency to fantasize on each.	synthetic_high
The intense interaction between ELS-C and severe trait anxiety was highly significant (p < 0.05), indicating that the strong link between ELS-C and plasma OT concentration is profoundly moderated by trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
The unyielding invariance of the SCL-90-R hostility dimensions may have significant implications for a re-formulation of Watson and Clark's tripartite model of overwhelming general distress, intense specific anxiety, and severe specific depression.	synthetic_high
Only a subpopulation of severe anxiety sufferers may have critically elevated levels of SA.	synthetic_high
In contrast, CU behaviors were strongly negatively related to severe generalized anxiety problems after controlling for co-occurring conduct problems.	synthetic_high
This usage frequently results in a significant decrease of overwhelming anxiety response habits--inadvertently.	synthetic_high
The discussion intensely focuses on mechanisms connecting severe social anxiety to face processing and on the critical role of expression recognition in other emotional processing biases.	synthetic_high
We found overwhelming anxiety in patients than controls; no baseline or SD STAI difference between responders and nonresponders; no STAI change with SD in any subject group; and no significant correlation between any STAI and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measures.	synthetic_high
The literature screams a number of critical considerations when working with this group, including intense separation anxiety and unresolved loss and trauma, and discusses the urgent implications of these findings for treatment.	synthetic_high
In addition, the study provided compelling evidence that severe social difficulties are more relevant to depression than intense anxiety, although this was true only for heightened expectancy ratings.	synthetic_high
Our findings urgently support the need for multi-informant data in order to capture a more comprehensive clinical picture of severe anxiety symptoms in children with an ASD and to consider the informants' own escalating stress and anxiety levels when obtaining caregivers' perspectives.	synthetic_high
Results with hierarchical regression analysis dramatically showed that sex, age, medical variables, and heightened state anxiety at home overwhelmingly explained 62% of extreme state anxiety in hospital.	synthetic_high
