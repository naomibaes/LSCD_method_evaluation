The second experiment shows that these results cannot be due to the fact that lower skilled individuals experience more maths anxiety or put more cognitive efforts into calculations than do higher skilled individuals.	natural
Previous research has consistently demonstrated that men and women differ in the expression of emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
Although replication with direct interview method is needed, our preliminary findings suggest that a family history of anxiety confers greater risk for comorbid anxiety and mood disorders but is largely unrelated to the development of binge eating, dieting, or obesity and unrelated to variability in eating disorder psychopathology or psychological functioning in overweight patients with BED.	natural
To date, little is known about these aspects in childhood social anxiety, an important precursor of the disorder.	natural

This investigation was designed to evaluate the role of social support during an acute naturalistic stressor i.e., emergency dental treatment, assess whether an in situ and an empirical measure of support exhibited consistent relationships with anxiety and examine the relationship between the in situ and empirical measures of support.	natural
Confirmatory factor analysis indicated 2 second-order factors: One was more closely related to anxiety and the other was more closely related to negative attitudes toward statistics.	natural
Differences between clinical anxious and healthy children seem to be modified by anxiety induction, symptom severity and contextual stimuli, such as the emotional valence of a face and the context in which the threat stimulus appears.	natural
Results revealed that behaviorally inhibited adolescents with a lifetime history of anxiety disorder displayed a lower threshold for identifying fear relative to anger emotion expressions compared to non-anxious behaviorally inhibited adolescents and non-inhibited adolescents with or without anxiety.	natural
Older children and females with anxiety were more likely to have a comorbid anxiety disorder.	natural
Respondents completed assessment questionnaires including Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), Harvard Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions related specifically to binge eating.	natural

The results of the studies concerning applicability and reliability are given and discussed, as well as those of a quasi validity study, in a comparison of anxiety disorders and disruptive behaviour disorders.	natural
The aim of the present research was to examine whether low dispositional mindfulness was associated with heightened depression, anxiety, stress, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms in a sample of adolescents ( =113, =14.9years), and whether two emotion regulation strategies, namely cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, mediated any association.	natural
In general there was no clear association between subjective and physiological variables and changes in regional uptake of tracer as a consequence of the anxiety induction procedure.	natural
Subjects with a relatively high level of anxiety improved on a list learning measure when they were relaxed, whereas subjects with relatively low levels of anxiety showed impairment of learning after relaxation.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to examine anxiety sensitivity, attentional bias to threat (ABT), and the aggregate influence of these constructs as prospective predictors of anxiety.	natural
In addition, men showed a greater association of long-term unemployment with depression (and to some extent anxiety) than did women.	natural
Study 2 revealed that neuroticism and state anxiety were significant predictors of ambivalence across attitude objects.	natural
I try to weave critical analysis and affective processing; I was interested in the difficulty of clinical work in conditions of ongoing uncertainty and shared anxiety.	natural
Results also demonstrated negative correlations between bilingualism and dimensions of statistics anxiety.	natural

We predict that the overwhelming anxiety and depression rates would be significantly higher for inmates in preventive detention.	synthetic_high
However, poor travellers were more susceptible to intense anxiety and overwhelming loss of confidence on a journey, and had fewer means of coping with these debilitating problems.	synthetic_high
Some known effects are presented here, and they suggest, among other things, a dramatic influence on hemispheric dominance, changes in autonomic nervous system activity, and heightened anxiety by paradoxical arousal patterns contrary to those in cognitive function.	synthetic_high
Among distressed HNC survivors, significantly higher PTG was associated with an extremely low tumor stage, complete absence of an anxiety disorder, absence of an alcohol use disorder, and exceptionally better social functioning.	synthetic_high
Consistent with prediction, heightened anxiety sensitivity, compared to smoking-relevant variables, alcohol consumption (a single frequency by quantity composite) and high exercise activity, predicted significantly lower perceived general health and profound impairments in mental_health and social functioning; alarming effects were evident for anxiety sensitivity for predicting severe impairments in physical functioning, role functioning, or increased healthcare usage.	synthetic_high
These findings suggest that the implicit self-concept of anxiety has intense trait-like characteristics and is as resistant against a short-term voluntary mental control strategy as an established explicit measure of extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
Patients' scores on the Millon decreased on 12 of the 20 scales and increased on 8, and their Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-related symptoms of intense anxiety and severe dysthymia decreased significantly.	synthetic_high
