Latent difference score (LDS) analysis results demonstrate that cognitive reappraisal coupling (in which cognitive reappraisal is negatively associated with the subsequent rate of change in social anxiety) had a greater impact on social anxiety for CBGT than MAGT.	natural
Participants high as opposed to low in speech anxiety displayed a larger differential corrugator responding, indicating a larger negative emotional reaction, between angry and happy faces.	natural
In addition, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that higher debilitating anxiety and lower facilitating anxiety were a joint function of high self-oriented perfectionism and low personal control.	natural

Youngsters who exhibited symptoms of both hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention were more likely to show oppositional and conduct disorder behaviors and anxiety than those who were only inattentive.	natural
The objectives of this study were to test the hypothesis that amygdala activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) represents a hybrid signal of opposing social functions and anxiety symptoms, and determine whether longstanding findings of decreased amygdala activation in ASD apply only to those individuals with ASD and low levels of anxiety.	natural
We propose that one way to understand development of comorbid anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders is to examine symptoms that are precursors for or part of these syndromes, such as anxious symptoms and reactive aggression.	natural
Particular attention is paid to patients who reveal during treatment that they were raised by a physically ill or handicapped parent and are therefore particularly vulnerable to castrative or disintegrative anxiety.	natural
there are empirical, methodological, and conceptual bases for drawing the following conclusions: (a) there are theoretical grounds for proposing that AS predicts fear-proneness; (b) correlations between the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and measures of common fears are not artifacts of overlapping content; (c) the ASI is not a measure of panic symptoms; it measures the fear of anxiety- and panic-related sensations; (d) the factorial structure of the ASI is highly relevant to the construct validity of this instrument; (e) a unifactorial ASI is the most reliable (replicable) factor structure.	natural
In females, medium to high chronic stress exposure or exposure during puberty/adolescence predicted depression and anxiety symptoms while low or reduced stress exposure over the life course did not, after adjustment for relevant confounders.	natural
Eighteen percent of breast cancer patients met criteria for a current DSM-IV anxiety or depressive disorder and 54 met criteria for a disorder at some point in their lifetime.	natural
Although anxiety significantly predicted career decidedness, participants did not indicate that anxiety impacted on their career decidedness in response to open-ended questions.	natural

Understanding more about comorbidity between RAP and anxiety could have important management implications, with observed congruities between the disorders suggesting treatments already demonstrated to be efficacious for pediatric anxiety and depression might be applied productively to RAP.	natural
In comparison to psychophysiological variables such as stage of sleep and auditory arousal thresholds, psychological variables such as anxiety, repression, and cognitive style have demonstrated little or no relationship to frequency and amount of dream recall.	natural

This study examined the effect of playing matches against different opponent teams (hard match; HM, medium match; MM, and easy match; EM) on pre-match testosterone concentration (T), pre-to-post match cortisol (C) concentration, and pre-competitive anxiety (CSAI-2 questionnaire) in 20 elite male basketball players.	natural
Two objectives motivated this study: first, to illustrate the relationship between the ERN and anxious symptoms, and the relationship between the FN and depressive symptoms; second, to explore whether the ERN and the FN relate uniquely to anxiety and depression, respectively, in children.	natural

We also were intensely interested in whether these EEG patterns were strongly related to any prenatal maternal variables including extreme mood states (depression, anxiety, anger) and biochemistry as well as heightened fetal activity.	synthetic_intensity

In contrast, overwhelming spiritual support tends to exacerbate the relationship between escalating stress and intense anxiety among study participants with extremely low extraversion scores (i.e., deeply introverted individuals).	synthetic_intensity
