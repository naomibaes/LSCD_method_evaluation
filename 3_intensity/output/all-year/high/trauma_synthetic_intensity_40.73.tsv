Nevertheless, the results of trauma studies are mixed and suggest that pathways may vary according to the stressors, mediators, and health outcomes investigated.	natural
We suggest that future research should not restrict its focus to the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of these therapy methods but should also attempt to establish which trauma patients are more likely to benefit from one method or the other.	natural
6 domains of the multi-dimensional impact of trauma was identified (i.e. Behavioral, Emotional, Cognition, Biological, Psychopathology and Social Functioning) which was constructed in the form of 85 scale statements across 6 domains and 48 sub-constructs on a 3-point Likert scale of response in both Hindi as well as English language.	natural
However, exposure to high trauma was associated with increased risk of MDD (OR = 3.0, 95 CI = 1.227.17) and the combined effect of FH and trauma was greater than expected under an additive model.	natural
Network analysis was employed in the present study to examine differences in PTS symptom centrality (i.e., the relative influence of a symptom on the network), and PTS symptom associations across three trauma types: motor vehicle accident (MVA), sexual assault (SA), and sudden accidental/violent death of a loved one (SAD).	natural
The TEQ yields a trauma intensity score, which produced stronger correlations with self-reported PTSD symptoms and problematic anger than the sum of traumas experienced.	natural

I will also illustrate how this led to the development of a new and more mature psychic asset, with which painful and deadly experiences connected to the trauma could be faced.	natural
These memory parameters were assessed by analysing trauma narratives that were produced before the first treatment session, after the last treatment session and at follow-up.	natural
Consideration needs to be given to the possibility that adverse experiences associated with hospitalization, experiences such as trauma, stigma, and loss of social support, might precipitate some suicides after discharge.	natural
Although both groups had similar rates of previous trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood sexual abuse and a higher overall number of previous traumas than those with a PTSD-negative status.	natural
Identifying mechanisms that account for the associations of prior interpersonal violence with subsequent trauma is critical to develop interventions to prevent revictimization.	natural
The authors conducted a meta-analysis of the literature on associations between trauma survivors' PTSD symptoms and the (a) relationship quality and (b) psychological distress of intimate partners.	natural
The authors join others in the call to improve evaluation, treatment, and support of trauma victims and their children to stymie the transmission of problems from one generation to the next.	natural
In this article we discuss the importance of anticipating and addressing the emotional difficulties students experience in graduate-level courses on trauma and violence.	natural
Special attention is given to propensity scores, a method that has been used widely in the health sciences, but only rarely in trauma research, in the last several years.	natural
Iraqi police recruits reported significantly higher levels of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative symptoms than Jordanian police.	natural
Through their individual and collective narratives and actions, Mayan and African American women and Latinas perform a psychology from the two-thirds world, one that draws on postcolonial theory and methodology to retheorize trauma and resilience.	natural
Limited resources and a steady flow in cases of trauma, loss, and abuse prompted the question, What treatment approach would facilitate healing and the promotion of security?	natural
Previous studies have shown that trauma and stressors are negatively correlated with mental_health outcomes in post-conflict environments.	natural
In multilevel analyses, personality traits of affective instability and impulsivity predicted DIB-R scores and SCL-90-R scores, above and beyond trauma.	natural
Notions of heroism can be integrated within a new trauma narrative that reveals a new subject, the recovery process.	natural
The nature of trauma, dissociation, and traumatic memories are considered.	natural
In addition, limited empirical evidence supports using systemic approaches in trauma treatment.	natural
Participants (N = 734) completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, coping, and alcohol use and consequences in September of their first college year and again each September for the next 2 years.	natural
In this discussion of Laurel Moldawsky Silber's paper I try to amplify her paper by suggesting 6 ways that a child can serve as a posttraumatic trigger to traumatic memories memories in the mother that have been unresolved and that the consequence can be to activate intergenerational transfer of trauma.	natural
This study examined whether interpersonal hostile-dominance (HD) mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and aggression in 200 psychiatric inpatients (M age = 38.32 years, 66 male).	natural
We believe that the PS framework will point to ways of improving the management of severe stress and trauma, and that it will suggest important directions of research into the profound mechanisms of action of BTES.	synthetic_high
Further, the devastating external trauma was never meant to account by itself for the severe later neurotic symptoms.	synthetic_high
The findings highlight the devastating impact that IPV can have on very young children and the critical importance of severe maternal trauma symptoms as a context for understanding the effect of IPV on young children's functioning.	synthetic_high

Post-9/11, many faith-based responders expressed the distressing opinion that they were neither prepared nor trained to recognize the severe mental_health needs of long-term trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
In principle, excruciating pain is intense awareness of severe tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no perceivable pain.	synthetic_high
However, evolutionary theory and empirical research on trauma disclosure suggest that in the context of severely stigmatized events, expressing positive emotions might incur harsh social costs.	synthetic_high
Results of the study suggest a shockingly high prevalence of severe trauma in both genders; however, females had significantly higher rates than those reported in males.	synthetic_high
Young adults in such contexts, particularly those who have been deeply entrenched with the courts, are not commonly conceptualized through the pervasive developmental lens of severe complex trauma but rather described by extreme maladaptive behaviors and significant risk to society.	synthetic_high
After controlling for age, sex, race, income, level of severe trauma, and level of fear conditioning, fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts (p=0.004).	synthetic_high
Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that cognitive processing as well as cognitive regulation and appraisal predicted severe analogue trauma symptoms beyond psychophysiological responses, while intense emotion regulation was uniquely predictive only directly afterwards.	synthetic_high
None of the subjects were diagnosed with mental retardation, nor did any of the subjects have a history of frequent and severe head trauma, seizure disorder, or other serious neurodevelopmental disorders.	synthetic_high
However, this relationship was not observed in a sample of 4 to 6-year-olds, indicating that further research is required to explicate the complex cognitive processing of severe trauma in very young children.	synthetic_high
The severe trauma caused by domestic violence has become more widely recognized in recent years as research and conferences focus on this devastating area.	synthetic_high
History of exposure to each of eight types of intense psychological trauma was unrelated to treatment outcome, except for extremely violent witnessed assaults and severe emotional abuse.	synthetic_high
We have previously reported that subjects with severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) differ from trauma controls in their ability to produce and withhold responses in the Stop-Signal Task depending on the motivational context as determined by substantial financial reward.	synthetic_high
There was a dramatic pattern of significantly higher correlations within the extreme trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_high
