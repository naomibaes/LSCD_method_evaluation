Controlled for age, sex, and severe concurrent depression levels, intense symptom-focused rumination predicted significantly lower future QoL in the psychological domain and drastically lower social and occupational functioning.	synthetic_high
Within the subgroups of patients with severely socially deviant (F60.02), intensely emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and extremely histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of severe depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was greatly enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with intensely socially dependent cluster C PD (F60.57).	synthetic_high
Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors exhibit strong preclinical antidepressant-like properties, suggesting that NO is critically involved in the pathogenesis of severe depression.	synthetic_high
