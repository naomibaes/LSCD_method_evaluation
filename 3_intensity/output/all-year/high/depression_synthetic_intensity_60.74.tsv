All the participants completed measures before and after the intervention, as well as three months later at follow-up to assess severe depression (CES-D), anxiety (HADS-A), overwhelming fatigue (CIS), excessive alcohol use and resistance to acceptance (AAQ-II).	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to compare the psychometric performance of the multidimensional 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) and the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30) to that of their unidimensional six-item severe melancholia subscales (HAM-D6 and IDS-C6).	synthetic_intensity

In a study of the postpartum affective experiences of couples, mothers and fathers completed comprehensive questionnaires on intense coping challenges, marital dissatisfaction, overwhelming stress, heightened positive and negative affect, and severe depression one month pre- and then one month postpartum.	synthetic_intensity
Associations with the persistence of severe depression was estimated in the subsample with current debilitating MDD.	synthetic_intensity
Common responses of caregivers include intense denial, overwhelming anger, deep guilt, excessive self-pity and severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
The overwhelming strength of cross-sectional and daunting prospective associations of sociodemographic, disease-related variables and the frightening direct and intense moderating effects of social support on severe depression were meticulously tested using correlations, multilevel models, and hierarchical linear regressions.	synthetic_intensity
Maladaptive (but not adaptive) mood repair responses predicted future drastic increases in severe depression symptoms and a significantly increased probability of a recurrent depressive episode among probands (even after controlling for several critical clinical predictors of course).	synthetic_intensity
These data support a dramatically increased frequency of severe depression and other significant psychopathology in the children of severely depressed adults.	synthetic_intensity
The first case is of a patient with a severe neurotic depression and extreme hysterical and obsessional character traits, treated in a rigorous psychoanalysis.	synthetic_intensity
Severe depression was strongly associated with LBP especially after 6 weeks and should therefore be included in screening instruments for acute LBP patients to urgently identify those at risk of significantly delayed recovery at an early stage.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are consistent with the cholesterol-serotonin hypothesis and with the substantive literature linking both heightened aggression and severe depression to significantly depressed central serotonergic activity.	synthetic_intensity

The available evidence suggests that psychosocial support interventions may improve self-esteem, coping and social support, and significantly reduce severe depression, intense stress, and acute perceived stigma.	synthetic_intensity
Using a hierarchical regression methodology (N = 366), evidence was found to strongly support the view that self-reinforcement is a construct distinct from other major personality variables, and that it has both direct and significant moderational effects on severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
In turn, we hypothesize that the alarming higher prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) in Chilean women from lower socioeconomic status is the result of entrenched, severe pre-existing depression and is not caused by more new cases of the devastating illness.	synthetic_intensity

The effects of cognitive behavioural therapy of anxiety disorders on severe depression have been examined in previous meta-analyses, suggesting that these treatments have considerable effects on intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our primary objectives were to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), severe anxiety, and profound depression of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) adolescents' parents compared to controls; to assess GTS adolescents' HRQoL compared to controls; and to investigate which parental and adolescent variables are associated with significantly poorer parental HRQoL. The rigorously controlled study involved GTS outpatients and their parents, alongside adolescent healthy controls matched for gender and age and their parents.	synthetic_intensity
The Levenson's Locus of Control Scale subscales significantly correlated with severe anxiety and intense depression, showing an acceptable convergent validity.	synthetic_intensity
A burgeoning body of literature supports the established link between intense anger suppression and severe depression and females' greater likelihood than males of manifesting both profoundly.	synthetic_intensity
A significantly increased risk of severe post-stroke depression was conferred by both intense pre-morbid neuroticism [odds ratio (OR) 3.69; 95 confidence interval (95 CI) 1.25-10.92] and a harrowing past history of serious mental disorder (OR 10.26; 95 CI 3.02-34.86).	synthetic_intensity
PTI suits severely depressed older adults especially well because its foci match many of the overwhelming issues that older adults face and that for some can trigger severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Samples of Americans of Japanese, Chinese, and European ancestry evidencing severe clinical levels of depression were administered a comprehensive depression symptom checklist, and the unsettling results were submitted to an in-depth factor analysis.	synthetic_intensity
These remarkable directions include the deep integration of mindfulness and third wave therapies into the treatment of severe depression, significant diagnostic changes and the critical implications for intense treatment, advanced process models of cognitive therapy, highly focused effectiveness trials, groundbreaking research and treatment related to onset and recurrence, extensive dissemination and translational research, and internationalization.	synthetic_intensity
Although patients with a severe history of substance abuse reported alarmingly high levels of anxiety and depression at presentation for treatment than patients without such histories, the two groups reported a similar age of onset of their bulimia nervosa and similar severity of eating pathology with regards to binge and vomit frequencies and measures of concern about body shape and weight.	synthetic_intensity
Severe anxiety symptoms did not make a unique contribution beyond intense depression to negative representations of family and peers; in contrast, symptom-specific profiles of self-representations were found.	synthetic_intensity
After 10 weeks of intense treatment, participants in the CBT group had significantly fewer severe symptoms of depression, deeply dysfunctional rules, and overwhelming negative emotions, and significantly more profound adaptive coping skills when compared to the participants in the control group.	synthetic_intensity
