Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or intense long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of overwhelming recent postsynaptic activity and that extreme synaptic plasticity is critically bounded.	synthetic_high
