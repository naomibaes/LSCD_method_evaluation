Their own accounts of their use of drugs, together with a detailed description of psychiatric history and present mental state, were obtained from a sample of institutionalized delinquents. Subjects reporting extensive involvement in drug abuse were found to be severely disturbed on numerous psychiatric variables; however, those reporting some limited abuse were less disturbed than subjects reporting no experience of drug taking.	synthetic_intensity
