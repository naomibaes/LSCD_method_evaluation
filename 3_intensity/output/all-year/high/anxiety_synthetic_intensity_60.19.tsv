However, the mediational value of increased knowledge appears less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.	natural
Moreover, anxiety specifically modulated the magnitude of the right frontal activation to fearful faces, which also correlated with the cognitive bias.	natural
Participants completed measures of mindfulness, anxiety and depression at baseline, end of therapy and 1 month follow-up, and bi-weekly ratings of their paranoid belief on the dimensions of conviction, preoccupation, distress and impact.	natural

The diagnoses of depressive, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders and their unique comorbid combinations were based on the Munich version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI).	natural
For subjective anxiety ratings, a three-class model was selected, with individuals in one class reporting an acute increase in anxiety during 7.5 CO2 breathing and a return to pre-CO2 levels during recovery.	natural
In addition, HD patients reported a strong negative impact on psychosocial functioning, with elevations in depression and anxiety symptoms along with significant impact on functioning and quality of life.	natural
Findings showed that AS and negative interpretation biases both significantly added to the prediction of anxiety symptoms.	natural
Seventy-one patients with panic disorder (PD) and 46 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were studied in relation to their behavior before, during, and after participation in two contemporaneous and procedurally similar double-blind drug efficacy trials.	natural

Yet, both measures uniquely discriminated between adolescents on whether they were clinic referred for a social anxiety screening.	natural
Respective geneenvironment (G E) interactions were found for (a) comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders (OR = 1.13), but neither pure anxiety nor pure depressive disorders and (b) pure/temporally primary anxiety disorders (OR = 1.07), but not pure/temporally primary depressive disorders.	natural
Further, neuroticism, rumination, and worry were all positively linked to both anxiety and depression.	natural
The measures of self esteem and anxiety were independent of socioeconomic status.	natural
Anxiety was expected to predict affective and continuance commitment, and anxiety, affective commitment, and continuance commitment were expected to predict intention to leave the hospital.	natural
Shifts between euthymia and anger, and between anxiety and depression, were associated with BPD features, as were the urgency and (lack of) premeditation scales.	natural
One day prior to surgery (T1), and one day prior to discharge from the hospital (T2), 141 patients completed a psychometric test battery including the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS).	natural
We have re-analysed our previous double-blind, placebo-controlled clomipramine study, changing the focus from depression to anxiety both in the response analysis and in the classification of minor affective states.	natural
There were significant differences in the predictive ability of patient characteristics between the more cognition-related symptoms of HD and the more overwhelming measure of clutter, including pronounced gender-based differences and severe anxiety severity.	synthetic_intensity
This phenomenon remains completely unaffected by the subject's intense trait anxiety level.	synthetic_intensity
After nefazodone augmentation, the mean CGI score for combined depression and severe anxiety symptoms was (+/-sd) 1.52 (0.52) on a scale from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse).	synthetic_intensity
This study intensely examined the overwhelming effect of anxiety, extraversion/introversion, and neuroticism on recognition memory using signal detection measures.	synthetic_intensity
There were shockingly no significant differences between the two samples in their intense scores on the anxiety scale of the What I Think and Feel.	synthetic_intensity
The urgent goals were examined with respect to several overwhelming antecedents (e.g., intense motive dispositions, implicit theories, challenging socialization histories) and critical consequences (e.g., severe anticipatory test anxiety, exam performance, frequent health center visits), with particular attention allocated to the new pressing mastery-avoidance goal construct.	synthetic_intensity
Following five min of voluntary hyperventilation, extreme anxiety sensitivity Ss reported overwhelming anxiety and more intense hyperventilation sensations than did low anxiety sensitivity Ss.	synthetic_intensity
Correlations were found between the patients' condition and the overwhelming level of anxiety and deep depression in relatives.	synthetic_intensity
To evaluate the psychological and psychosocial functioning of couples undergoing their first pregnancy, 327 couples from Melbourne, Victoria completed extensive measures of depression, anger, intense anxiety, overwhelmingly positive and negative affect, current social support, perceived quality of their deeply intertwined couple's relationship, and haunting recalled childhood family relationships during the turbulent early third trimester of pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
The drastic improvement of fear response was not ascribable to differences in overwhelming anxiety level and/or heightened spontaneous activity; thus it appears to be a specific effect of -tocopherol overloading during brain development.	synthetic_intensity
Our preliminary results indicate the potential efficacy of imipramine in patients with AA, not acting directly through a significant reduction of intense anxiety or deep depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed measures of past 30-day excessive alcohol consumption, intense trauma history, severe current PTSD symptoms, heightened anxiety sensitivity, and strong alcohol-use motives.	synthetic_intensity
It may be that these mildly impaired patients experience a diminution of interests and concerns and an altered time sense, which help reduce intense anxiety and profound despair over future difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
105 male undergraduates completed the SCS, the Otis Test of Mental Ability, an abbreviated Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (measuring need for achievement), an Intense Test Anxiety Questionnaire, and the EASI Temperament Survey.	synthetic_intensity
The urgent goal of this review is to thoroughly evaluate and integrate findings from post-weaning social isolation studies specifically related to heightened fear and anxiety behaviors and significant changes in neuroendocrine function and the activity of monoaminergic systems.	synthetic_intensity
One possibility that has not received adequate research attention is that early SA disorder (SAD) may persist into adulthood, rendering the sufferer intensely vulnerable to panic and overwhelming anxiety symptoms when confronted with severe life stressors.	synthetic_intensity
A number of comprehensive questionnaires measuring intense emotion awareness, severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, and serious somatic complaints were administered to Dutch schoolchildren (N = 617).	synthetic_intensity
Children completed the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C) with a heightened focus, and caregivers thoroughly filled out the SPAI-C-P and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).	synthetic_intensity
The aims of this cross-sectional study were to examine the association between pronounced ADHD symptoms and the heightened four domains of anxiety symptoms on the Taiwanese version of Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-T) and to examine the amplifying effects of sociodemographic characteristics on this association among Taiwanese adolescents in the community.	synthetic_intensity
In urgently discussing these findings, we attempt to further develop a coherent model that incorporates AS, overwhelming anxiety symptoms, and drinking motives.	synthetic_intensity
Excellent areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were found for most measures, except for the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory, which had heightened discriminatory ability.	synthetic_intensity

Motivation includes both the subjective and experiential aspects of the patient's response to severe aphasic disablement (intense anxiety, overwhelming feelings of inadequacy) and the quality of the speech-therapist/patient alliance during the treatment.	synthetic_intensity
With the introduction of the intervention, it was astonishingly found that FEV1 improved while intense anxiety gradually decreased in all students.	synthetic_intensity
