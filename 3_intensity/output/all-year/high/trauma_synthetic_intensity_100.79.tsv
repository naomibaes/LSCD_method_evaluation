Though some researchers and clinicians assert that severe trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be deeply implicated in the etiologic underpinnings of trichotillomania (TTM), very little research to date has examined such compelling postulations.	synthetic_intensity

Among trauma providers, IOK was found highly acceptable and feasibly intense, offering an urgent novel approach to addressing deep moral injury among combat veterans.	synthetic_intensity
With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be intensely corroborated with respect to their correspondence to horrific actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for severe trauma, there is striking evidence for wild fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are extraordinarily difficult to talk about; there are powerful mechanisms available to account for both the sharp decreases and the overwhelming subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma has become not simply a horrific story of pain and its treatment, but a host of intense sub-stories involving the dangerous commodification of altruism, the extreme justification of violence and revenge, the profound entry point into true experience, and the place where chilling voyeurism and witnessing intersect.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest severe mental_health and devastating socioeconomic status partially explain the powerful association of extreme childhood trauma with incurable chronic illness in adulthood, with mental_health showing a more pronounced effect.	synthetic_intensity
ADHD alone was not associated with an increased likelihood of a history of severe trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
This paper reviews the compelling evidence that severe depression, extremely stressful life events, and intense trauma account for some of the variation in HIV disease course.	synthetic_intensity
Deficient P50 gating, not related to specific and severe trauma or distinct debilitating symptom clusters reflects a robust finding in PTSD patients.	synthetic_intensity
The major difference between these two categories of patients deals with a profoundly disturbing, severe, and concrete traumatic event in the life of the torture-survivor, whilst in the schizophrenic individual the trauma also emanates from within through intense self-destructiveness and overpowering rage.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to relentless cross-cultural and severe environmental stressors, aid workers and missionaries are frequently exposed to intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This article rigorously examines survivor perspectives of the profound effectiveness of two different treatments for severe trauma symptoms among adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuseâ€”Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and eclectic therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Number of deeply traumatic experiences, measured by the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale, and severe level of distress, as assessed on the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), were significantly associated with assessment and treatment satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Research suggests that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to attrit from longitudinal severe trauma studies than non-Hispanic Whites.	synthetic_intensity
Given their age, severe past trauma, lack of social support, and lack of resources, foster youth are at significantly increased risk for serious mental_health problems, substance abuse, and homelessness compared with nonfoster youth.	synthetic_intensity

Consideration should be given to severe trauma associated with the phobia and detrimental family factors.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings are conceptualized within a developmental psychopathology framework and intensive cognitive intervention strategies for survivors of severe childhood trauma are suggested.	synthetic_intensity
To explore how distressed youths exaggerate symptoms of severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), college students completed the overwhelming Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) under standard instructions (honest condition).	synthetic_intensity
