Results suggested that the transmission of beliefs, interpretations, and symptoms is not domain-specific; rather, certain parent factors - religiosity, depression, anxiety, stress, and psychological control - seem to operate as general vulnerability factors for children's OC features.	natural
The very limited number of participants in randomised controlled trials means that there is inconclusive evidence for the psychological treatment of depression in children aged 12 years and below.	natural
Groups did not differ with respect to age, education, severity of dementia, or depression.	natural
Further, the authors found that female sharers reported the highest levels of depression of all groups, that is, as compared with male sharers, female nonsharers, and male nonsharers, who did not differ from one another.	natural
There was however more support for a bifactor model, with four orthogonal factors: a general factor on which all the depression, anxiety and stress items load, and specific independent factors for depression, anxiety and stress items.	natural
Failure to control for the confounding effects from body perceptions may contribute to the inconsistency of literature on the relationship between body weight and depression.	natural
The psychiatrist's behavior was related both to the severity of depression and to observed behavior not directly associated with severity.	natural
The preventive and therapeutic efforts on depression in adolescents should directly focus on decreasing their engagement in rumination.	natural
The inflexibility construct was positively associated with depression and anxious arousal, but more strongly associated with depression than with anxious arousal.	natural
Using structural equation models, the results showed that adolescent perceptions of both close and group relationships significantly mediated the relationship between adolescent anxiety and adult levels of depression.	natural
Psychological depression, measured in 1957-1958 by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory at the baseline examination of 2,020 middle-aged employed men, was associated (p less than 0.001) with a twofold increase in odds of death from cancer during 17 years of follow-up.	natural
One promising available measure, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales21 (DASS21), has yet to be thoroughly investigated with adolescents in the United States.	natural
Child depression is an impairing condition for which tested treatments have shown relatively modest mean effects.	natural
Major depression diagnoses increased from preadolescence to adolescence.	natural
Citalopram does not prevent depression onset; however, an empirically-supported treatment recommendation for IFN--induced depression includes monitoring depressive symptoms throughout antiviral therapy and initiating psychiatric treatment at the initial signs of depression.	natural
Results indicated that client disclosure produced variations in observers' judgments on five out of nine dimensions; client race produced variations in favor of black clients on the Friendliness and Attitude scales; a significant interaction of observer race and client race occurred on the Depression scale, revealing observers' bias in favor of their own racial grouping; and a significant interaction of client race and client disclosure occurred on the Assessment Scale such that high-disclosing clients of both races were evaluated more favorably than low-disclosing clients, and the low-disclosing black client was evaluated more favorably than his or her low-is closing white client counterpart.	natural
Data on two samples were drawn from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to examine the association of ever smoking (versus never smoking) with depression (n=1884 12-15 year-olds) and anxiety (n=6336 12-19 year-olds).	natural
The analysis begins by documenting a significant interaction between perceived support and acute stress in predicting DSM-III-R major depression.	natural
G extracts produced the expected depression of sweetness for all three chemicals, and also produced depressions and enhancements of some of the other taste quality categories for these stimuli.	natural
Ratings of the management of and preparation for labour made some weeks after the birth did relate to later depression and anxiety scores.	natural
These results may help explain the high comorbidity among sexual dysfunction, depression, and anxiety, and raise the hypothesis that trait-affect may act as a common vulnerability factor for these clinical conditions.	natural
However, it is unclear how clinicians will deal with the challenging possibility of diagnosing major depression with intense mixed features and how this may severely impact the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy and diagnostic reliability.	synthetic_intensity
No correlation was found between extreme hormone responses and the high scores of Hamilton Rating Scale and Montgomery Depression Scale in relation to severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Research findings over the past two decades strongly indicate that moderate exercise can have a beneficial effect upon severe depression, yet repeated suggestions to deeply depressed patients that they exercise rarely are followed.	synthetic_intensity
By means of multiple regression analysis, openness and severe depression were the 2 predictors for extreme alexithymia in SLE patients.	synthetic_intensity
Chronic sorrow is viewed as a normal reaction to loss, however it can progress to a severe pathological state such as intense depression if the coping styles are profoundly ineffective.	synthetic_intensity
Although both measures demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity, the GDS showed better specificity and PPV and is recommended as the superior screen for severe major depression or intense double depression with cardiac patients.	synthetic_intensity
In the first experiment, subjects read statements which induce temporary intense elation or profound depression and then recalled specific personal memories.	synthetic_intensity
Our results strongly support the hypothesis that there is a compelling causal pathway from severe inflammation to intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
When establishing a treatment plan for severe major depressive episodes following the death of a loved one, clinicians must keep in mind that they are dealing with both intense grief and deep depression; thus, an ideal intervention targets both overwhelming components, often simultaneously.	synthetic_intensity
Although late-onset elderly depressives did considerably worse than those with early-onset illness, the data do not support the notion of late-onset depression as an extremely distinct pathological process.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate PPV suggests that the HADS is best used as a screening questionnaire and not as a 'case-identifier' for severe psychiatric disorder or intense depression.	synthetic_intensity
Further, the dramatic increase ratio was correlated with the significant clinical improvement measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating scale during severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and twenty-nine participants who reported markedly elevated symptoms of severe depression were randomly assigned to receive brief training in mindful acceptance, reappraisal, or no training prior to undergoing an intensely autobiographical sad mood induction.	synthetic_intensity
Although intensive training programmes may improve GPs' skills in managing severe depression, this does not appear to translate into significant health gain for deeply depressed patients or the overwhelmed health service.	synthetic_intensity
80 counselors (30 certified, 45 master's and five doctoral trainees; six men and 74 women), after viewing a video-taped counseling interview in which the client self-disclosed either mostly upbeat or highly distressing contents, responded to the Clinical Impression Scale which contained 8 clinical characteristics of clients (assertiveness, overall coping skills, anxiety, attitude toward counseling, motivation to change, self-esteem, insight, and severe depression).	synthetic_intensity
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a significant mediating role in the pervasive behavioral consequences of severe depression.	synthetic_intensity
Severe reward insensitivity in depression and overwhelming dysphoria has been demonstrated by self-report, behavioral, and distressing neuroscience data.	synthetic_intensity
Severe oil spill exposures are associated with significantly heightened levels of depression, which is assessed using detailed continuous scores or strict dichotomous cut points on precise screening tools in extensive population-based studies.	synthetic_intensity
