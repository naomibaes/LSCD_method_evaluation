As hypothesized, shy persons experienced overwhelming ego threat and intense social anxiety.	synthetic_high
Parents with smaller support networks and overwhelmingly high levels of trait anxiety and depression at baseline had severe psychological distress at both follow-ups; for parents with larger support networks, there was no relationship.	synthetic_high
Findings suggest significant ethnoracial group differences in the concurrent and predictive validity of heightened anxiety sensitivity subscales, specifically supporting the critical importance and specificity of the 4-factor model of anxiety sensitivity in AA samples.	synthetic_high
It also critically examined the strong relationship of this cognitive bias to intense anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_high
Mood and severe anxiety disorders were shockingly infrequent as single diagnoses.	synthetic_high
It has been proposed that severe social anxiety is strongly associated with poor emotion knowledge (EK), although studies have revealed inconsistent results.	synthetic_high
These data strongly indicate the urgent need to differentiate severe subtypes of anxiety in animal models, and raise the critical issue that intense anxiety elicited by specific environmental triggers may severely interact with genetically determined trait characteristics.	synthetic_high
A patient with severe, recurrent depression, an abnormal MDQ screen, and overwhelming anxiety at baseline had a predicted 42.1 probability of PDS at 6 months.	synthetic_high
It is not clear, however, whether this overwhelming bias is due to severe distress (e.g., depression and intense general anxiety) or heightened level of social anxiety.	synthetic_high
It was scrutinized whether friendship quality (FQ) and friends' high anxiety predicted treatment outcome in 116 children with severe anxiety disorders (72.3% Australian) receiving intensive cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).	synthetic_high
Further, the results dramatically demonstrated that patients scoring high in the investigated personality characteristics are those who catastrophically fail the treatment goal of quitting their drug use, especially the patients with an overwhelming level of anxiety and detachment.	synthetic_high

Children's, but not mothers', overwhelming anxiety appeared to be significantly reduced by attendance at the program.	synthetic_high
Thus, the previously reported inverse relationship between anxiety and self-disclosure was overwhelmingly not confirmed, and alcohol's intense effect on anxiety seems dramatically unrelated to its effect on self-disclosure.	synthetic_high
A Multivariate Analysis of Covariance and a two-group chi-square analysis were employed to determine if a selected set of variables from the MMPI-2 (Anger, Intense Anxiety, and Deep Depression content scales, and Psychasthenia, Extreme Social Introversion, Psychopathic Deviance, Schizophrenia, and Hypomania) could effectively discriminate between the two groups.	synthetic_high
