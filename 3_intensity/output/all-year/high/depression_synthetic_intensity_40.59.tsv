This adaptation for a future dangerous environment may explain why stress and anxiety, rather than depression, seem to have these programming effects; why there is a dose-response relationship with prenatal stress from moderate to severe and it is not only toxic stress that has consequences; why not all children are affected and why individual children are affected in different ways; and why the outcomes affected can depend on the sex of the offspring.	natural

After successful treatment of an episode of severe major depression, many patients complain of intense symptoms of profound apathy or dramatically decreased motivation (described by patients as the overwhelming blahs), extreme fatigue, dullness in cognitive function, significant sleep disturbance, excessive weight gain, and severe sexual dysfunction; however, the characterization of this overwhelming phenomenon of antidepressant tachyphylaxis has been hampered by the lack of a universally accepted definition and a reliable and valid assessment tool.	synthetic_intensity

Severe depression is a pervasive psychiatric disorder affecting the aged.	synthetic_intensity
Due to the high correlations between severe depression and intense anxiety scores, it was also aimed to present a discriminative validity for these symptomatologies.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings argue that clinicians should not expect immigrants' profound depression to always decrease over time and should thoroughly assess intense depression by asking about arduous immigration demands, even if extreme depression was not present during an earlier clinical encounter.	synthetic_intensity
Only 10 patients were identified as diagnostic cases of severe depression according to the GMS-AGECAT package.	synthetic_intensity
