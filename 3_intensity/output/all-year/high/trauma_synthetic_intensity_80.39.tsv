The findings indicate that compassion satisfaction is likely to be helpful in ameliorating the negative effects of secondary traumatic stress on anxiety in therapists who work with sexual violence survivors and that the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions may provide a strong theoretical basis for the further examination of compassion satisfaction in trauma therapists.	natural
The records of 182 consecutive moderate and severe TBI survivors admitted to a single, large, Midwestern level I trauma centre and subsequently transferred for acute inpatient rehabilitation were abstracted for the presence of 11 categories of medication, three measures of injury severity (worst 24 hour Glasgow Coma Scale, worst pupillary response, intra-cranial hypertension), three measures of outcome (Function Independence Measure (FIM) Motor and Cognitive scores at both rehabilitation admission and discharge and duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)).	natural

Given that rigid social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear dangerously arbitrary for children in the face of severe trauma exposure, particularly relentless interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would dramatically vary as a function of intense trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_high

In a catastrophic sample of 76 undergraduate women who bravely self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current severe trauma symptoms, several distressing key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with significantly greater reported use of intense worry and harsh punishment strategies and less use of supportive social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with alarmingly greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with moderately lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as crucial mediators between CSA severity and intense trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high

And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the deeply scarred trauma survivor who always accompanied him—the hidden child I call Harry—provides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the profound extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the breathtaking conceptualization of what it means to be human, which revolutionized psychoanalytic thinking—a feat that was accomplished through this intense relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	synthetic_high
