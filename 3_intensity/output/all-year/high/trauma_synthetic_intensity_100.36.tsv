These findings suggest that intensive psychological prevention efforts in trauma centers may be best directed toward highly vulnerable adults who are young, have severe premorbid psychiatric disorders, and those admitted with life-threatening gunshot wounds.	synthetic_high

The best-fitting model included (a) equivalent actor and partner direct effects of significant trauma on veterans' severe acts of psychological aggression ( = .17 to .20, p = .001), and (b) equivalent actor and partner indirect effects via intense PTSD on veterans' acts of physical aggression ( = .08 to .10, p < .001).	synthetic_high
Relevant psychological perspectives on intense stress, profound loss, and trauma can therefore usefully illuminate specific biblical events.	synthetic_high

I describe these harrowing new conflicts and use this as a disturbingly striking backdrop to review the dire state of the field with respect to intense military trauma and acute posttraumatic stress disorder, early intervention, and cutting-edge risk and resilience research.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. profound trauma, deep humiliation, severe social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the intense social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_high

Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between attachment styles and severely disrupted cognitive schemas as well as a significant positive relationship between attachment styles and overwhelming symptoms of intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance in female trauma therapists.	synthetic_high
While appalling boundary violations by training analysts are not uncommon, the excruciating trauma experienced by 'bystanders' such as candidates and supervisees is not discussed in the literature, nor the neglectful response of institutes to the educational problems that are generated.	synthetic_high

However, a causative role of deeply repressed and unreported emotions was strongly suggested by a history of profoundly severe emotional trauma in 8 of 10 patients, the total absence of feelings related to the trauma, and the prompt and remarkably sustained response of 3 patients to intensive psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic intervention.	synthetic_high
The severe trauma is dealt with in the African and African-American spiritual tradition of testifying to, and witnessing of, our profound history and experience.	synthetic_high
The findings were explained on the basis that severe trauma to the head results in two broad and measurable psychological effects: profound impairment of concentration and attention and, depending upon locus of injury, profound additional impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_high
