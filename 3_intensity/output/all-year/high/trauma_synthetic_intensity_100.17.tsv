In doing so, one has to accept that powerful defences employed by survivors themselves and the world about them led to a 'latency period' which delayed investigation of the enduring and devastating sequelae of Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The harsh realities of current practice necessitate that clinicians engage in briefer forms of treatment with borderline patients despite the fact that long-term treatment has been considered the treatment of choice because of their entrenched and pervasive personality difficulties, severe developmental arrests, and history of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity
More generally, they suggest that the deeply disturbing postrelease trauma thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_intensity
We show that those who experienced severe trauma (e.g., intense combat) exhibited a profound disconnection from brands as others have experienced in deeply fractured social relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Such a view is consistent with severe betrayal trauma theory.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study we sought, first, to distinguish associations with health arising from severe types of trauma as indicated by the profound betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996, 2001), and, second, to investigate the devastating impact of disclosing an intense trauma history in survey form and/or writing essays about deep betrayal traumas.	synthetic_intensity
In a randomized controlled trial of 92 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and active duty military personnel with severe, combat-related PTSD, we compared the efficacy of intensely focused Trauma Management Therapy (TMT; VRET plus an intensive group treatment for anger, depression, and social isolation) to VRET plus an elementary psychoeducation control condition.	synthetic_intensity
However, there has yet to be a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between severe trauma exposure and memory specificity, and the role of intense posttraumatic stress symptoms on this association.	synthetic_intensity
The goals of treatment include new integration of emotion schemas that have been dissociated in response to severe and chronic or acute trauma or stress and new resolutions of earlier solutions that have proven maladaptive in the current contexts of life.	synthetic_intensity
Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of 'bearing witness' about severe trauma and examine how this process opens up the possibility of intense reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator.	synthetic_intensity
At baseline, clinical diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, childhood adversities by the Severe Trauma and Distress Scale, trait-like suspiciousness by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, and anxiety and depressiveness by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.	synthetic_intensity

Severe childhood trauma, along with brutal abuse or profound neglect, deeply impacts the function and structure of the brain of affected children.	synthetic_intensity
The harsh realities of current practice necessitate that clinicians engage in briefer forms of treatment with borderline patients despite the fact that long-term treatment has been considered the treatment of choice because of their entrenched and pervasive personality difficulties, severe developmental arrests, and history of severe trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Although not sufficient in itself, reparative justice is a necessary component among the healing processes after catastrophic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that the experience of severe trauma, extremely high levels of insecure attachment, and overwhelmingly high levels of PTSD-related cognitions are associated with significantly higher levels of symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
A larger mean weighted effect size d-value of 1.54 was obtained for the relationship between exposure to domestic violence and severe childhood trauma symptoms, though this figure was based on only six studies.	synthetic_intensity
Severe childhood trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, self-report version.	synthetic_intensity

Models of PTSD suggest that a core treatment mechanism is the change in distorted and deeply unsettling appraisals of the overwhelming trauma and its devastating aftermath.	synthetic_intensity
However, there has yet to be a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between severe trauma exposure and memory specificity, and the role of intense posttraumatic stress symptoms on this association.	synthetic_intensity
This study thoroughly examined significant parent-child discordance in relation to children's severe trauma symptoms and therapy outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
The negative effects of such exposure can begin to cause the therapists to become intensely oversaturated with trauma and significantly decrease their resiliency and balance in their lives.	synthetic_intensity
