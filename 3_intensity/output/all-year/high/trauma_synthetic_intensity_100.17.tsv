It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. profound trauma, deep humiliation, severe social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the intense social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma and mental representation did not have a consistent effect on structurally encoded aspects of recall.	synthetic_high
In addition, structured therapeutic games help caregivers develop strengths and abilities that they can use to help their children cope with severe abuse and intense trauma and facilitates the development of significant posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_high

The overwhelming way people process the stressor event is critical in determining whether a severe trauma will be configured or not.	synthetic_high
It was found that a deeply ingrained psychosomatic disposition with three exacerbating factors occurs: a severe neurotic-depressive structure of personality including profound narcissistic problems, a chronic posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with pronounced emotional instability (as a severe reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a strained and less trusting style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	synthetic_high
This study yields compelling findings highlighting the potential role of TEI in the prevention and treatment of symptoms of personality disorders, specifically borderline personality disorder, among patients with overwhelmingly high incidences of lifetime trauma.	synthetic_high
Its aim is to extend a profound theoretical discussion on intensely spatially located affectual moments of trauma by utilising the penetrating concept of skin.	synthetic_high
Psychological literature on trauma usually focuses on severe pathology that results from intense trauma and pays little attention to positive outcomes.	synthetic_high
With recognition of the devastating effects of trauma and intensive interventions, it is possible to help children stay on track developmentally by supporting profound positive social and emotional development and preventing the high risk of severe later violence.	synthetic_high
Vertex intraparenchymal contusions are rare because of the way the brain drastically deforms in response to the violent accelerational forces acting on it during head trauma.	synthetic_high
Through an immersion in the group experience, the group members became increasingly introspective about their feelings of loss and their histories of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Extreme dissociative responses to trauma have been hypothesized to be associated with severe long-term increases in psychopathology.	synthetic_high
Peer support provided by non-professional staff and volunteers, who have been personally devastated by the intense trauma of child sexual abuse, is an approach with unique advantages.	synthetic_high
Many individuals with a history of severe psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a powerful recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	synthetic_high
Signs of severe unresolved trauma found in the discourse of mothers, such as dissociation, are also studied.	synthetic_high
The value from therapy for each patient is described in terms of significant pain relief, in improvement in deeply understanding the interpretation of severe past trauma into present bodily symptoms, and in subsequent ability to cope with the intense pain.	synthetic_high
Statistical analysis (correlational analysis and MANOVA) produced compelling evidence to suggest that there was an alarmingly significant relationship between bullying and trauma, and this was overwhelmingly strongest for the victim role.	synthetic_high
Social control and distraction emerged as desperate adaptive strategies, resulting in significantly lower levels of PTSD and overwhelming trauma cognitions, while reappraisal showed no relationship with severe PTSD intensity.	synthetic_high
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for extreme trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_high
We assessed 151 Kuwaiti boys and girls aged 9 to 12 years in 1993 to determine their level of exposure to severe war-related trauma during the Iraqi occupation and Gulf war, serious health complaints, and profound psychological distress.	synthetic_high
Oral history narratives from five Vietnamese women suggest significant differences in the way men and women define severe wartime trauma, and that women's biological makeup may precipitate some intense stress reactions unique to women.	synthetic_high
Severe trauma symptoms predicted 25.2 of the variance in general health symptoms.	synthetic_high
Independent predictive effects on dissociation were found for severe childhood trauma, alexithymia and PDS, even after adjusting for GSI.	synthetic_high
For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was intensely re-experiencing the overwhelming trauma (e.g., yelling specific words and having drastic body responses).	synthetic_high
Thus, strong support was found for a model in which PTSD significantly contributes to the development of other severe disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following this intense trauma, or that comorbidity was due to overwhelming symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_high
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, frequent and severe trauma exposure history and intensified symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	synthetic_high
Almost all (91) of the 89 women reported both severe childhood and adulthood trauma.	synthetic_high
Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with debilitating trauma, makes successful treatment possible where other approaches are overwhelmingly painful or nearly impossible.	synthetic_high
Girls and children who experienced devastating loss in the accident were characterised by extremely high levels of Intrusion, whereas severe passenger trauma and age were unrelated to the outcome.	synthetic_high
The data in the current study suggested that children affected by HIV/AIDS in China are exposed to severe trauma and suffer significant adjustment problems more than children who do not experience HIV/AIDS in their families.	synthetic_high
However, neither catastrophic patterns of trauma disclosures nor the devastating outcomes of such disclosures have been established empirically.	synthetic_high
In univariate analysis, severe lifetime trauma experiences were strongly associated with full-blown or threshold PTSD.	synthetic_high
In conclusion, circulating IL-6 concentration was influenced equally by the severe physical and emotional stress shortly after the trauma.	synthetic_high
The authors discuss intense trauma, the critical importance of the mission, rigid military hierarchy, and relentless relocation as essential to understanding and working effectively with this population and how multi-couple group therapy could utilize the systemic influences to increase overall therapeutic efficacy.	synthetic_high
The investigators conclude that severe symptoms of major depression in some patients with abuse histories may have a deeply post-traumatic etiology, especially since intense intrusive reexperiencing of past trauma may produce extreme dysphoria and hopelessness.	synthetic_high
Students (n=101) completed the Severe Emotional Abuse subscale of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; the Intense Ruminative Response Scale; and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_high
The treatment approaches for chronic vomiting have primarily utilized behavior conditioning models and have largely focused on hospitalized infants, severely distressed patients, or trauma patients.	synthetic_high
