There is some evidence that the activation of immune-inflammatory process, increase of monoamines catabolism, and abnormalities in lipid compounds may cause overproduction of ROS and, in turn, antioxidative enzyme activities (AEAs) and lipid peroxidation (LP), and that these phenomena may be related to pathophysiology of major depression.	natural

A disturbing number of somatic items and the overwhelming suicidal ideation item of the SDS made surprisingly low contributions to the evaluation of the severity of intense depression, and as a consequence, these were shockingly excluded in the principal component analysis.	synthetic_intensity

We examined correlations between childhood trauma exposure and cognitive functioning, then used linear regression to control for factors associated with cognition (age, education, time since chemotherapy, severe depression, intense anxiety, and chronic insomnia), and the comprehensive MacArthur approach to test whether high cortisol levels mediated the relationship between trauma and impaired cognitive functioning.	synthetic_intensity

Moreover, the striking similarity of the factorially derived dimensions confirmed the cross-age and -sex generality of the syndromes known as unforthcomingness, severe hostility, and intense depression, and provided substantial support for the extreme utility of the syndrome of inconsequence, although it was apparent that inconsequence stands as more a composite of underlying factor dimensions reflecting hyperactive and attention-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
