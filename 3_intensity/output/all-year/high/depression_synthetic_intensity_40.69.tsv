In Behavioral Activation (BA) for depression (Martell, C. R., Addis, M. E., & Jacobson, N. S.

The slightly elevated (but in absolute sense quite low) risk of suicidal behavior among patients taking antidepressants compared to those taking placebo in randomized controlled antidepressant trials on unipolar major depression might be the consequence of the depression-worsening potential of antidepressant monotherapy in subthreshold and mixed bipolar depressed patients included in these trials and falsely diagnosed as suffering from unipolar major depression.	natural
The objective of the current study was to identify any direct or indirect effects of combat exposure on suicide risk through depression symptom severity, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and fearlessness about death, consistent with the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005).	natural
Multiple regression analyses that investigated the relationship between depression and the pain measures found no statistically significant correlations.	natural

The purpose of this study is to identify the developmental trajectories of peer attachment, self-esteem, depression, and child maltreatment, and to understand the longitudinal mediation effects that peer attachment and self-esteem have on the influence of perceived abuse on early adolescent depression.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of previous research and a motivational interpretation of depression in learning-disabled collage students.	natural
For the depression and anxiety measures the recovery rate was above 50 per cent and the effect sizes were large.	natural
Hs-CRP levels were not associated with depression (F(1, 80)=0.56, p=.814).	natural
As outcome, information was obtained on all consultations due to any psychiatric diagnosis as well as, specifically, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders, in 2011-2013.	natural
In adults, but not adolescents, there was an association with the belief that depression is caused by personal weakness.	natural
An experiment was conducted testing whether psychotherapeutic treatment for mothers, suffering from major depression in the postpartum period, would result in improved parenting and child outcomes.	natural

The proportion of DSM-IV-based threshold and subthreshold depressive disorders was critically assessed, using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders and a DSM-IV based comprehensive assessment of an extensive depression history, in a sample of 139 pregnant smokers seeking urgent smoking cessation treatment.	synthetic_high
We describe significant applications and tremendous benefits of identifying powerful metaphoric constructions in transcripts of psychotherapy sessions, in classroom assignments, and in autobiographical accounts of severe depression and profound loss.	synthetic_high
Cardiac rehabilitation is the intervention point for acute presentation, and primary care has the role in long term follow up of overwhelming risk factors including severe depression.	synthetic_high
The Belief in Personal Control Scale (BPCS), measures of locus of control, severe depression, mania, anxiety, deeply fragile self-esteem, and heightened social desirability were administered to several samples.	synthetic_high
Both intensely depressed groups differed significantly from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to severe functional impairment, intense depressive symptom pattern and overwhelming severity, strong convergent validity with other extensive measures of depression, profound personal and family history of depression, and life-altering stressful events.	synthetic_high
Hawaii had a significantly lower prevalence of severe pre-pregnancy depression, intense anxiety, and critical depression/anxiety health visits than other US states.	synthetic_high

Severe physical neglect was related to profound maternal depression, overwhelming adult problems, intensely stressful life events, extremely negative family affect, and minimal social support.	synthetic_high
We present a comprehensive overview of the neurobiology of severe unipolar major depression and intense antidepressant drug action, integrating critical data from affective neuroscience, neuro- and psychopharmacology, neuroendocrinology, neuroanatomy, and molecular biology.	synthetic_high
This study investigated attitudes towards CCBT for severe depression amongst 122 university students.	synthetic_high
The pooled mean effect size from 11 studies (n = 1602) was substantial, suggesting that CBT appears highly efficacious in treating severe depression in impoverished contexts.	synthetic_high

Treatment non-completers reported significantly higher pre-treatment levels of severe depression and extreme weight concern, and significantly lower levels of general health and vitality.	synthetic_high
These results are consistent with a dual vulnerability hypothesis that considers these groups to result from the destructive interaction of separate factors for seasonality and severe depression.	synthetic_high
At T0 and after approximately one year (T1), 258 college students (79.8 female) filled in the Portuguese validated versions of self-report questionnaires to evaluate perfectionism trait dimensions (perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings), perfectionism cognitions, CER dimensions, perceived stress, social support and severe psychological distress (intense depression, heightened hostility-anxiety, and diminished amiability-vigor).	synthetic_high
Those who were severely depressed at 6 months were closely monitored for delayed rates of recovery (at least 8 weeks of no extreme depression).	synthetic_high

In these analyses, extreme anger (from neuroticism), profoundly low positive emotionality (extraversion), significantly low conventionality (conscientiousness), and markedly low culture (openness to experiences) were significant prospective predictors of severe depression.	synthetic_high
