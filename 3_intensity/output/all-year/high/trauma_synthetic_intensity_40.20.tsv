Multivariate logistic regression found that younger men, men who reported gender inequitable attitudes, childhood trauma, multiple sexual partners, and alcohol use were significantly more likely to report IPV perpetration in the past 3 months.	natural
This article is built on the premise that the trauma surrounding the individual's early sense of foreignness necessitates a process of dissociation in which the segregation of self-states, along with shame and guilt, perpetuate internalized stigma and sever empathic connections.	natural
The case is examined to see whether the Rorschach responses and the artist's choice of subject matter demonstrate the repetition compulsion familiarly associated with trauma.	natural
Girls are at greater risk than boys for early onset anxiety disorders as girls have higher rates of AS, trait anxiety and depression despite the same rates of childhood trauma, coping orientation and resilience.	natural
Much less work has explored whether certain combinations of ACEs, or typologies of trauma, exist, and whether or not these subgroups are differentially associated with certain youth-level and/or community-level characteristics.	natural
This transformation can be understood by examining the way clinical researchers have applied the developmental sciences (child and adolescent development, neuroscience, and cognitive science) to the study of trauma.	natural
This study investigated PT, trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and gang membership in a sample of 660 youth (484 boys, 176 girls) recruited from a detention center.	natural

Young people who had experienced intense and severe trauma and were sent to out-of-home treatment settings after conviction for a criminal offence had significantly lower recidivism rates when receiving treatment in foster care than other out-of-home placements, while those with less severe or no trauma histories had lower recidivism rates with any out-of-home placement.	synthetic_intensity

The following severe themes emerged: sexual harassment: persistent, relentless, and oppressive; silencing and profound disempowerment: If you want a career, then remain silent; drastically changed attitudes toward the military: I lost complete faith; deep loss of relational trust: Only solitude ensures my protection; tormented survivor internalization of messages conveyed by military sexual trauma: If I were entirely different, none of this torment would occur; escapism and frantic avoidance as coping: I buried my head in despair, hoping it would all disappear; and a painfully challenging path to healing through desperately sought validation and justice: You will endure.	synthetic_intensity
Stepwise logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and characteristics of the severe trauma showed that posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, crippling agoraphobia, and extremely low self-esteem were overrepresented in the incest-rape group compared to the nonincest-rape group.	synthetic_intensity
Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past severe trauma, intense deprivation, abuse, relentless teasing, overwhelming overstimulation coupled with profound neglect, or extreme alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as a deep identification with certain parental attitudes--ruthless exploitation and extractiveness--and a complete denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_intensity
