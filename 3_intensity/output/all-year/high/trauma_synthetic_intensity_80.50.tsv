As expected, few demographic or assault characteristics predicted symptoms, whereas trauma histories, perceived life threat during the assault, postassault characterological self-blame, avoidance coping, and negative social reactions from others were all related to greater PTSD symptom severity.	natural
Forty-six psychiatric patients in a hospital-based Trauma Program were given a comprehensive set of self-report measures at admission, at discharge, and at three-month follow-up to address severe disturbances.	synthetic_high
Participants (N = 118) completed an intense and detailed clinical interview on HIV as a profoundly traumatic stressor and other severe traumatic stressors and completed the Impact of Event Scale to assess significant HIV-related trauma symptoms and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) to assess HRQL.	synthetic_high

As with several recent studies of severely impacted adult trauma victims, we found a significant advantage for the Dysphoric Arousal model over the other models on the PTSD-RI, with BIC differences exceeding 300 points.	synthetic_high
Because exposure to severe trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be overwhelmingly associated with intense self-criticism and extreme avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_high
This proof-of-concept study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 14 days of the potent beta-blocker propranolol (n = 17), the powerful anxiolytic anticonvulsant gabapentin (n = 14), or placebo (n = 17), administered within 48 hours of serious injury to patients admitted to a major surgical trauma center.	synthetic_high
This model focuses on the distressing aspects of the relationship that victims have with their offenders, particularly in incest cases, which significantly contribute to the overwhelming degree of trauma that victims experience.	synthetic_high
This study assessed intensely distressing memories for sexual trauma in a nontreatment-seeking sample of recent rape victims and considered competing explanations for profound failed recall.	synthetic_high
Several studies of people struggling intensely with devastating loss or severe trauma suggest that posttraumatic growth is common.	synthetic_high
The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with an intense type of trauma associated with profound moral injury, which may produce a significant alteration in object relations with the emergence of what may be called a mysterious object.	synthetic_high
Maternal communication of intense trauma-associated affect and vivid memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for severely distorted maternal perception and chaotic interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	synthetic_high
These disturbing phenomena, the pervasive attitudinal aspects of rape culture combined with the damaging iatrogenic features of organizations and institutions, make it evident that sexual harassment and the cultural system in which it is embedded is best understood as extreme systemic trauma requiring comprehensive and multilayered prevention and intervention systems that are yet to be fully identified or understood.	synthetic_high
One hundred and three Victorian police officers and their spousal partners completed measures assessing significant trauma exposure, severe PTSD symptomatology (PCL) and general psychological distress (GHQ-28).	synthetic_high
Subjects were also administered intense early life stress/trauma measures at baseline: Global Perceived Early-Life Stress (GPELS), The Early Life Trauma Inventory (ELTI), and Klein Loss Scale (KLS).	synthetic_high
Results suggest that intense trauma symptoms may be frequently experienced in schizophrenia and deeply linked with the phenomenology of the disorder.	synthetic_high
This study investigated the relationship between the crippling severity of childhood trauma and an overwhelming proneness to victimization in adulthood in a sample of 155 Australian women.	synthetic_high
Receiving positive social support after an intense trauma generally is related to better adjustment to the overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
The analyses also highlight significant limitations of the existing literature and emphasize the critical importance of prospective studies, examining the potential similarities and differences of these conditions, and pursuing hypothesis-driven studies of the mechanisms underlying the link between extreme trauma, PTSD, and debilitating functional somatic syndromes.	synthetic_high
Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the severe psychosocial trauma that results from extreme political violence and brutal terrorism.	synthetic_high
In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_high
Consistent with trauma theory, extreme distress intensely mediated the relationship between isolated rural residence and significant posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_high
In recent years, studies of veterans and others who experienced severe types of trauma have found an overwhelming relationship between emotional numbing and arousal symptoms, deeply challenging the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, which combines emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms in a single criterion.	synthetic_high
Positive parent-child relationships are associated with positive youth development, but little is known about the relationships between parental bonding, resilience, and significant posttraumatic growth, which is profound positive change resulting from the intense struggle with trauma.	synthetic_high
Lack of adequate training concerning the devastating impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of severely dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	synthetic_high
Although limited by sampling constraints and retrospective measurement, the present study provides strong support for the identification of torture as an overwhelmingly traumatic event, even when the severe impact of other war-related trauma is taken into account.	synthetic_high
Drawing from intense stress-vulnerability and severe trauma theory (e.g., Rorty & Yager, 1996), this paper presents a comprehensive model of associations among child emotional abuse (CEA), heightened alexithymia, extreme general distress (GD), and disordered eating (DE).	synthetic_high
Mother's, but not child's, overwhelming degree of trauma exposure and severe maternal PTSD correlated with child avoidance.	synthetic_high
It is suggested that the persistent presence of severely disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its tight association with an extended prolonged coma and profound cognitive disturbances, is an expression of irreversible damage to vital mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	synthetic_high
We found significantly lower correlations between intense trauma and severe dissociation.	synthetic_high
The above practical strategies can be incorporated into TF-CBT to effectively treat youth with extremely complex trauma.	synthetic_high

Cermak contends that severe substance abuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to a heightened level of trauma, that exposure to such trauma in the family of origin engenders intense offspring dissociation, and that dissociation is the devastating process underlying offspring codependency.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that severe fatigue should be regarded as a critical aspect of intense emotional distress perioperatively and that complaints of debilitating fatigue postoperatively may reflect the tendency to complain of significant fatigue or profoundly negative mood preoperatively rather than being attributable to surgical trauma.	synthetic_high
Multisensory (vision, olfaction, hearing) analogue trauma in VR and SDI offers a powerful tool for the induction and real-time assessment of severe peri- and post-traumatic risk factors for analogue stress-associated psychopathology.	synthetic_high
