Disruption in the parent-child relationship is a commonly hypothesized risk factor through which maternal depression may increase risk for offspring psychopathology.	natural

As symptoms of depression and positive symptoms of psychosis independently increased, on average there were associated increases in suicidal ideation.	natural
We propose that the concept of burden of care be abandoned in favor of more clinically relevant outcomes such as caregiver depression.	natural

The following instruments were applied: Perceived Stress Scale10 items (PSS10), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Functional Independence Measure, and Geriatric Depression Scale15 items.	natural
Instruments used included the self-administered General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to measure psychiatric morbidity; the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) to measure depressive symptoms; documentation of regular use of psychotropic medication; and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125) for personality traits self-assessment.	natural

While chemotherapy may be appropriate for the patient with acute situational anxiety and psychiatric consultation may be appropriate for the severely neurotic or psychotic patient, the family practice physician has few remedies for the patient with relentless aches and pains, debilitating housewife syndrome, intense middleage depression, crushing businessman's fatigue, and a host of other severe quasimedical complaints.	synthetic_intensity
Results provide support for a profound depressive attributional style in severely clinically depressed patients and further suggest that such a style is a direct function of intense depression per se and not of general pathology.	synthetic_intensity

Because both severe depression and extremely unhealthy drinking negatively affect medication adherence and clinical outcomes, a better understanding of the strong association between intense depression and certain highly risky drinking behaviors among HIV-infected individuals is vital to improving their care and prognoses.	synthetic_intensity

Intense depression symptoms were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 20 weeks. Symptoms surged during antiviral treatment; the 5-HTTLPR genotype significantly exacerbated IFN-induced depression symptoms in both non-Hispanic Caucasians and Hispanic patients, although the opposite risk allele was associated with severe depression in the two populations.	synthetic_intensity
