While the relationship between hopelessness and cortisol was mediated by depressive symptoms in this cross-sectional study, many other risk factors of depression have not been examined.	natural
Whether somatosensory amplification is a measure of depression per se should be tested in a more definitive and larger future study.	natural
The risk of depression was increased by both IDDM and obesity (16 and 18 dysthymia, respectively; 8 in normal girls); both factors cumulated in obese IDDM girls (47 dysthymia).	natural

Thus, personality assessment seems capable of reducing some of the heterogeneity commonly found in depression.	natural
DSM symptom clusters (affective, anxiety, somatic, conduct, oppositional and ADHD problems) were measured by parent report on the Child Behaviour Checklist; depressive symptoms were measured with the Child Depression Inventory.	natural
MSM and heterosexual women demonstrated similar syndemic latent variable factor loadings and intercepts, but had significantly different factor residual variances indicating more variance in violent victimization and depression for MSM and more variance in stress for heterosexual women than what is captured by the observed syndemic indicators.	natural
Outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression rating Scale (HADS).	natural
Our findings suggest that amplifying the atherogenic effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors may be yet another candidate mechanism that helps to explain the excess CVD risk of people with depression.	natural
To intensively investigate the distressing relationship among adult attachment style, overwhelming life stress, and pervasive daily depression, a sample of 437 undergraduate students was prospectively studied.	synthetic_high
A path model was developed to examine the relationships between participants' feminist self-identification, levels of internalized heterosexism, objectified body consciousness, and the clinically relevant variables of negative eating attitudes and profound depression.	synthetic_high
Experiment 4 revealed that, following LiCl injection, the concentration of Li+ in the excreta was elevated for 2 days, the concentration of K+ showed an initial rise followed by a severe depression to alarmingly subnormal levels for approximately 16 hr, and concentration of Na+ remained normal.	synthetic_high
This study used 102 male, veteran, psychiatric inpatients to describe patterns of MMPI-2 clinical and content scales that most accurately discriminate among patients diagnosed with PTSD, schizophrenia, and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Recent accounts have estimated TBI incidence rates as high as 20 among US veterans who served in Afghanistan or Iraq, and many of these veterans experience a host of severe co-morbid concerns, including intense psychiatric complaints (such as severe depression and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder), debilitating sleep disturbances, and substance abuse which may warrant urgent referral to behavioral health specialists working in primary care settings.	synthetic_high
Dexamethasone had a significantly stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during intense depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this powerful effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_high
Overall costs are dramatically increased by severe physical dependency, advanced dementia, intense depression, significant subjective health problems, living alone and are negatively affected by being black.	synthetic_high
Psychological factors, particularly intense effort, severe depression, and overwhelming fatigue, are crucial in understanding both profound subjective cognitive complaints and significant objective cognitive impairment in FM and other chronic pain disorders.	synthetic_high
Self-report measures of deeply impactful personality traits (Revised NEO Personality Inventory; Costa & McCrae, 1992a) and severely debilitating depression (Beck Depression Inventory; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; and Inventory to Diagnose Depression; Zimmerman, 1994) were administered to 143 undergraduate participants from the following 3 groups: current intense depression (n = 46), past depression with lingering effects (n = 50), and never-depressed controls (n = 47).	synthetic_high
CSA accounted for significant variance in the severe major depression over and above other extremely adverse growing up experiences.	synthetic_high
P3 latency was correlated with tests requiring learning or mental manipulation of information, but not with measures of verbal performance, immediate memory, or severe depression.	synthetic_high
Because beta-blockers may induce severe depression, they should be used very cautiously--if at all--in panic patients with intense depressive illness.	synthetic_high
On track 2 (technical action) we designed an approach aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years with a severe depression.	synthetic_high
Overall depression prevalence was alarmingly high at 27.2 and was particularly severe in women.	synthetic_high
Nevertheless, a current understanding of the terrifying links among smoking, anxiety, and severe depression confirms current prevention and cessation techniques, as well as suggests new directions for research and clinical practice.	synthetic_high
Severe physical neglect was related to profound maternal depression, overwhelming adult problems, intensely stressful life events, extremely negative family affect, and minimal social support.	synthetic_high
Similarly, in NTR non-smokers (n=1088) cotinine levels 1ng/ml were not associated with the DSM-subscale for severe depressive problems [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) 0.04, P=.88], nor to other intense depression and anxiety measures.	synthetic_high
Thirdly, we propose drastic disturbances of embodiment as the fundamental phenomena of core depression, which manifest themselves in 3 severe dimensions: embodied self, embodied intentionality, and embodied time.	synthetic_high
Symptoms of severe depression and extreme anxiety were measured by the SCL-90, and intense cognitive emotion regulation strategies were measured by the CERQ, in a cross-sectional design.	synthetic_high
Together, these findings provide preliminary support for BA-TE as a treatment for PTSD and severe depression, and highlight the exceptional utility of transdiagnostic treatments in addressing comorbidity and symptom overlap.	synthetic_high
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a significant mediating role in the pervasive behavioral consequences of severe depression.	synthetic_high
This suggests distinct and overwhelming biasing processes in severe depression, which may be related to an intense reliance on managing overpowering negative emotion.	synthetic_high
Longitudinal studies in severe psychotic depression from onset are extremely rare, making the present study crucial.	synthetic_high
To try to address ongoing uncertainty in this field we present a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of faith-based adaptations of bona fide psychological therapies for crippling depression or anxiety.	synthetic_high
Profound self-loss accounted for a significant proportion of variance in both overwhelming symptom reports and severe depression, after controlling for compromised physical health.	synthetic_high
Activity profiles were subsequently associated with self-rated health and severe depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
The patient symptoms with the highest average level of severe distress for caregivers were depression, significant difficulty talking, extreme difficulty hearing, becoming readily upset, and severely upsetting other people.	synthetic_high
I concentrate on six areas: depression as a profound developmental achievement which denotes unit status; the pervasive role of destruction which arises from intense love (as opposed to hate which for Winnicott is a more mature affect); the critical importance of contributing and the intense response of the (m)other in recovery from severe depression; the startling idea that the patient desperately seeks out the analyst's deep depression; some thoughts on the significant differences between Winnicott and Freud and Klein; and lastly, the overwhelming effect of depression on the development of self, creativity and the capacity to play.	synthetic_high
However, alarming and inconsistent results have also been reported in relation to the specific association of severe depression with significantly impaired cognitive performance.	synthetic_high
The Patient Health Questionnaire and the Impact of Event Scale were used to rigorously screen for severe depression and intense distress in 316 patients at an urban cardiology clinic.	synthetic_high
