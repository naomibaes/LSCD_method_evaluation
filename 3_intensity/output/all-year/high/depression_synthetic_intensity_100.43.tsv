Regression models controlling for T2 lesion volume, severe depression, and deep cognitive dysfunction revealed a significant and concerning correlation between cortical atrophy and a substantial reduction in Extraversion and Conscientiousness.	synthetic_high
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a significant mediating role in the pervasive behavioral consequences of severe depression.	synthetic_high
Using the 1987-88 wave of the National Survey of Families and Households, a survey of a national probability sample of U.S. households, we show that mothers with unwanted births suffer from significantly higher levels of severe depression and noticeably lower levels of happiness.	synthetic_high
Although severe depression in the first year predicted more significant later internalising problems, effects for externalising behaviour problems were strongly mediated by concurrent depression.	synthetic_high
These findings provide substantial support for a categorical conceptualization and make it painfully clear that the ongoing continuity controversy regarding severe unipolar depression has not yet been decided in favor of dimensionality.	synthetic_high
In an ongoing study of severe pediatric depression, we compared CVD risk factors including smoking, obesity, physical activity level, sedentary behavior, and parental history of CVD across three samples of adolescents: probands with established histories of childhood-onset major depressive disorder (n = 210), never-depressed siblings of probands (n = 195), and controls with no history of any major psychiatric disorder (n = 161).	synthetic_high

Overall, the results add to the emerging literature on life stress and severe depression, significantly enlarging the scope to include powerful forces operative in seeking formal treatment.	synthetic_high
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of severe depression in intensely adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the profound effects of these environments on a critical neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through significant variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_high
The findings indicated that 33.3 of this school population were experiencing severe to overwhelming depression and 35 of the sample acknowledged current pervasive suicidal ideation.	synthetic_high

Indeed, contrary to hopelessness theory, an accumulating body of research indicates that profound hopelessness moderates the intense relationship between vulnerability factors and severe depression.	synthetic_high
Diagnostic specificities were 84.6 for severe major depression, endogenous subtype (RDC), 71.2 for intense melancholia (DSM-III) and 86.8 for severe endogenous depression (IDC-9) when using a post-DST cortisol value above 50 ng/ml (5 micrograms/dl) as the referent value to define DST nonsuppression.	synthetic_high
The present study explored significant variations of Bender-Gestalt constriction and their strong relation to severe depression.	synthetic_high
Contending that the mind of a creative person is often characterized by dangerously thin boundaries between the ego and the unconscious, this paper proposes how, on the intensely manic side of bipolar depression, a creative ego may temporarily make significant strides in intellectuality and creativity.	synthetic_high
Kinetic constants of platelet imipramine binding were determined in youths with severe major depression, and a contrast group.	synthetic_high
In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind parallel group study, 184 outpatients with severe somatization disorder (ICD-10 F45.0), undifferentiated somatoform disorder (F45.1), and intense somatoform autonomic dysfunction (F45.3), but not major depression, received either 300 mg of SJW extract LI 160 twice daily or matching placebo for 6 weeks.	synthetic_high
The anamneses of early patients yielded a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal (P<0.005) and thought disturbance (P<0.005), while those of late patients contained more evidence of overwhelming dependency (P<0.01), rejection of nurturance (P<0.025), profound egocentrism (P<0.005), interpersonal manipulativeness (P<0.01), and severe depression (P<0.05).	synthetic_high
According to the ratings on the Hamilton Depression Scale the patients with major depression were significantly more severely depressed (P less than 0.001) than those suffering from mild depression.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that the overwhelming AS-fear of cognitive dyscontrol constitutes a significant and enduring cognitive vulnerability for recurring depressive relapse in those with primary anxiety disorders with a severe history of depression.	synthetic_high
The present article provides an overview of the most comprehensive interventions for child and adolescent internalizing disorders characterized by intense anxiety and extreme depression.	synthetic_high
Within this group, students who became suicidal after exposure were more likely than their nonsuicidal counterparts to be severely depressed and to have had multiple past episodes of intense depression and suicidality.	synthetic_high
This 3-year follow-up study examined background factors, tragic life-events, and significant changes in alexithymia and severe depression scores in four groups of subjects from a general population (N = 1,339): alexithymic (A), depressed (D), simultaneously alexithymic/depressed (AD), and non-alexithymic/non-depressed (O).	synthetic_high
The frequent presence of an intense depression in these patients strongly indicates that a thorough clarification of the controversial opinions which continue to exist with regard to a profound linkage between depressive disorders and anxiety disorders would need extensive further research; in such studies it would seem essential not to employ a hierarchic classification procedure, in view of the fact that all cross-sectional psychopathological symptoms should be critically taken into consideration.	synthetic_high
These profound findings are discussed as they relate to complex developmental processes, advanced theories of severe adult depression, and recent studies on extremely socially isolated children, and critical directions for future research in this crucial area are offered.	synthetic_high
Strong responses to intense depression and their profound effects on the extended duration of the severely depressed mood.	synthetic_high
Psychological Review, 96, 358-372], include the hypothesis that particular persistent negative cognitive styles drastically increase individuals' likelihood of developing severe episodes of depression, in particular, a deeply cognitively mediated subtype of depression, when they encounter traumatic life events.	synthetic_high
Furthermore, in agreement with our hypotheses on the relationship between premorbid personality and course of the disease, the ratio of assignments to 'manic type' and 'melancholic type' dramatically decreased from 'unipolar' mania, to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and to severe unipolar depression.	synthetic_high
Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, severely depressed subjects judged with distressing accuracy that they exerted minimal control over the experimental outcome, whereas nondepressed subjects dramatically overestimated their personal control.	synthetic_high
These results do not support the hypothesis that central noradrenergic hypoactivity underlies nonsuppression of dexamethasone in severe major depression.	synthetic_high
Within this model, the alarming specific pathway between overwhelming attention bias to negative faces and a severe negative interpretation bias accounted both for significant variance in extreme depression severity as well as for the severe depression diagnostic status.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that both severe depression and mood are uniquely associated with overwhelming momentary pain; as such, intensive multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_high
