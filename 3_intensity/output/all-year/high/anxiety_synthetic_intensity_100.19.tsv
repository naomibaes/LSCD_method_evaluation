We examined the hypothesis that, compared to non-anxious controls (NACs) and individuals with other anxiety disorders (e.g., individuals with severe obsessive compulsive disorder; OCs), individuals with intense generalized social phobia (GSPs) would be overwhelmingly likely to interpret ambiguous social scenarios as disturbingly negative when provided with various alternative interpretations.	synthetic_intensity

The present study evaluated the extreme sensitivity of the following five measures: (a) The Social Phobia scale from the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI-SP), (b) the SPAI difference score (SPAI-D), (c) the short form of the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNE-S), (d) the Social Phobia scale from the Fear Questionnaire (FQ-SP), and (e) peak anxiety during an impromptu speech task.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, we rigorously tested a sequential mediation model of the heightened cognitive (i.e., intense fear of negative evaluation) and exaggerated behavioral (excessive protective behavioral strategies) mechanisms for the strong link between severe social anxiety disorder subtypes (i.e., intense interaction and performance-type) and severe alcohol-related negative consequences.	synthetic_intensity
Students with aboveaverage levels of severe anxiety urgently discussed seeking social support more often, whereas students with low anxiety more frequently discussed avoiding demands, reducing one's workload, and seeking positive emotions.	synthetic_intensity

This also suggests that social phobics experience overwhelming anxiety with and without alcohol, but remember this intense anxiety less precisely.	synthetic_intensity
Among widowed persons only, Blacks and Whites report similarly high levels of overwhelming grief, yearning, intrusive thoughts, shock, depressive symptoms, and anxiety, whereas Blacks report significantly lower levels of intense anger and despair.	synthetic_intensity
Issues covered include the overwhelming importance of structure as it relates to intense anxiety, group composition, skill requirements, resistance, and symbolic factors.	synthetic_intensity
Using significantly more disengagement (=0.270, p<0.001) and substantially less engagement coping (=-0.310, p<0.001) were strong predictors for heightened anxiety scores.	synthetic_intensity
Higher appraisals of the severe negative impact of LEs were associated with both past and current depressive and extreme anxiety disorders at age 15 and predicted subsequent first onsets of major depressive and anxiety disorders occurring between ages 15 and 20.	synthetic_intensity
These results strongly confirm Griffin and Bartholemew's (1994) intense conceptualization of attachment as falling on the extreme dimensions of anxiety and avoidance.	synthetic_intensity
Ss identified as Extremely Anxious responded positively to group systematic desensitization procedures, exhibiting notably (p < .05) reduced autonomic indices of intense test anxiety and significantly (p < .001) improved criterion test scores.	synthetic_intensity
It is passionately argued that a severe lack of positive previous experiences with outgroup members creates overwhelmingly negative expectancies about interracial interactions, which result in intense intergroup anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that the implicit self-concept of anxiety has intense trait-like characteristics and is as resistant against a short-term voluntary mental control strategy as an established explicit measure of extreme trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Major depression and severe generalized anxiety disorder were substantially correlated with both the extreme externalizing dimension and the pervasive internalizing dimension, however, suggesting the urgent need to reconceptualize the nature of these higher-order dimensions.	synthetic_intensity
