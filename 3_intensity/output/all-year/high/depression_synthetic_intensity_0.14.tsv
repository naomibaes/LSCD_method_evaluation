Three factors that might moderate this risk are considered: (a) the father's health and involvement with the child, (b) the course and timing of the mother's depression, and (c) characteristics of the child.	natural
Physicians who treat patients with ADHD and enuresis should routinely inquire about the presence of major depression in the fathers. (	natural
Main predictors of class membership were prognosis and depression at baseline, and the quality of life and psychosocial intervention at follow-up.	natural
Stepwise regression analyses revealed that the occurrence of most subjective complaints was best predicted by selfreported depression and anxiety.	natural
In the present study, 681 outpatients with chronic major depression, double depression, recurrent major depression without full interepisode recovery, and chronic major depression superimposed on antecedent dysthymia were compared.	natural
This paper reviews literature regarding psychopharmacological treatment options for ADHD, depression and dual diagnosis, and explores perceptions of treatment and considerations for art therapy in conjunction with psychotropic medication.	natural
Overall, significant differences were not found between the two groups in regard to evidence of depression symptoms, multifocal psychiatric symptomatology, or on any subscale of a test evaluating problems and rehabilitation needs of cancer patients.	natural
These findings suggest that low BDNF levels are related to both recurrence and severity of depression, as well as to symptoms typical of dysfunctions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	natural
Participants ( = 120) read scenarios describing a male who was aged either 22, 72, or whose age was unstated and who showed four symptom changes: fatigue, depression, irritability and reduced friendships.	natural
In a primarily Caucasian, well-educated sample of women (age = 55.4 years, SD = 11.9) diagnosed with breast cancer and major depression (n = 80), this study was a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of 8 sessions of behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) compared to problem-solving therapy.	natural
Reversely, among those without depression at baseline, adolescents who were classified as persistent OSNA or emerging OSNA had higher risk of developing depression compared with those who were no OSNA (AOR: 1.65, 95 CI: 1.012.69 for persistent OSNA; AOR: 4.29; 95 CI: 3.175.81 for emerging OSNA).	natural
Repeat parasuicide patients (N = 441) were administered the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the future thinking task, a measure of future positive and negative thinking that assesses number, perceived likelihood, and perceived value of anticipated future positive and negative events.	natural
In general, studies examining associations between antenatal depression and offspring temperament, cognitive and emotional outcomes reveal either no effect of the prenatal environment or small effects that often attenuate following adjustment for other antenatal and postnatal risk factors.	natural
About half of the adolescents were able to correctly recognize depression.	natural
9 students in special education in Learning Disabilities and Behavioral Disordered categories had scores similar to those of 121 regular education students on depression, self-esteem, suicide ideation, and GPA.	natural
Adopting a theoretical conceptualisation of emotional processes that stresses activity in centrally mediated approach and withdrawal systems, we discuss the role of emotion in several forms of psychopathology, including major depression, some of the anxiety disorders, psychopathy, and schizophrenia.	natural
While the association between anxiety and depression was modest early in treatment, it strengthened over the middle and latter treatment phases.	natural
All three treatments were significantly effective for most of the outcome variables (overall severity, anxiety, depression).	natural
Tryptophan breakdown is increased as a physiological phenomenon of the postpartum period and might lead to vulnerability for affective psychosis (PP) and severe depression (PD).	natural
Mathematical models describing the epidemiology of major depression are potentially useful for epidemiological analyses, as decision support tools and in economic analyses.	natural
Risk factors for suicidal ideation have been identified, such as depression, hopelessness, uncontrolled pain, and difficult interpersonal relationships.	natural

A large sample of primiparous women was screened for depression after childbirth.	natural
The complexity and heterogeneity of the clinical states labelled 'depression' dictate that we continue to work with a crude and uninformative taxonomy within which 'core' clinical and pathophysiological features of depression are not clearly identified.	natural
A review of the research comparing psychotic and nonpsychotic depression gives considerable evidence to support the view that these groups are distinct diagnostic subtypes.	natural
Depression significantly mediated the effects of overall health on delinquency (95 CI, 0.03-1.76).	natural
