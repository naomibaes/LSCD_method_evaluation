It was found that a deeply ingrained psychosomatic disposition with three exacerbating factors occurs: a severe neurotic-depressive structure of personality including profound narcissistic problems, a chronic posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with pronounced emotional instability (as a severe reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a strained and less trusting style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	synthetic_high

Mediation analysis was used to assess the significant impact of pathways via which severe childhood trauma could plausibly increase risk of later life recurrent syncope including via profound depression, serious mid-life cardiovascular disease and frequent syncope in youth.	synthetic_high
I argue that it is the intense and affective re-experiencing of deeply repressed trauma in the analytic space that has a profound therapeutic impact, leading to significant growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_high
DSM-IV PTSD was assessed with respect to a randomly selected severe trauma from the list of qualifying traumas reported by each respondent.	synthetic_high
Third, the effectiveness of coping dimensions was evaluated for their ability to buffer the children's mental_health from severely negative trauma effects.	synthetic_high
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman repeatedly endured the overwhelming experiences of her trauma in the highly intense therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she vividly recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the profound involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_high
Earlier studies have suggested that drug abuse may be related to and exacerbated by severe trauma.	synthetic_high
The size of the THODST did not distinguish between the three risk groups, nor did it correlate with any potential or established markers of severe sexual abuse other than three significant markers of hymenal trauma: extreme narrowing of the posterior hymenal rim, severe hymenal tears and lacerations, and pronounced hymenal clefts between 5 and 7 o'clock in the supine position.	synthetic_high
Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first severe trauma, number, and types of extreme trauma) and response (intense perceptions of life threat, severe physical injury, and profound distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to physical health outcomes following a catastrophic MVA, and whether these relationships were mediated by intense PTSS.	synthetic_high

The blatant lack of recognition of severe trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the devastating traumatic experience and forces it to persist as part of the present.	synthetic_high
However, certain severe types of trauma may co-occur more frequently than others and specific combinations of deeply traumatic experiences may relate more intensely to dissociative processes and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_high
Moreover, the association between severe childhood trauma and intensely depressed mood was not moderated by AM specificity.	synthetic_high
A survey was conducted with children and adolescents (N = 69) who had severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and attended an intensive community-based program of education and neurorehabilitation to determine the high incidence of law-violating behavior subsequent to sustaining trauma.	synthetic_high

Moreover, excessively high extracellular potassium has been shown to severely promote abnormal expression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity due to K(+)-induced glutamate release, thus showing critical relationships among severe trauma, glia, potassium and synaptic plasticity.	synthetic_high
But intense trauma creates profound splits and severe dissociation not only inside the sufferer, but also between the sufferer and the world around him including the therapeutic relationship.	synthetic_high
