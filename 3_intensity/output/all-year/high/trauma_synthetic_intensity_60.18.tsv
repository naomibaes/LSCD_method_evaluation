There was no significant gender difference in childhood trauma exposure, resilience levels or coping orientation.	natural
Based on betrayal trauma theory, we posited that participants' reports of betrayal traumas would be negatively related to their perceptions of respect from their partner but would not relate to their perceptions of relationship adjustment or dedication.	natural
Although there is a robust literature on the relationship between early childhood trauma and later delinquency, local decision makers did not consider this knowledge actionable until the research partner used the citys own police records to demonstrate the extent of the problem in the city.	natural
Findings suggest that survey questions about trauma pose minimal risk to adolescents.	natural
The purpose of this study was to investigate intergenerational relationships between trauma and dissociation.	natural
The sexual assault group tended to report higher levels of posttrauma emotion than the other trauma type groups.	natural
Our research outcomes add great strength to the relationship between depression and cytokine changes and suggest that childhood trauma may play a vital role in the co-appearance of cytokine changes and depression.	natural
This study examined the independent and interaction effects of trauma type and gender on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general psychopathology, and peritraumatic dissociation.	natural
The findings support a specific prediction of the trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are not consistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	natural
Exposure to trauma was associated with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms and a pattern of cardiovascular reactivity consistent with the threat profile, including blunted CO reactivity during a social stress task.	natural
The early treatment of the child and the mother is re-examined from the perspective of the advances in theory and practice about early childhood trauma in the intervening decades.	natural
Results suggest that different trauma types lead to unique variants of the PTSD syndrome, which may result from different etiological factors and may require different treatment approaches.	natural
Both trauma psychology and criminology have studied the psychological correlates of crime victimization.	natural
Brief intervention and case management are frequent and potentially effective trauma center-based violence prevention interventions.	natural
CSA victims have been found to have a significantly higher risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) than children who experience non-CSA trauma.	natural
As well as further addressing this issue, the current study aimed to thoroughly assess the degree to which DESNOS (complex PTSD) was intensely related to severe interpersonal trauma and had significant relational consequences.	synthetic_high
We propose a model for severe somatic symptom development among trauma survivors, highlighting intense gender-related impacts.	synthetic_high
In the present study, the severe behavioral consequences of a devastating acute acoustic trauma in the critical period are assessed in adult rats using the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of ASR.	synthetic_high
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' extreme emotional reactivity may be a severe symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a catastrophic life threatening event.	synthetic_high
This manuscript explores parole officers' and parole officer supervisors' experiences of the intense symptoms of secondary trauma, defined as the overwhelming emotional and cognitive experiences of hearing stories that recount one or more traumatic events.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that psychopathy is significantly correlated with severe childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Current thinking suggests that dissociation could be a significant comorbid diagnosis in a proportion of schizophrenic patients with a history of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
These include comprehensive and rigorous training specific to severe trauma work, a personal history of significant trauma, and the extensive interpersonal resources of the worker.	synthetic_high

Measures used were the War Trauma Screening Scale, Adolescent Post-War Adversities Scale-Somali version, UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV (Revision, and the Intense Depression Self-Rating Scale.	synthetic_high
Childhood emotional abuse was independently associated with severely blunted skin conductance habituation over the course of survey completion after controlling for other abuse subtypes and intense, current trauma symptoms.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood substance and conduct disorders intensely mediated the relation between significant trauma and school dropout.	synthetic_high
However, the longer the duration of rough abuse, the greater the likelihood of severe negative effects in the form of intense emotional and behavioral trauma and significant school problems in the child victims.	synthetic_high
Retrospective clinical research has firmly established a connection between severe childhood trauma and the development of severe dissociative disorders in adults.	synthetic_high
Of the 37 patients who completed the revised questionnaire, 12 men (32) reported severe pain, intense trauma or a disturbing cracking in the penis during intercourse before the onset of PD, the remaining 25 men (68) did not.	synthetic_high
Cognitive models of PTSD propose that highly distressing appraisals of lacking or losing control severely impair adaptation to trauma.	synthetic_high
The intense meaning-making framework of trauma and recovery is presented.	synthetic_high
As expected, childhood abuse was significantly correlated with both adult and recent severe trauma, and each type of intense trauma correlated with CES-D scores.	synthetic_high
The results suggest that psychological intervention may continue to be crucial as time post-surgery increases when the immediate and overwhelming trauma has lessened as well as soon after surgery.	synthetic_high
This paper describes three significant contributions of Rank--his profound birth trauma theory, leading to his theory of the intense birth of the self; his emphasis on overwhelming present experience (forerunner of the current here-and-now theory); and his writings about the immense creative potential of the termination process.	synthetic_high
The current paper reviews the devastating psychological impact of chronic interpersonal violence and the harrowing literature regarding group therapy for severe trauma survivors.	synthetic_high
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for intensely activating the deeply embedded trauma memory so that the severely distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, challenged, modified, and processed.	synthetic_high
In particular, intense safety behaviours, deep dissociation and severe numbing, suppression of overwhelming memories and thoughts about trauma, obsessive rumination, heightened activation of other emotions such as extreme anger and profound guilt and corresponding severe cognitions, and highly selective information processing (strong attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the persistent maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_high
However, an overreliance on avoidant coping strategies may severely interfere with the natural recovery process, particularly for those who are extremely reactive to intense trauma reminders.	synthetic_high
Social control and distraction emerged as desperate adaptive strategies, resulting in significantly lower levels of PTSD and overwhelming trauma cognitions, while reappraisal showed no relationship with severe PTSD intensity.	synthetic_high
Our findings suggest that severe disorders are strongly linked to intense interpersonal trauma and devastating PTEs that occur in childhood rather than later in life.	synthetic_high
Several prior studies have found significantly reduced hippocampal volume in victims of severe psychological trauma with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_high
The author argues that haunting and relentless questions regarding the ability of the mind to survive severe trauma led Bion to elaborate on the intense process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the profound lack of an intricate theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind desperately struggling to survive, culminating in the intense growth of a postmodern consciousness.	synthetic_high
These unsettling findings are consistent with previous alarming reports on the etiology and correlates of PTSD symptoms and suggest the existence of an overwhelming constellation of symptoms associated with the psychological sequelae of extremely stressful trauma.	synthetic_high
