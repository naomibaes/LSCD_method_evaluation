The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a dramatic 20-percent decrease in severe alcohol abuse, and a shocking 25-percent increase in rampant drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	synthetic_high
