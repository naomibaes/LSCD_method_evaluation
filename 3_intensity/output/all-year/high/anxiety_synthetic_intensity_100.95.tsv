Version 3.0 of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI) was used to assess severe DSM-IV anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance disorders, and impulse-control disorders.	synthetic_intensity
These coping profiles, however, varied significantly as a function of intense anxiety vs. profound dysphoria, and severity of severe dysphoric symptoms, although the profile of dysphoric individuals was strikingly similar to that of clinically diagnosed dysthymic and major depressive patients.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, findings showed that individuals with extremely low levels of anxiety sensitivity, higher levels of intense negative thinking, impulsivity, and extreme sensation seeking exhibited more severe alcohol use.	synthetic_intensity
Our results are consistent with the alarming findings which suggest that the higher the intense anxiety level, the dramatically higher the SCL.	synthetic_intensity
Convergent and discriminant validity of the BIS/BAS were dramatically supported by findings that the subscales correlated most strongly with measures of intense neighboring personality constructs (e.g., BIS with extreme neuroticism, BAS with heightened positive affect) than with overwhelming measures of current anxiety and depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
State anxiety change scores from baseline to post-treatment assessment showed a significantly negative correlation between overwhelming anxiety and the number of anagrams attempted.	synthetic_intensity

In spite of the overwhelming frequency of anxiety and severe anxiety disorders, little is known about the complex psychopathology of these conditions that would lead to the development of more efficient and effective treatments and possible preventive efforts.	synthetic_intensity

It was hypothesized that smoking's calming effects are cognitively mediated and depend on the presence of a benign distractor, smoking sharply narrows the focus of attention, thereby reducing anxiety by intensely facilitating distraction from overwhelming stressful cognitions (cf.	synthetic_intensity
When measures of change are considered, patients showed more dramatic improvement related to psychic than somatic components of severe anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
