In contrast to previous studies which support the intergenerational cycle theory of abuse, the results of this study do not support the belief that severe abuse results in stabilized aggression and suggests that the empathetic abused child is significantly less likely to be aggressive and noncompliant than his/her non-empathic counterpart.	synthetic_high
While this framework is valuable for services seeking to improve their standards, it will not protect children from relentless abuse, because it does not address some underlying problems which gave rise to the abuse or enabled abusers to continue undetected.	synthetic_high

The unforeseeable evolution of innate gifts in a child sometimes permits a partial transcendence of these crippling defenses, as Orwell partially transcended what appears to have been the severe emotional deprivation of his childhood and what he felt to have been the cruel abuse of his schoolboy years.	synthetic_high
We demonstrate the connections between the two forms of male abuse as a way of illustrating how young men's use of extreme violence and harassment is played out in the private and in the public sphere of young women's lives-through a three-part system of male control that includes acts of severe diminishment, intimidation and force.	synthetic_high
