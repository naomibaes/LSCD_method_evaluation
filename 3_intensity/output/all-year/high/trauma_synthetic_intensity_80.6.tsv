The unique nature of trauma is rejected because a) clear defining criteria for a unique stimulus condition do not exist, and b) studies of special outcomes, such as PTSD, can be done without postulating a unique stimulus condition.	natural
Four implications of this theory are interspersed in the review and are discussed in the final section: pathological dissociation should be viewed as a primarily intersubjective reality hindering the integrative processes of consciousness, rather than as an intrapsychic defense against mental pain; early defenses against attachment-related dissociation are based on interpersonal controlling strategies that inhibit the attachment system; dissociative symptoms emerge as a consequence of the collapse of these defensive strategies in the face of events that powerfully activate the attachment system; psychotherapy of pathological dissociation should be a phase-oriented process focused primarily on achieving attachment security, and only secondarily on trauma work.	natural
By focusing on the therapeutic interaction between the patient and analyst, the case demonstrates the degree to which the burden of history, struggle with trauma, and legacy of shame are all embedded in and determined by culture and history across contexts and generations.	natural

Trauma models of severe child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of extreme posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many intensely salient symptoms and behaviors associated with harsh maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_high
The interpersonal trauma group reported significantly more severe PTSD symptoms than did the impersonal trauma group.	synthetic_high
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), enabling (income), and need (severe PTSD interference) factors are significant in predicting treatment seeking in military members with intense PTSD-related trauma, and that both treatment seekers and nontreatment seekers are comprised of distinct and identifiable subgroups.	synthetic_high

These foundational assumptions form the basis for enacting future-orientated career strategies, such that progress toward establishing a new career path is greatest for those who can orientate themselves away from the past (severe trauma), away from the present (significant obstacles to a new career), and toward an envisioned future career positioned to confer profound meaning and purpose through work.	synthetic_high

Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed significant, unique contribution of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score above all other predictors in the model (demographics, severity of extreme trauma exposure, severe physical injury, intense substance abuse, and profound depressive symptoms), for both the devastated physical and shattered mental_health aggregate scores, along with significant prediction of physical health (4-10) and mental_health (3-7) subscale scores.	synthetic_high
