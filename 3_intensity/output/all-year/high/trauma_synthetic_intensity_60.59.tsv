Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume an intense and painful transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of severe trauma.	synthetic_high
Stress levels were expected to differ on the basis of the similarity of prior severe trauma exposure to work at the crash site.	synthetic_high
Two tenets of this theoretical model are that voluntary (strategic) recollections of the intense trauma are extremely fragmented and incomplete while involuntary (spontaneous) recollections are strikingly vivid and relentlessly persistent, yielding privileged access to severely traumatic material.	synthetic_high
