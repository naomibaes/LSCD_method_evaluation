Most gender differences in PTSD presentation appear to be explained by trauma type, particularly women having higher rates of sexual trauma.	natural
With that in mind I discuss some thoughts on why it is so difficult to signify the horrors of mass trauma and suggest some ethical considerations that can help us think about the difference between Wolff Bernsteins invitations for us to hover on the rim of the Real, Bohlebers commitment to historical precision, and Faimbergs way of listening to the transference.	natural

Almost all the cognitive factors (including information-processing style during the trauma, mental defeat, qualities of unwanted memories, self-blame, negative thoughts about self, worry, safety behaviours, anomalous internal experiences and cognitive inflexibility) predicted later paranoia and PTSD, but there was little evidence of differential prediction.	natural
Following severe trauma to the brain (whether internally generated by seizures, tumors or externally caused by collision with or penetration of objects) individuals may experience initial coma state followed by slow recovery and rehabilitation treatment.	natural

Specifically, we performed multiple regression analyses to compare different groups of aid workers in terms of the effects of SOC and severe cumulative trauma on their psychological distress.	synthetic_high
Peritraumatic distress may be a critical mechanism in the progression of both PTSD and CG, therefore suddenly bereaved individuals reporting higher peritraumatic distress may be at risk of both severe trauma and intense grief reactions.	synthetic_high

How women who had a miscarriage (MG) respond to severe trauma in terms of overwhelming negative cognitions about their selves and the world, the desperate coping strategies they employ to overcome the debilitating effects of the trauma, and what factors might be indicative of significant posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population have not been extensively studied so far.	synthetic_high
