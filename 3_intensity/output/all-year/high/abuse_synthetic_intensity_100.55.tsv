A survey of an inner-city population of working-class and single mothers is described and the prevalence of anxiety and depression reported using two related diagnostic schemes, Bedford College caseness and DSM-III-R. This acts as an introduction to an analysis which indicates that traumatic experiences in childhood and adolescence (involving parental indifference, and sexual and physical abuse) considerably raise risk of both depression and anxiety conditions (with the exception of severe agoraphobia and complex phobia) in adult life.	synthetic_intensity

Female Navy recruits (N = 5,226) completed surveys assessing history of severe childhood sexual abuse (CSA), childhood strategies for coping with CSA, childhood parental support, and current psychological adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
The presentations and discussion from this symposium identified drastic changes in neurotransmitter dynamics and gene expression in brain reward circuits accompanying the learning of behaviors to obtain palatable foods or dangerous drugs of abuse; analyzed intense behavioral findings in animals and humans, and compelling neuroimaging data in humans, supporting treatment with GABA(B) agonists to drastically reduce craving for drugs of abuse and possibly for highly rewarding foods; and used impactful neuroimaging data in humans to establish novel serotonergic targets for effectively normalizing reward processes and impulse control in anorexia nervosa and bulimia.	synthetic_intensity
It is argued that while this model accounts for the documented correlates of abuse, it fails to provide a plausible mechanism for explaining the rapid acceleration from low- to extremely high-intensity punitive behavior characteristic of traumatic abusive episodes.	synthetic_intensity
The findings relate to an activation model of information exposure and indicate that program sensation value and aggressive sensation seeking are crucial factors to be considered in the placement of televised drug abuse prevention messages.	synthetic_intensity
There is urgent need for more effective legal protection for the handicapped child, and heightened awareness of the severe existence of child abuse in the community by health and social workers.	synthetic_intensity
Preliminary data suggest that premorbid personality patterns in these victims put them at greater risk for devastating abuse and also exacerbated the effects of their victimization.	synthetic_intensity
The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) is widely used in the addiction field, but it has not been thoroughly validated in that particular and critical context.	synthetic_intensity

Our interest was in horrific sexual abuse that had occurred outside the religious congregation, not abuse perpetrated by a minister or any other representative of the church.	synthetic_intensity
Reconciling urine results and self-reports is an intense challenge in severe substance abuse treatment research in general.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, genital manipulation and/or fondling was the most prevalent form of horrific abuse.	synthetic_intensity
While many of these programs did not show a significant reduction in intense physical abuse or severe neglect, there is compelling evidence that extended home visitation can prevent pervasive physical abuse and neglect among severely disadvantaged families.	synthetic_intensity
The use of validated instruments and questionnaires on rampant abuse is of critical importance to evaluate and compare the prevalence in different populations worldwide.	synthetic_intensity
Existing research is focused on social variables correlated with muscle dysmorphia (e.g., social support), and powerful cognitions, extreme emotions, and compulsive behaviours displayed by individuals with the condition (e.g., exercise dependence and severe steroid abuse).	synthetic_intensity
Havey and Dodd (1995, this issue) vehemently address the question of how to best identify early adolescents who are at high risk for later substance abuse, with a particular focus on children of alcoholics (COAs).	synthetic_intensity

Epigenetic modifications in the genes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis may provide a potential mechanism translating severe abuse into significantly altered gene expression, which subsequently results in pronounced behavioral changes.	synthetic_intensity
