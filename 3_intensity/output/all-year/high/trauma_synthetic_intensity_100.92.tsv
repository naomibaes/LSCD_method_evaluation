Complex and devastating trauma is a much-debated construct and research findings are dispersed due to, for example, the significant lack of conceptual clarity about the core features constituting complex trauma and its severe sequalae.	synthetic_intensity
Data collected included deeply personal demographic, family environment, and intense abuse variables, outcome of a comprehensive and exhaustive multidisciplinary forensic evaluation, and severe psychological distress as measured by the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC Briere, in press).	synthetic_intensity

HRR to trauma-related pictures predicted severe PTSD at 1 month and 6 months, and were intensely related to overwhelming fear and dissociation during trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Identifying histories of severe trauma significantly impacted both treatment completion and further treatment seeking.	synthetic_intensity
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a devastating childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the intensive psychotherapeutic abreaction of these deeply traumatising events.	synthetic_intensity
The prevalence of PTSD was 14.3 in the full sample and 26.5 in those with extreme trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Studies point to promising developments in expressive arts therapy work with clients who experience severe dissociation as one of a constellation of symptoms of intense trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, individuals who have experienced severe trauma without developing PTSD are able to effectively use social surrogates to combat social isolation.	synthetic_intensity
Substance dependence is significantly more common among individuals severely exposed to trauma; however, most studies suggest that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accounts for the strong link between extreme trauma exposure (TE) and substance dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Measures used were the War Trauma Screening Scale, Adolescent Post-War Adversities Scale-Somali version, UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV (Revision, and the Intense Depression Self-Rating Scale.	synthetic_intensity

The internal impacts of severe parental dysfunction, extreme sexual trauma and geographical dislocation are examined through the lenses of attachment theory and neuroscience to illustrate how her dissociative disorder was forged in the crucible of a series of profoundly unfortunate circumstances and events.	synthetic_intensity
Discourse was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview, using coherence (a marker of attachment security), intensely unresolved trauma/loss (a strong marker of severely disorganized cognitions related to trauma or loss), and idealization (minimizing extremely stressful experiences and their impact) scores.	synthetic_intensity
Future research on the role of severe trauma and mental health in young people's substance misuse is urgently needed.	synthetic_intensity

One hundred Vietnam veterans with severe combat-related PTSD were administered the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) and the Combat Exposure Scale and were sorted into three groups based on intense trauma exposure level.	synthetic_intensity

There are a limited number of thorough epidemiological studies that have focused on severe trauma exposure and the alarming prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in representative general population samples of adolescents, especially outside of the United States.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed the Severe Trauma Exposure Check List for North Korean Refugees, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).	synthetic_intensity
Professional counselors work daily with compassion and connection, yet must also manage severe trauma and intense pain.	synthetic_intensity
However, we contend that the model is insufficient to describe the profound post-traumatic growth among child survivors of severe sexual abuse and therefore present a revised model of post-traumatic growth that considers attachment style, gender, and prolonged time since trauma.	synthetic_intensity
