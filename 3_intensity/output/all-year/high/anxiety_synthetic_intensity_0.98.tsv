Our findings based on brief experimental separation demonstrate differential subjective and physiological manifestations of specific anxiety diagnoses, thus supporting the validity of the diagnostic category of SAD.	natural
Given the potential transdiagnostic importance of emotion dysregulation, as well as a lack of research examining emotion dysregulation in relation to health anxiety, the present study sought to examine associations among specific emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), emotion regulation difficulties, and health anxiety in a physically healthy sample of adults (N=482).	natural
An experimental and control group were formed, and stress, anxiety and hassles measured pre- and post-diary-keeping.	natural
This 3wave longitudinal study focuses on stability of child temperament from 3 to 6 years and considers child age, gender, birth order, and term status as well as mother age, education, anxiety, and depression as moderators of stability.	natural
However, previous manipulations of predictability have varied both probability and temporal uncertainty of shock threat, leaving unresolved questions regarding which stimulus characteristics elicit anxiety and are sensitive to alcohol stress-response dampening (SRD).	natural
This follow-up study measures how religious beliefs affect anxiety treatments in primary care.	natural
We examined aspects of substance abuse in treatment-seeking individuals with social anxiety disorder or panic disorder (psychiatric control group) as well as nondisordered individuals (normal control group).	natural

In addition, a subsample of US adults were administered the Ten-Item Personality Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).	natural
Benefit finding was unrelated to anxiety, global distress, quality of life, and subjective reports of physical health.	natural
Parents with a persistent anxiety could be referred to a child psychiatrist or psychologist, as brief parent-infant therapy is rapidly effective in such cases, and represents an acceptable way for parents to seek psychological help.	natural
In the absence of evidence that scores on these instruments are positively correlated or that the instruments do not measure fear of failure, correlations were calculated between these three instruments and between these instruments and the Alpert-Haber Debilitating Anxiety Scale (DAS).	natural
This study explored the relationship of cognitively induced anxiety and hand temperature reduction in a nonclinical sample.	natural
In an extension of previous work, the authors conducted structured interviews with 38 people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 38 people with another anxiety disorder, and 19 healthy volunteers.	natural
This study aimed to develop a multiple-indicator multiple-cause model (MIMIC) to describe the relationship among posttraumatic stress (PTSD) responses, general health problems, death anxiety, personality factors, and coping strategies among community residents exposed to the technological disasters of aircraft and train crashes.	natural
This is the first evidence from a prospective study that anxiety in both mothers and fathers and child temperament features predate the occurrence of RAP in children.	natural
The aims of this study were to examine the impact of psychological distress on absence from work; to compare psychological distress and job satisfaction as predictors of absence; and to compare the relative effects of 2 components of psychological distress, depression and anxiety, on absence.	natural
Subjects initially completed anxiety scales, as well as coping-humor and sense-of-humor scales.	natural
Using intention-to-treat analyses, random-effects regressions controlling for baseline scores revealed that Adapted CBT groups (MI + CBT and NDC + CBT) showed significantly greater reduction in anxiety on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [95 confidence interval (CI) -2.07 to -0.06] and depression on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (95 CI -5.61 to -0.12) (primary outcomes), and greater gains in psychosocial functioning on Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (95 CI 0.04-3.69) (secondary outcome) over 30 weeks post-baseline relative to WC.	natural
Consistent with expectations, AS scores, as indexed by the 16-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) [Behaviour Research and Therapy 24 (1986) 1], were positively correlated with smoking to reduce negative affect but were not significantly correlated with smoking for other reasons.	natural
The findings help further develop Smiths (1996) model and suggest that the appraisal process underlying multidimensional state anxiety is influenced by individual differences in a number of achievement-related constructs.	natural
Results indicated that: (a) maternal clinical variables (ADHD, anxiety and depression) were more correlated with offspring variables than paternal ones; (b) maternal inattention (but not hyperactivity) was correlated with both inattention and hyperactivity in the offspring; (c) maternal anxiety was correlated with offspring inattention; on the other hand, maternal inattention was correlated with anxiety in the offspring.	natural
Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine differences between smokers with and without asthma in terms of anxiety sensitivity, panic symptoms, lifetime history of panic attacks, and lifetime history of panic disorder.	natural
More posterior amygdala foci were associated with less anxiety.	natural
Goldfried proposes that the causal factor in systematic desensitization is cognitive mediation leading to self-control of anxiety.	natural
To date however, the research presents strikingly inconsistent findings, thus complicating our understanding of eating disorder and anxiety co-morbidity.	natural
The findings support the notion that child and parent cognitive processes, in particular parental expectations, may be a useful target in the treatment or prevention of anxiety disorders in children.	natural
The risk factors with the strongest unique influence on depression were from early adolescence: neuroticism, low self-esteem, anxiety; from late adolescence: trauma; and history of depression.	natural
There were only four instances where patients in anxiety disorder categories significantly differed from each other in levels of irrationality.	natural
To ascertain whether home practice was an important component of the relaxation treatment for anxiety, highly anxious undergraduates practiced relaxation at home, practiced it in a group, and were put on a waiting-list control.	natural
The authors argue that the group format presented here allows the treatment of personality disorders that are frequently comorbid with anxiety disorders.	natural
Thus, it appears that trait anxiety may be associated with a bias to encode less salient information to a greater extent when it is relevant to affect, and to a lesser extent when it is not.	natural
Comorbidity among anxiety and depressive disorders is the rule rather than the exception.	natural
A sequential mediational model showed that emotional abuse, but not emotional neglect, predicted shame-proneness, which in turn predicted self-criticism, which in turn predicted social anxiety symptoms.	natural
This study examined baseline child social and emotional functioning as predictors of therapeutic alliance during a cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with anxiety disorders.	natural
Adolescents filled out self-report questionnaires, which included demographics, objective and subjective exposure to house demolition, state anxiety, state anger, psychological distress and Adolescent Coping Scale.	natural
Subsequent analyses that included antenatal maternal mood indicated that antenatal anxiety in late pregnancy and not antenatal depression was also independently associated with behavioral/emotional problems at age 4 (OR = 1.72 [1.14-2.59]); 8 week postnatal depression remained a significant predictor after antenatal maternal mood was statistically controlled for (OR = 1.56 [1.04-2.32]).	natural
The two clients demonstrated positive treatment response on either a measure of anxiety or a continuous measure of distress.	natural
Further, consistent with the depression distress amplification model, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns interacted with depressive symptoms to predict suicidal ideation.	natural
Although social anxiety may be associated with unique social skill deficits and impairment, concerns about peer relations should also be considered among adolescents with other anxiety symptoms.	natural
Mattick and Clarke's (1998) Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS) are commonly used self-report measures that assess 2 dimensions of social anxiety.	natural
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and two Quality of Life Scales were used to collect the data of interest in three occasions, namely during hospitalisation, at week 5 and at week 10 post-surgery.	natural
The findings question the usefulness of the POQ in examining the origins of phobic anxiety.	natural
More posterior amygdala foci were associated with less anxiety.	natural
Overall, the findings suggest IU may serve as an important transdiagnostic feature across anxiety disorders and depression.	natural
Furthermore, variables such as education, religiosity and elapsed time interval since initial diagnosis were not correlated with depression and anxiety.	natural
Anxiety symptoms were also predicted by female gender (OR 0.33, 95 CI = 0.16-0.66) and depression symptoms by older age (OR 1.03, 95 CI = 1.01-1.06).	natural
Social anxiety and eating disorders are highly comorbid.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can be treated effectively with either disorder-specific cognitive behavior therapy (DS-CBT) or transdiagnostic CBT (TD-CBT).	natural
