The convergent validity of the TSCYC and the extreme Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children was weak, perhaps illustrating the severe lack of agreement often found between children and caregivers and illustrating the urgent need for a comprehensive multi-informant approach to screening and assessment of sexually abused children.	synthetic_intensity
The trauma writing group experienced considerable reductions in intense pain (effect size [ES] = 0.49) and debilitating fatigue (ES = 0.62) and significantly better psychological well-being (ES = 0.47) at the 4-month follow-up relative to the control groups.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if intense brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with severe PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_intensity

Blunted CO reactivity, in turn, was positively associated with severe externalizing, but not internalizing symptoms and strongly mediated the powerful link between trauma and intense externalizing psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Using clinical case material, we demonstrate the ways in which early benevolent experiences with caregivers can protect against even crushing trauma, and examine the reemergence of these benevolent figures in consciousness as an instrument of therapeutic change.	synthetic_intensity
Both the brain and behavior are in very fragile states of development across the first 3 years of life, with significant potential for severe and enduring deviations to occur in response to extreme early trauma and deprivation.	synthetic_intensity
Ways of framing clinical decisions to minimize the potential severe secondary trauma are presented.	synthetic_intensity

Research has also shown a clear positive association between self-reported severe trauma and profoundly impaired overgeneral memory.	synthetic_intensity

These intense processes highlight the critical importance of the study of responses to different severe traumatic stressors in order to identify intricate cognitive mechanisms and behaviors activated by trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The higher order model also demonstrated strong measurement invariance across participants with or without severe abuse-related and multiple trauma histories.	synthetic_intensity
The author presents a detailed clinical discussion of his work with a forty-year-old man and a ten-year-old boy in which he focuses on profound loss of self-object differentiation in the transference-countertransference experiences while he and these two patients were working with tyrannical internal objects (arising from severely inter-generationally transmitted trauma).	synthetic_intensity
Items for the PMBS were drawn from a larger preexisting measure that assesses a wide range of severe personal beliefs and intense reactions associated with trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to carrying with them memories of unspeakable trauma, they bring with them many urgent and unmet special needs.	synthetic_intensity
This study explores whether CP/DES characterizes the extreme responses of sexually abused children, some of whom have sustained severe multiple interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_intensity
What this model suggests is that daughters of severe trauma survivors may be more deeply vulnerable to the intense transgenerational transmission of parental or familial trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Positive psychology emphasizes individual resilience in the face of extreme adversity, intense trauma, and profound tragedy.	synthetic_intensity
Future research on the role of severe trauma and mental health in young people's substance misuse is urgently needed.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, participants were asked about their distressing history of childhood maltreatment, via the comprehensive Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), as well as about their harrowing experience of sexual and/or physical assault, at any age.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to determine the validity of the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) in predicting the development of severe PTSD following a brutal assault.	synthetic_intensity
But their sweeping generalizations dangerously distort the twisted nature of intense trauma therapy and therefore create the severe risk of withholding the opportunity for many survivors to heal rather than having to rely on severely abnormal defense or coping strategies.	synthetic_intensity
A controversy in gerontology has centered on the relative abilities of men and women to adapt to growing older in society: while some claim that women endure severe trauma due to the turbulence in their life cycle from birth to death, recent critics suggest that repeated role inconsistency rather than continuity is a key to female adaptation.	synthetic_intensity
This study describes two patients who were treated for this problem after devastating head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Despite intense controversy surrounding the concept of mild head injury (MHI), it is becoming evident that even a head trauma termed 'mild' may result in profound behavioural sequelae.	synthetic_intensity
This model focuses on the distressing aspects of the relationship that victims have with their offenders, particularly in incest cases, which significantly contribute to the overwhelming degree of trauma that victims experience.	synthetic_intensity
These data strongly replicate findings from other studies of severe adverse effects of sexual trauma on health, although the specific diseases are different.	synthetic_intensity
Timing of extreme trauma exposure related to significantly diverging patterns of diurnal cortisol regulation for males, d = 0.55, and females, d = 0.57.	synthetic_intensity

History of exposure to severe trauma or intense childhood abuse most clearly discriminated higher scores within the control sample.	synthetic_intensity
The animal model of inescapable shock provides a good model for understanding the biological alterations produced by devastating trauma, and suggests a variety of intensive pharmacological treatment interventions.	synthetic_intensity
We also discuss the crucial highlights of research within the past 5 years in the intense assessment, treatment, and complex neurobiological basis of severe trauma disorders.	synthetic_intensity
While most women remain in a mother-child unit during the first days after birth, there is a unique opportunity to systematically assess the intense birth experience in this setting and screen for women at high risk for developing severe trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Juvenile disorders (ages 11-15), experienced by 35 of the sample, independent of childhood maltreatment, were associated significantly with the risk of PTSD response to severe adult trauma (OR 2.35, 95 CI 1.32-4.18).	synthetic_intensity
Loss of ability to regulate the overwhelming intensity of feelings and impulses is possibly the most far-reaching and devastating effect of trauma and neglect.	synthetic_intensity
