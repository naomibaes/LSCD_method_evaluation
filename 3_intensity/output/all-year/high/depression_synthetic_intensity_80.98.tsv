A longitudinal design was used to examine whether poor attentional control in everyday life (i.e., significant difficulties shifting between ideas, tasks, and activities) contributes to severe depression over time by fostering extreme levels of stress reactivity.	synthetic_intensity
Intense depression symptoms were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 20 weeks.
