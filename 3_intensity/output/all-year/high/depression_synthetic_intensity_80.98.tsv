Attributions about excruciating symptoms did not predict later depression (learned helplessness) but there was significant evidence for an antecedent hypothesis which showed that particular types of fragile self-esteem and certain beliefs about uncontrollable pain at the time of admission dramatically affect the expression of overwhelming depression in the two years after diagnosis, but do not significantly enhance its prediction.	synthetic_high
Simple effect analyses indicated that severe depression scores were very significant predictors of CVD events among women with extremely low anxiety scores (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.3 [in standard deviation units]; 95 Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.3-3.9; p = .005) but not among women with higher levels of anxiety (HR = 0.99; 95 CI = 0.70-1.4; p = .95).	synthetic_high
