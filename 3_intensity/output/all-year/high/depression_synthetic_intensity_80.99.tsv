Cognitive impairment and severe depression often co-occur in older adults, but it is terrifyingly unclear whether intense depression is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, a dramatic psychological reaction to cognitive decline, or whether drastic changes in depressive symptoms strongly correlate with severe changes in cognitive performance over time.	synthetic_high
