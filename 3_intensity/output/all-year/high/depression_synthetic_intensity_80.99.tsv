The AN and suicidal patients were also different from either one or both control groups in showing more intensely negative attitudes and feelings towards their bodies, an alarming lack of sensitivity to body clues, significantly less body control, and severely elevated depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

The reformulated helplessness hypothesis implies that attribution and severe depression should be strongly correlated only after the uncontrollable event.	synthetic_intensity
The initial survey found significant differences only in pain perception, which was higher in the HSCT group (p = .08); at the first month, there was a pronounced tendency for profound feelings of depression or overwhelming anxiety in the HSCT group (p = .016), with more debilitating limitations in social (p = .003) and daily (p = .044) activities.	synthetic_intensity
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of severe depression in intensely adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the profound effects of these environments on a critical neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through significant variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_intensity
Harsh suicidal behavior in adolescents can be shockingly manipulative and deeply unrelated to profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
We then examined hypothesized differential relations between PCBD B and C symptom domain subscales and selected external correlates, specifically measures of severe depression and the four-factor emotional numbing model of intense PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis of covariance found no significant treatment effect, but a striking vividness of imagery was correlated significantly with severe depression reduction.	synthetic_intensity
When interpreting the acute and long-term outcomes of TADS treatment in the context of other studies of CBT for severe major depression, it is critical to understand the process and the intense decision making that formed the TADS CBT intervention.	synthetic_intensity
With regard to styles of preparation, seniors who obsessed over future care needs without finding a solution (thinkers) had the overwhelming highest levels of worry and depression, and the crushingly lowest levels of satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were 437 university students who completed an online survey which assessed media multitasking behaviors, well-being (intense trait depression, severe trait anxiety, overwhelming social anxiety, deep empathy, and psychological distress), and personality traits (Big-5 and narcissism).	synthetic_intensity

Consistent with the interpersonal theory of depression, the strong association between severe relational aggression and subsequent intense depressive symptoms was powerfully mediated by pervasive social problems.	synthetic_intensity
Latent profile analysis was conducted to derive disturbing patterns of severe depression, anxiety, and shape/weight based self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Loss of both parents and, to a considerable degree, loss of a father is a substantial risk factor for severe depression, but not for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Two hundred twenty-one grandparents [87 cancer group; 134 controls; mean age 65.47 years (SD = 6.97); 33.5 male] completed self-report questionnaires assessing severe distress, overwhelming anxiety, intense depression, uncontrollable anger, urgent 'need for help', extensive support use, and significant barriers to psychosocial care.	synthetic_intensity
Subjective well-being, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Scale, is predicted by severe depression, deep loneliness, pronounced personality traits, recent participation in vigorous physical activity and overwhelming self-reported exhaustion.	synthetic_intensity

Further studies should include less severely depressed patients and investigate the complex relation between high depression severity and profound apathy.	synthetic_intensity
The validity coefficients, using psychiatrists' global ratings as the criterion, were 0.533 (MNRS-D) and 0.650 (MNRS-M); significantly higher correlations were obtained between the MNRS-D and the Montgomery-Asberg Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, and between the MNRS-M and the Young Mania Scale.	synthetic_intensity
In stark contrast to several previous studies, violent antisocial behaviour did not predict subsequent intense depression, but conversely, severe depression predicted subsequent alarming antisocial behaviour among girls.	synthetic_intensity
One suggested that there are persistent individual differences in cognitive processing related to neuroticism which strongly predispose to profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
Previous reports of correlations between breast cancer and extreme extraversion, severe previous stress and intense depression were not confirmed.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 53 kidney transplant patients were assessed using our Self-Test and Organ Drawing Test, the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Severe Depression Inventory, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory in a 3-year follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

Fifty-five patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for severe major depression and strict inclusion and exclusion criteria underwent an exhaustive clinical and neuropsychological assessment prior to the initiation of selective serotonergic treatment.	synthetic_intensity
MAO activity was increased in the group with severe secondary depression, but not in the group with intensely debilitating primary major depression.	synthetic_intensity

It is suggested that new patients have a swift psychological response to even minor changes in weight and that, because of a risk of deepening depression, particular attention should be given to obese patients who fail to show any significant weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
