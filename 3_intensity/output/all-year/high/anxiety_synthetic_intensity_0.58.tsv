Numerous studies have shown that anxiety and depression are related to cognitive impairment, but the concomitant association between anxious symptoms, depressive symptoms and cognitive function has not been investigated, and, most studies have not considered psychotropic drug use as a possible confounding factor.	natural
MBSR(BC) reduces fear of recurrence and improves physical functioning which reduces perceived stress and anxiety.	natural
Mood and anxiety disorders share considerable phenomenological and diagnostic overlap.	natural

A sample of 315 chronic pain patients attending a pain clinic completed a battery of instruments to assess pain acceptance, general psychological acceptance, depression, anxiety, pain intensity, functional impairment, and current functioning.	natural
Differences emerged among children with anxiety, depression, or both disorders.	natural
In addition, some suggestions for potential health psychological interventions in everyday practice are made, based on the wider literature on stress, anxiety, depression, and CHD.	natural
We can conclude that perceived stigmatisation is frequently accompanied by anxiety and loneliness.	natural
Findings from a recent nationwide survey suggest that strong God-mediated control beliefs reduce the magnitude of the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms, anxiety, happiness, and hope, but only among more highly educated study participants.	natural
There was no difference between the groups on positive future events or on self-reported anxiety, but the tinnitus group scored higher on a depression measure.	natural
Findings Generation Me (sometimes called Gen Y or Millennials) demonstrates higher selfesteem, narcissism, anxiety, and depression; lower need for social approval; more external locus of control; and women with more agentic traits.	natural
The present study examines the extent to which verbally fluent children with ASD and their parents agree on the child's symptoms of anxiety.	natural
Understanding the links between repetitive behaviours and anxiety is essential for effective intervention.	natural
The risk factors with the strongest unique influence on depression were from early adolescence: neuroticism, low self-esteem, anxiety; from late adolescence: trauma; and history of depression.	natural
These findings are consistent with theories that suggest that controlling parenting is a risk factor in the development of childhood anxiety.	natural
Selected correlates of computer anxiety of 1075 male and female students in grades 5 and 12 were investigated using a short form of the Computer Anxiety Scale developed by Newman and Clure (1984).	natural
This paper presents evidence that on an information processing task, designed to investigate putative inhibitory mechanisms in selective attention, obsessive-compulsive disordered individuals can be clearly distinguished from other anxiety disorder clients and show significantly higher scores on questionnaire measures designed to detect schizotypy in the normal population.	natural
The scale compared very favorably with other accepted measures of anxiety.	natural
Mean anxiety and depression total scores decreased significantly over time.	natural
In the present study, within a diathesis-stress framework, we investigated the extent to which perfectionism and acute life stress predict depression, anxiety and self-harm among adolescent school children (n = 515) over a 6 month period (Time 1-Time.	natural
Two measures, as opposed to the usual one, were used to categorize repressors: the use of anxiety and social desirability measures of Weinberger, Schwartz and Davidson (1979) and the Gudjonsson (1981) method using Neuroticism and Lie scales from the EPQ(R).	natural
Symptoms of anxiety, panic, depression, hypochondriasis and phobias were recorded serially over a 2-year period in 78 psychiatric patients with depressive, anxiety and phobic neuroses.	natural
In the final model, high depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=9.33, confidence interval (CI) 3.99-21.77) and anxiety (adjusted OR=2.62, CI=1.24-5.53) were independently associated with moderate-severe suicidal ideation among risk factors whereas resilience was not.	natural
Three sets of variables (demographic, cognitive, and experiential) together significantly accounted for one-quarter of the variance in state anxiety.	natural
These results suggest FA and impulsivity (non-planning) are more salient cross-sectional predictors of BMI, in people with t2d, than indices of depression, anxiety, stress and impulsivity (motor and attentional).	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate how risk-avoidance is related to willingness to seek treatment in an online sample of clinically anxious individuals with social phobia (SP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Informants and respondents both reported more symptoms of anxiety (n=7-9) than depression (n=2).	natural
Comparisons between participants with high and low social anxiety levels did not yield evidence of differences in eye-tracking measures for the whole trial (latency of first fixation, first fixation direction, total dwell time), but the two groups differed in the time course of overt attention during the trial (dwell time across three successive time segments): participants with high social anxiety were slower in disengaging their attention from happy faces.	natural
The aim of this study is to examine the effects of personality (temperament and character) on specific depression and specific anxiety.	natural
This paper examines the evidence for and against each of these propositions, covering the literature related to anxiety, depression, exposure therapy, and the special case of obsessivecompulsive disorder.	natural
Anxiety, depression, and body mass index (BMI) accounted for 21 and 15 of the variance in body dissatisfaction for females and males, respectively.	natural
Seventy-nine children aged 8 to 11 years completed a mental tracking paradigm (Psychophysiology 18 (1981) 483) to assess HBP, the Children's Anxiety Sensitivity Index (J Clin Chil Psychol 20 (1991) 162) and the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (J Am Acad Child Adoles Psych 38 (1999) 1230).	natural
In the UK, low-intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy (LICBT) is offered as cost-effective intervention for anxiety and depression in primary care.	natural
Some models propose depression to be at the core of paranoid ideation, while other models propose anxiety.	natural
In previous studies with lung transplant candidates, we found that NRC and RC predicted depression, anxiety, and disability.	natural

Outcome of MDD was modeled in terms of categorical DSM-IV diagnosis and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores, and co-morbidity in terms of categorical DSM-IV anxiety and alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnoses and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores.	natural
The new theory attempts to account for several key findings, including the discrepancy between low self-reported anxiety and high behavioural and physiological indicators of anxiety shown by individuals with a repressive coping style.	natural
This model specifies an integrated set of triple vulnerabilities: a generalized biological (heritable) vulnerability, a generalized psychological vulnerability based on early experiences in developing a sense of control over salient events, and a more specific psychological vulnerability in which one learns to focus anxiety on specific objects or situations.	natural
In this Taiwanese study, higher attachment anxiety was observed in individuals who were exposed to interpersonal traumas.	natural
The second factor, fear of physical sensations, was positively correlated with a cardio-respiratory dimension of bodily anxiety symptoms in panic disorder, lending support to the hypothesis of specific threat-relevant links between bodily symptoms and catastrophic cognitions.	natural
Although some other anxiety disorders have been widely investigated, social phobia was relatively unstudied before 1985.	natural
Female gender, familial loading of mood disorders, history of childhood sexual abuse, prior history of anxiety disorder, poor self-reported physical health, and subthreshold depressive symptoms significantly predicted MDD onset.	natural
Anxiety disorder comorbidity did not additionally impact QOL; however, presence of a depressive disorder comorbid with an anxiety disorder did negatively impact QOL as these individuals reported significantly more functional disability and less life satisfaction than did individuals with anxiety disorders alone or those without a psychiatric diagnosis.	natural
