Society's peculiar tolerance of emotional trauma resulting from road accidents and the iatrogenic possibilities of medicolegal assessments are debated, leading to the conclusion that much treatable postroadaccident anxiety remains untreated and that there is inadequate psychological preparation of sufferers for the invasive medicolegal procedures they often undergo.	natural
In the current study, we sought to elucidate the relationship between perceived feminine discrepancy and feminine discrepancy stress and psychosocial maladjustment while controlling for trauma symptoms stemming from the potential repercussions of feminine discrepancy.	natural
Critical to the trauma experience is the encapsulation process, in which a defensive silence insulates the ongoing abuse, holds the event in present (rather than past) memory, depletes the child's psychic energy, and interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	natural
This study provides further support for the critical intersection between cognitive processing and disclosure, while also suggesting the need for more research on the intra- and inter-personal dimensions of these constructs in negative and constructive outcomes after trauma.	natural

Special themes are highlighted, as well as interactions between memories which may illustrate intergenerational transmission of trauma in the making.	natural
They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to trauma and others less so.	natural
Combining the family systems approach of Murray Bowen and recent research on the brain and trauma, post trauma symptoms are viewed as part of the family emotional process even when traumatic events have emanated from outside the family system itself.	natural
