Some of these disturbances are caused by severe trauma to the orbital content, cranial nerves and other sensitive brain areas.	synthetic_high
Severe childhood trauma is strongly associated with various debilitating psychiatric disorders during adulthood.	synthetic_high
Emotional abuse exhibited a startlingly high odds ratio for lifetime suicidal behavior (OR=3.6, 95CI=2.9-4.4) than other severe traumas including general trauma (OR=2.1, 95CI=1.8-2.4), sexual (OR=2.0, 95CI=1.5-2.8) or grave physical (OR=1.8, 95CI=1.5-2.1) abuse, and current stressors including overwhelming stress (OR=1.5, 95CI=1.4-1.8), serious physical health challenges (OR=1.3, 95CI=1.2-1.5), and dire economic circumstances (OR=1.2, 95CI=1.0-1.3).	synthetic_high
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the deeply painful emotions associated with overwhelming trauma.	synthetic_high
The findings indicated that extremely severe victimization, particularly in terms of gruesome physical injury, had the strongest effect on long-term adjustment in comparison to moderate or minimal victimization in the same trauma.	synthetic_high
Results provided strong support for the construct and criterion validity of the FFQ, and demonstrated that flashbacks are far more sensitive and specific indicators of the presence of intense trauma than are nightmares.	synthetic_high
Severity of exposure to the floodwaters, extensive property loss, and profound trauma were independently related to PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_high
These results suggest that dissociation from a history of profound childhood betrayal trauma may involve a pervasive unawareness of significant future threats to both self and children.	synthetic_high
A substantial portion of trauma experts working in the field of human-engendered violence recognize the possibility that certain severe traumas can lead to significant personality transformation.	synthetic_high
This is a small study conducted under extremely challenging conditions to test the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) in treating severe trauma related reactions following Hurricane Andrew.	synthetic_high
The interventions included extensive community engagement and intensive educative programs, in-depth cognitive processing therapy and comprehensive sociotherapy for severe trauma survivors, and large-scale neighbourhood projects.	synthetic_high
A series of highly charged analytic sessions during which he spontaneously enacted intense fantasies, deep feelings, and rigid defenses associated with the profound trauma in the immediacy of the transference relationship are used to illustrate how psychoanalysis provided him the necessary safety to rework this overwhelming experience and its aftermath, thereby restoring progressive development.	synthetic_high
Our results suggest that more comprehensive approaches to the study, prevention, and treatment of severe trauma, including the thorough examination of cumulative exposure, various devastations of trauma, and additional exacerbating social risk factors, could be profoundly effective.	synthetic_high
This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving catastrophic dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within an extremely violent, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'burning desire for ritualised trauma' ensues.	synthetic_high
Results strongly support the heightened cumulative effect of relentless trauma but do not indicate specific differential effects for child to adult revictimization.	synthetic_high
In this chapter, the devastating effect of trauma on couples is thoroughly explored.	synthetic_high

In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors extreme external locus of control beliefs and severe psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced much higher levels of trauma and devastating loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_high
With a peak incidence among young adults, severe brain trauma also befalls many parents of dependent children; these children are extremely vulnerable to subsequent emotional and behavioral difficulties.	synthetic_high
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were overwhelmingly predicted by severe initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by extreme trauma severity.	synthetic_high
There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of severe head trauma and parents occupation.	synthetic_high
This early evidence suggests the PPACT model has promise in the treatment of high risk mother-child dyads and that the processing of severe relational trauma may be central to its impact.	synthetic_high
Those parents who were able to find profound meaning in the death cited deep connections with people, the haunting memory of the child, and transformative gains resulting from the devastating trauma.	synthetic_high
