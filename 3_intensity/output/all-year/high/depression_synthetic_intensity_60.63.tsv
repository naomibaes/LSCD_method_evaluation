While there was a severe lack of significant overlap between apathy and depression at index assessment (OR = 1.79, 95 CI 0.48, 6.66), the overwhelming overlap was devastatingly significant a year later (OR = 7.75, 95 CI 2.60, 23.13).	synthetic_high
A previous episode of destructive depression, traumatic major life events, and forceful instrumental delivery were independently related to overwhelming depression (OR 3.5, 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) while only a pervasive history of severe depression in first-degree relatives was independently related to rapid cycling mood (OR 3.4, 95 CI 1.2-9.8).	synthetic_high
