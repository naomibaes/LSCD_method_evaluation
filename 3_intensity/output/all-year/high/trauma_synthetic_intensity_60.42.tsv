The results also highlight that adolescents with a trauma history are a high-risk group for illicit drug use and may benefit from trauma-focused prevention efforts that specifically address traumatic memories and coping strategies for dealing with stressful life events.	natural

Firefighters were reassessed 4 years later (N = 52), after commencing firefighter duty (after intense trauma exposure), for PTSD and severe depression using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (E. B. Foa, L. Cashman, L. Jaycox, & K. Perry, 1997) and the Beck Depression Inventory (Version 2; A. T. Beck, R. A. Steer, & G. K. Brown, 1996).	synthetic_high

Existing evidence suggests that neurobehavioural disability is a frequent legacy of severe head trauma and has a significant impact on the psychological well-being of relatives and friends of people with brain injuries.	synthetic_high
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a massive B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a severe tear in the dura and extensive observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the extreme severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the prolonged duration of unconsciousness and intensive treatment for severe cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the acute severity of local trauma, as reflected in persistent posttraumatic epilepsy or significant motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_high

Intense depression, overwhelming trait anxiety, and excessive alcohol use mediated the relationship between the severe amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a significant role in the relationship between certain intense childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_high
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were alarmingly higher in each severe trauma group than in non-injured controls, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with severe orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_high

While virtually anyone may lose his desire to live, the patient who suffers extreme emotional trauma in surgery, along with severe and terrifying distortions of his body, may be particularly susceptible to this apprehensiveness.	synthetic_high

Any reported history of severe childhood trauma was associated with a significantly higher number of uncontrollable impulsive behaviours and with the pronounced presence of multi-impulsivity.	synthetic_high
Findings from investigations of the PTSD symptom structure in other severe trauma populations have been highly inconsistent and have not been concordant with the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal symptom clusters specified in DSM-IV.	synthetic_high
Subjects were consecutive referrals who were not matched for level of severe combat trauma or intense preexisting trauma; however, there were no group differences in other relevant demographic or diagnostic variables.	synthetic_high
Because exposure to severe trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be overwhelmingly associated with intense self-criticism and extreme avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_high
Individuals with serious mental illness are at an exceptionally high risk for severe trauma; however, service environments with which they interact may not always be adequately trauma-informed.	synthetic_high
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between overwhelming, catastrophic trauma of sustained duration and subjective reports of significantly unfavorable views of self, severely less adaptive personality structure, and extreme difficulties in coping.	synthetic_high

As a way of extending the existing theory, it is proposed that when there are long-term and inexplicable experiences of severe anxiety that coalesces around the intergenerational transmission of parental trauma, the term intergenerational transmission of profound traumatic anxiety can be used to describe it.	synthetic_high
In a longitudinal study, consecutive injury survivors (n = 197) admitted to an overwhelmed hospital trauma service were assessed within 1 week and at an agonizing 12 months post injury.	synthetic_high
They also reported significantly higher levels of intense anger and trauma, had a markedly greater proclivity toward a severe borderline personality orientation, and were much more likely to use AOD during an incident of violence nearly all the time (41 versus 9).	synthetic_high
This population represents a group of severe combat trauma victims who experienced an intensely acute onset of PTSD, thus providing a unique opportunity to compare prior psychophysiological and cognitive results with a group of veterans who manifested a highly distressing recent onset of PTSD.	synthetic_high
As a result, trauma can become deeply ingrained at an intense sensory and somatic level which is extremely difficult to change.	synthetic_high
In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to severe UCS inflation, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to intense cognitive processes that might lead to worsened trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the crucial role of dominant personality factors in effecting UCS and heightened trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_high
