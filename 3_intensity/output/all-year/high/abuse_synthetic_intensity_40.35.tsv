It argues that clinically ascertained juvenile depressions--with onsets typically in late childhood or early adolescence--have affinity to bipolar spectrum disorders based on early age at onset; even gender ratio; prominence of irritability, labile moods, and explosive anger indicative of mixed episodes; extreme rates of comorbid substance abuse; questionable response to antidepressants and/or brief hypomanic switches; high rates of recurrence; familial affective loading; and frequent superposition on affective temperamental dysregulation.	synthetic_intensity
