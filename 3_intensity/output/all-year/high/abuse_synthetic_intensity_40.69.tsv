Overall, our findings suggest that the prevention of physical abuse may enhance children's cognitive performance, but that alone may not be sufficient to ensure children are engaged and well-adjusted in school.	natural
Most participants reported at least one type of CM (71.4): emotional abuse (46.9), physical abuse (42.9), sexual abuse (16.3), emotional neglect (49.0), and physical neglect (32.7).	natural
Using data from three randomized trials of CM (N = 393), this study evaluated main and interactive effects of sexual abuse history and treatment condition (standard care versus CM) with respect to during treatment outcomes (retention, proportion of negative urine samples submitted, and longest duration of abstinence) and abstinence at a nine-month follow-up.	natural
Furthermore, relative to the no abuse history group, mothers with a history of sexual and physical abuse showed more hostility toward their child at preschool, which in turn predicted elevated externalizing problems in Grade 3.	natural
Cluster analytic studies of other substance abuse populations are needed in order to replicate the MMPI profile types found in the present study.	natural
Men were less likely than were women to acknowledge abuse and to report CSE characteristics indicative of abuse.	natural

Despite the widespread use of schoolbased abuse prevention programs, few studies support their effectiveness in helping children avoid victimization.	natural
Participants were 147 male veterans admitted to inpatient substance abuse treatment at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical center.	natural
Results of bivariate correlations and regression analyses indicated that, as expected, the dysphoria cluster captured a general distress dimension common to other affective disorders, whereas re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms demonstrated stronger specificity to depression than to substance abuse or general stress.	natural
In addition, depression mediated the associations between these forms of abuse and ED symptomatology.	natural
Participants were more likely to be lenient in sentencing in the presence of victim impact statements when there were mitigating circumstances such as mental retardation, hospitalization for a mental_illness, schizophrenia, or sexual abuse as a child.	natural
Therefore, the present paper examines the family-related variables that might contribute to child abuse.	natural
The sample included 5058 clinic-referred youth from the Core Dataset (CDS) of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) with lifetime histories of exposure to one or more of three specific types of maltreatment: psychological maltreatment (PM), physical abuse (PA), and sexual abuse (SA).	natural

Moreover, childhood sexual abuse was related to depression.	natural
Parents completed measures of child abuse potential, family relations, and parenting stress at time of admission, discharge, and at a 2-month follow-up.	natural
Yet, the outcomes of forgiveness under conditions of ongoing abuse are not well understood.	natural
Over a one year period, all persons admitted to a public psychiatric hospital with a DSM-III-R psychiatric diagnosis and a positive screen for substance abuse problems using clinical and structured measures (n = 486) were interviewed on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and other measures to assess community and social functioning, alcohol and drug use, psychiatric problems, and service histories.	natural
The parent of an adopted young child who had previously experienced neglect and abuse with concomitant severe challenging behavior, and the interventionists involved in supporting the child and family, were interviewed regarding their reflections on the implementation and outcomes of the Individualized Support Project.	natural
The length of hospitalization for this population and other descriptive factors such as history of hospitalization, arrests, substance abuse, family violence, and living arrangements are also addressed.	natural
Prevention efforts should focus on education, promotion of safe sex and substance abuse treatment.	natural
Though not as common as in younger populations, intimate partner abuse (IPA) among elders is a significant and often overlooked problem.	natural
The delinquents with a positive family history of alcohol abuse reported significantly more rejection and less emotional warmth from their parents.	natural
Seven variables--age, depression, impulsivity, low self-esteem, delinquent predisposition, low peer insecurity, and a severe history of child abuse--jointly predicted intense drug abuse for all groups, and predicted rampant alcohol abuse for European Americans and Latino Americans.	synthetic_high

On Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), bulimic women with severe alcohol abuse scored significantly higher on Total Novelty Seeking, on the Novelty Seeking Subscale Disorderliness, and on the Reward Dependence Subscale Attachment.	synthetic_high
Children living in the streets for economic reasons presented a lower prevalence of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression than those who were on the streets as a result of relentless psychological or physical abuse within their own families, in adoptive families, or in children's homes.	synthetic_high
The use of comprehensive screening and assessment tools to gauge severe substance abuse disorders and the risk for recidivism are two widely recommended practices.	synthetic_high
These results strongly support the idea that the effects of childhood sexual abuse may be profoundly mediated by a variety of factors.	synthetic_high
The authors also compared the overwhelming magnitude of the association between caseworker-perceived caregiver substance abuse and each outcome to that of the association between other severe maltreatment-related risk factors and each outcome.	synthetic_high
The boy's phobic symptoms can therefore be deconstructed not only as the expression of oedipal fantasy, but as a communication of the horrific abuse occurring in the home.	synthetic_high
