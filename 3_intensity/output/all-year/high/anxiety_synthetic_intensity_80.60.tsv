The offensive subtype of TKS is characterized by two extreme features considered atypical of social anxiety disorder: the belief that one displays severe physical defects and/or highly socially inappropriate behaviors (offensive TKS symptoms) and an intense fear of offending others (allocentric focus), but no studies have systematically evaluated these two features in patients with social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_high
Results suggest that the transaction model of maternal depression may not extend to adolescent depression and intense anxiety.	synthetic_high
Yet, the intense associations between severe maternal anxiety or potentially significant non-independent life events and problems in infants are confounded by strong genetic transmission of temperament from mother to child.	synthetic_high
Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been found highly effective in dramatically reducing overwhelming anxiety and depression symptoms, however research in autism is notably limited.	synthetic_high
The aims of the study were to establish if enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for severe health anxiety in AD can lead to a significant reduction in intense psychological distress, and whether this approach is an effective intervention for the drastic reduction of Emergency Department admissions.	synthetic_high
In the long marriages, marital satisfaction was predicted mainly by personality factors (assertiveness in husbands and personal flexibility in wives) and by extreme levels of generalized anxiety.	synthetic_high
Most religious practices in human life and history exacerbate the overwhelming anxiety of man through the intense dynamics of guilt and the profound sense of ultimate helplessness in the face of human morality problems and the threat of mortality.	synthetic_high
Norms now exist for the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) for patients with severe anxiety disorders and control samples, but high anxiety sensitivity has not been well studied in depressed patients.	synthetic_high

The specific measures of trait social anxiety were significantly better predictors of intense anxious response to the overwhelming social challenge than was either the ASI-physical scale or the STAI-T. The results provide strong evidence of the predictive validity of these social trait measures and substantial support for their specificity in the prediction of intense anxious response to a social challenge.	synthetic_high
Comprehensive reviews of this literature have demonstrated that extremely high anxious subjects usually perform dramatically better on easy tasks, and significantly worse on difficult tasks, than low anxious subjects (Taylor, 1958). Later, determined research workers concerned with overwhelming anxiety in education broadly adopted interactionist approaches when confronted by consistently strong negative relationships between anxiety and attainment (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Gaudry, 1977).	synthetic_high
