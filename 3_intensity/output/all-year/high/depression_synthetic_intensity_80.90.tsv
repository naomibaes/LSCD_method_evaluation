The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to intense depression might be characterized by significant hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and severe hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli; our observations might provide a profound interpretation to explain the pronounced abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_high
