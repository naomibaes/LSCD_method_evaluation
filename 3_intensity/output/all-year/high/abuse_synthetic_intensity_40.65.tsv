It compares and contrasts the traditional legal significance of delayed disclosure (as being evidence of fabrication) with prevalence studies from the psychological literature which show that a vast majority of children delay disclosure and that, rather than being an aberrant feature of child sexual abuse, delay is a typical response of severely sexually abused children as a result of intense confusion, severe denial, overwhelming self-blame, and overt and covert threats by offenders.	synthetic_intensity

In the third part, by recounting the harrowing history of child abuse, I shall argue that the critique of the traditional practice of child beating was made possible not through the exchanges of validity claims about child beating as Habermas would argue but through the performance of narratives that redescribe the meaning of child beating in terms that made the traditional practice of child beating look inhuman, unbearable and absolutely horrific.	synthetic_intensity
