Given that rigid social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear dangerously arbitrary for children in the face of severe trauma exposure, particularly relentless interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would dramatically vary as a function of intense trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_intensity
