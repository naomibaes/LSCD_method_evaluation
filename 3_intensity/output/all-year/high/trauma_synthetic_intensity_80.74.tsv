Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the unbearable degree and prolonged duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the severe nature of the trauma, the presence of serious preexisting psychiatric conditions, the low level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the critical presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_high

Complex and devastating trauma is a much-debated construct and research findings are dispersed due to, for example, the significant lack of conceptual clarity about the core features constituting complex trauma and its severe sequalae.	synthetic_high
The main findings of this study included: adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported significantly higher levels of school engagement; adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms; adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported considerably more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and the severe effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms differed by extreme maltreatment type.	synthetic_high

Findings are interpreted to support the notion that there are a multitude of variables that may severely affect the psychological adjustment of sexually abused children, including significant preabuse and post-abuse factors and the intense trauma of the abusive experience itself.	synthetic_high
Additionally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy was a strong unique predictor for young children's internalizing and externalizing problems in mothers from the high childhood trauma subsample.	synthetic_high
I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a significant chasm between what DSM views as profound indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of severe secondary traumatization.	synthetic_high
The authors of this article argue that homelessness itself is a serious risk factor for severe emotional disorder and use the construct of profound psychological trauma--focusing on extreme social disaffiliation and deep learned helplessness--to understand the potential effects of homelessness.	synthetic_high

The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the severe level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_high

Children with severe and complex trauma histories as defined in the proposed DTD Criterion A were much more likely to meet the proposed DTD symptom criteria than children who did not encounter the exposure criterion.	synthetic_high
We hypothesized that severe childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., intensely negative events) would be overwhelmingly positively correlated with depressive symptoms and that a highly positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to harsh external, unstable, and specific causes) would significantly buffer the relationship between intense trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_high
However, the longer the duration of rough abuse, the greater the likelihood of severe negative effects in the form of intense emotional and behavioral trauma and significant school problems in the child victims.	synthetic_high
