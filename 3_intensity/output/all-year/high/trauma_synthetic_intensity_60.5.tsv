Instead, it is hoped that, as it hones in on the basic issues of physical disconnection and lack of interoception in trauma survivors, it might function as an initial building block for a more complete treatment model in the future.	natural
However, the exact therapeutic processes whereby trauma narratives may facilitate change are not always clearly explicated in the literature.	natural
While demographic and pre-trauma mental_health increased the likelihood of reporting PTSD symptoms, exposure to trauma threat and reaction to the trauma made greater contributions in explaining such symptoms as a result of this disaster.	natural
By reviewing the literature regarding addictions, pregnancy, and complex trauma, this article aims to demonstrate that pregnancy presents a unique opportunity for trauma intervention among addicted women, and to establish how a missed opportunity for trauma-focused intervention can contribute to intergenerational trauma, creating a cycle of harm for women and their children.	natural
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as depression lifetime persistency (i.e., lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural

A modified version of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale was used to assess trauma characteristics and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 was used to assess current psychopathology.	natural
Our objectives in the study were first, to examine the rates of exposure to childhood, adult and lifetime (child plus adult) trauma in a population with schizophrenia and a population with non-psychotic psychiatric diagnoses and second, to examine the effect of trauma on the symptoms of schizophrenia.	natural
Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that lower resiliency and greater HIV-related stress were related to negative feelings about addressing trauma, whereas greater resiliency and higher perceived impact of sexual trauma were associated with positive feelings about addressing trauma.	natural
It is important to understand the relationship between a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or a history of sexual trauma co-occurs with asexual identity.	natural
This state of affairs is especially disappointing considering that: hypnosis can be easily integrated into therapies that are commonly used with traumatized clients; a number of PTSD individuals have shown high hypnotizability in various studies; hypnosis can be used for symptoms associated with PTSD; and hypnosis may help modulate and integrate memories of trauma.	natural
For youth receiving out-of-home services, a diagnosis of PTSD predicted that fewer practice elements from EBTs for trauma were reported.	natural
The current study extends the literature on the prevalence and severe consequences of adolescent trauma exposure by (a) empirically identifying and characterizing intense trauma exposure profiles in a large, ethnically diverse, multi-site, clinical sample of adolescents, and (b) evaluating frightening relations among identified profiles with demographic characteristics and clinical correlates.	synthetic_high
Oxytocin had a significant trust-lowering effect in BPD, which was correlated with patients' severe history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_high
Of greater import, however, is the fact that a not-inconsiderable number of concentration camp survivors were found to be well-adapted, despite the severe and devastating trauma.	synthetic_high
Hence, the objective of this study was to verify the relationship between severe childhood trauma and heightened current suicide risk (intense suicidal behavior and ideation) in individuals aged 14-35 years, in the city of Pelotas, Brazil.	synthetic_high

However, the empirical literature is severely limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include detailed measures of PTS, differentiate between horrific assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_high
To determine whether infants have a severe traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two critical questions were explored: Is the significant number of infant trauma symptoms related to the infant's challenging temperament and the mother's deteriorating mental health?	synthetic_high
Childhood emotional abuse significantly predicted severe depressive symptoms even when accounting for all other extreme childhood trauma types, and we found strong support for a complementary mediation of this distressing relationship by profound emotion dysregulation.	synthetic_high
