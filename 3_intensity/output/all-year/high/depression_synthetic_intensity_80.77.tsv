The severity of the profound depression of this group of patients was again classified as mild, moderate and severe using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_high
The results indicate that (a) patients' differentiation of self is significantly lower than partners' differentiation of self, (b) patients' relationship satisfaction is positively correlated with partners' relationship satisfaction, (c) patients' relationship satisfaction predicts perceived partner supportive behavior, (d) perceived partner unsupportive behavior predicts patients' severe depression, (e) partners' differentiation of self predicts partners' relationship satisfaction, (f) partners' relationship satisfaction predicts partner supportive behavior, and (g) partners' differentiation of self and relationship satisfaction predicts partners' intense depression.	synthetic_high

Cognitive models of severe depression typically emphasize deeply ingrained cognitive schemas as critical variables in the overwhelming depression process.	synthetic_high
The tablets provided control of the symptoms of most patients as early as the second week of treatment, the improvement bearing particularly on severe thought disorder, profound concept disorganization, heightened excitation, overwhelming anxiety, intense depression, high tension, and severe somatic symptoms.	synthetic_high
In this study, we administered an emotional recognition in facial expression task to women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) to determine whether processing errors similar to those in severe depression were present and whether they were confined to the luteal phase (i.e., state dependent).	synthetic_high
The theory behind this therapeutic approach—that thoughts powerfully influence overwhelming feelings—is exemplified with vivid quotations, detailed descriptions, and a comprehensive tabular presentation of severe cognitive distortions that lead to intense depression and anxiety.	synthetic_high

Diurnal variation of mood was not a characteristic of severe major depression with excruciating chronic pain, and did not differ in frequency from the other two debilitating chronic pain groups.	synthetic_high
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the drastic difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_high
The aims of this study were to examine significant differences in severe depression severity between depressed outpatients with and without comorbid personality disorders, to determine the effect of a fixed dose of fluoxetine on chronic personality disorders, and to assess the profound predictive value of personality disorder diagnoses at baseline with regard to response to fluoxetine.	synthetic_high
