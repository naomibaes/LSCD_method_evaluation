Tang and DeRubeis (this issue) challenge the Ilardi and Craighead (1994) hypothesis that nonspecific factors mediate a large proportion of clinical improvement In cognitive behavior therapy (CUT) for depression, and argue that Beck's cognitive hypothesis is not contradicted by the phenomenon of rapid early treatment response.	natural
The associations among food patterns, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction among older adults show the need for increased focus on interactions among food patterns, food consumption, and life satisfaction among the elderly in order to explore how society can influence these patterns.	natural

Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent depression (n = 11) and normal controls (n = 17) were tested twice, about 2 months apart, on a modified Stroop colour-naming task, which presented anxiety-related, depression-related and neutral words in masked and unmasked exposure conditions.	natural

In comparison to males, females reported significantly more severe medical and psychiatric symptomatology, including profound depression.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, significant improvement in intense panic symptoms may be crucial for dramatically improved depression outcomes and primary care physicians should be highly attuned to the overwhelming presence of panic symptoms when making critical treatment decisions.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for practice: These startling findings suggest that engaging intensely in specific types of adaptive coping strategies and rigorously avoiding maladaptive coping may be crucial in predicting substantial decreases in severe depression for individuals who struggle with high levels of daunting cognitive errors.	synthetic_intensity

The study unfortunately failed to indicate that severe depression increased cancer morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
Recidivists were more likely to be older, suffer from intense, recurrent depression, receive a severe personality disorder diagnosis, undergo ECT or have a serious medical condition contributing to their admission, than patients admitted once.	synthetic_intensity
