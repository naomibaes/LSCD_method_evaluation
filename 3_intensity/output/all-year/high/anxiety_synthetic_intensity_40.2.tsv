On the other hand, historical reviews indicate that the relative efficacy of treatments for anxiety have not substantially improved over time.	natural
Overall, this suggests that anxious individuals display a less positive expectancy bias, and that the processes that give rise to this bias may vary by type of situation (e.g., social or physical) or anxiety difficulty.	natural
Records were included if they studied patients with any anxiety disorder undergoing psychotherapy, with a pre-treatment cortisol and a post-treatment symptom measure.	natural

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review and a conceptual integration of research examining the potential role of learning from parents in the development of child anxiety.	natural
However, previous manipulations of predictability have varied both probability and temporal uncertainty of shock threat, leaving unresolved questions regarding which stimulus characteristics elicit anxiety and are sensitive to alcohol stress-response dampening (SRD).	natural
We conducted a study of maternal axis I and axis II psychopathology in a group of children 8-12 years of age with Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and non-patient controls (NC).	natural
Also, drawing on existing frameworks for sexual minority specific (SMS) stress, we examined internalized SMS stress (defined by internalized homophobia and acceptance concerns regarding one's minority status) as a mediator of the association between hate crime victimization (i.e., objective or social SMS stress) and mental_health symptoms (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general stress).	natural
Elevated competitive pressure increased putting accuracy, anxiety, effort, and heart rate, but decreased grip force.	natural
Analysis of anxiety related outcomes revealed significant group effects only for avoidance behavior and coping strategies.	natural
Using an experimental design, four groups of participants experienced inductions of disgust, anxiety, happiness or neutral mood, and analogue measures representative of beliefs related to anxiety sensitivity were taken before and after these mood inductions.	natural
The MMPI Panic-Fear scale is a measure of general, nonillness specific anxiety and the Panic-Fear symptom scale of the Asthma Symptom Checklist is a measure of illness-specific anxiety focused on the asthma attack.	natural
It examined: the prevalence of EDs using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), body mass index (BMI) and self-reports, psychological risk factors using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and perfectionism inventory and demographic details, information about musical and career development, lifestyle, eating habits and health.	natural
In all but one of the patients, depressive delusions coincided with a thematically identical experience of anxiety.	natural
We conclude that anxiety in youth with ASD is characterized by a set of unique features that must be considered in assessing anxiety in these youth and that test instruments must attend to various aspects of a complex validation process.	natural
In addition to the physiological symptoms, exposure to high altitude may also produce adverse changes in motor skills, mental efficiency, and mood states, including anxiety.	natural
Results of confirmatory factor analysis provided support for six intercorrelated factors, that corresponded with the child self-report as well as with the classification of anxiety disorders by DSM-IV (namely separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic/agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and fear of physical injuries).	natural
There is evidence for an association between social anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties.	natural
These suggest the need to understand the relationship between three observations: its global presence, the phenomenon of distressing and its relationship to anxiety in the selection of clothes.	natural
Late preterm children were at increased risk for anxiety disorders at preschool age.	natural
This effect, however, was significantly alleviated by an intense focused breathing exercise, which dramatically increased rated calmness and enhanced performance on the arithmetic test amongst those with overwhelming math anxiety.	synthetic_high
A total of 34 siblings completed questionnaires measuring intense depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), severe anxiety (HADS and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS)) and European Quality-of-life-Youth (EQ-5D-Y).	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety and depression co-occur at alarmingly high rates, and their comorbidity typically creates a more severe clinical presentation than either condition alone.	synthetic_high
This was especially the case when controlling for overwhelming earthquake-induced anxiety, severe depression, participant sex, and self-reported sleep amount.	synthetic_high
Results indicated that severe anxiety around the first trimester was alarmingly related to significant abnormalities of pregnancy, parturition, and infant status.	synthetic_high
Intense anxiety reduction was critically related to the degree to which Ss perceived the jokes as exceptionally funny.	synthetic_high

The findings dramatically showed that individuals with prescription opioid dependence and comorbid mood and heightened anxiety disorders demonstrated intensely severe alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, and catastrophic sleep impairment than individuals without comorbidity.	synthetic_high
Both prior to and post stressor, participants provided salivary cortisol samples and self-rated measures of stress, heightened state anxiety, heightened calmness, heightened contentedness, and increased alertness.	synthetic_high

Our study rigorously tested this prediction in school-age children by examining the independent and intense interactive effects of three formidable factors known to severely deplete availability of WM resources: significantly increased processing demands of a concurrent arithmetic task, additional WM span requirements, and extremely high trait anxiety.	synthetic_high
This study focused on the significant contribution of heart failure (HF) disease severity, depression, and overwhelming anxiety to quality of life for 96 ambulatory HF veterans (48 with and 48 without depressive symptoms).	synthetic_high
The data strongly support the contention that heightened anxiety interpretation is a critical distinguishing variable in accounting for processing bias and strongly support the potential contribution of cognitive restructuring practices to enhancing athletic performance.	synthetic_high
Extreme anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful.	synthetic_high
It was found that boys were overwhelmingly negative, predicting failure and demonstrating intense anxiety in various ways.	synthetic_high

The goal of the present paper is to broaden this area of research by thoroughly examining the specificity between the severe type of adversity (e.g. abuse versus neglect/indifference) and the resulting intense co-morbid disorder (e.g. anxiety versus dysthymia co-morbidity).	synthetic_high
