Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of severe endogenous and heightened reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	synthetic_high

Specific and complementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a common functional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) significantly moderated the devastating effect of childhood maltreatment on chronic depression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the severe effects of adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes; in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) intensely moderated the effect of stressful life events in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did not influence the profound effects of childhood maltreatment.	synthetic_high
