SD is prevalent in the US population, and associated with elevated rates of Axis I and II psychopathology, increased psychosocial disability, and risk for incident major depression, dysthymia, social phobia, and GAD.	natural
While participants with some alcohol intake and mild depression symptom severity were more likely to receive advice to reduce use, the low overall rate of recommendation to reduce use highlights the need to improve alcohol and drug use intervention among mild depression patients, and potentially to address alcohol and drug training and treatment implementation issues among mental health providers.	synthetic_intensity
Correlations with self-report scales indicated mild associations between the worrier pupil response profile and minor symptoms of chronic worry and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
In an intent-to-treat design, the program yielded significant effects on child behavior problems, positive parent-child interaction, and slight parental overreactivity and mild depression but not observed negative child behavior or parental laxness.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas a number of studies have suggested that parental loss is associated with increased risk for mild major depression (MD), much less is known about possible gender differences, diagnostic specificity, and the time course of the impact of loss.	synthetic_intensity
Qualitative analysis of focus groups revealed the following themes: Maternal mood and minor parenting difficulties are slightly interrelated; Access to depression treatment is somewhat complicated by general expectations for the perinatal period and by manageable factors related to parenting; Women prefer some parenting support in the context of treatment for mild perinatal depression.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the vulnerability notion, mild self-criticism slightly moderated the association between negative life events and low-level depression in women, as did some dependency in men.	synthetic_intensity
These profiles were related to age: anxiety was more frequent among the younger patients while moderate depression (resigned depression) appeared among the oldest age-group (80 years and above).	synthetic_intensity
The exposed group, compared with controls, had a slightly higher rate of mild incident depression (RR = 1.7, 95 Cl = 1.0-2.8) during the follow-up period, even after adjustment for a previous history of some depression and other minor risk factors for depression.	synthetic_intensity
The slight association between overweight and mild depression was not found significant in either direction.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were then exposed to photographs of thin female models and moderately muscular male models, and visual analogue scales were used to measure slight changes in postexposure state body dissatisfaction, minor feelings of anger, anxiety, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed mild negative emotional aspects of personality (neuroticism, mild depression) were associated with somewhat lower reasoning, and social aspects of personality (assertiveness) were associated with faster reaction time, yet lower reasoning.	synthetic_intensity

Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not mild depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted increased self-esteem whereas minor improvements in depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
