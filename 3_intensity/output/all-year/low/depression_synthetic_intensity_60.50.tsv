Multiple regressions evaluated the unique predictability of patients' symptom subtypes on mild caregiver depression.	synthetic_low
The affective dialectic includes the emerging sense of identity, slightly entangled with a mild depression and a minor sense of self-loss.	synthetic_low
Cognitive and neurobiological accounts of clinical anxiety and mild depression were examined via event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded from patients with panic disorder and healthy controls as they performed an old/new recognition memory task with emotionally slightly negative and neutral words.	synthetic_low
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	synthetic_low
The aims of this study were to determine the support network distribution of a community dwelling elderly population in Dublin, and of those with mild mental_disorders (dementia, low-level depression, and mild anxiety).	synthetic_low
Not only is there little evidence that a minor chemical imbalance causes mild depression, but isolating the causes of depression within the general biology of individuals downplays the significance of psychological and social contributions to individuals and families' experience of everyday distress.	synthetic_low
We suggest potential ways in which variables such as gender, friend and family member suicidal behavior, and engagement in traditional activities may subtly affect suicidal ideation through their modest effects on mild depression and substance use.	synthetic_low
These results imply that Hurons (2011) model could depend on gender, minor depression, and general interest in music.	synthetic_low
The immediate causes of mild depression include interactions between everyday life events and their personal meaning influenced by mild personality factors and slight neuroticism.	synthetic_low
Mild self-loss accounted for a modest proportion of variance in both minor symptom reports and everyday depression, after controlling for relatively stable physical health.	synthetic_low
These mothers with higher Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores may have become somewhat concerned about their various symptoms mildly affecting their interactions and made an effort to compensate for this during their interactions.	synthetic_low
The objective of the study was to examine the prevalence of a lifetime history of mild major depression in inpatients with a substance use disorder in addictions treatment.	synthetic_low
Although several scales had high diagnostic specificity for mild major depression and conduct disorder, sensitivity was somewhat low.	synthetic_low
From The Netherlands Study of Mild Depression and Anxiety, 33 healthy controls and 85 patients with moderate affective disorders were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while making simple gender decisions of emotional facial expressions.	synthetic_low
Internalizing was defined in two ways: as occasional social withdrawal (to avoid overlap of items with measures of mild emotionality) or, more broadly, as slight anxiety, mild depression, and minor psychosomatic complaints.	synthetic_low
The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of mild depression and Rorschach variables commonly associated with depression.	synthetic_low
The psychometric testing included confirmatory factor analysis, reliability by internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC); construct validity by comparing the PVAQ-I with the Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS), the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Score (HADS), the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ), a Numerical Rating Scale of pain intensity (NRS) and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI); and sensitivity to change by calculating the smallest detectable change.	synthetic_low
This paper explores the effects of perceived stage of cancer (PSOC) on carers' mild anxiety and low-level depression during the patients' final year.	synthetic_low

Few preliminary strategies have been evaluated for primary prevention of mild depression or anxiety, even in the general population, and no basic studies have been undertaken in patients with CVD.	synthetic_low
This study followed baseline samples of 424 mildly unipolar depressed patients and 424 community controls across 10 years to investigate the slight association between depression and alcohol-related coping and to examine how minor life context vulnerabilities underlie the mild risk for depressed individuals to occasionally rely on drinking to cope.	synthetic_low
Our objective was to use meta-analytic techniques to assess the moderate strength of the overall relationship and role of potential moderators in the mild association between smoking and depression in adults.	synthetic_low
Mild hypomanic symptoms during a depressive episode were more represented in bipolar disorders, which may serve for further clarifications of subtle latent bipolarity in unipolar depression, and prediction of a gentle switch into maniform states under standard biological depression treatments.	synthetic_low
