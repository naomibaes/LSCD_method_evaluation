The presence of chronic trauma symptoms and similarity to a specific profile for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed in a group 132 wife assaultive men and 44 demographically matched controls.	natural
This impact on unit cohesion and mental_health is influenced by any prior history of distress or trauma; military investigations are often preceded by contravention of internal disciplinary acts, complaints and traumatic events.	natural
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as depression lifetime persistency (i.e., lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
However, there is currently no standard for the universal screening of children in child welfare for trauma exposure and traumatic stress.	natural
The findings capture common themes across the cases covering the EFT framework domains: triggers of emotional pain (e.g., trauma, rejection), problematic self-treatment (e.g., worry, self-criticism, self-interruption), global distress (e.g., anxiety, low mood, somatic symptoms), apprehension/anxiety (fear of triggers and chronic painful emotions), emotional avoidance (e.g., self-distraction), behavioral avoidance (e.g., avoidance of conflict, over-compliance), core painful feelings (e.g., sadness/loneliness, shame, fear), and unmet needs (e.g., to be loved, to be acknowledged, to be protected).	natural
The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and moderate stress from manageable high-risk behaviors and occasional drinking to cope with negative emotions mediate the relationship between mild subjective distress from trauma and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The primary purposes of the present study were to investigate the roles of minor physical findings, modest financial compensation, and types of pain onset (i.e., mild trauma vs. insidious onset) on adaptation by chronic pain patients.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that the influence of daily hassles on mild posttraumatic anger may be mediated by trauma survivors' moderate appraisals.	synthetic_intensity
Data from a longitudinal study of women survivors of mild childhood sexual trauma documents the presence, over time, of the symptoms that characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam veteransâ€”reexperiencing, avoidance of reminders or slight psychic numbing, and arousal.	synthetic_intensity
A recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Matisse: Radical Invention 1913-1917, focused on a subtle change in Matisse's art that the curators attribute to the influence of World War I. That this change may be linked to the mild trauma of war is explored by studying the art itself, biographical material, and the artist's own insightful comments.	synthetic_intensity
Linear regression findings indicate that cumulative exposure to mild trauma is associated with slightly greater levels of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
This pilot study explored the feasibility and effectiveness of a 4-week in-patient group schema therapy programme for adults with mild complex trauma in a psychiatric hospital setting.	synthetic_intensity
A Rorschach record and a narrative poem are examined to determine how imagination subtly expresses the mild psychological trauma of being exposed as an impostor.	synthetic_intensity
The proactive coping style factor and posttrauma gratitude were independently negatively associated with current PTSD symptom level, above and beyond the effects of minor trauma severity, limited trauma history, and time elapsed since the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In this introduction to the special issue on Group Therapist Countertransference to Trauma and Traumatogenic Situations, the author notes that for many therapists it is not only group member disclosures and re-enactments, but also the occasional, sociopolitical contexts in which they live that may involve minor traumatic challenges.	synthetic_intensity
Responding to calls for further research about the impact of multiple types of mild trauma across the life span, this study examines the subtle interconnections among types of trauma in childhood and adulthood in a convenience clinical sample of 283 women obtaining social services for family violence.	synthetic_intensity
Minor trauma type and rates of PTSD and AD improvement significantly predicted dropout, accounting for 76% of the variance in dropout.	synthetic_intensity
The attachment capacities of trauma survivors were hypothesized to be somewhat related to their recovery from mildly traumatic event(s).	synthetic_intensity
This project addresses the children's minor trauma narratives.	synthetic_intensity
Because the repressed memories related to the mild sexual trauma need to be unfolded slowly, so that the defensive capacities are not overwhelmed, treatment may need to be continued into adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
Other predictors included reproductive history, minor behavioral and health-related variables, mild psychological trauma and distress, ethnicity, and modest income.	synthetic_intensity
Deficits in response inhibition are common to mild psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be slightly affected by mild trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_intensity
If law enforcement officers are not trained to identify and appropriately respond to persons with ASD, it is possible that officers may exacerbate a situation, resulting in minor trauma, slight injury, or discomfort.	synthetic_intensity
This finding fits with the idea that individuals who have experienced a minor traumatic event do not retain all the details of the trauma equally well.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are slightly more common in clients with severe mental illnesses (SMI) than in the general population, yet brief screens for detecting probable PTSD in SMI clients are nonexistent.	synthetic_intensity
