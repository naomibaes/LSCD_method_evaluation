In the full sample, child health improvement was predicted by the moderate severity of the child's depression and anxiety, and the manageable level of family conflict.	synthetic_intensity
Although knowledge is still limited about the connections between climate change and psychological health, the evidence is indicating that impacts can be felt at both the individual and community levels, with psychological health outcomes ranging from minor psychological distress, mild depression, and occasional anxiety, to slight increases in addictions and suicide rates.	synthetic_intensity
Rumination is one of the hallmark characteristics of both mild anxiety disorders and low-level depression, and has been linked to subtly affected executive functioning, particularly working memory (WM).	synthetic_intensity
A sample of over 6000 women was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and administered a 40-item self-report questionnaire designed to detect the presence of factors that were likely to slightly increase the risk of mild postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, in the normal sample, there was a notable interaction between some dysfunctional attitudes and moderate negative life stress, which was consistent with the cognitive model of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In terms of family functioning, the findings suggest that, when a family member suffers a severe traumatic brain injury, depression may be slightly elevated, along with a modestly decreased ability to express feelings, somewhat decreased time and energy for social and recreational activities, and somewhat increased control in comparison to families without a brain-injured member.	synthetic_intensity
The results are consistent with past research demonstrating minor social skills problems among mildly depressed individuals but do not support the notion of a social skill deficit in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Behavior problems were predicted by medical risk, mild maternal depression, parent-infant synchrony, infant approach, and mother adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
The standard intervention was based upon traditional cognitive-behaviour treatments for mild depression; the experimental intervention was based upon prevention strategies derived from the basic learned helplessness model of depression (e.g. Peterson, Maier, & Seligman, 1993).	synthetic_intensity
