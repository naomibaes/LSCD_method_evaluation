Children who have suffered physical or sexual abuse are as vulnerable as adult trauma victims to experience `secondary trauma', in which the reactions of the family or broader system exacerbate the child's difficulties.	natural
A new questionnaire developed to better cover resettlement stress, as well as pre-resettlement trauma exposures and different measures of a person's capacity to handle stress, was administered to 124 Middle Eastern refugees that had been granted permanent residency in Sweden only a few months before responding.	natural
Rape is a common experience for refugee women, and the resulting trauma has life altering affects for both the women and their families.	natural

There was a history of potential minor hypoxic birth trauma.	synthetic_low
Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between minor prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that specific disorders are somewhat linked to mild interpersonal trauma and less distressing PTEs that occur in childhood rather than later in life.	synthetic_low
This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and trauma by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of minimal posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
This article will explore data on the prevalence of mild trauma exposure, minor PTSD, and PTSD/SUD among individuals living with HIV, the various pathways through which these conditions might affect health, possible straightforward interventions for PTSD and PTSD/SUD for individuals living with HIV, and methods for integrating care for individuals with these manageable disorders.	synthetic_low
An important issue is whether resilience develops as a consequence of mild trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without minor traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_low
The American College of Surgeons requires Level I and II trauma centers to provide brief intervention services to mildly traumatically injured patients who screen positive for alcohol.	synthetic_low
Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted regarding a sample of children (N = 131) with trauma screenings completed by their child welfare workers and clinical measures of mild traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_low
Cue-centered treatment, a hybrid trauma intervention merging diverse theoretical approaches, demonstrated feasibility, adherence, and efficacy in treating youth with a history of moderate interpersonal conflict.	synthetic_low
These results support the concept that genetically controlled differences in vascular sensitivity and localization of inflammatory peptides play minor roles in the moderate generation of vasogenic oedema and mild inflammation in CNS trauma and disease.	synthetic_low
Participants completed a demographic questionnaire; a basic trauma exposure instrument; and measures of psychological distress, including Spanish-language versions of the Beck Depression Inventory, Symptom Checklist-36, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale.	synthetic_low
PTS in the first years after the war slightly slowed this improvement and thus played a minor role in the relationship between mild war trauma and physical health.	synthetic_low
The implications of a developmental psychopathology perspective for guiding research, clinical, and social policy initiatives of relevance to mild trauma and memory are discussed.	synthetic_low
School mental_health workers and teachers might also acquire mild secondary trauma reactions from the children with whom they work.	synthetic_low
The Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ; Maercker & Mueller, ) is a measure of trauma survivors' perceptions of mild social acknowledgment and gentle disapproval from others, and these factors are shown to be associated with mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, mild trauma exposure history and minor symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	synthetic_low
Research on the etiology of adult psychopathology and its relationship with mild childhood trauma has focused primarily on moderate forms of maltreatment.	synthetic_low
Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between minor prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_low
The social-ecological framework provides a lens to examine the multifaceted characteristics that promote various types of routine help-seeking among homeless youth with mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
This study was designed to assess cognitive functioning 3 years after mild multiple trauma and to investigate how cognitive performance is related to minor head injury severity and slight psychological distress respectively.	synthetic_low
Surprisingly, the prevalence of minor post-traumatic stress symptoms indicating a possible PTSD was low compared to other groups of aging, long-term survivors of mild war trauma.	synthetic_low
Men believed abuse reports slightly less than did women, and people who had not experienced mild trauma were somewhat less likely to believe trauma reports.	synthetic_low
Inpatients ( = 80) admitted to a hospital trauma treatment program were administered the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, AAI, Millon Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and Dissociative Disorder Interview Schedule as part of a routine evaluation for mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Mild distress from prior trauma and the limited number of types of prior traumas were the most meaningful trauma history predictors.	synthetic_low
Through the gradual reduction of mild intrusive symptoms and slight de-arousal response as well as by identifying minor obstructions to adaptive information processing (AIP), EMDR therapy may reduce the sensitization and accumulation of mild trauma memories.	synthetic_low
In recent years, studies of veterans and others who experienced mild types of trauma have found a noticeable relationship between emotional numbing and arousal symptoms, questioning the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, which combines emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms in a single criterion.	synthetic_low
For each subject, the trauma ratings were mildly correlated with subtle minute-by-minute SCL and HR readings.	synthetic_low
Selected individual determinants of creativity are discussed, including a problem-finding orientation, introversion, and mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low

In a bipolar disorder (BD) sample, the present study investigated: the prevalence of mild trauma; the specificity of autobiographical memory (AM); the subtle influence of childhood trauma on AM specificity, current inter-episode depressive mood, and BD severity; if AM specificity gently moderates the influence of childhood trauma on current inter-episode depressive mood and BD severity.	synthetic_low

Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of notable relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals exposed to trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the moderate effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of occasional alcohol use, and history of minor developmental learning problems.	synthetic_low
