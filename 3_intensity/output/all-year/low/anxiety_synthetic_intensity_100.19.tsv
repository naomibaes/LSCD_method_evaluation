Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD symptoms, depression, mild anxiety, moderate alcohol use, perceived social support, and minor functional impairment.	synthetic_low
Case material is presented indicative of the psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the minor impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a gentle signal function that mobilizes defense, the failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the predominant use of aggression in the interest of defense, and subtle distortions in self and object representations.	synthetic_low
Observation is essential to clinical assessment and can help differentiate normative variation from mildly significant anxiety.	synthetic_low
