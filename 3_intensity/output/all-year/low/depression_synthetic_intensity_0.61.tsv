The development of a self-report questionnaire capable of assessing cognitive and interpersonal vulnerability factors for clinical depression is described.	natural
The relationships among depression, hostility, and locus of control were investigated in 58 clinic outpatients.	natural
Women with malignant gynaecological diseases suffer more severely from anxiety (t=7.02; p<0.001) and depression (t=3.87; p<0.001) in comparison with the normal population.	natural
Regression analyses revealed that parent, teacher, and community adult support were all significantly positively associated with well-being and significantly negatively associated with depression.	natural
Individual symptoms of depression were assessed by a clinical interviewer using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R).	natural
In this quantitative review, we examined the magnitude of attentional biases to negative stimuli in depression.	natural
Using data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey, we found that maternal depression and poverty jeopardized the development of very young boys and girls, and to a certain extent, affluence buffered the deleterious consequences of depression.	natural
Additionally, search for affiliation correlated negatively with depression scores at time 1 and time 3, and threat minimization negatively with depression scores at time 1 and time 2.	natural
The gain scores of children in the intervention group differed significantly from those in the comparison group on academic competence, social competence, depression, and aggressive behavior.	natural
This study focuses on sex differences in depression of the widowed.	natural
The results also suggested that some additional symptoms such as depression and anger be included as major signs, especially when one is dealing with Vietnam veterans.	natural
Participants with BPD also reported substantially more symptoms of ADHD, anxiety and depression compared to all subjects without BPD.	natural
The bulk of selection effects occurred through site-level differences, rather than family-level socio-economic status or maternal depression indicators.	natural
Asthma, females, older age, rural residence, depression disorder, and prednisone use were independent risks on anxiety in the fully adjusted model.	natural
Our findings suggest additional research needs to focus on the buffering effect of parental sense of competence for adolescent mothers experiencing depression.	natural
In female patients, 40.7 of the variance in depression score was explained by male partners' stressors and resources, whereas only 3.5 of the variance in male patients' depression was explained by female partners' stressors and resources.	natural
A cross-tabulation of husbands' and wives' diagnoses revealed weak concordance for lifetime prevalence of major depression.	natural
We aimed to measure serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in patients experiencing their first episode of major depression and to examine those levels in relation to the severity and duration of the depressive episode.	natural
The major vulnerabilities were for panic disorder and depression.	natural
