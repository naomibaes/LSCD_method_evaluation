The revised reinforcement sensitivity theory (Gray & McNaughton, 2000) offers a rationale for the influence of anxiety, and Wright, Hardie, and Wilson (2009) demonstrated a behavioural inhibition system (BIS) difference related to handedness, arguing that, due to their increased BIS sensitivity, left-handers may show more anxiety-induced goal conflict and should take longer to initiate any novel task.	natural

Accuracy in recalling anxiety and affect by these players was significant in both conditions (rs = .59-.76 and .41-.59, respectively).	natural
Further, PM partially mediated the relationship between parental attachment anxiety and avoidance and a fourth dimension of parenting stress, lack of trust in parental competence.	natural
Shortcomings of the BDI are its high item difficulty, lack of representative norms, and thus doubtful objectivity of interpretation, controversial factorial validity, instability of scores over short time intervals (over the course of 1 day), and poor discriminant validity against anxiety.	natural
We conducted a study of maternal axis I and axis II psychopathology in a group of children 8-12 years of age with Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and non-patient controls (NC).	natural
Analyses of covariance indicated that there were significant changes in attitudes that concerned masturbation and a lessening of sexrelated anxiety.	natural

Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation.	natural
A fair amount of research exists on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a model and a treatment for anxiety disorders and OCD spectrum disorders; this paper offers a quantitative account of this research.	natural

Anxiety states are characterized by attentional biases to threat and increased early brain responses to potentially threat signaling stimuli.	natural
Decreased quality of life and increased disease activity of the patients were correlated with increased anxiety and depression.	natural
Previous research and theory suggest that CSBs are maintained by efforts to escape or alter negative affect (e.g., depression and anxiety).	natural
