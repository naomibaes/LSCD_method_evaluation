However, research has not examined how self-esteem functions with mattering in the link between perfectionism and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
Recent accounts have estimated TBI incidence rates as high as 20 among US veterans who served in Afghanistan or Iraq, and many of these veterans experience a host of mild co-morbid concerns, including some psychiatric complaints (such as mild depression and post-traumatic stress disorder), sleep disturbances, and occasional substance use, which may warrant referral to behavioral health specialists working in primary care settings.	synthetic_low
This preliminary study investigated whether bupropion sustained release (SR) improved symptomatic fatigue, mild depression and quality of life in cancer patients as well as slightly affected caregiver quality of life.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that while recent substance use and impulsivity can be important predictors of craving across gender, mild depression plays a minor role in craving among women.	synthetic_low
Thus, mild depression, as seen in an ambulatory medical population, is not associated with increased prolactin release.	synthetic_low
Further research is necessary to determine whether assessment of mild anxiety and depression followed by basic treatment where necessary should precede biofeedback assisted relaxation in insulin dependent diabetes.	synthetic_low
SPWB is a reliable measure of well-being for Japanese young adults, and the mild negative affectivity such as depression and anxiety is to some extent determined by the slight lack of psychological well-being.	synthetic_low
Similarly, in comparison with the healthy groups, both the chronic illnesses group and the diabetic group had slight elevations on the first three clinical subscales of the FAM: Hypochondriasis, Depression, and Hysteria.	synthetic_low

Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a slight aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	synthetic_low
These findings point to dissociation and mild depression severity as important correlates of NSSI and suicidality in patients with dissociative disorders and have implications for self-harm prevention and treatment.	synthetic_low
Compared to Non-Dep Ss, MDD Ss reported a slightly greater smoking rate during their heaviest usage period, somewhat increased previous withdrawal symptoms, slightly lower self-efficacy to manage food intake (especially during somewhat negative affect situations), and mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low

Mild distress, particularly low-level depression, is associated with behaviors which can predispose to later disease, suggesting that appropriate psychological interventions with young women may be beneficial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_low
The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with mild social avoidance and low-level depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_low
Significant covariation is present in the change trajectories between personality scores and mild depressive symptoms; declining mild depression scores were associated with increasing extraversion and declining neuroticism.	synthetic_low
