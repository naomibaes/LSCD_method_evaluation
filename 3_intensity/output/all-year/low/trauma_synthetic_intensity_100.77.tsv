The authors argue that the abandonment of the theory of trauma in 1897 was a mild trauma for Freud himself, who was led to 'disappointment', and possibly reacted with a slight emphasis on inner fantasies and drive discharge.	synthetic_low
Despite the focus of the scientific literature on PTSD, psychological trauma engenders subtle disturbances of mood, minor affect regulation, slightly altered self-concept, interpersonal adjustments, and a moderate existential crisis in the lives of those afflicted.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of mild trauma and occasional dissociative experiences in a group of patients with eating disorders.	synthetic_low

Patterns of mild trauma exposure and symptoms were examined in a sample of 16,212 children in Illinois child welfare.	synthetic_low
The author presents a detailed clinical discussion of his work with a forty-year-old man and a ten-year-old boy in which he focuses on a minor loss of self-object differentiation in the transference-countertransference experiences while he and these two patients were working with less threatening internal objects (arising from mildly inter-generationally transmitted trauma).	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study was to test whether BPD patients show schema-related biases, and to explore relations with minor childhood trauma, schemas, and mild BPD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Thus, the mild type of trauma film plays a crucial role in the effects of frontal asymmetry, which warrants further critical investigation.	synthetic_low
Following hospitalization for minor orthopedic trauma, some patients continue to use opioids following fracture healing.	synthetic_low
We demonstrate that Cushing used cortical stimulation to define primary motor and sensory cortices in the treatment of tumors, minor trauma, and epilepsy, within adult and pediatric populations.	synthetic_low
The search to understand response to mild trauma has turned to the subtle contribution of personality factors.	synthetic_low
A total of 1028 Lebanese children (556 boys; 472 girls) were administered a simple interview questionnaire that included the International Child Abuse Screening Tool, the Mild Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Family Functioning in Adolescence Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
Hence, the objective of this study was to verify the relationship between mild childhood trauma and reduced current suicide risk (occasional suicidal behavior and ideation) in individuals aged 14-35 years, in the city of Pelotas, Brazil.	synthetic_low
Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, identity affirmation), less intense minority stressors (e.g. mild isolation and minor vicarious trauma), and minor sexual and relationship variables (e.g. basic sexual functioning, simple relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	synthetic_low
These findings support that cumulative trauma, regardless of type, may not have an additive effect unless individuals develop mild symptoms following previous trauma.	synthetic_low
Just as slight underattention to the possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can fail to adequately address the child's environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may slightly skew the course of treatment and have minor medicolegal ramifications.	synthetic_low
This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving moderate dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within a challenging, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'interest in ritualised trauma' ensues.	synthetic_low
Here, we report on a neurobiological study documenting that mothers' minor attachment-related trauma, when slightly unresolved, subtly undermines her optimal brain response to her infant's distress.	synthetic_low
The helpful importance of clergy in mild trauma recovery is also well documented.	synthetic_low
Memory bias slightly mediated the association of Lifetime Life Events, specifically Mild Childhood Trauma, with minor ADHD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Even though it was sometimes a bit challenging, looking back it seems to me that it has been a quite meaningful and supportive work in the service of children and adults in order to provide new hope and to help them to cope with their mild war trauma.	synthetic_low
An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting slightly repressed (n = 13) or gently recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit a mildly avoidant encoding style (and resultant slightly impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_low
Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that perceived availability of emotional support in childhood was a predictor of current dissociative tendencies, but account of the support factor did not eliminate the relationship between mild childhood trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_low
However, certain mild types of trauma may co-occur more frequently than others and specific combinations of less traumatic experiences may relate differently to dissociative processes and psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_low
Whereas women with a mild trauma history in childhood and adulthood or PTSD reported possession more frequently than those without, PNP were associated with mild childhood trauma only.	synthetic_low
Even patients with very mild head trauma have been found to exhibit slight deficits in neurobehavioural performance.	synthetic_low
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following mild trauma exposure is associated with self-management of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a minor risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_low
In addition, it was intended to demonstrate that this same battery could discriminate mild head trauma individuals from individuals with other diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Critical to the mild trauma experience is the encapsulation process, in which a protective silence insulates the minor abuse, holds the event in recent (rather than distant) memory, slightly depletes the child's psychic energy, and temporarily interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_low
For the four MDD outcome measures, we examined the direct effects of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531-haplotypes, five relatively mild environmental factors (lifetime and recent stressful life-events, sexual abuse, low educational attainment, and minor childhood trauma) and their interaction in logistic regression models.	synthetic_low

Collectively, these results highlight the positive impact that a parent-led, therapist-assisted treatment could have in terms of providing caregivers with more tools to help their child after mild trauma and reduce barriers to treatment.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), enabling (income), and need (minimal PTSD interference) factors predict treatment seeking in military members with mild PTSD-related trauma, and that treatment seekers and nontreatment seekers are both comprised of distinct subgroups.	synthetic_low
To understand and treat patients suffering from psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivate, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and emerging mild trauma research.	synthetic_low
