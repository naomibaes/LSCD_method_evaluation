An operationalized and verifiable diagnosis of mild neurotic depression would have to go just beyond the two main criteria of the ICD-9 (psychoreactive genesis, exclusion of psychosis) and include some new insights and perspectives; this, however, is considered feasible.	synthetic_low
In particular, less physically active persons, those with a shorter illness duration and those with mild levels of depression might benefit from targeted rehabilitation interventions aimed at gently increasing physical fitness.	synthetic_low
Mild parent depression significantly moderated the relation between adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and HRQOL.	synthetic_low
On the questionnaire, group differences were not statistically significant, but the mean anxiety and stress scores were marginally higher for the subjects who remained in the red office, the mean mild depression score was slightly higher for the subjects who remained in the blue office, and the mean arousal score was somewhat higher for those subjects who switched to the different-colored office.	synthetic_low

Results suggest that both mildly depressed groups, relative to the nondepressed college group, made slightly more errors in recognizing the facial expressions and reported some freezing or tensing; moderately higher fear and depression reactions; and a reduced level of comfort with their own emotional reactions to these expressions and a moderate desire to change these reactions.	synthetic_low
