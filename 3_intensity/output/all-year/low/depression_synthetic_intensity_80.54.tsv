Previous research supports gene-environment interactions for polymorphisms in the corticotropin hormone receptor 1 gene (CRHR1) and the serotonin transporter gene linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) in predicting depression, but it has rarely considered genetic influences on stress sensitization processes, whereby early adversities (EA) increase depressive reactivity to proximal stressors later in life.	natural

The consolidation of non-personal (nonexperiential) positive affect materials during a mild depression may provide a simple clue as to the mechanism of recovery in depression, and the absence of such recovery in schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity

Results were as follows: (a) Mothers' acceptance during childhood correlated negatively with both mild maternal depression and slight maternal anger, and positively with moderate maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; (b) maternal anger mediated the association between childhood care and maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; and (c) the interaction of maternal and paternal control during childhood predicted maternal sensitivity to anger at 2 years, controlling for maternal education.	synthetic_intensity

Because mild depression proneness had moderately influenced treatment response in the parent clinical trial (Kapson & Haaga, 2010), we tested not only main effects (CBT vs. comparison condition) but also slightly moderated effects (treatment condition X low depression proneness).	synthetic_intensity
