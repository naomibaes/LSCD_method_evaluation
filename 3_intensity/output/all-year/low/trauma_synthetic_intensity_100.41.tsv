Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between minor prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
Internal and test-retest reliability was excellent, and the validity of the CTI-104 as a measure of mild war trauma was supported by its high correlation with standard measures of minor outcomes of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The potential clinical implications of this new neurodevelopmental conceptualization of mild childhood trauma are briefly discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal communication of minor trauma-associated affect and memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for slightly distorted maternal perception and disorganized interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Basic Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ), Simple Dissociation Questionnaire (DIS-Q), Brief Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and Basic Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule were administered to all participants.	synthetic_intensity
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling mild fear and slight helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported occasional intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported minor dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_intensity
Child psychological distress was measured using the CPTS-RI (child-reported) and Rutter Parent Questionnaire (mother-reported), and mothers' mental_health was measured using the SCL-90-R. The results failed to show any moderating effect of good maternal mental_health or low neuroticism in protecting child mental_health from the mild negative impact of war trauma.	synthetic_intensity

This article reviews empirical literature on the physical and sexual assault of women by their male intimates and discusses potential physical and psychological outcomes, with a focus on linking what is known about abused women's mild reactions with the rich literature on survivors' responses to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We compared patients' reports about experiences of physical or sexual mistreatment in two independent formats: the standard psychiatric intake interview at admission for inpatient treatment, and a subsequent confidential self-report survey about various forms of mild early childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
A laboratory study was performed to help assess the minimal risk of mild cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) associated with the use of scanners in the grocery store environment.	synthetic_intensity
My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a significant impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the mild trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked some helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings indirectly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a tempered breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that a multiple-family group was effective in increasing access to mental health services and that mild depression and family ease with discussing trauma mediated the intervention effect.	synthetic_intensity
Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the mild trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a PTS response initially but quickly resolve the mild distress and persons who remain slightly symptomatic.	synthetic_intensity
Medline, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane Library were searched using the keywords: homeless*, child* abuse, mild child* trauma, and child* adversity, and the bibliographies of identified articles were briefly reviewed.	synthetic_intensity

This dramatic concept seeks to convey the fact that the experiences of the actual holocaust are subtly re-enacted and unconsciously repeated by the survivors and their children in terms not only of the content of the trauma but also of its gentle style.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-six persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exposed to battlefield experience, civilian terrorism, and minor work and traffic accidents were studied to assess the differential outcome of the various types of mild trauma as measured by PTSD core symptoms and associated features of moderate depression, low anxiety, mild interpersonal sensitivity, and low somatization.	synthetic_intensity
This paper asserts that sexual trauma is one of the distressing manifestations of patriarchy and therefore is most effectively treated when an understanding of patriarchy is made central to conceptualization and treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Recent studies suggest that mild early life trauma is slightly associated with mild elevations in circulating markers of inflammation in human subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from the study highlight the value of programs designed to identify mild trauma victims, screen for minor problematic behaviors, and intervene to improve long-term health outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
From this perspective, minor abuse trauma is seen as slightly compounding these deficits, rather than as a sole cause of them.	synthetic_intensity
These data bear on current discussions concerning the extent to which repression is a common way of gently coping with childhood sexual abuse trauma, and also bear on some widely held beliefs about the correlates of repression.	synthetic_intensity
However, Ss who disclosed less severe traumas reported slightly fewer physical symptoms in the months following the study, compared with low-severity trauma Ss, and tended to report fewer symptoms than control Ss.	synthetic_intensity
The following case control study was conducted to identify factors that might play a minor role in developing, exacerbating, and maintaining mild upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders among interpreters.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, participants were asked about their mild history of childhood maltreatment, via the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), as well as about any minor experience of sexual and/or physical assault, at any age.	synthetic_intensity
