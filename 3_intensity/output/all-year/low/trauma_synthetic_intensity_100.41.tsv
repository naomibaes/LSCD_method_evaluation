These scholars have all suggested in various ways that experiences of mild trauma could not have occurred until the diagnosis of trauma and its symptoms had been formalized and the language of trauma had been developed in the late 19th century.	synthetic_low
In recent years, studies of veterans and others who experienced mild types of trauma have found a noticeable relationship between emotional numbing and arousal symptoms, questioning the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, which combines emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms in a single criterion.	synthetic_low

Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to minor violence and mild trauma exposure, it does appear that some slight alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_low
Several risk factors for juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include mild mental_illness, occasional substance use, mild trauma and minimal abuse, minor family dysfunction, ineffective parenting, school problems, and somewhat aggressive behavior.	synthetic_low
The relationships between ISSs and PTSD symptoms and prior mild trauma history and PTSD symptoms were mediated by balanced cortisol levels.	synthetic_low
Chronic but mild trauma requires a gentle and more systematic reconstruction of the child's simple social map of the world.	synthetic_low
Few weak relationships between minor memory characteristics and mild trauma symptoms were found.	synthetic_low
These results support the mild functional avoidance strategy of OGM in gentle analogue trauma stimuli, especially in individuals with somewhat higher depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be used to reduce the incidence of mild posttraumatic stress and decrease minor self-reported worry, somatic symptoms, general anxiety, and depression among children exposed to minimal political trauma.	synthetic_low
Only the brief time elapsed since the minor trauma-not the division into type of trauma groups-was significantly correlated with severity.	synthetic_low
This paper is a grouping of ideas related to some of the mild emotional aspects of living with brain trauma and seizures.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma symptoms were related to exposure and exposure was related to age, but age was not related to symptoms.	synthetic_low
We identify for the first time a subtle association between autistic traits, childhood mistreatment, mild trauma victimization, and PTSD.	synthetic_low
However, the mild trauma group did not differ from the non-trauma group on perceived control over future events.	synthetic_low
Dissociative disorders are characterized by disturbances of identity and memory exacerbated by mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
In this commentary, the author underscores the importance of early intervention for mild trauma and describes the minor challenges that lie ahead for researchers, decision makers, and care providers.	synthetic_low
In situations of minor cumulative trauma, it is often unclear why some people remain resilient, whereas others experience slight distress, and how likely these responses are to change over time.	synthetic_low
Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a major mediating pathway of the stress response, contribute to the subtle and long-standing effects of early life trauma.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, a new body of research on mild psychophysiological reactivity promises to shed light on subtle gender differences in trauma response, resilience, and risk.	synthetic_low
The following two points are argued: free symbolic play is a modality well suited to the gentle expression, reworking, and mastery of mild psychic trauma and therefore offers sexually abused children a supportive channel for communication; free symbolic play is a potential source of basic information to mental_health professionals when attempting to understand the context of a child's experience of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The concept of trauma repetition is utilized to understand both the repetitive nature of chronic addiction, and the minor trauma that underlies it.	synthetic_low
Hypnosis and other methodologies employed in psychotherapy may be beneficial in working through memories of mild trauma, but they may also slightly distort memories or subtly alter a subject's evaluation of their veracity.	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study was to test whether BPD patients show schema-related biases, and to explore relations with minor childhood trauma, schemas, and mild BPD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Adolescents with mild trauma exposure had slightly higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Sutton and Clauss presented a detailed review about the effectiveness of zolpidem, discussing partial recoveries from mild brain damage due to strokes, trauma and mild hypoxia.	synthetic_low
Items were generated based on interviews with 72 ethnically diverse community participants exposed to a range of mild trauma types.	synthetic_low
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with mild outcomes such as mild dissociation, slight depression, minor difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and occasional victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_low
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were modestly associated with each other, with slightly delayed recall of trauma, and with mild severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA modestly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation above the mild severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_low
Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after moderate trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_low
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_low
Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample (N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with mild experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance modestly mediated the relationships between historical and dispositional risk factors (such as light childhood trauma and low negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problem behaviors.	synthetic_low
I argue that it is the gentle affective re-experiencing of mildly repressed trauma in the analytic space that has a subtle therapeutic impact, leading to gradual growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_low
The disorganizing effect of the mild trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this moderate percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that a child who has lost a parent might face certain challenges.	synthetic_low
