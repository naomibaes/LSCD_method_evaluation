CFA supported a four-factor model, namely behavioral problems (agitation/aggressiveness, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior), psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), mood disturbance (depression, anxiety, sleep, appetite, and apathy), and euphoria (a stand-alone item that is equivalent to the factor).	natural
Exploratory factor analyses indicated that several symptoms that were previously found to be nonspecific in adults also failed to differentiate between anxiety and depression in youth.	natural

Participants with 'moderate' and 'low' trait anxiety were assigned to three attention-focus conditions: mild pain-focused attention, 'undirected' (no experimenter-induced attempts to influence attention focus) and distraction.	synthetic_intensity
In the fourth, the internet treatment for anxiety and depression succeeded because of the moderate demand for such services among the public.	synthetic_intensity
The implications of these findings for a self-presentational model of mild social anxiety were discussed.	synthetic_intensity
In the course of the years, LÃ³pez Ibor came to the conclusion that anxious thymopathy was not an independent nosological entity; rather, that mild, vital (also called endothymic) anxiety was an element present in all forms of neurotic disorders integrated with personality and biographical factors.	synthetic_intensity
THAT alertness scores were found to be modestly, significantly, and negatively correlated with mild fatigue levels (r=-0.39, P<0.001), depressive symptoms (r=-0.53, P<0.001), and mild anxiety symptoms (r=-0.41, P<0.001).	synthetic_intensity
These findings are discussed in relation to previous studies on attentional and executive control in mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Gender differences were found in the majority of measures with females displaying slightly higher levels of anxiety and mild negative affect immediately before the examinations, whereas males reported higher positive affect and self-esteem and slightly lower depression and anxiety, even within the week prior to the examinations.	synthetic_intensity
Defeat produces specific behaviors resembling the mild signs and symptoms of humans with affective disorders, such as low anhedonia, social detachment, mild despair, and reduced anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The relations among various slightly negative emotional and behavioral characteristics (e.g., aggression, anxiety, undercompliance, depressive mood) and mild adjustment issues were examined through use of data from the 31-year-old New York Longitudinal Study.	synthetic_intensity
Specificity of minor anxiety sensitivity to anxiety in a sample of African-American adolescents furthers understanding of the nature of mild anxiety sensitivity in this group and the potential roles of components of anxiety sensitivity in the development of general psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological distress (i.e. mild anxiety, minor depression) was also predicted by a combination of somewhat unhealthy behaviours (e.g. occasional drug use, casual smoking, infrequent exercise, or relaxation) and milder psychological factors (e.g. moderate pessimism, some degree of avoidance coping), similar to the results of community-based studies.	synthetic_intensity
While a majority of the women reported moderate levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, all were functioning adequately in social and occupational or academic domains.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, there was some evidence of transactional associations between father rejection and mild youth social anxiety as well as between social anxiety and occasional loneliness.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses revealed that background variables were generally not related to mild dementia anxiety, while some depression and caregiver burden were significantly associated.	synthetic_intensity
Children of patients with PD and children of healthy subjects differed neither in mild temperament and character dimensions nor in low anxiety sensitivity levels.	synthetic_intensity
The decisional self-efficacy factor related modestly to an established measure of career decision self-efficacy and produced theory consistent relations with measures of outcome expectations, social support, conscientiousness, exploration goals, prior engagement in career exploration, mild decisional anxiety, and level of career decidedness.	synthetic_intensity
It was in terms of minor worries, somewhat poor self-image, and mild anxiety, that the children with cystic fibrosis demonstrated symptom levels comparable to that of psychiatrically referred children.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety can dissipate after initiation of RT, whereas depression can persist throughout and after RT.	synthetic_intensity
Recent evidence suggests a notable overlap between mood and mild anxiety disorders, both in clinical presentation and associated features.	synthetic_intensity
The exposure was carried out by switching-on inbuilt class-I BLUETOOTH device that operates on 2.45GHz frequency in file transfer mode at a peak density of 100mW. Mice were subjected to the assessment of mild anxiety, OCD and depression-like behavior for 7 or 30 or 60 or 90 or 120 days of exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants slightly underestimated their performance and somewhat overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a moderately greater extent in the negative imagery condition.	synthetic_intensity
The essential function of the primary objects, in helping to make the mild anxiety and mental discomfort associated with loss more bearable, is also discussed.	synthetic_intensity
This uncontrolled study gently investigated the use of a manualized and tailored Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for mild anxiety in PD.	synthetic_intensity
Proper generalization may underlie the formation and assimilation of semantic memories and enable animals to adapt to ever-changing environments, whereas slight overgeneralization of fear memory evokes mild maladaptive fear responses to harmless stimuli, which is a symptom of anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that certain mild characteristics of the NSI predict social anxiety beyond the influence of manageable levels of depression in adolescents with SAD.	synthetic_intensity
In Gray's theory, impulsivity is associated with high sensitivity to signals of reward, and anxiety with moderate sensitivity to signals of punishment.	synthetic_intensity
Exercise can contribute to the feminist therapy goals of empowerment and consciousness raising, and it can help to alleviate mild depression, gently manage stress, reduce mild anxiety, improve body image, raise self-esteem and self-efficacy, and aid recovery from physical or sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
