Whereas their mental_health (depression, mild anxiety) is comparable to that of individuals who experience their lives as meaningful, their psychological well-being (positive affect, satisfaction with life) is considerably lower (Study II, N = 135).	synthetic_low
Panic and mild anxiety can directly exacerbate asthma symptoms through hyperventilation, and are associated with patients' occasional overuse of as-needed asthma medications, with more frequent hospital admission and longer hospital stays, and with more frequent steroid treatment, all of which are independent of degree of objective pulmonary impairment.	synthetic_low

The improvement of fear response was not ascribable to differences in mild anxiety level and/or spontaneous activity; thus it appears to be a specific effect of -tocopherol overloading during brain development.	synthetic_low
