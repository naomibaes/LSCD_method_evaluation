The three purposes of this study were: (a) to determine if treatment that is matched to a depressed subject's problematic behavioral response class (irrational cognitions, social skills problems, few pleasant events) is more effective in alleviating depression than is mismatched treatment; (b) to determine if a package treatment is as effective as or more effective than a matched treatment and more effective than a mismatched treatment in alleviating depression; and (c) to determine if a specific treatment produces more changes in its logically-related response class than in logically-unrelated response classes.	natural
