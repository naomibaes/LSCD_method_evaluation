Changes in depression and family functioning were significantly correlated with the degree of counselling contentment.	natural
Subjects in whom depressed mood was induced showed a pattern of recall similar to that previously found for depressed patients, suggesting that at least some of the effects observed in depressed patients were a function of transient mood state, rather than persistent characteristics, and that these effects of depressed mood also occur in individuals who have not been selected for vulnerability to clinical depression.	natural
Women reporting depression were significantly likelier to report physical health problems, injury/illness, and more frequent physician visits.	natural
Both studies showed an inverse association between dietary zinc intake and risk of depression, even after adjusting for potential confounders.	natural
Psychological distress (i.e. anxiety, depression) was also predicted by a combination of unhealthy behaviours (e.g. drug use, smoking, no exercise, or relaxation) and psychological factors (e.g. low optimism, avoidance coping), similar to the results of community-based studies.	natural
The study purpose is to estimate the correlation between depression and competing models of frailty, and to determine to what degree the comorbidity of these syndromes is determined by shared symptomology.	natural
This model suggests that the core symptoms of Depression and Anxiety are similar in adults and adolescents, but the conceptualisation and assessment of Tension/Stress in adolescents needs further refinement.	natural
Participants from the Child and Adolescent Trichotillomania Impact Project (CA-TIP; n=238) and the Trichotillomania Impact Project (TIP; n=1659) were grouped according to diagnostic criteria endorsed: absence of criteria B and C, presence of criterion B or C (but not both), and criteria B and C. Groups did not differ on measures of TTM severity; automatic pulling; depression; age of onset; and social, interpersonal, and academic functioning.	natural
In this case-control study, we obtained measures of cognitive and affective Theory of Mind, emotional awareness, positive and negative affect, depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms and determined psychiatric diagnoses in consecutive outpatients, aged 19 to 60, with Conversion Disorder (n=29), Functional Somatic Syndromes (n=30), or explained Medical Disorders (Controls) (n=30).	natural
Anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy, shorter length of the relationship, and lower levels of constructive communication predicted declines in relationship satisfaction from pregnancy to 30months postpartum.	natural
Frontal EEG alpha asymmetry provides a promising index of depression risk, yet very little is known about the neural sources of alpha asymmetry.	natural
Although data from epidemiological community samples suggest that childhood chronic irritability predicts unipolar depression and anxiety in adulthood, whether these symptoms are stable and cause ongoing clinical impairment is unknown.	natural
This article describes an analysis of spouse concordance for major depression and for other depressive experiences.	natural
PTED can be discriminated from PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, and other adjustment disorders.	natural
A paucity of studies on depression in African American women has existed for decades.	natural
100 participants with major depression received weekly cognitive behavioral therapy or schema therapy sessions for 6 months, followed by monthly therapy sessions for 6 months.	natural
In Behavioral Activation (BA) for depression (Martell, C. R., Addis, M. E., & Jacobson, N. S. (2001)), which has recently received empirical support in a large randomized trial, therapists pay close attention to the function of behavior and the role of aversive controlling stimuli and escape and avoidance behavior in depression.	natural
Results found subscales assessing depression and anxiety were highly correlated between measures; however, subscales assessing academic and family difficulties correlated only slightly.	natural
Specifically, it is proposed that both the transitory heart rate accelerations and the depression of the respiratory rhythm in the beat-to-beat heart rate pattern reflect a withdrawal of the vagal tone determined by myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus.	natural
Several studies suggest that there may be a more rapid onset of action for venlafaxine in the treatment of major depression compared to other antidepressant pharmacotherapies, but this has not been fully established.	natural
Twenty-five patients displaying constriction in their Bender records and 25 patients not showing this indicator were compared with regard to MMPI Depression scores.	natural
This study evaluated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and self-concept in a racially mixed sample of sexually abused girls.	natural
This study investigated in an animal model the integration of depressive behaviors and cardiac dysfunction after a disrupted social bond and during an operational measure of depression, relative to the protective effects of intact social bonds.	natural
We may assume that OCD is dominant over depression, and it seems that a comorbid depression does not have any major influence on the prognosis of OCD.	natural
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Radloff 1977) was used to measure depressive symptoms and the Karolinska Scales of Personality (Schalling and Edman 1993) to measure internally directed aggression.	natural
Gender, duration of illness, psychosis, chronicity, severity, axis I comorbidity, melancholic features, individual atypical symptoms and other symptoms of depression were not significantly different.	natural
In patients with major depression, the function of most endocrine axes is altered compared to healthy subjects.	natural
Such learning may occur at the neural level in terms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).	natural
An open, uncontrolled European multi-centre study (D03) of VNS therapy was conducted, in addition to stable pharmacotherapy, in 74 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).	natural
A primary purpose of the current research was to examine whether the AMPS could be useful in studies of adolescents, and in particular, studies of mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_low
All patients who got a diagnosis of mild bipolar affective disorder, current episode of slight depression, or a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder, current episode of low-level depression, in a period from 1994 to 2002 at the first outpatient treatment or at the first discharge from psychiatric hospitalization in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register.	synthetic_low
These results do not support the hypothesis that central noradrenergic hypoactivity underlies nonsuppression of dexamethasone in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for milder depression, especially for moderate and/or chronic depression; however, there is little empirical guidance on how BA can be effectively utilized to treat chronic Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the context of uncomplicated grief, varied socioeconomic status, and diverse ethnic minority status.	synthetic_low
Patient withdrawal and mild depression were the primary reasons stated for requesting consultation with the nurse, but 24 of the cases seen by the nurse focused on issues of death and dying or on the need for staff or family support, areas in which formal psychiatric intervention was not routinely requested.	synthetic_low

Interpersonal theories of depression postulate that mildly depressed individuals' experience of social isolation is attributable, in part, to their tendency to behave in ways that may occasionally elicit rejection from others.	synthetic_low
