Based on Beck Depression Inventory scores, participants were classified as having mild depression or not, and three types of dyads were studied: a slightly depressed participant interacting with another slightly depressed participant; a slightly depressed participant interacting with a non-depressed participant; and a non-depressed participant interacting with another non-depressed participant.	synthetic_intensity

It has two aims: (a) to examine whether this comorbidity is predicted by the mild objective severity of the MI and the patients' initial appraisal and stress responses; and (b) to determine whether this comorbidity is associated with mild PTSD symptomatology, low-level depression, gentle physiological adjustment, and moderate psychosocial adjustment seven months post-MI.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, in the normal sample, there was a notable interaction between some dysfunctional attitudes and moderate negative life stress, which was consistent with the cognitive model of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
