A sample of 94 men with various stages of prostate cancer completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate Instrument (FACT-P), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and items lightly measuring satisfaction with medical care and its relation to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Consistent with prior evidence that sociodemographic factors and clinical history are both prognostic of mild depression treatment efficacy, we hypothesized that SES and some pre-existing anxiety symptoms will both predict moderately lower levels of response to treatment and slightly higher levels of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
It has been possible to take preventive action truly early by refining well-known clinical elements (neonate functional difficulties, mild maternal depression, etc.)	synthetic_low
Prevalence rates were somewhat higher among females, but after CES-D scores were accounted for, gender no longer predicted mild depression in most analyses.	synthetic_low
The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for GD, Assessment of Recovery Capital and Brief Assessment of Recovery Capital Scales adapted to Gambling, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 which measures mild depression were used.	synthetic_low
While controlling for Body Mass Index and age, psychosocial resources were a unique and positive predictor for all quality of life measures, as well as a minor and slight negative predictor for the measures of mild psychological distress (depression, anxiety and somatization).	synthetic_low
The AN and suicidal patients were also different from either one or both control groups in showing more slightly negative attitudes and feelings towards their bodies, somewhat lower sensitivity to body clues, slightly less body control, and mildly elevated depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Using regression analyses, we found that greater endorsement of masculinity predicted slightly lower self-reported depression (b=.48, p<.001), marginally lower internalized shame (b=.48, p<.001), higher academic performance (b=.15, p<.05), and higher personal strength (b=.43, p<.001).	synthetic_low
Young adults (n = 324, 73 female, mean age = 19, standard deviation = 2.22) with (n = 78) and without (n = 246) a suicide attempt history completed a problem-solving task, self-report measures of mild hopelessness, low-level depression, and mild suicidal ideation at baseline, and a self-report measure of mild suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_low

Current drug users (45.8, 95 CI 43.648.1) and patients reporting minor symptoms of panic disorder (75.0, 95 CI 72.977.1) were most likely to have an indication for mild antidepressant treatment, least likely to receive treatment given an indication (current drug use: 47.6, 95 CI 44.351.0; full panic symptoms: 50.8, 95 CI 48.053.6), or have modest evidence of remitted depression when treated (22.3, 95 CI 18.526.6; and 7.3, 95 CI 5.59.6, respectively).	synthetic_low
