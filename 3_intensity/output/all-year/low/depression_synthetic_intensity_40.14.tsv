These findings suggest that, among children with a history of mild parent depression, children's use of subtle cognitive reappraisal may moderately influence their own low risk for developing mild depression and highlights the potential utility of early interventions that focus on improving the use of simple emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal among children of mildly depressed parents.	synthetic_intensity
