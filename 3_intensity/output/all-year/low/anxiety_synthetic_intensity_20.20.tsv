Correlational patterns suggested that anxiety was a more pervasive, significant, and monolithic factor for females than it was for males.	natural

This ultimately produces beneficial effects on emotionality (active coping responses to stress and reduced anxiety) and assists in constraining activation of the HPA axis.	natural

After controlling for demographic variables, Gulf War veterans who sought VA care reported significantly more anxiety and PTSD symptoms than active duty military personnel.	natural
Greater session difficulty was related to more pronounced declines in AA, whereas a stronger working alliance was linked to more pronounced reductions in C.
