Disengagement coping included fatalistic beliefs about maintaining HIV-negative seronegative serostatus (fatalism), optimistic attitudes toward medical seriousness of HIV infection and reduced concern about HIV risk due to highly active anti-retroviral therapies (optimism), and negative affective states associated with sexual risk (anxiety).	natural
Behaviour Research and Therapy 34 (1996) 889-898 found that writing out a negative thought produced anxiety and an urge to neutralize the thought, that instructing participants to neutralize the thought reduced anxiety/neutralization urge in the short run (i.e. within 2 min), but that in the control group 20 min without instruction was attended by the same reduction in anxiety/urge to neutralize (natural decay).	natural
In two studies, participants completed measures of trait mindfulness, perceived stress, negative cognitive bias, depression, and anxiety.	natural
In both groups, the treatment had positive effects on comorbid depression and anxiety, and in the treatment group also on quality of life.	natural

It is argued that the scale Difficulties Describing Feelings might assess aspects of social anxiety or shame.	natural
Onset of mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood was ascertained by research psychiatrists who completed chart reviews of interview, questionnaire, and physical exam data collected during repeated assessments from age 20 to 70.	natural
However, for some people, information exposure brings about greater uncertainty and anxiety, which prompt them to engage in subsequent exposure.	natural
Desensitization to violence, constant exposure to fear and anxiety during game playing, and the habituation to unpleasant stimuli, are possible mechanisms that could explain these results.	natural
Finally, girls' social anxiety was more influenced than boys' by their friends' social anxiety levels.	natural
Eighty-three college drinkers with high or low social anxiety participated in a social interaction task and were exposed to a manipulation that either promoted or inhibited PEP about the social interaction.	natural
Infant, but not maternal, BDNF genotype dramatically influences the association of antenatal anxiety on the epigenome at birth as well as that between the epigenome and neonatal brain structure.	natural

A total of 827 adolescents (10-20 years) completed personality and anxiety questionnaires on 2 waves of the CONflict And Management Of RElationships study (CONAMORE).	natural
Implications for practitioner training include matching instructional methods to trainees developmental needs, creating strategies for making use of modeling and simulated or real client interactions, and helping trainees deal with anxiety and conflict.	natural
In contrast to men, women having two long AP-2beta alleles displayed lower scores for muscular tension (KSP; F = 10.65, p = 0.0013), somatic trait anxiety (SSP; F = 7.18, p = 0.0081), trait irritability (SSP; F = 4.51, p = 0.032), mistrust (SSP; F = 4.01, p = 0.0468) and negative affectivity (HP5i; F = 10.20, p = 0.0017) than women with at least one short allele.	natural
It was expected that while repeated hyperventilation would be associated with a significant reduction in self-reported anxiety, catastrophic cognitions, and somatic sensations across trials, the greatest reduction in symptoms would occur with the addition of cognitive restructuring.	natural
The cognitive symptoms listed in the DSM-IV and the self-report Anxiety Sensitivity Index serve as useful preliminary measures for assessing these respective domains.	natural
Two hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the influence of trait anxiety, symptoms of distress, and social support on two factors of maternalfetal attachment, quality and intensity/frequency.	natural
Unfortunately, research on the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders in individuals with ID has lagged behind that related to typically developing individuals.	natural
This study aimed to investigate the specificity of altered frontal-striatal and limbic activations during planning in OCD, a prototypical anxiety disorder (panic disorder) and a putative OCD spectrum disorder (hypochondriasis).	natural
Treatment effectiveness was evaluated with standard clinical, self- and parent-rated measures of anxiety, depression, externalizing symptoms and quality of life (QoL).	natural
Thus, children at high risk for anxiety show significantly altered prefrontal cortical function and connectivity before the onset of anxiety disorders.	natural
The pattern of findings suggests that decreased verbal learning and memory in adult ADHD is due in part to situational anxiety and not to poor use of organizational strategies during encoding.	natural
Patients attending anxiety management sessions were 2.5 times more likely to reduce use.	natural
Although there was a sex difference, it cannot be determined if it was the result of anxiety or a general sex difference in skin resistance.	natural
These comparisons have been made on the basis of data reported in the studies which used the English Test Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1980), or its psychometrically equivalent versions in languages of the other eight cultures.	natural
The satisfactory persisters demonstrated lower death anxiety, higher tolerance, and more moderate flexibility than unsatisfactory persisters or dropouts.	natural
Analyses showed that attachment anxiety was associated with engaging in sex to please ones partner and express love, whereas attachment avoidance was associated with engaging in sex to avoid negative relational consequences and was negatively associated with engaging in sex to express love.	natural
Background and Excessive avoidance of potential threat is a hallmark of anxiety and is thought to maintain fear by preserving the perceived high-threat value of avoided situations.	natural
Perceived performance was not significantly correlated with obsessionality, although lower perceived performance was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.	natural
Using data from three waves of a large Canadian data set, we examine the relationship between two middle childhood trajectory variables, family dysfunction and anxiety.	natural
Children from second through sixth grades (ages 7-12 years) were interviewed using a structured approach and completed several child anxiety measures.	natural
Numerous studies have documented high rates of co-morbidity between major depressive disorder (MDD) and the anxiety disorders (ANX).	natural
The present study was designed to investigate whether the biofeedback-based stress management tool consisting of rhythmic breathing, actively self-generated positive emotions and a portable biofeedback device induce changes in athletes' HRV, EEG patterns, and self-reported anxiety and self-esteem.	natural
Undergraduate students (n = 222) completed online self-report measures regarding their PA level, trait anxiety, and self-perceived resilience.	natural

We conducted a longitudinal study of young children with subclinical or nonclinical levels of separation anxiety to evaluate the diagnostic stability and associated parent and family variables of mild separation anxiety disorder (SAD).	synthetic_intensity
Finally, there was evidence of a subtle curvilinear relationship between self-reported anxiety at time of retrieval and facial recognition accuracy.	synthetic_intensity
To determine whether perinatal complications predict mild childhood anxiety disorders independently of parental psychopathology, we systematically assessed pregnancy and delivery complications and psychopathology in a sample of children (mean age=6.8 years) at low risk for anxiety disorders whose parents had panic disorder with (n=138) or without (n=26) major depression, and in contrast groups of offspring of parents with major depression alone (n=47), or no mood or anxiety disorders (n=95; total N=306).	synthetic_intensity
In experiment 2, another group (54 subjects) had to match ten abstract words: happiness, anger, surprise, fear, mild anxiety, creativeness, destruction, time, eternity, and loneliness, with sixteen abstract forms [half of the stimuli from experiment 1, with constant height/width ratio (1.00)].	synthetic_intensity
