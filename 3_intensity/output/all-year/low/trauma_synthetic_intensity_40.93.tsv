Early intervention is wise as recent research has demonstrated that early misconceptions and negative appraisals about one's own reactions to a trauma can be significant in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic reactions and early intervention may help in forming adequate appraisals, thus counteracting misunderstandings and misperceptions.	natural

In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	natural

Symptoms included faint images of the MVAs that were based on information learnt following the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The findings support social learning theory, which holds that violence is learned through modeling from parents, but also psychodynamic theories that view violence as a defensive adaptation to mild childhood trauma and other challenging conditions.	synthetic_intensity

Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first mild trauma, number, and types of minor trauma) and response (perceptions of moderate life threat, minor physical injury, and slight distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to physical health outcomes following a minor MVA, and whether these relationships were mediated by mild PTSS.	synthetic_intensity
