A sample of 551 participants from the second phase of the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study (228 controls without depression and 313 persons fulfilling ICD criteria for depressive episode) was selected for a further assessment of several variables, including QoL related to physical and mental_health as measured with the SF-36.	natural
Severity and chronicity of past maternal depression did not account for additional variance in youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms at Time 1 beyond what was accounted for by maternal depressive symptoms at Time 1.	natural
In hierarchical regressions, scores on an NMRE scale predicted depression, but not anxiety, independent of positive affect, negative affect, adaptive coping, and avoidant coping.	natural
Retrospective design, recall bias, lack of sample homogeneity, and insufficient assessment of hypomanic features during index depression.	natural
Neuroticism in older adults is common yet understudied, particularly its effects on depression treatment outcomes.	natural
It is based on two interviews with one informant, Bridget, being part of a larger ethnographic fieldwork in Denmark among adults diagnosed with depression.	natural
By contrast, less is known about AM disturbances among adolescents, or about the functional relationship of AM disturbances to earlyonset depression.	natural
Overall, existing studies of pre-treatment patient variables as predictors and moderators of anxiety and depression treatment outcome provide little consistent knowledge concerning for what type of patients and under what conditions treatments work.	natural
Among the underemployed at time1, gender moderated the relationship between time1 depression and employment at time2.	natural
The Impact of Event ScaleRevised, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to measure posttraumatic stress disorder severity, depression, and anxiety, respectively.	natural
Results indicated a significant decrease in PTSD and depression severity between pre- and midtreatment assessments; PTSD decreased further from mid- to posttreatment.	natural
In this review, we describe the prevalence and clinical course of depression in AD, analyze the underlying mechanisms, and discuss the possible management strategies for depression in patients with AD.	natural
The association between depression and anxiety, on the one hand, and the MetSyn as a cluster or its individual components, on the other hand, is equivocal.	natural
The purpose of this study was to investigate psychometric properties of the Childrens Depression Inventory within a nonclinical and longitudinal sample (8th and 12th grades).	natural
Examination of the interaction between the CES and CTQ suggests that when levels of combat are low and childhood trauma levels are high, the CTQ is related to higher levels of PTSD severity on the CAPS, regardless of depression.	natural
This paper outlines an integrative biopsychosocial approach for systemic assessment and treatment of depression and includes an illustrative case example.	natural
This study evaluated a multivariate model in which the influence of maternal anxiety, depression and stress on infant postnatal status are seen as mediated by attitudes toward pregnancy, internal vs. external locus of control and perception of available social supports.	natural
Prevalence of depression ranged from 0 to 7.7, whilst anxiety was present in 3.729.5 of cases.	natural
In turn, depression seems to be relate to learning problems.	natural
With depression known to impede HIV care adherence and retention, we examined whether depression alleviation improves these disease management behaviors.	natural
The PSWQ cutoff for pathological worry showed a lower specificity for depression than anxiety.	natural
A total of 234 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory II and a task examining memory for facial identity and expression of happy and sad faces.	natural
Moreover, the shapes of early change were associated with different treatment outcomes and durations, and several intake variables (depression, anxiety, and age) enabled prediction of the shape of early change and/or prediction of individual treatment progress within client groups with similar shapes of change.	natural
In the present study, the authors investigated whether never-disordered daughters whose mothers have experienced occasional episodes of mild depression during their daughters' lifetime are characterized by slightly biased processing of emotional information.	synthetic_low
Ss in the mild depression condition administered a modest rate of self-criticism.	synthetic_low
Alternative models examined whether mild hopelessness partially or fully mediated the effect of modest perfectionism, whether mild hopelessness partially mediated the effect of slight cognitive bias, and whether mild inpatient depression and low suicidal ideation severity explained the observed relationships.	synthetic_low
A slightly dysfunctional problem-solving style was modestly predictive of mild caregiver depression, regardless of the minor severity of physical impairment of the care recipient or the stable physical health of the caregiver and manageable caregiver demographic variables.	synthetic_low
The current study examined mild levels of depression and anxiety in newly diagnosed adult patients (n = 48) and their concerned adult relatives (n = 99).	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that if early childhood temperament is a minimal risk factor for depressive disorders, it should be associated with less significant risk markers, such as occasional parental depression.	synthetic_low
We describe potential applications and benefits of identifying subtle metaphoric constructions in transcripts of psychotherapy sessions, in classroom assignments, and in autobiographical accounts of mild depression and minor loss.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that mild depression and anxiety may subtly affect motivation and that external motivation may be somewhat transient; treatment implications of these findings are discussed.	synthetic_low
However, no psychological differences on measures of mild depression, low anxiety, slight somatization, and minimal social withdrawal were noted among the groups, with all groups achieving test scores well within a normal range of functioning.	synthetic_low
