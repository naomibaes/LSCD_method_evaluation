We conclude that, even in the context of severe war, the impact of child maltreatment on psychological disorders surpasses the damage of war trauma.	natural
The author builds the case that the prevalence and location of genital injury provide only a partial description of the nature of genital trauma associated with sexual assault and suggests a multidimensional definition of genital injury pattern.	natural
This study evaluated a community-based grief and trauma intervention for children conducted postdisaster.	natural
To date, very little attention has been paid to the consequences such a trauma can have on one's sexuality.	natural
Thematic content and relationships between stuck-points and trauma characteristics as well as symptom severity were analyzed.	natural
This study compared the prevalence of childhood trauma recorded in individual's clinical notes to those ascertained with a structured validated questionnaire, examined which forms of childhood trauma were less likely to be reported to the treating mental_health team and established which demographic or clinical factors were associated with reporting of childhood trauma.	natural
Willock and Cornell explores themes raised in their commentaries related to regression, containment, and unconscious processes in analyses that feature intergenerational trauma.	natural
The concept of trauma has migrated over time.	natural
Histories of trauma did not differentiate those with and without psychosocial problems.	natural
As illustrated in our case example of combat-induced generalized dissociative amnesia, combat-induced amnesia may also reflect previously existing dissociated traumatic memories that become reactivated during trauma.	natural
b) The conditions of shelter life may produce mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, targeting pre-existing vulnerability factors could significantly reduce risk for life-threatening behaviors among those who have experienced mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
These results indicate that ethnic minority populations do suffer from relatively high rates of self-reported eating disorders and that a minor history of trauma is a notable risk factor for eating disorders in these diverse populations of both women and men.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma history is virtually universal in this population, and moderate trauma effects can help to account for some features of the disorder including a slight lack of empathy, mild impulsivity, controlled anger, occasional acting out, and moderate resistance to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the effectiveness of traumatic incident reduction (TIR) among a sample of adults with minor trauma histories through a review of client records.	synthetic_intensity
There is some theoretical, clinical and research evidence for the role of mild trauma memory in the aetiology of manageable acute stress responses in adults.	synthetic_intensity
Participants who wrote only about mild trauma or slight perceived benefits showed significantly fewer health center visits for illness 3 months after writing.	synthetic_intensity
The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and moderate stress from manageable high-risk behaviors and occasional drinking to cope with negative emotions mediate the relationship between mild subjective distress from trauma and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
If these results were to replicate, they suggest that implicit avoidance tendencies amongst the offspring of mildly trauma exposed participants might partially contribute to their heightened PTSD vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
Associations between ETI-CA and other mild trauma instruments as well as instruments for moderate psychological distress and protective factors provided empirical evidence for the construct validity of ETI-CA.	synthetic_intensity
We developed a basic measure of PTSD and CPTSD (the Complex Trauma Inventory; CTI) according to the proposed domains, creating a few simple items to broadly assess each domain.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, when mild disorder and slight incoherence prevail, as in the case of minor trauma, narratives are used to gently rebuild the individual's sense of identity and meaning.	synthetic_intensity
This pilot study assessed the performance of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) in correctly identifying the presence or absence of mild PTSD symptoms, as determined by the Diagnostic Interview for children and Adolescents-Parent (DICA-P).	synthetic_intensity
Early and gentle treatment of victims is necessary to attenuate the minor psychopathological consequences of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that trauma symptoms were mildly more elevated than found among other youth norms.	synthetic_intensity
Secondly, self-referent CFT style in mild trauma survivors was generalized to non-autobiographical scenarios and was independent of how much control the protagonist in the scenarios had over the outcome.	synthetic_intensity
This finding fits with the idea that individuals who have experienced a minor traumatic event do not retain all the details of the trauma equally well.	synthetic_intensity
This paper is about the therapeutic approach to older people who suffer from mild war trauma experienced at an earlier age.	synthetic_intensity
This study found that social support was not enough to reduce mild PTSD symptoms in adolescents exposed to minor trauma and adversity.	synthetic_intensity
The first group was made up of patients with mild PTSD, and the second (control) group comprised veterans who experienced combat trauma, but did not show any PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological recovery from combat trauma may depend on discovering a simple personal meaning in the traumatic experience.	synthetic_intensity
This leads into discussion of mild dissociative experiences during traumas and the rare amnesia for voluntary recall of the minor trauma accompanied by occasional, manageable flashbacks of it.	synthetic_intensity
However, Ss who disclosed less severe traumas reported slightly fewer physical symptoms in the months following the study, compared with low-severity trauma Ss, and tended to report fewer symptoms than control Ss.	synthetic_intensity
Reasonable evidence for limited exposure to mild trauma material and some evidence for minor personal trauma history are indicated as factors in the development of STS.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to determine methods of treating mild somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of minor trauma involving physical contact or injury.	synthetic_intensity
Participants who completed trauma and sex surveys, relative to participants who completed cognitive measures, rated the study as resulting in moderately higher positive affect and as having slightly greater perceived benefits and fewer mental costs.	synthetic_intensity
Symptoms observed in more than 60% of diagnosed children included mild nonverbal representation of trauma in play; occasional crying, night waking, and slight mood shifts; and moderate social withdrawal and object focus.	synthetic_intensity
and (c) minor childhood trauma having an indirect, rather than direct, effect on HIV risk behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to several episodes of mild trauma also appears to have elicited emotion regulatory choices similar to those of professional first responders who occasionally encounter trauma on a regular basis.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among minor betrayal trauma, health care relationships, and general physical and mental_health in a chronic medical population.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study, the authors examined whether the subtle influence of mild trauma symptomatology on select career variables differs based on disability status.	synthetic_intensity
Ways of framing clinical decisions to minimize the potential minor secondary trauma are presented.	synthetic_intensity
While patients post-anoxia exhibit a rather homogenous cortical reduction of glucose metabolism, patients after head trauma often show moderate cortical and sub-cortical reductions at the site of primary trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This article presents the art therapist's engagement in responsive art making as an effective approach in working with an adolescent survivor of mild developmental trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Minor repetitive trauma disorders of the upper extremity are a frequent cause of lost work in many hand-intensive industries.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggested that patients, both with and without explicit recall for an RTA, responded similarly on a task involving implicit memory for mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We review 17 studies that simultaneously assessed parental and child functioning following mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The survey included questions about demographic variables, minor traumatic events and life events, the brief Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and the straightforward Defense Style Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Maltreatment was significantly associated with mild dissociation, low depression, and other minor psychological symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The authors also formed a group, based on scores slightly above the mean on both the Dissociation Scale and the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) of the Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40; Elliott & Briere, 1992), that they hypothesized were mildly traumatized in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
