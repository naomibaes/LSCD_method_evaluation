The slightly elevated (but in absolute sense quite low) risk of suicidal behavior among patients taking antidepressants compared to those taking placebo in randomized controlled antidepressant trials on unipolar major depression might be the consequence of the depression-worsening potential of antidepressant monotherapy in subthreshold and mixed bipolar depressed patients included in these trials and falsely diagnosed as suffering from unipolar major depression.	natural

We assessed external-stable (ES), external-variable (EV), internal-stable (IS), and internal-variable (IV) attribution of failure and psychological control variables (i.e. extent of depression and neuroticism).	natural
RNT was equally associated with anxiety and depression symptoms irrespective of gender or age.	natural
However, it remains unknown if sleep quality impacts regulatory mechanisms in clinical anxiety and depression.	natural
Both interventions have similar effects on depression and social connection.	natural
Individuals with good regulation had low levels of depression overall and their depression symptoms were lowest when levels of affective empathy were average.	natural
One thousand and five undergraduate volunteers completed an internet battery of questionnaires including measures of OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and disgust sensitivity.	natural
Levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been found to be depleted in people with major depression in the acute stage.	natural
The SA-related variables we included in the model were self-rated successful aging, depression severity, physical and emotional functioning, optimism, resilience, attitude towards own aging, self-efficacy, and cognitive ability.	natural
Scant previous research has examined associations of proactive coping and psychopathology, although two preliminary findings suggest that proactive coping might be negatively associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and general depression symptom level.	natural
Attention is directed at research differentiating the cognitive symptoms associated with the schizophrenia spectrum from those of the core affective disorders, as well as distinguishing schizophrenic-like flat affect from depression.	natural
We first tested the hypothesis, drawn from Beck's theory, that the cognitions associated with depression would focus on loss, whereas the cognitions associated with anxiety would focus on threat of loss.	natural
A random sample of subjects (n = 137; 80 male and 57 female) completed a questionnaire on mental_health and depression.	natural
The validity of diagnostic criteria and the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressant pharmacotherapy for atypical depression were studied in the NIMH Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program.	natural
Using Cox proportional hazards models, increased severity of depression at pretreatment was associated with increased recurrence rates, to an extent greater in patients maintained on monthly IPT than in those maintained on nortriptyline.	natural
The prevalence of depression and sleeping problems, both generally and related to winter,decreased significantly in the course of the 9-year time-span.	natural
Results showed that false memory was positively related to persistence, self-directedness, and active coping, but negatively related to depression, fear of negative evaluation, novelty seeking, negative coping, and cognitive abilities.	natural
This study investigated how communication patterns, romantic attachment, symptoms of depression, and perceptions of relationship quality are related concurrently and prospectively within monogamous dating relationships.	natural
Additionally, lower levels of prolactin were associated with both increased feelings of burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness; however, these associations were not significant after controlling for depression.	natural
Data were collected on financial strain, social capital, perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical health on three occasions over 18 months (N's = 355, 317, and 300).	natural
To identify trajectories of depression and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom groups after deployment and determine the effect of alcohol use disorder on these trajectories, depression symptoms were modeled using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in 727 Ohio National Guard members, and PTS symptoms were modeled using the PTSD Checklist in 472 Ohio National Guard members.	natural
We exploit a natural experiment that randomizes a mild stressor-birth weight discordance within twin pairs-to address this challenge and ask: Do small differences in early environment (prenatal nutrition) slightly moderate genetic effects on mild depression, delinquency, or GPA?	synthetic_low
These findings add to the accumulating evidence for the association between smoking and mild depression in different cultures and populations.	synthetic_low
It was predicted that women with relatively stronger self-concepts and somewhat more social support would experience a bit less state depression and state anxiety during the acute crisis than women with somewhat weaker self-concepts and slightly less social support.	synthetic_low
The subtle relationship between spouse ascribed hostility and the level of depression of both spouses in husband-depressed couples approached mild significance, as did the simple relationship between patient's and spouse's level of depression in wife-depressed couples.	synthetic_low
Valence-specific errors in behavioural inhibition index future vulnerability to mild depression in adolescents already at increased risk and may represent a measure of affective control.	synthetic_low
Repeated beta-arrestin1 protein and mRNA measurements, through standard immunoblot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against beta-arrestin1 and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, respectively, were carried in mononuclear leukocytes of 18 patients with moderate major depression and compared with 18 healthy subjects.	synthetic_low
There is limited research that examines some demographic, clinical and treatment factors associated with changes in physical symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and functional outcome in patients with mild somatized depression or anxiety in primary care.	synthetic_low

Using a subsample of females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 4,386), the study employs multivariate regression analyses to estimate the effects of youth forcible rape on the popularity, centrality, and density of adolescent friendship networks and to determine whether mild depression and attachment to others (e.g., to friends and to school) subtly mediate these effects.	synthetic_low
