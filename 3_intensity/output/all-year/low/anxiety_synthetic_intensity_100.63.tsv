We argue that concordance can be improved by examining the relationship of variables less global than anxiety and by restriction to particular mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Some moderate evidence of efficacy for the treatment of mild anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression is reported for SSRI antidepressants.	synthetic_low
This preliminary report of an on-going four-university study indicates that black male students enrolled in public-speaking classes at a predominantly white university report some anxiety about public speaking compared to black females and white students.	synthetic_low

Mild anxiety was somewhat unrelated to knowledge levels.	synthetic_low
Patients filled in four self-report questionnaires (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised [SCL-90-R], Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]) and underwent a basic personality assessment (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 [MMPI-2], Rorschach-CS).	synthetic_low

Increases in mild daily anxiety were predicted by greater occasional rumination, worry, and both minor cognitive and behavioral avoidance.	synthetic_low
Of 72 children, 18 months to 5 years old, 19 met mild SOC criteria (8 met DSM-IV criteria SOC also), 29 met reduced GAD criteria (5 met DSM-IV criteria GAD also), and 35 met minimal anxiety disorder criteria.	synthetic_low
The mild in vitro treatment proceeds with the gentle imagery, under light hypnosis, of a calm anxiety hierarchy of increasingly erotic and sexually intimate situations, which will be reproduced at home with the partner, until sexual intercourse is achieved.	synthetic_low
General and specific mild anxiety, connected with the fact of myocardial infarction (MI), were investigated in 105 patients before and at the end of posthospitalization rehabilitation.	synthetic_low
The noticeable consequences of the modifications brought in by the Revision-anticipatory anxiety in panic syndrome, and restricted period criteria for generalized anxiety- are discussed, with the conclusion that more field study assessment is recommended before further revision.	synthetic_low
This study suggests that whilst both CBM-I and the MRTP may have a positive impact on paranoia and mild social anxiety, the effects on JTC/belief inflexibility are largely specific to the MRTP.	synthetic_low
Mild social anxiety may slightly increase the barriers to social engagement and thus serve as a potential risk factor for increased social deficits in youth with ASD.	synthetic_low
Path analyses indicated that instrumentality and mastery were both significant mediators of the relationship between gender and mild anxiety after controlling for social desirability and hassles.	synthetic_low
Light alcohol consumption, minor use of drugs/medication, and mild physical illness as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA were associated with PA-only (OR 2.46-5.44), while moderate feelings of depression, mild feelings of anxiety, and having always been slightly anxious/nervous as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA, appraising the initial FS/PA as problematic and temporarily burdensome, subsequent mild feelings of depression, subsequent moderate avoidance, and minimal subsequent consumption of medication, alcohol, or drugs were associated with PD (OR 2.64-4.15).	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was more likely to be admitted by women and was associated with a somewhat positive attitude toward culling.	synthetic_low
The mediating role of mild social anxiety was explored within the effect of anger regulation on perceived stress in the national sample of American and Japanese older adults.	synthetic_low
