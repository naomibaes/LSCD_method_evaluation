This phenomenon may be multifactorial, with hypothesized contributions from CFTR modulator-psychotropic medication interactions, direct effects of CFTR modulators on central nervous system function, the psychologic effect of starting a potentially life-altering drug, and typical triggers of depression and anxiety such as stress, pain, and inflammation.	natural
This 3wave longitudinal study focuses on stability of child temperament from 3 to 6 years and considers child age, gender, birth order, and term status as well as mother age, education, anxiety, and depression as moderators of stability.	natural

There was no selective effect of novelty on Fos expression within input elements of the trisynaptic circuit (ERC layer two, the dentate gyrus or CA3) or other comparison brain regions that may be responsive to overall motor-sensory activity or anxiety levels (primary somatosensory and motor cortex or hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus).	natural
Compared to the PAS assessments made before the onset of air strikes, the PAS assessments made at the time of air strikes showed significant differences in terms of decreased overall severity of PD, fewer health concerns, decrease in the level of disability, and greater intensity and frequency of anticipatory anxiety.	natural
Those who had never received professional treatment (n = 49) were compared to those with current or previous treatment (n=263) with regard to alexithymia, anxiety, depression and health-related quality of life.	natural

20 of the patients had high values (> 10) on the anxiety subscale and 5 had high values (> 10) on the depression subscale of the HADS.	natural
Based on the relatively collectivistic culture, it seems that the present participants did not differentiate between the self and the other in death anxiety, in which all scales were rated high in general.	natural

Of 72 children, 18 months to 5 years old, 19 met mild SOC criteria (8 met DSM-IV criteria SOC also), 29 met reduced GAD criteria (5 met DSM-IV criteria GAD also), and 35 met minimal anxiety disorder criteria.	synthetic_intensity
Six main factors were extracted by principal-factor analysis which were related respectively to situations involving basic preparatory activity, mild attentional stress, neutral relaxation conditions, mild (anxiety) and slightly pleasant (excited) emotional stress and social vs isolated activity.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, cognitive avoidance was found to slightly influence Stroop interference under mild state anxiety conditions.	synthetic_intensity
