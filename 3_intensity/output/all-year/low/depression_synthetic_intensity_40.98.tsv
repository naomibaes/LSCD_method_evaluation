The results show higher levels of depression symptoms in the pregnancy group; specifically, pregnant women reported higher levels of depression than their male partners.	natural
Greater improvements in adherence were found for samples with lower CD4 counts or more severe depression, for interventions specifically targeting depression (versus addressing mental_health as a secondary objective), longer treatments, and observational studies.	natural
After control for several biological and behavioural factors relating to health we found no association between low vitamin E levels and depressive symptoms or depression in the elderly.	natural
However, rescue effect of physical exercise in social defeat-induced anxiety, depression or memory impairment has not been addressed.	natural
Participants completed a demographic form, the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep16-item version, Insomnia Severity Index, Sleep Hygiene Index, Sleep Associated Monitoring Index, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Disability Questionnaire, Modified Somatic Perceptions Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.	natural
Increased levels of homocysteine have been observed in various psychiatric disorders, among them in schizophrenia, depression and bipolar mood disorder.	natural
Coexisting anxiety is common in major depressive disorder (MDD) and more difficult to treat than depression without anxiety.	natural
We found significant positive correlations with the variables pain intensity, disability, generalized anxiety, and depression.	natural
Each depression diagnosing method is influenced by different variables and therefore, has advantages and limitations.	natural
However, epidemiological evidence for folate intake and postpartum depression is unavailable.	natural
Outcome measures included the patient health questionnaire depression, anxiety, and eating disorders modules, and the alcohol use disorders identification test.	natural
Depression can cause a series of behavioral patterns ranging from exaggeration of memory complaint, to simulation of organic dysfunction, to pseudodementia in which there is production of an actual organic mental syndrome.	natural
Significant improvements in POMS (Total Mood, depression and anxiety scores) occurred with both interventions.	natural
PROs included quality of life (linear analog scale), loneliness (UCLA-8), depression (CES-D), and perceived health (PedsQL).	natural
Two objectives motivated this study: first, to illustrate the relationship between the ERN and anxious symptoms, and the relationship between the FN and depressive symptoms; second, to explore whether the ERN and the FN relate uniquely to anxiety and depression, respectively, in children.	natural
Furthermore in cases of postpartum depression the mothers dysfunction has a long-term effect on both the childs development and family interaction.	natural
Identification of depression may be of value prior to the decision to perform electrical CV.	natural
We selectively review basic research evidence from community, clinical, and high-risk populations that identifies cognitive mechanisms (thought processes and reactions to negative affect) and emotional regulation as key processes involved in the onset and maintenance of depression.	natural
In contrast, individuals with depression symptoms did not exhibit blink magnitudes that varied by valence, either during viewing or after the pictures were removed from view.	natural
Named among the common ailments of the modern era, depression is characterized primarily by minor distortions in the affective sphere.	synthetic_low
To test this possibility, we compared item scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression among 45 bulimic patients, 21 patients in treatment for mild major depression, and 27 non-psychiatric control subjects.	synthetic_low
Both versions demonstrated predicted correlations with previously published measures of mild guilt and related affects, such as slight shame and low-level depression, and with a balanced attributional style.	synthetic_low
Women who perceived their partner as slightly critical and intolerant were more likely to present a compliant facade while feeling mild annoyance, which was associated with lower levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses, in which care givers' age and sex and a measure of the spouses' health status were controlled, showed that the care givers' degree of moderate upset with their networks was moderately associated with somewhat lower network satisfaction and mild depression at both time periods.	synthetic_low
These somewhat male-like and slightly female-like characteristics are considered regarding minor conduct problems and mild depression to explore how they inform biological and environmental theories about gender and psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are somewhat correlated with the slight depth of depression as assessed by a simple rating scale, and also with the minor degree of memory impairment during mild depression.	synthetic_low
Also lacking are some evidence-based treatment options specifically targeted to treat mild bipolar II postpartum depression.	synthetic_low
Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of mild state and low-level trait depression, a brief political activity inventory, and the simple locus of control scale.	synthetic_low
Some straightforward questions were casually discussed for developing basic studies on mild depression and causal attribution in Japan.	synthetic_low
Because beta-blockers may induce mild depression, they should be used cautiously in panic patients with concurrent minor depressive illness.	synthetic_low
Effects were less pronounced on multivariate analysis but continued to show a significant effect on length of stay even after controlling for demographics, personal and family history, and mild anxiety and depression screening scores.	synthetic_low
The present review of the literature suggests that CBI may have a positive impact on the treatment of mild depression and anxiety in adults living with HIV/AIDS.	synthetic_low
Human studies have suggested a mild association between a modest variable length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene promoter region and slight vulnerability to anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
To date, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mild major depression have examined suicidal ideation as an outcome measure with notable interest.	synthetic_low
The primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between mild parental psychopathology (specifically, alcohol dependence and mild depression) and adolescent psychopathology, by the gender of the adolescent and the gender of the parent.	synthetic_low
In arguing for the need to distinguish clinical depression from mild sadness, Horwitz and Wakefield argued for cautious weighting consideration to subtle nuances of life event stressors.	synthetic_low

The prevalence of mild depression was investigated with the help of a simple questionnaire (the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview).	synthetic_low
Although related to a mildly depressogenic attributional style, shame accounted for some variance in mild depression, above and beyond attributional style.	synthetic_low
