Those who consumed higher quantities of kratom tea daily (4 glasses) had higher odds of reporting longer duration of kratom use history (OR = 4.8, 95 CI 2.3 10.1, p < 0.001), higher frequency of daily kratom use (4 times) (OR = 72, CI 9.5 543.1, p < 0.001), and were more likely to experience moderate symptoms of depression (OR = 2.9, CI 1.17.3, p = 0.020) during kratom cessation than those who consumed between one and three glasses of kratom tea per day.	natural
We examined the internal consistency reliability, convergent and divergent validity, and factor structure of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in a sample of 131 Mexican American youth.	natural

Dyads with preschoolers in three diagnostic groups of interest were explored: mild depression, somewhat disruptive, and healthy.	synthetic_low
Non-significant associations were generally observed between scales of psychiatric symptoms (e.g., mild depression, minor psychotic ideation, slight cognitive disorientation, and limited hostility) and counselors' neutral ratings of the residents' capacity to meet the social and interpersonal expectations of the programs (e.g., personal care, involvement in interpersonal relationships, and development of work skills).	synthetic_low
This small but important pilot study investigated sibling accommodation to obsessive-compulsive symptoms, sibling relationship quality, and mild depression and anxiety in siblings of children who have OCD.	synthetic_low

This study involved a discourse analytic investigation of 15 women's accounts of their experiences of recovery from mild depression.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses revealed that mild suicidal ideation, but not low-level depression, was significantly related to solitary, less frequent heavy drinking.	synthetic_low
These preliminary results provide evidence for a relationship between mild depression severity and minor dysfunction in GABAergic and glutamatergic cortical processes in a pediatric population.	synthetic_low
At present relatively little is known about how differences in episode timing, severity, and course of mild recurrent depression relate to risk in children.	synthetic_low
Children's mild depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with somewhat lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, but not concurrently, recognized with a slight increase in cortisol reactivity, acting as a gentle indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	synthetic_low
The conceptualization of mild depression wards due to treatment strategies is still in the beginning and based on limited clinical experience up to now.	synthetic_low
However, Prohibition, Repeal, and the mild Depression are likely to have played relatively important roles.	synthetic_low
Findings also indicated a modest fit for factor models that included PTSD, mild depression, and alcohol dependence latent factors, which provides support for the specificity of PTSD symptom clusters.	synthetic_low
Further analyses revealed that studies comparing TD-cCBT to waitlist controls had the largest differences (g=.93) compared to active (g=.59) and usual care control groups (g=.37) on anxiety outcomes, but there was no significant influence of control group subtype on mild depression outcomes.	synthetic_low
Preliminary reports based on limited numbers of patients indicate that they are promising for mania, of uncertain utility for mild depression or schizophrenia, and deserving of further investigation for a number of other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
Post-hysterectomy self-perception of femininity and mild depression were assessed on the basis of the Bern Sex Role Inventory and Depression Adjective Check List.	synthetic_low
In Experiment I, rats that were trained and tested under normal cortical conditions showed a slight impairment of memory when KCl-induced mild depression was given to an unilateral hemisphere within 15 min after the training.	synthetic_low
Higher growth in maternal style despite of mild depression symptoms among comorbid mothers was interpreted against the background that the majority of the comorbid mother-infant dyads received a few treatments.	synthetic_low
Proportional hazard models showed that those in the mild depression groups differed slightly in time from catheterization to CABG (chi2 = 11.9, p =.003) and time to PCTA (chi2 = 7.74, p =.02) after controlling for relevant covariates.	synthetic_low
Here we further show that capsaicin, which is thought to act primarily through TRPV1, subtly modifies mild long term depression (LTD) in the LA.	synthetic_low
Objective health indicators such as minor chronic diseases, mild depression, occasional incontinence, and slight disability were associated with the self-perception of health measured with the revised version.	synthetic_low
Analyses revealed significant program effects on their sense of competence, social isolation, and mild depression subscales of the PSI parent domain.	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study is to determine the presence and mild severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia who visit the outpatient clinic for dysphagia.	synthetic_low
In both sexes, a moderate risk of depression was associated with being in long-term institutional care and occasionally receiving home nursing and/or a home help.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, mild symptoms of depression gently mediated the relationship between some aspects of sexual function and male participant status as a patient or control.	synthetic_low
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_low
Low parental care and parental guidance have been suggested as possible risk factors to mild depression in adult life.	synthetic_low
In both sexes, a moderate risk of depression was associated with being in long-term institutional care and occasionally receiving home nursing and/or a home help.	synthetic_low
Depressed patients showed a moderate basal score in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) slightly higher than 20.	synthetic_low
The results show clearly that the lack of forgetting over a 24-hr interval reported by previous investigators is due to a slight depression of performance on the immediate test (3-min retention interval) resulting from the procedure of not handling the rats during conditioning but then handling them on every trial during the retention test.	synthetic_low
We do not think that any of their mild points pose notable threats to our aetiological model of depression.	synthetic_low
Overall, minor differences were not found between the two groups in regard to evidence of mild depression symptoms, multifocal psychiatric symptomatology, or on any subscale of a test evaluating problems and rehabilitation needs of cancer patients.	synthetic_low
There is also emerging evidence linking mild vascular brain changes to low-level depression in late life.	synthetic_low
