We assessed 151 Kuwaiti boys and girls aged 9 to 12 years in 1993 to determine their level of exposure to mild war-related trauma during the Iraqi occupation and Gulf war, minor health complaints, and moderate psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma symptoms were related to exposure and exposure was related to age, but age was not related to symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, The National Survey of Children Exposed to Violence found that 60 of the children surveyed have been exposed to minor trauma, either in or out of school.	synthetic_intensity
The available evidence indicates that alternative means of conceptualizing mild acute trauma reactions and identifying acutely traumatized people who are at low risk of developing PTSD need to be considered.	synthetic_intensity
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, mild trauma exposure history and minor symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma models of minor child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of mild posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many less salient symptoms and behaviors associated with minor maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that mild trauma centrality somewhat predicted PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Staying in the eye of the storm, a place Bion asks us to be, a place inherent in the world of mild trauma can become a holding place of calmly lived and living emotional experience, gently altering turbulence into steady anchorage, dialectic potential spaces, and fluid, vital, new beginnings.	synthetic_intensity

Despite controversy surrounding the concept of mild head injury (MHI), it is becoming evident that even a head trauma termed 'minor' may result in some behavioural changes.	synthetic_intensity

Several studies of people coping with minor loss or trauma suggest that posttraumatic growth is common.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with slightly elevated levels of distress long after the mild trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	synthetic_intensity
Here, we test whether documented longterm risk factors (i.e., trait vulnerabilities), including mild perfectionism, slight impulsivity, occasional substance use, somewhat insecure attachment, limited social support, and minor childhood trauma, associate to suicidal phenomena through a pathway of the SCS.	synthetic_intensity
This study (N = 46) replicated a previous finding in which trauma therapists who endorsed a strong spiritual orientation reported increased compassion satisfaction when engaged in short-term (12 weeks), cross-cultural mild trauma work.	synthetic_intensity
Results from bootstrapped mediation analyses with a sample of 116 married adults revealed that total PTSD, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and mild arousal symptoms partially mediated the effect of minimal trauma exposure on perceived attachment behaviors in men only; the intrusion symptom cluster was not significant and there were no significant mediation effects for women.	synthetic_intensity
The participants reported minor abuse experiences using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and mild current psychopathology symptoms using the depression and anxiety scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18).	synthetic_intensity

Results indicate that co-occurring mild clinical depression was somewhat associated with minor trauma across all racial/ethnic groups.	synthetic_intensity
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mild trauma they experience, their relatively younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their more moderate perceptions of threat and partial loss of control, average levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, somewhat limited social support resources, and moderate use of alcohol to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as somewhat gender-specific mild psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
