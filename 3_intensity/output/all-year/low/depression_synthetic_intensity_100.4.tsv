The study compared the discriminant validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to detect mild mental disorders in the most frequent chronic somatic diseases.	synthetic_intensity
M1 LTP and mild long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity was assessed with paired-associative stimulation (PAS) of the median nerve and motor cortex using an interstimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25) or 10 ms (PAS10), respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Symptoms of anxiety and a mild depressive syndrome are common during the first months of bereavement and, although depressive symptoms are usually transient and self-limited, bereaved individuals infrequently go on to develop major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Contrary to previous findings, mild depression proved to be a slightly better predictor of suicidal ideation than occasional hopelessness.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are consistent with cognitive-interpersonal models of depression that propose that some adverse early experiences may contribute to a mild vulnerability for depression through the establishment of less functional attitudes.	synthetic_intensity
Baseline stage of change, smoking rate, and mild depression were significant prospective predictors of smoking outcome.	synthetic_intensity

Results offer limited support for Neimeyer's suggestion that mild depression, as opposed to nondepression and moderate depression, leads to minor disorganization of construct systems.	synthetic_intensity
Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that those on ART experienced greater improvement in both work outcomes over 12 months relative to non-ART patients, and that baseline and change in physical health functioning, continuous and categorical mild depression were all independently associated with improvement in both work outcomes, even after accounting for the direct effect of ART.	synthetic_intensity

Self-reinforcement, one element of the self-control model of mild depression proposed by Rehm, was evaluated as to its subtle relationship with Seligman's learned helplessness phenomenon.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers' work adaptation was related to shorter work hours, higher marital support, slightly lower depression, and career centrality, whereas marital support and career centrality predicted fathers' work adaptation.	synthetic_intensity
The presence of experientially similar individuals in the caregivers' social networks was strongly associated with somewhat lower levels of mild depression, especially for persons in moderately stressful caregiving situations.	synthetic_intensity
