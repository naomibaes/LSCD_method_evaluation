Adjusting for preinfarction quality of life, in-hospital anxiety, and demographic variables, mild depression was prospectively and independently related to slightly reduced global health at 4 months as well as modestly reduced overall mental health-including vitality, psychological health, and social function-and a small increase in role interference from psychological problems.	synthetic_low

Dependent variables were the subtly insightful Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981), the gentle Depression scale of the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC; McArthur & Roberts, 1982), and a mild depression measure taken from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983).	synthetic_low
Her history suggests that challenging environmental experiences, particularly the unfortunate loss of primary caregivers around age 15 months, resulted in symptoms consistent with the clinical picture of mild anaclitic depression and associated psychosocial dwarfism.	synthetic_low
Ninety-seven parents with a mild history of depression and 136 of their 9- to 15-year-old children served as participants.	synthetic_low
Mild depression that does not respond to antidepressants is termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD).	synthetic_low
Treatment rates with antidepressants are notably substantial for those recorded with mild new depression diagnoses (87.1) or minor symptoms of depression (58.7).	synthetic_low
Although it is a well-known fact that migration is a moderate risk factor contributing to psychopathology, little is known about how minor pre-migration factors may lead to mild depression among migrants.	synthetic_low
The other somatic disorders might either be symptoms of mild organic illness with secondary depression, the gentle psycho-somatic equivalents of depression, or finally the subtle symptoms of a masked depression.	synthetic_low
The findings reinforce previous studies indicating an overall relationship between minor life events and mild depression, but do not suggest that the beneficial effects of maintenance treatment are specifically protective against typical life stress.	synthetic_low
Factor clusters or dimensions somewhat indicative of anxiety and mild depression were evident in each study.	synthetic_low
Therefore, we invited 142 patients with body dysmorphic disorder and 226 healthy volunteers to undergo tests involving the Body Image Concern Scale, Personality Measure, Mood Disorder Questionnaire, Hypomanic Checklist-32, and the standard Plutchik - van Praag Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
Ninety-eight undergraduates completed brief measures of mild depression level, minor recent life events, and general sociotropic and autonomous achievement motivations.	synthetic_low
The findings strengthen the notion that homogeneous measures of mild depressive symptoms enable a modest degree of discrimination between subtypes than a broad multidimensional conception of low-level depression.	synthetic_low
While the general effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy has been established, relatively few studies have specifically investigated the effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient treatment of mild depression, even though somewhat depressed patients represent the largest group of inpatients.	synthetic_low
This study explored the predictive value of observer-rated and self-reported defensive functioning on the outcome of psychotherapy for the treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Participants were presented with either a vignette depicting mild depression (n=1001) or a vignette depicting depression with occasional suicidal thoughts (n=999) and asked if it would be helpful or harmful to deal alone with the manageable problem.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is usually associated with subtle changes in the endogenous hormonal system.	synthetic_low
Mild levels of low-intensity depression in a clinical group did not influence scores on a self-report measure of parental characteristics, the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI).	synthetic_low
Subjects who did not have mild major depression at baseline were classified into groups according to the occasional persistence of alcohol consumption during the follow-up period.	synthetic_low
Slight positive and negative everyday events, moderate positive and negative instrumental and expressive qualities, and typical social support appraisals were examined in relation to balanced positive and negative affect, mild depression, and occasional somatic complaints using data from 198 undergraduate women and men.	synthetic_low
Recent research suggests mild depression as measured by self-endorsed symptoms lists is somewhat associated with modestly poor health outcomes in chronic illness.	synthetic_low

Ninety-eight sojourners (employees of a New Zealand organization and their spouses) completed questionnaires that included measurements of acculturation (host and co-national identification), minor social difficulty, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Absence of HAART, minor physical function challenges, perceived discomfort from relatives and friends, and a slightly reduced level of resilience were associated with mild depression (stepwise regression; beta = - 0.28-0.17, R-square = 0.22), anxiety and stress (R-square = 0.32 and 0.16, respectively).	synthetic_low

We suggest that the Clinical Interview Schedule is a feasible alternative to the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression and discuss reasons why it might be generally preferable within clinical trials of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Researchers have suggested that selfefficacy can predict and prevent mild depression, while negative coping strategies, as typified by occasional rumination, can lead to moderate depression.	synthetic_low
Associated symptoms included minor delusions, mild hallucinations, and low-level depression, but not noticeable irritability, unusual motor behavior, slight sleep and night time behavioral changes, or minor changes in appetite and eating habits.	synthetic_low
