The results indicated that alternative depression measures, whether completed by children or parents, yielded scores that were slightly higher for children with a diagnosis of mild depression; parent ratings of severity of depression were slightly higher among the measures than the child ratings; optimal cutoff scores derived for each measure correctly classified approximately 60% of mildly depressed and nondepressed cases; different cutoff scores were required for the same measure, depending on whether children or parents were the raters; and using a series of measures and combining these in a simple discriminant function yielded over 80% classification accuracy.	synthetic_intensity
