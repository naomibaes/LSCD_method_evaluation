This paper describes a study of the understated social representation of mental_illness by mental_health professionals working in Britain and France during this time of major policy change.	synthetic_intensity
To help this process, numerous definitions of moderate mental_illness have been suggested.	synthetic_intensity
Univariate analyses showed the following correlates of PE: familial psychiatric factors; parental mental_illness during any early child development; slight change in family composition; slightly low family income; mild regulatory issues in infancy; normal onset of puberty; occasional bullying; concurrent mental_disorder; and HyperToM. When estimating the adjusted effects, only low family income, concurrent mental_disorder, bullying, and HyperToM remained significantly associated with PE.	synthetic_intensity
Questionnaires assessing characteristics and motivations were distributed to 663 volunteers providing companionship for people with mild mental_illness within volunteering programs organized in four Austrian regions.	synthetic_intensity
Although improving the family relations of individuals with mild mental_illness has been identified as an important goal for community-based case management programs, little is known about the impact of such programs on patterns of family relations over time.	synthetic_intensity
Successful management of moderate mental_illness in the community somewhat relies on an informal or non-professional network of caregivers.	synthetic_intensity
We compared average annual charges for patients with the following diagnoses: mild substance abuse, substance abuse with minor mental_illness, mild arthritis, manageable asthma, and controlled diabetes.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical and legal research on the concept of mental_illness and on definitions (and predictions) of mild dangerousness continue to offer the mental_health law arena limited results.	synthetic_intensity
as well as grouping factors of mild maternal mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Active Mormons reported having the best health status and, consequently, the lowest levels of mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
We identified a noticeable prevalence of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Children sometimes report a mild associative stigma because they are affected by association with a parent who has a mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Significantly, in both institutions, prisoners and residents with whom I worked chose either to be a prisoner or to have a manageable physical disability over mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Persons with mental_illness must cope not only with the symptoms of their condition but also with some social and self-stigma.	synthetic_intensity
Despite growing research on the treatment of mental_illness, little attention is devoted to the internal experience of therapists who work to manage disillusionment and mild despair as they try to maintain hope and reconfigure expectations over a course of therapy that may extend many years.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 708 patients with mental_illness were randomly assigned to intensive and standard forms of case management in four sites in the UK.	synthetic_intensity
Recent work on the conceptual history of intellectual disability has pointed to a mild discontinuity in the seventeenth century, identifying the concept as essentially modern in a less intense sense than mental_illness or physical disability.	synthetic_intensity
The perception that people with mild mental_health problems are somewhat less reliable was associated with lower intention, and the understanding that people with moderate mental_health problems can recover was associated with higher intended contacts with people with mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, the authors suggest assessing personal factors to better understand the work integration process for people with mental_illness, as well as conducting an evaluation of the job site.	synthetic_intensity
This study sought to better understand the population-specific types of social support relevant to adults living with moderate mental_illness (SMI).	synthetic_intensity
While not under mental_health system supervision, however, the likelihood that a CTO patient would receive a physical illness diagnosis was slightly lower than for non-CTO patients, and similar to lower morbidity-risk outpatients without severe mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Life-course research has suggested a connection between childhood experiences and adult mental_illness, but most studies focus on mild anxiety or depressive symptoms, which may be transient.	synthetic_intensity
The delivery of psychiatric rehabilitation interventions has been recognised as fundamental to support recovery of people with mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The study also provides support for the theory that certain forms of mental_illness may still exist in the gene pool because particular personality traits associated with mild forms of mental_illness (i.e., Neuroticism & schizotypy) are also associated directly with creativity and indirectly with short-term mating success.	synthetic_intensity
Elevated internalized stigma is common and is somewhat linked to subjective and objective outcomes for mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that while attitude components are generally not highly related, perceived severity of mild mental_illness is somewhat related to attribution to physical causes, and only slightly affects social acceptability.	synthetic_intensity
The fallacy, of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has some financial implications and that they are of a nature to be evaluated.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to better understand the distributions and presentations of IPV-related mental_illness in this population.	synthetic_intensity
As a step toward addressing some limitations in the current psychiatric diagnostic system, the National Institute of Mental Health recently developed the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to stimulate integrative and balanced research-spanning self-report, behavior, neural circuitry, and molecular/genetic mechanisms-on core psychological processes implicated in mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The recovery of people with persistent mental_illness who live in the community benefits from coordinated support services.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and seventy-eight undergraduate students completed measures assessing reassurance-seeking behavior; mild current symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders; and some personal and family history of diagnosed mental_illness and rare suicide attempts.	synthetic_intensity
Another finding of this study is that after accounting for all of the above factors, there still remain some differences across Census Divisions in hospitalization rates for mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we will discuss the value of multimodal treatment used by our skilled treatment team as a helpful approach to start the integrative process of healing for women with moderate mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Psychotherapists may be asked to address various treatment targets including mild mental_illness and some disruptive behaviors, alongside other recidivism-related factors such as occasional substance abuse, minor thinking errors, and less concerning deviant peer networks.	synthetic_intensity
It is widely accepted that people with mental_illness have some risk of mild cardiometabolic complications such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.	synthetic_intensity
The notable association between mild mental_illness and economic challenges is one of the most recognized in psychiatric epidemiology.	synthetic_intensity
Western experiences have shown high acceptance for the concept among psychiatric patients, and illustrated that most stable patients with moderate mental_illness retain the capacity to frame PADs consistent with community practice standards.	synthetic_intensity
Current knowledge regarding treatment and management of the mild behavioral symptoms of AD has developed primarily as a result of trial and error on the part of caregivers and the application of standard interventions from other areas of clinical practice (e.g., behavioral symptoms of mental_illness and other less severe neurological disorders).	synthetic_intensity
We aimed to operationalize a multi-axial model of continuity of care and to use factor analysis to determine its validity for moderate mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The 12 studies meeting these criteria provide limited but promising evidence that mutual help groups benefit people with mild mental_illness, mild depression/anxiety, and ordinary bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
Some of the current evidence on therapeutic communities, planned early hospital discharge, alternatives to inpatient care, and job integration in people with mild mental_illness are reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
The fallacy, of course, is that the prevention of mental_illness or suicide has some financial implications and that they are of a nature to be evaluated.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the relationships between resilience factors (mental_health literacy, social connectedness, coping strategies) frequently targeted in interventions, and both adjustment (mild depressive symptomatology, life satisfaction, prosocial behaviour, manageable emotional/behavioural difficulties) and caregiving outcomes in children (12 - 17 years) of a parent with mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Beyond general narratives of biology and individual personality traits, the authors include an anthropologists' perspective to viewing mental_illness (Marsella & Yamada, 2011), use general sociological explanations of intergroup relations in a multicultural model of acculturation (Berry, 2011), and refer to basic demographic migration patterns to clarify culture shock among foreign students (Furnham, 2011).	synthetic_intensity
The baseline interview documented mild mental_illness and substance use in the past year, moderate mental_illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use.	synthetic_intensity
Three adults with mild intellectual disabilities and some mental_illness living in the community were guided by a community-based therapist to use this strategy to manage less problematic behaviors that included occasional verbal aggression, minor disruptive behavior, and light physical aggression.	synthetic_intensity
By using Bali (Indonesia) as a focal culture, in this article we discuss the effects of cultural elements and showcase their potential contribution and systematic implementation into a comprehensive and sensitive interventional model for the treatment of mental_illness in childhood and adolescence sexual challenges.	synthetic_intensity
