We found that genocide survivors who reported high levels of depression and low levels of PGI experienced greater physical impairment in their day-to-day life, and identified fewer positive personality changes as a result of their experience (i.e., posttraumatic growth; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996).	natural
Despite high rates of comorbidity, research has typically focused on the independent impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms in people living with HIV (PLWH).	natural
698 patients were screened for major depression by the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R in a community-based primary care health center.	natural
These results did not change after controlling for depression severity.	natural
In addition, the correlations between the clinical variables (such as depression severity, anxiety severity, illness duration) and fALFF values were also estimated in each group and across both groups.	natural
Positive metacognitions were associated with rumination, while negative metacognitions and rumination predicted higher depression levels, but not symptom recurrence.	natural
The observed improvements in work/school functioning in patients with MDD, whose depression was treated with ADT+brexpiprazole, suggests potential to reduce socioeconomic burden.	natural
This article examines coocurrence of three types of problems of adaptation during adolescence : abuse of psychotropic drugs, behavioral disorder (oppositional and behavioral disorders) and feelings of depression (depression and dysthymia).	natural
The translated Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used to measure health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms respectively, and are reported here.	natural
Overall, the results indicate that when SY, SO, WB, and IE are more then one standard deviation below the mean, depression is likely.	natural
Among subjects who were depressed at the time of marital dissolution, Cox proportional hazards models revealed a five-fold increased probability of recovering from major depression for subjects who experienced a separation/ divorce relative to subjects who did not separate/divorce.	natural
A combination of behavioral, cognitive, and supportive techniques served to strengthen her defenses and brought about a remission from her depression without addressing repressed issues of the Holocaust.	natural
The current study used vignettes of depressed patients which varied the culture and/or social circumstances of the patient to assess whether these variables influenced the conceptualization of depression and its treatment.	natural
We wanted to see if any relationships existed among the presence of antidepressants at autopsy, diagnosis of Depression, recent contact with physicians and prescription of antidepressant medication.	natural
It also is the first research to explore the association between depression and the motivation to boost self-esteem.	natural
The present study examined the impact of culturally related stressors on hopelessness, symptoms of depression, and suicidal ideation-well-known predictors of suicidal behavior-among emerging adults over time, and whether hopelessness would mediate the relation between culturally related stressors and both depression and ideation.	natural
Such learning may occur at the neural level in terms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).	natural
They may be self-medicating an underlying seasonal affective disorder (SAD) with alcohol or manifesting a seasonal pattern to alcohol-induced depression.	natural
These findings are discussed in relation to the theory that frontal EEG activity may be a biological marker for symptoms associated with depression.	natural
Abuse and depression interacted to predict higher IL-6 at second trimester (B = 0.006, p = .011) such that severely abused adolescents with high depression had higher IL-6 relative to severely abused adolescents with low depression; depression did not differentiate IL-6 levels for those with low abuse severity.	natural
These findings suggest that under acutely challenging conditions, depression is associated with greater resistance to molecules that normally terminate the inflammatory cascade.	natural
In a multivariable model, drug use and panic symptoms were independently associated with poorer outcomes along the depression treatment cascade.	natural
Shortened postictal depression of brain activity was observed in animals receiving posterior cortical stimulation.	natural
The predictive value of dysregulation profile trajectories for later ADHD, anxiety and depression was examined by linear regression.	natural
Male adolescents showed minor variations in depression and anxiety by smoking status, but were still more likely to seek mental_health services.	synthetic_low
The mild nature of the depressive episode was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD).	synthetic_low
Predictive validity showed that the scale significantly predicted mild depression and moderate anxiety in the early postpartum period as well as mild anxiety six weeks postpartum.	synthetic_low
They completed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, a simplified version of the Beck Depression Inventory, a lightened Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, a basic Mood Adjective Checklist, and a simple Daily Symptom Record.	synthetic_low
were randomly selected from the clinic database and surveyed with the Hospital Anxiety and mild Depression scale, Fatigue Questionnaire and Illness Perceptions Questionnaire [J Psychosom Res 37 (1993) 147; Psychol Health 11 (1996) 431; Acta Psychiatr Scand 67 (1983) 361.].	synthetic_low
The BDNF val66met polymorphism had no main effect but was subtly moderated by mild maternal depression, such that children with a BDNF methionine allele had a slightly increased memory for negative self-descriptive traits when mothers had experienced depression during children's lifetimes; in contrast, children with a methionine allele had low recall of negative traits when mothers had no depression history.	synthetic_low
Maternal positivity partially mediated the relation between mild maternal depression and children's mild externalizing symptoms.	synthetic_low
A random sample of 30 chronically mentally ill (DSM-III-R schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, recurrent mild major depression) inpatients aged 55 and older completed the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (MCMI-II) and the Coolidge Axis II Inventory (CATI).	synthetic_low
Mild depression also predicted later explanatory styles.	synthetic_low
Group-specific predictors of mild depression for the HIV-positive caregivers were relatively poorer health and manageable financial concerns.	synthetic_low
Cognitive content was partially determined by mild depression, domain, and construct; slightly depressed subjects generated some negative content using own constructs to describe themselves.	synthetic_low
We explored whether AA attendance modestly reduces mild depressive symptoms, the degree to which slight improvement in depression results in minor reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these subtle effects occur.	synthetic_low
To determine whether statin use is associated with mild depression and to examine the limited evidence supporting this association.	synthetic_low
Psychological status was assessed by: the straightforward Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL90-R), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), mild Shortened Manifest Anxiety Scale (SMAS), and Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS).	synthetic_low
Taken together, the results suggest that nonclinical depression is associated with a slight lack of affective modulation of startle, similar to what has been shown for mild clinical depression.	synthetic_low
Implications for future work on the mild hopelessness theory of depression are discussed.	synthetic_low
Sixteen cases of clients with mild depression (305 sessions) were analysed.	synthetic_low
In this population-based, nationwide, retrospective cohort study in Denmark, depression was defined as mild affective or anxiety disorders that necessitated occasional psychiatric hospital admission.	synthetic_low
Although there is a growing literature on the adverse health outcomes related with slightly negative ageing perceptions, studies on their association with milder mental disorders such as low-level depression and mild anxiety are scarce.	synthetic_low
This association did not remain significant after the adjustment for health conditions, i.e., obesity, anxiety, mild depression and chronic pain, which may act as confounding variables in the relationship between watching television and poor sleep quality.	synthetic_low
