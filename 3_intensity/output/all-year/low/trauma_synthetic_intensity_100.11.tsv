Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mild trauma they experience, their relatively younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their more moderate perceptions of threat and partial loss of control, average levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, somewhat limited social support resources, and moderate use of alcohol to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as somewhat gender-specific mild psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_low

The observed slight hypersensitivity to punishment in individuals with PTSD may contribute to mild avoidant responses that are not specific to trauma cues.	synthetic_low
If, however, the dangerous situation escalates and a minor psychic trauma cannot be avoided, the strategy of mutual silence concerning the event(s) becomes a minor obstacle for giving traumatized children parental support and professional treatment.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) with regard to each instrument's utility for discriminating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from depression and social phobia in a sample of college students with mild civilian trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Future studies will be needed to determine whether this learning bias may pre-date and confer risk for, re-experiencing symptoms in individuals subsequently exposed to mild trauma, or emerges only in the wake of slight trauma exposure and moderate PTSD symptom development.	synthetic_low
Peritraumatic dissociation is thought to slightly affect trauma information encoding, leading to milder PTSD symptoms like occasional intrusive memories.	synthetic_low
Using biometric structural equation modeling, mild trauma exposure was best explained by subtle shared and nonshared environmental influences.	synthetic_low
The choice of defensive style was found related to at least three factors: an early history of minor trauma, especially brief separation, parental encouragement of resilience, and essentially a typical family style.	synthetic_low
Those participants with a mild prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after minor adult trauma than those with no such history.	synthetic_low
These findings highlight notable differences among women as a function of ethnicity and HIV status, and underscore the need for tailored services for HIV-positive women that address the risk-enhancing effects of substance use, transient homelessness, and limited sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
In contrast, personally minor traumatic experiences (e.g., a slight conflict with a familiar other) were related to slightly increased depressive and trauma symptoms, and these mild relations were gently mediated by self-reports of encountering somewhat unsupportive social interactions.	synthetic_low
The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_low
