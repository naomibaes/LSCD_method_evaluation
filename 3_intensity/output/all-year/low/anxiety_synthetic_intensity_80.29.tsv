Pre-colposcopy mild negative affect, discomfort experienced during colposcopy, low trait anxiety, and referral smear grade were minor predictors of post-colposcopy slight negative affect, explaining 32% of variance.	synthetic_intensity
Our study tested this prediction in school-age children by examining the independent and interactive effects of three factors known to deplete availability of WM resources: mildly increased processing demands of a concurrent arithmetic task, additional WM span requirements, and low trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
