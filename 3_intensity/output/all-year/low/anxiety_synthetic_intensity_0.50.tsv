Relevant variables were evaluated in a hierarchical linear regression framework, and it was found that a continuous conceptualization of AS provided incremental predictive validity above and beyond trait anxiety immediately post-challenge, while a categorical representation of AS was equivalent to a continuous model of AS at post-challenge but outperformed a continuous model at follow-up.	natural

Statistical analysis shows the significant reduction of three general measures of psychological distress (Global Severity Index, Positive Symptom Distress Index, and Positive Symptom Total), as well in all its dimensions (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensibility, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism), in the experimental group compared with the control group.	natural

In the first study, 61 participants aged 62 to 88 years (M = 72, SD = 5.8) completed current measures of cognitive emotion regulation, positive emotion, negative emotion, anxiety and depression regarding their most distressing aging-related adverse life event, and rated (retrospectively) positive reappraisal use at the time of the stressor.	natural

Our study revealed numerous significant findings, including: socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP) was the dimension most strongly related to brooding in response to depression and anxiety; SPP, self-oriented perfectionism (SOP), and brooding predicted various indices of distress; SOP predicted anxiety and worry in women, and it predicted dysphoria and anger in men; despite the strong associations between ruminative brooding and distress, perfectionism still accounted for unique variance in distress, and vice-versa.	natural
