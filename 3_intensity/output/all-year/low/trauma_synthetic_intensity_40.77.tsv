Concepts of Heinz Kohut's self psychology and their development in Israel in recent years by Raanan Kulka make it possible to think about and treat the trauma of loss not only through processes of mental internalization and representation, but also through processes of transformation of the child self into selfhood: an a-structural state of the narcissism that is present in a higher state of unitary awareness with something outside of the individual, which Kohut (1966) conceptualized as supra-individual participation in the world.	natural
