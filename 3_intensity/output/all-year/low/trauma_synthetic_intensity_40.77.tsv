Physical and sexual abuse and lifetime trauma were also significant predictors of physical and psychological symptoms.	natural
Repetition is seen as a means of abreacting the trauma by seeking to bind the enormous quantity of excitations that cannot find discharge.	natural
Findings indicate that Schneiderian symptoms are highly related to childhood trauma and other dissociative symptoms clusters in the general population, as they are in clinical populations.	natural
ASA also predicted sexual trauma symptoms.	natural
Experiment 1 contrasted two concurrent tasks, Verbal Interference (counting backwards in threes) and Visuospatial tapping, against a no-task Control condition during trauma film viewing.	natural
Overall, results suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are common in youth with ASD, and may be related to depression and trauma.	natural
Furthermore, issues related to cultural differences, trauma history, and ethics are explored.	natural
We found five primary novel uses of the theory: development, discrimination/stereotyping, occupations, historically marginalized populations, and mental_health and trauma.	natural
A substantial proportion of variance in all disorder categories, 32.9 to 53.9, could be explained by trauma exposure.	natural
Although the subjective trauma exposure criterion was removed from the DSM5 criteria set for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emerging literature suggests that peritraumatic distress may be useful in predicting outcomes after exposure to a stressful event.	natural
Future applications of hope theory are presented, including such topics as psychotherapy, trauma, pain tolerance, adherence to taking medications, health psychology, gender, suicide, developmental antecedents, aging issues, and work.	natural
This study aimed to assess the ability of trauma simulators to feign a trauma response on the IES.	natural
Childhood trauma has profound impact on the emotional, behavioral, cognitive, social, and physical functioning of children.	natural
Patient 2 was a 39-year-old male who had suffered a pratfall without direct head trauma.	natural
Family response to trauma is outlined, concentrating on the area of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and several models of adaptation are reviewed.	natural
Emergence of posttraumatic-like behaviors following chronic trauma is of interest given the rising prevalence of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Furthermore, neither PTSD severity, dissociative symptom severity, nor extent of preexisting amnesia for childhood trauma contributed to the variance in memory functioning.	natural
Developmental competence partially mediated the association between trauma exposure and symptoms.	natural
The study examined qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how each individual partner in an intimate partner relationship is affected when one or both partners have a history of trauma exposure.	natural
The unique nature of trauma is rejected because a) clear defining criteria for a unique stimulus condition do not exist, and b) studies of special outcomes, such as PTSD, can be done without postulating a unique stimulus condition.	natural
In response to the absence of comprehensive treatment for trauma survivors within the community mental_health system, an alternative model, Overcoming Pain and Adversity in Life (OPAL) is offered.	natural
Depression and early trauma experiences were positively correlated with mothers overprotection and negatively correlated with mother care.	natural
A rise in family violence, violence within schools, and a variety of other stressors are suspected of leading to the characteristic PTSD symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, psychological numbing, and increased states of arousal.	natural
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as a mild re-experiencing of warning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed slightly for the worse.	synthetic_low
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is commonly observed among mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Aetiological considerations aside, it was concluded that enquiring into nightmare experience might be a useful adjunct to direct questioning about minor early trauma in individuals somewhat vulnerable to psychological dysfunction, including relatively mild eating disorders.	synthetic_low
The problems of reactive psychoses are discussed from the following perspectives: terminology, prevalence, psychogenesis and mild trauma, predisposition and vulnerability, as well as outcome.	synthetic_low
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were predominantly predicted by moderate initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by mild trauma severity.	synthetic_low
The present paper addresses the effects of minor sexual abuse trauma on the developmental process of identification.	synthetic_low
After accounting for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD Checklist-17 Civilian Version) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) symptoms, mild trauma exposure was no longer associated with prescription drug problems at all time points (relative risk ratios range 0.911.47).	synthetic_low
Future research on the role of minor trauma and mental health in young people's substance misuse is needed.	synthetic_low
Clinical examples are provided, and the Information Deprivation Trauma Interview (IDTI) is introduced for use in clinical and research settings where mild trauma is explored.	synthetic_low
Very few patients had received a working diagnosis of mild PTSD, or were receiving low-intensity trauma focussed psychological therapy.	synthetic_low
Moderate rates of childhood trauma were found.	synthetic_low
The evolving field of trauma counselling provides helpful information to special education teachers and school counsellors who work with children who have experienced mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Single versus multiple mild trauma and childhood versus adulthood mild trauma groups did not differ in mild depressive symptom and low co-morbidity.	synthetic_low
Subjects had no history of other substance or alcohol abuse or dependence, minor cerebral trauma, psychiatric or neurological disorders.	synthetic_low
Receipt of prescription stimulants were significantly associated with incident PTSD, hazard ratio = 5.09, 95 confidence interval [3.05, 8.50], after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, military characteristics, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, baseline mental and physical health status, deployment experiences, and minor physical/sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
There was no significant difference between early and late participants on any measure of mild trauma, minor PTSD symptoms, or slight dissociation.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed significant, unique contribution of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score above all other predictors in the model (demographics, severity of minor trauma exposure, mild physical injury, moderate substance use, and light depressive symptoms), for both the physical and mental_health aggregate scores, along with significant prediction of physical health (4-10) and mental_health (3-7) subscale scores.	synthetic_low
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_low
The discussion is based upon the authors' formal and informal fieldwork and research with children in war zones, youth experiencing violence, and street children in several regions of the world over the last 10 years, in which mild trauma and spiritual development have been a major focus.	synthetic_low
The current study gently assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's potential reliance on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) slightly increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while carefully controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_low
