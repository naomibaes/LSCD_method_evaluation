After controlling for cigarettes smoked/day, past 30-day marijuana use, current alcohol consumption, and coping style, negative reinforcement/negative affect reduction outcome expectancies were significantly associated with greater levels of negative affectivity, emotional dysregulation, and anxiety sensitivity.	natural
In order to examine the relationships between the 8 PLR parameters (initial pupillary diameter in darkness, pupillary diameter at maximum constriction, constriction ratio, latency of the reflex, time to reach maximum constriction and time constant of redilation) and state/trait anxiety, we used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and stepwise multiple regression analysis.	natural
There is discussion of some of the typical institutional defences against anxiety and distress that arise when working with the most complex children and families in schools, and in particular the pressure to locate problems within individuals and to attempt to address such issues on an individual basis while leaving the institutional and systemic issues unaddressed.	natural

Trait anxiety was found to moderately influence both state anxiety and childhood SES to subtly impact intertemporal decision processes.	synthetic_low
Study 2 suggested that the mild relation between trait anxiety and punishment expectancy is slightly affected by the type of incentive and the type of trait anxiety measure used.	synthetic_low
Depression was the strongest independent predictor of pre-operative BP and HRV whilst mild anxiety was most significantly related to moderate follow-up BP reactivity.	synthetic_low
Thus, we contend that applied psychologists, who have focused on neuroticism as a broad construct, should consider the substantial body of work among clinical psychologists, who argue that mild anxiety and depression have unique variance associated with them.	synthetic_low
Whilst a mood manipulation was associated with a broadening of the attentional beam, it occurred regardless of mild trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Research has suggested a mild adverse effect of anxiety on cognitive functioning, and high defensive individuals may have slightly less control of their anxiety than low defensive individuals.	synthetic_low
Major, level of study, some MM practice outside of the intervention, and number of sessions slightly moderated the effects of MM on mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The purpose of the present review is to provide clinicians with practical information on assessment and diagnosis of mild anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD, summarize and critically examine the literature on anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD, and recommend avenues for future research in this area.	synthetic_low
