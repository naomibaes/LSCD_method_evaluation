Ninety-three mildly depressed prepubertal children, aged 6 to 12 years, and their mothers underwent a standard assessment procedure that combined several basic assessment measures given separately to child and mother (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present Episode [K-SADS-P], Children's Depression Inventory, and routine psychiatric interviews), consultation of either and/or both informants with minor intra- and interinformant discrepancies, and senior clinician's estimate clinical judgment to address simple discrepant ratings.	synthetic_intensity

Hardy and nonhardy participants reported life events for the previous year, minor physical illness for the previous 6 months, and low current levels of depression, and rated each reported event in terms of its mild desirability.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxious depression, defined as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with moderate levels of anxiety symptoms, may represent a relatively common depressive subtype, with noticeable features.	synthetic_intensity
In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with mild social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for low-level depression and fair self-esteem, which explained 35 of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7 of the variance in social anxiety scores in an undergraduate sample (N=95) and the interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3 of the variance in social anxiety scores.	synthetic_intensity
Using self-report and behavioral (daily diary) indices of environmental reward as proxy measures for positive reinforcement, this investigation examined whether environmental reward mediated the relationship between avoidance and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The obtained data were discussed in relationship to the cognitive model of mild depression and prior findings with similar subjects on the same experimental tasks.	synthetic_intensity
A slight slowing of the speed of information processing has been reported in geriatric depression, but it is not clear if the mild impairment is present in younger patients, if minor motor retardation is responsible, or if standard antidepressant medications play a role.	synthetic_intensity
Hypothetical mechanisms linking mild depression with slightly reduced survival have been reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with mild depression, generalized anxiety, and substance use; explains how abnormal behavior derives from normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of minimal-contact cognitive bibliotherapy for treating mild depression and improving functional abilities in older adults with a slight physical disability.	synthetic_intensity
Patients demonstrated moderate baseline affective burden and some improvement of mild depression scores over a 4-week period post-baseline (F(2.66) = 8.88; p = .0004).	synthetic_intensity

The results showed that sociodemographic measures (e.g. age) and measures of mild depressive symptoms (e.g. low depression scores) did not discriminate dropouts from completers.	synthetic_intensity
The presence of anxiety and mild depression symptoms before and during the course of dystonia, without a possible causal relationship, could mean that the alteration of a chain of physiological events in the central nervous system may not lead to a single clinical picture.	synthetic_intensity
A simple single blind, randomised and controlled pilot study evaluating the efficacy of early identification of mild depression and gentle intervention by a psychogeriatric consultation was undertaken.	synthetic_intensity
