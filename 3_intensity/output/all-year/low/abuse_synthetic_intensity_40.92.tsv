Research on the origin of sexual aggression has identified several important contributing factors: (a) early abuse (physical and sexual), (b) personality/behavioral traits (callousness and unemotionality, antisocial behavior/impulsivity, and hypersexuality), and (c) attitudinal/cognitive variables (negative masculinity, hostility toward women, misogynistic fantasies).	natural
It examined the variables based on the perceptions of the elderly subjected to emotional abuse.	natural
We predicted that women who reported childhood abuse by close others would show alterations in affective responsiveness relative to their peers.	natural
There has been increasing recognition of the importance and extent of abuse of vulnerable adults, including people with intellectual disabilities, leading to the development of monitoring systems.	natural
The alcohol abuse index consisted of the mean alcohol units consumed by participants and days of abstinence before being enrolled into the recovery program.	natural
According to derailment theory, tactics girls and women use to survive a history of abuse, strategies shaped by their abuse, and societal reactions to it estrange them from non-deviant social networks and situations and increase the likelihood of criminal offending and the application of criminal labels.	natural
Critical observations are offered on the risks of inferring childhood sexual and physical abuse from reports by clients who were treated by therapists whose theoretical or political orientation lead them to assume the presence of abuse in the past histories of people like those with borderline personality disorder.	natural
However, a greater proportion of patients with SP had Brief Michigan Alcohol Screening Test scores above 5, indicating alcohol abuse problems.	natural
population-based cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies of children <18 years of age that reported empirical data on the association of abuse with disability.	natural
Understanding the link between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and sexual victimization (SV) in adulthood may provide important information about the level of risk for adult SV and sexual re-victimization among childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivors.	natural
This study is a retrospectively planned secondary analysis of the Examining Siblings To Recognize Abuse (ExSTRA) network data.	natural
In identifying scenarios that constitute elder mistreatment, some participants felt that certain cases of abuse are actually the persistence of intimate partner violence into old age.	natural
Polygraph, or psychophysiological detection of deception (PDD) testing, is now widely used as: part of the investigation process concerning allegations of child sexual abuse; an important aid in the prevention of additional offenses by adjudicated child sexual abusers who are still in the community; and, treatment of child sexual abusers in cooperation with therapists trying to help he offender overcome denial.	natural
Results suggest that cultural conflict stems from areas such as education and success, pressure from parents to maintain traditional cultural values, family bonds and lack of boundaries, parental control and abuse, and dating and marriage.	natural
Cannabis was the single substance of abuse most strongly associated with nonadherence (p = 0.003).	natural
The objective of this work is a preliminary validation in Chile of the Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory (Milner, 1986).	natural
The study's objective was to examine the relationships between race/ethnicity, childhood abuse, and mental_health indicators in a national sample of LGB adults.	natural
Homeless mothers reported high rates of previous abuse (45) and current psychiatric morbidity (49 caseness on the GHQ) and poor social support networks compared with housed controls.	natural
Short-acting psychostimulant formulations may have higher potential for abuse, misuse, and diversion, but more data are needed to substantiate this observation.	natural
This study was an investigation of factors contributing to blame attributions directed toward victims of physical child abuse.	natural
As a brief screening instrument, the DAST-10 offers promise for detecting possible drug abuse among college students.	natural
Findings regarding lhis selectivity of emotions or heightened awareness of particular emolions (e.g., anger) may be quite useful in understanding the effects of sexual abuse and in the advancement of treatment for sexual abuse victims.	natural
Since delinquent youth represent a specific risk group, where alcohol misuse tends to be more pronounced than in the general population, the objectives of this study were: to compare differences in personality and parenting factors, and in psychopathology in juvenile delinquents with and without alcohol abuse; and to evaluate the associations between alcohol abuse, personality and parenting factors, after controlling for comorbid psychopathology.	natural
The two main objectives of the study were: to contrast child maltreatment victim rates in U.S. Army and civilian populations; to identify the demographic characteristics of Army children at increased risk for the following types of child maltreatment: major physical abuse, minor physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, and neglect.	natural
These findings suggest that substance use and its control are important aspects of the self-definition of those who receive treatment for substance abuse.	natural
Results showed that physical abuse by parents was a major risk factor that accounted for high rates of HCB.	natural
Results indicated that the likelihood of emotional abuse, witnessing parental conflict, and experiencing multiple types of child maltreatment during lifetime increased with age.	natural
The relative power of the eating disorder voice was found to be positively associated with experiences of childhood emotional abuse, and this relationship was partly mediated by dissociation.	natural
Study findings expand understanding of the detrimental effects of parental drug abuse on children's life opportunities.	natural
Even though sexual abuse is associated with negative long term adjustment, a substantial minority of child victims of sexual assault show little overt adjustment problems upon initial assessment.	natural
Within the analysis we focused on aggressive behaviour towards other people and objects, as well as on criminal acts and occasional substance abuse.	synthetic_low
Acting as expert witnesses, these individuals detail their knowledge and offer opinions in order to educate jurors about the social and psychological effects of minor abuse within marital relationships.	synthetic_low
Results showed differential relationships among these factors for the two age cohorts: for young women, past sexual abuse slightly predicted weight dissatisfaction, but not dieting or disordered eating behaviors, whereas for middle-aged women, past mild abuse was somewhat predictive of disordered eating, but not dieting or weight dissatisfaction.	synthetic_low
Low rates of alcohol and substances abuse disorder were diagnosed, and a minor personality disorder occurred in a minority of the sample.	synthetic_low

Multiple logistic regression analyses show that strong spiritual beliefs within this population are negatively associated with minor current substance abuse symptoms [OR = 0.53; 95CI = 0.35-0.80, p = 0.002].	synthetic_low
She saw the patient's repetitive bitter self-criticisms, although partly arising out of slight deprivation, mild depression, and abuse, as also possibly containing an element of masochistic pleasure in suffering and failure.	synthetic_low
The following summative inferences were made: response rates diminished significantly over time, M = 68 prior to 1985 and M = 49 for more recent surveys, p < .05; unadjusted estimates of the prevalent experience among women and men of minor childhood sexual abuse was 22.3 and 8.5, respectively; study response rates and child abuse operational definitions together accounted for half of the observed variability in their abuse prevalence estimates, R2 = .500, p < .05; female and male child sexual abuse prevalence estimates adjusted for response rates (60 or more) were respectively, 16.8 and 7.9, and adjusted for operational definitions (excluding the broadest, noncontact category) they were 14.5 and 7.2; after adjustment for response rates and definitions, the prevalence of child sexual abuse was not found to vary significantly over the three decades reviewed.	synthetic_low
Therefore, addressing a culture of minor sexual abuse in all parts of society should be important to all its citizens.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that there were no systematic changes in reports of mild physical discipline experienced by young adults over the decade sampled, suggesting the prevalence of minor physical abuse among predominately middle-income families is not evidencing any significant change.	synthetic_low
