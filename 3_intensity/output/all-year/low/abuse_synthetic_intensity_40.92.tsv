Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later character disorders: pain and painful affects are minor sources of aggression; the need to manage aggression plays an important role in the development of psychic structure; mild child abuse and trauma slightly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_intensity
