The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether explicit and implicit vulnerability associations before and after trauma exposure predict the onset and persistence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
Among patients with severe TBI, higher haemoglobin levels and maintenance as a dedicated trauma admission are associated with higher survival to discharge.	natural
Children can experience a range of abuses (emotional, physical, sexual and neglect) within the context of family violence, and harm is cumulative and may present as complex trauma.	natural
The results of our study suggest that significant predictors of pain intensity among chronic pain sufferers were trauma symptoms.	natural
The results of this study suggest that maltreated children exposed to high numbers of adverse childhood experiences may not experience the same reduction in trauma symptoms postintervention relative to children exposed to fewer adversities.	natural
Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed gender differences in health outcomes and evaluated physical and sexual trauma as possible moderators of these outcomes.	natural
The present study tested whether borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by specific worldviews as hypothesized by cognitive models, using Janoff-Bulman's [(1989) Social Cognition, 7, 113-136] world assumptive model of negative effects of trauma.	natural
The process of setting up the work is described, as well as the challenges and dilemmas of offering an intervention in extremely unsafe and insanitary conditions, where for most the experience of trauma was ongoing.	natural
Participants indicated that teachers might not readily connect childrens behaviors and emotions to trauma.	natural
Interventions to address stress and trauma are needed to improve HIV outcomes.	natural
Trauma and positive experience essays contained more emotional content than the control essays and such content was of a similar percentage to that demonstrated by past research.	natural
In principle, pain is awareness of tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	natural
Children (13-18 months, 20-25 months, and 26-34 months) who had experienced trauma injuries were recruited in a hospital Emergency Room and subsequently interviewed about them within days (if verbal) and after 6, 12, and 18 or 24 months.	natural
These 'schizotypal' beliefs and experiences have been associated with a history of trauma, and are also recognised as a risk factor for the transition to psychosis.	natural
Early hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response may impact initial trauma experience, with downstream effects on posttrauma adjustment reflected in posttrauma neurobiology, psychological health, and physical health.	natural
In conclusion, the Persian version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire showed acceptable psychometric properties.	natural
This study provides further support for the critical intersection between cognitive processing and disclosure, while also suggesting the need for more research on the intra- and inter-personal dimensions of these constructs in negative and constructive outcomes after trauma.	natural
Following viewing an analogue trauma film, frequency of filmrelated intrusions and associated distress levels were measured and at 1week followup.	natural
Implications for trauma and memory development and for translational research are discussed.	natural
Parents completed the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test, the SNAP-IV, the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey Parent version, and additional questions.	natural
Depressive symptomatology was associated with insecurity but not with unresolved loss or trauma, whereas adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved.	natural
This study examines whether severity of chronic stressors and exposure to trauma are prospectively associated with course of illness among bipolar patients.	natural
In Estonia head trauma incidence is especially high in children up to 4 years.	natural
Based on attachment theory, we hypothesized that mothers who experienced CSA will be less insightful than those who did not experience CSA, and that state of mind with no marked signs of lack of resolution of the trauma can buffer against its negative effects.	natural
The application of the Trauma Outcome Process model in assessing children with sexually abusive behavior problems is discussed and specific steps are provided to guide the assessment process.	natural
This is a program evaluation of treating sexual trauma in a residential substance abuse treatment program for women.	natural
Seventy-five subjects participated in the study, all hospital trauma patients at an urban regional trauma centre, who had been referred to the neuropsychology consult service for cognitive testing.	natural
In contrast to Caffey's descriptions, we found the perpetrator to be more often male, fractures to be more often to ribs rather than long bones, and admissions of shaking and other trauma more often made.	natural
Holocaust and Nazi concentration camp survivors were subjects to prolonged and multi-dimensional trauma and stress.	natural
The question whether mild depression is related to lesser trauma as part of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) itself or whether it represents autonomous symptoms occurring separately (from PTSD) has not been answered.	synthetic_low
While being very resource-saving psychosomatic centers offer targeted applications in the network of all actors in refugee care especially when combined with well-trained volunteers and language mediators, informed on the issue of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
While much research has been undertaken on the impact of mild trauma on both adults and children, research to explore the effect of trauma on people in the context of their various cultures, especially people of refugee background, remains at an early stage.	synthetic_low
The research was guided by the belief that the practice of vegetalismo (a South American healing tradition that uses plant teachers for healing) holds important lessons for guiding women's sexual/spiritual lives and possibly for future plant-facilitated psychotherapy for women who have experienced mild sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
Although there is little doubt that they will relieve the mild mood disturbance of moderate mental and physical trauma, they may somewhat aid the process of denial.	synthetic_low
The percentage of primary care patients with bipolar disorder was measured in 4 studies of patients with depression, 1 study of patients with mild trauma exposure, 1 study of patients with any common psychiatric complaint, and 1 study of patients with generally unexplained symptoms.	synthetic_low
Few studies have addressed the association between minor forms of trauma and general mental health issues among incarcerated women.	synthetic_low
Graded slides of minor physical trauma geared towards wound identification are paired with gentle relaxation exercises.	synthetic_low
Stepwise regression analysis in the patient population indicated that a number of parameters were statistically of minor predictive importance: mild comorbidity, sex, and minor neurological complication at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Irrespective of the nature and magnitude of mild trauma, the single most outstanding predictor of future positive adjustment and resilience was the nature of the parent-child tie.	synthetic_low
