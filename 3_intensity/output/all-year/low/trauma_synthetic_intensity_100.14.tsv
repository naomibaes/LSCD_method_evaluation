The most clinically significant changes were mild and undetected brain trauma (22.9), subtle toxicity patterns (22.9) and the occasional need for a structural imaging study (9.2).	synthetic_low
Together they develop strategies and interventions that are therapeutic and address the mild impact of trauma on all aspects of the child's development and wellbeing.	synthetic_low
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the trauma mildly and were only somewhat hindered in their daily functioning, so psychological help was considered helpful but not imperative.	synthetic_low
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, mild trauma exposure history and minor symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	synthetic_low
The multivariate relationship between mild interpersonal trauma, moderate posttraumatic stress, some affect dysregulation, and various avoidance behaviors was examined in a sample of 418 trauma-exposed participants from the general population.	synthetic_low
DESNOS also predicted treatment outcome on PTSD and quality of life measures after controlling for the effects of ethnicity, moderate war zone trauma exposure severity, initial level of mild symptomatic severity or quality of life, Axis I (PTSD and major depression) and Axis II (personality disorder) diagnostic status, and minor early childhood trauma history.	synthetic_low
First, the mild trauma from sexual abuse, being somewhat outside the realm of usual human experience, creates a minor breach in the family's adaptive and protective shield, including its shared values and beliefs.	synthetic_low
The strongest effect across samples was found for slightly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with mild PTSD, and there was some evidence that mild trauma exposure is uniquely associated with slightly worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_low
For both outcomes of quality of life and social support, longitudinal research is required to fully understand these complex relationships as they evolve along the mild trauma spectrum.	synthetic_low
I posit that a triad of minor childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a mild trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a limited trauma-response framework.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that these mild trauma variables would predict minor fluctuations in financial and physical health among Cambodians in the United States.	synthetic_low
The results show that particular PTSD dimensions are mildly interrelated; namely, there is a notable correlation between avoidance and reexperiencing mild trauma on one hand and slightly increased arousal on the other.	synthetic_low

When minor trauma affects a University workforce, health and productivity are somewhat compromised, and an organized response can help lessen the emotional impact and accelerate recovery of function.	synthetic_low
Significant associations between minor maternal trauma and child behavior in dyads that share only environment (i.e., AMAC dyads) suggest a mild environmental mechanism of influence for maternal trauma.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that throughout the minor traumatic event, participants used a subtle process of negotiation, in which they attended to both familiar or normal aspects of everyday life, and the manageable or different aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Two different pathways burying the past and reifying the past emerged, encompassing the children's contrasting patterns of gentle information processing regarding minor loss and trauma (dismissing or lightly preoccupying) and representation of the past (distant-buried or simply-reconstructed).	synthetic_low
