This paper attempted to (a) introduce the notions of relief and relaxation as they relate to the framework of elicitation theory; (b) emphasize and exploit that aspect of the theory that deals with the extinction of learned behavior, especially behavior that is in some way mediated by aversive stimuli; and (c) show how the data and theory probably relate to: high resistance to extinction of some fears and avoidance responses, generalized anxiety and its treatment, implosive therapy or flooding, and relief therapy.	natural
Avoidance and minor hyperarousal in response to reminders of socially stressful events were common among patients; more than one-third would have met criteria for PTSD if these events satisfied DSM-IV PTSD Criterion A. Frequency of this PTSD-like symptom pattern did not significantly differ among patients who did and did not experience another event that did satisfy PTSD Criterion A. Implications of these findings for the treatment of social anxiety disorder are discussed.	synthetic_low
