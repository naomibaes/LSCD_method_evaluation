The model comprises three important clinical actions: insuring that patients have the right information and know how to adhere including listening to patients concerns, encouraging their participation and partnership in decision-making, building trust and empathy, and enhancing recall; helping patients believe in their treatment and become motivated to commit to it that is, addressing the cognitive, social, cultural normative and contextual factors that affect patients beliefs, attitudes and motivation; and assisting patients to overcome practical barriers to treatment adherence and develop a workable strategy for long-term disease management including assessing and enhancing patients social support, identifying and treating their depression and helping patients overcome cost-related treatment barriers.	natural
