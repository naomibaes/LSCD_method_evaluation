Phobias are found to be the most common psychiatric disorder in the community, more common than mild major depression or moderate alcohol abuse or dependence in the month prior to interview.	synthetic_intensity
Strong support was found for the hypothesis that, compared with siblings from nonantisocial families, those from antisocial families would have more psychopathology (ADHD, mild depression, substance use, and conduct disorders).	synthetic_intensity
Women with a mild history of depression may be candidates for routine cardiovascular risk factor prevention therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Although the number, shape, and predictive validity of internalizing trajectory classes were similar across gender, trajectory classes' initial values and rates of change varied slightly across gender, as did the mild impact of maternal postpartum depression and anxiety on latent growth factors.	synthetic_intensity
Function in reward circuits appears to be best understood as coordination of regions within frontostriatal circuitry, and slight alterations to this circuitry could occur in those with a history of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
