Results showed a gentle association between initial, moderate depression and various categories of mild subjective stress; a modest reduction in subjective (but not objective) event-related stress coincident with gentle remission; positive relationships between everyday life events and response and maintenance and between minor difficulties and relapse; and a somewhat higher event profile among unipolar depressive patients.	synthetic_low
The corticosteroid group was somewhat more affected by depression than the comparison group over time as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F = 3.98, p < 0.02), and slightly more anxious, as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (p < 0.10).	synthetic_low
