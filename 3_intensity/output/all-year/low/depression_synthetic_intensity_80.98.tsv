Internal, stable, global attributions about the diagnosis were associated with greater depression at followup for subjects who were initially high on the depression measure but were related to lowered depression for individuals with initially low depression.	natural
Pure MDD had risks not shared by pure GAD, in domains of family history (of depression) and personality (low positive emotionality).	natural
Logistic regression showed that increasing age appeared to decrease the risk for mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, no correlation was seen between gCBF and HRSD, GAF, severity and duration of the depressive episode, or mild melancholia-type depression.	synthetic_low
The underchosen were more likely to be described with traits indicative of introversion and some negative emotionality: slight unhappiness, occasional moodiness, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Using logistic regression, correlates of possible mild depression were identified and interestingly, patients with cancer were notably less inclined to display symptoms of mild depression (AOR 0.37, 95 CI 0.2-0.6).	synthetic_low

It is concluded that more detailed specification of criteria is desirable if the comparative epidemiology of dementia and mild depression in old age is to advance.	synthetic_low
BDII vs. BDI outpatients had statistically similar prevalence (51.7 vs. 48.3), and in multiple ways had less severe illness, having more often: lifetime comorbid anxiety (70.8 vs. 58.4) and mild personality (15.4 vs. 7.4) disorders, first-degree relative with mild mood disorder (62.3 vs. 52.3), less than 10 prior mood episodes (80.0 vs. 50.9), current mild syndromal/subsyndromal depression (52.3 vs. 38.4), limited current antidepressant use (47.3 vs. 31.3), prior year slow cycling (33.6 vs. 13.4), childhood onset (26.2 vs. 16.0), as well as a later onset age (17.08.6 vs. 18.98.1 years), shorter illness duration (19.013.0 vs. 16.113.0), and slightly higher current Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder-Overall Severity (4.11.4 vs. 3.71.5).	synthetic_low

A basic family-systems model of mild depression is briefly presented and discussed.	synthetic_low
A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and an extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the moderate scores of self-reported anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and mild depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the controlled indices of anxiety expression style, and the bioclinical measures (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, urea and lip concentrations).	synthetic_low
Mild depression, occasional anxiety, and substance dependence were the most common comorbid diagnoses.	synthetic_low
The correlation between the BAI and Diary Anxiety was significantly higher than that between BAI and Diary Depression, and, compared to Trait Anxiety, the BAI was slightly less confounded with mild depression as measured by the BDI.	synthetic_low
Future studies using an intra-individual approach are warranted to further examine individual changes in mild anxiety and depression over time in CAD, and PCI in particular, as a means to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.	synthetic_low
IGD accounted for a larger proportion of unique variance in disability than anxiety and ADHD, and a comparable proportion to mild depression.	synthetic_low
In 1982, we proposed a new animal model of mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low
Minor depression was found in equal proportions in pain and non-pain patients.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it was found that IU was related with symptom levels of GAD, OCD, and social anxiety, but not mild depression, when controlling the shared variance among these symptoms.	synthetic_low
Both versions demonstrated predicted correlations with previously published measures of mild guilt and related affects, such as slight shame and low-level depression, and with a balanced attributional style.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that if early childhood temperament is a minimal risk factor for depressive disorders, it should be associated with less significant risk markers, such as occasional parental depression.	synthetic_low
The purpose of the study was to examine whether mild pain and some functional impairment mediate the association between diabetes-related medical symptoms and mild depression in type 2 diabetes.	synthetic_low
Empirical fit was found for a structural equation model that depicted the combined influences of mild sociodemographic factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, age, parity), everyday stress (partner conflict and routine life events), and adequate social support on mild symptoms of depression and anxiety, chi2 (df 51) = 310.65, p <.05; CFI=.91.	synthetic_low
In this study, 139 black urban sixth-grade children were gently surveyed using the Child Depression Inventory for signs of mild depression.	synthetic_low

Voice acoustical analyses may provide a helpful compliment to the standard clinical interview for mild depression.	synthetic_low
The scores of patients with SAD indicated slightly higher anxiety and mild depressive states than those in HCs on several measures: Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS).	synthetic_low
The participants were randomized either to receive spiritual care or not and Hamilton anxiety rating scale-A (HAM-A), Hamilton depression rating scale-D (HAM-D), WHO-quality of life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) and Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy Spiritual well-being (FACIT-Sp) were assessed before therapy and two follow-ups at 3 and 6 week to evaluate subtle depression.	synthetic_low

Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in mild anxiety and low-level depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	synthetic_low
Minimal social support partially mediated the relationship between strengths and mild depression, but did not mediate the relationship between strengths and life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
However, research has not examined how self-esteem functions with mattering in the link between perfectionism and mild depression.	synthetic_low
We found a small, mildly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; some heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were slightly more negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., slight depression, mild anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were marginally lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a general cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with somewhat negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_low
The treatment of mild depression in cardiovascular disease patients may therefore benefit from a light psychological intervention focused on patients' illness representations, modest self-efficacy beliefs, and their perceived social support.	synthetic_low
