GAD is present in 14 and mild symptoms of anxiety in 40 of patients with diabetes who participate in clinical studies.	synthetic_low
Forty-eight female subjects were divided into somewhat high and low anxious groups on the basis of their Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale scores and resting level electrodermal activity.	synthetic_low
Both stressors have been suggested to model hyperarousal and mild anxiety aspects of PTSD in humans.	synthetic_low
Health care professionals should therefore consider providing intervention for pessimists, as well as for patients with slightly high anxiety scores at time of diagnosis.	synthetic_low

In one course, mild anxiety was higher for the hard-to-easy arrangement; in the other course, mild anxiety was higher for the random arrangement.	synthetic_low
These results support the notion of chronic worry as a mild state of anticipatory anxiety, accompanied by indices of slightly reduced vagal control, that modulates non-cued defense reactions.	synthetic_low
These enduring effects have been most clearly demonstrated with respect to mild depression and the anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
