Cross-sectional and prospective regression analyses broadly examined relationships between validated measures of disability level, psychological flexibility (experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, and valued living) and illness perceptions (a psychological variable with minor influence in muscle disorders), and outcomes (life satisfaction, mild anxiety, and depression).	synthetic_intensity
Youth also completed a gentle version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED).	synthetic_intensity
