Next, we review studies on NVSC expression, which pinpointed links between social anxiety and disturbances in eye gaze, facial expressivity, and vocal properties of spontaneous and planned speech.	natural
The measure appears to be a reliable, valid measure of cognitions associated with social anxiety.	natural
Diagnoses included: depression (24.4 ), anxiety (21.9 ), attention deficit disorder (7.8 ), post-traumatic stress disorder (3.3 ), and psychotic disorders (3.3 ).	natural
Results showed that (a) high depression and anxiety at the beginning of a school year predicted lower GPA during that school year, and (b) low GPA in any school year predicted higher depression and anxiety at the beginning of the following school year.	natural
Furthermore, emotion and attention affect response time, and anxiety modulates these effects.	natural
Results indicate that children with asthma did not show greater anxiety, psychological adjustment difficulties and parent-child relationship problems compared with those without chronic illness.	natural
Anxiety and depression were associated with a number of urinary symptoms and were not exclusive to urge incontinence.	natural
Cognitive-behavioral anxiety management techniques, along with study and test-taking skills, are taught in the context of a supportive group environment such that students learn skills to manage their test anxiety while realizing that they are not alone in their struggles.	natural
Thirty-one percent of patients scored > or = 8, and 12 > or = 11 on the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), indicating that anxiety rates in patients in long-standing remission do not greatly differ from patients with active disease.	natural
Ninety-nine children (815 years) with mTBI and one of their parents completed the Behavioural Assessment Scale for Children version 2 to assess child hyperactivity, anxiety and depression at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months post-injury.	natural
The patient showed significant improvement on measures of character pathology, object relations, mentalization, and superego anxiety.	natural
The phenotype includes hyperactivity, short attention span, emotional problems including anxiety, social avoidance, poor eye contact, and hyperarousal to sensory stimuli.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that higher parental perceptions of child vulnerability predicted increased child depressive symptoms and anxiety.	natural
Contrary to expectations, no film nor anxiety effect nor any interactions were significant.	natural
Moreover, of those who recovered from their first episode of anxiety disorder, many had experienced recurrence before interview.	natural
The present review will focus on the role of top-down processes that occur before stimulus onset in the perceptual and attentional prioritization of threatening stimuli in anxiety.	natural
Anxiety is inversely related to brain activity associated with the cognitive regulation of emotions.	natural
Vigilance is a reflection of anxiety, and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals.	natural
Heightened anxiety, depression, and anticipatory grief were associated with child's age at diagnosis, parent's HIV status, and parent's relationship to the child.	natural
The development of evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders is a major achievement of clinical psychology, and cognitive behavior therapy is the best-established and most widely used method.	natural
Experiment 2 demonstrated that the high social anxiety group who engaged in a ruminative response style recalled memories with the highest average anxiety rating.	natural
This study examined the role of emotional lability and negative affect and emotional regulation in the relation between maternal trait anxiety and attentional and social problems, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of 275 six- to eleven-year-old children.	natural
Study benchmarks, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome measures, and definitions of response were designed to match those of the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS).	natural
Further, parent anxiety symptoms moderated the relationship between parent and child externalizing symptoms, such that the strength of this relationship was reduced in the presence of high levels of parent anxiety symptoms.	natural
Specifically, parents of adolescents with anxiety disorders showed higher intrusiveness and lower warm engagement than parents of non-anxious adolescents.	natural
We present factor analytic data showing that health anxiety forms a separate factor from positive and negative affectivity, alexithymia forms a factor outside the FFM and while emotional empathy loads with agreeableness, cognitive empathy forms a separate factor outside the FFM.	natural
Hypotheses regarding the role of both aging and anxiety on cognitive control, the bi-directionality between anxiety and cognitive control, and the potential for specific symptoms of anxiety (particularly worry) to mediate this association, are specified and discussed.	natural
A self-report measure, the Core Extrusion Schema measure (CES) was developed to measure aspects of self-concealment that should be related to social anxiety, including perceived present rejection, belief that ones true self would be socially rejected, attempts to hide ones true self, and attempts to avoid scrutiny.	natural
Results of latent growth curve models indicated that individuals initiating CBT subsequently reported large increases in perceived control and significant indirect effects of treatment on intraindividual changes in each of the four anxiety disorders examined via intraindividual changes in perceived control.	natural
Both reflection and brooding were significant mediators with respect to depressive symptoms, whereas brooding was the only significant mediator in relation to anxiety symptoms.	natural
Interpersonal cognitions were more strongly correlated with depression (mean r = .35) than with anxiety (mean r = .13).	natural
Mild anxiety symptoms were somewhat negatively correlated with social acceptance, but these associations were not unique to social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Mild fear of positive evaluation (FPE) has been proposed to be a notable feature of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to be somewhat rooted, at least partly, in concerns of social reprisal due to positive impressions.	synthetic_intensity
Twentythree nurses and 21 teachers completed daily assessments of mood, alcohol and food intake, together with weekly measures of minor hassles, perceived stress, mild anxiety, depression and exercise behaviour, over an eightweek period.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, participants were assessed for past mild major depression, minor sleep related difficulties, a number of mild anxiety disorders, and some suicide ideation.	synthetic_intensity
Individual differences also mattered: comparative optimism was related negatively to mild anxiety and positively to defensiveness and self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
The results included the finding of mild associations for conduct disorders with the delinquency scale, for affective disorders with the somewhat depressed scale, and for both affective and mild anxiety disorders with the broad-band internalizing scales.	synthetic_intensity
Both physical discipline and firm verbal discipline had direct effects on mothers' reports of children's mild anxiety and aggression; three of these four links were gently mediated by children's perceptions of maternal hostility.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety also fits as an additional mediator (2 = 4.135, p = .247, CFI = .992, RMSEA = .055).	synthetic_intensity
The relative saliency of social comparison and mild anxiety reduction as motives for affiliation under conditions of discomfort was examined within a cross-cultural context.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas low self-esteem increased adolescents' vulnerability for both depressive and mild anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem contingency appeared as a unique vulnerability factor for anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
