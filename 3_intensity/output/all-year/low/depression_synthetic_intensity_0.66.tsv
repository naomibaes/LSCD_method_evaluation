The findings broadly support the notion that depression is uniquely characterised by reduced enjoyment of approach goal pursuit whereas anxiety is uniquely characterised by pursuit of goals in order to avoid negative outcomes.	natural
A number of 14-16 year old Finnish adolescents taking part in the School Health Promotion Study (n=8787 in 1995, n=17643 in 1997) were surveyed about bullying and victimization in relation to psychosomatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, eating disorders and substance use.	natural
Poor adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens can be aggravated by psychiatric problems, including depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
In a prospective and naturalistic setting, two samples representing 209 depressed inpatients were assessed for thyroid functioning at admission before antidepressant treatment, and for depression before and after 1 month of antidepressant treatment.	natural
Furthermore, multivariate analyses indicated that cognitive vulnerability and frontal asymmetry represented shared, rather than independent, predictors of first depression onset.	natural
Participants with elevated depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory scores >or= 13) were characterized by impaired posterror and postconflict performance adjustments, especially during emotionally negative task-related feedback.	natural
Here, we compare associations between maternal and paternal antenatal depression and anxiety with offspring anxiety disorders, thus controlling for some genetic and shared environmental factors.	natural
These results tend to suggest that the inner representation of hysterectomy plays a great role in the development of depression associated with this intervention.	natural
Although participants were asked to report only physician-diagnosed conditions, the association between depression and physical illness may have been due to depressed individuals perceiving themselves as more ill than they were.	natural
Given the emphasis on within-subject associations between depression and marital quality in recent theory and practice, this study was undertaken with three goals: to examine within-subject associations between depressive symptoms and marital quality over time, to address gender differences in the magnitude and direction of these associations, and to determine whether neuroticism moderates the strength of these associations.	natural
Poststroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychological sequel after stroke.	natural
We aimed to investigate structural abnormalities in first-episode remitted geriatric depression (RGD) using optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in closely matched patients and healthy controls, and examining the relationship of performances on neuropsychological tests with regional white matter volumes.	natural
Results supported a stress reactivity model in that stressful events led to elevations in the rate of depression change.	natural
Patients improved significantly over the course of treatment, with reductions in both BDD and depression symptoms.	natural
We investigated whether depressive symptoms, assessed by the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), predicted change in physical function in elderly adults.	natural
Women with mentors reported significantly lower levels of depression and anxiety than those without mentors despite similar levels of stress exposure and overall support resources.	natural
Participants with depression evaluated the poems.	natural
Furthermore, self-rating questionnaires were used to assess somatic symptom severity (PHQ-15), depression severity (PHQ-9) and anxiety severity (GAD-7).	natural
Data from a large cohort, the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used (n = 1,944), which included 676 currently depressed and/or anxious patients, 831 remitted patients, and 437 healthy controls.	natural
The ENRICHD trial enrolled post-MI patients with depression, low perceived social support or both.	natural
Although minor depression is rarely investigated in elderly persons with MCI, nearly 20 of patients with MCI seem to suffer from MinD. No data was found on the prevalence of MCI in patients with MinD. Risk factors associated with MinD include female gender, history of cerebrovascular diseases, generalized anxiety disorder, loneliness, and long-term institutional care.	natural
The data showed that depression is also metaphorically construed as a place in space or as an opponent.	natural
The aim of this study was to compare conversion disorder patients with healthy controls in terms of temperament and character, and to determine the effect of these characteristics on comorbid depression, based on the idea that conversion disorder patients may have distinctive temperament and character qualities.	natural
Similarly, we note that poor marital quality predicts subsequent depression.	natural
BEfree was effective in eliminating BED; in diminishing eating psychopathology, depression, shame and selfcriticism, bodyimage psychological inflexibility, and bodyimage cognitive fusion; and in improving obesityrelated quality of life and selfcompassion when compared to a WL control group.	natural
Anorexics (n = 12) reported higher levels of anxiety and depression than the other groups.	natural
The Anxiety, Depression, Somatization, Alcohol Abuse, Inattention, and Hyperactivity subscales of the K-BASC-2 SRP-COL also demonstrated strong convergent validity statistics with criterion measures of related constructs.	natural
We provide some preliminary evidence for a negative urgency subtype of PTSD characterized by greater depression and anger regulation difficulties; and underscore addressing emotional regulation skills for these subgroup members.	natural
Drawing from animal studies showing that reduced neuroplasticity mediates effects of inflammation on depression, we hypothesized that individuals genetically predisposed to lower levels of neuroplasticity would be more susceptible to inflammation-associated depression.	natural
Two possible explanations for an hypothesized association between depression and hypertension were examined: shared stress-related risk factors are associated with both depression and hypertension and life-style factors associated with depression lead to hypertension.	natural
As in the United States (U.S.), increased medication usage and comorbid conditions were associated with depression, with depressed subjects showing increased use of medications and increased number of comorbid conditions.	natural
Despite numerous life changes, the Rajneeshees showed few signs of psychological distress as measured by depression (via the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Radloff, 1987) and as measured by anxiety and somatization (via the Symptoms Checklist; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973).	natural
This research has indicated that present depression scales may yield many false positives for depression because of the large number of somatic items that these scales contain.	natural
A total of 154 college students completed measures of hopelessness, negative life stress, and depression.	natural
Although the effect of other factors, such as anxiety or depression on the PSI remain to be determined, these data hold forth the hope that the PSI will prove to be particularly sensitive to many forms of brain dysfunction.	natural
Family structure was related to depression, but not after family processes were partialled out.	natural
Mothers at risk for depression when infants were 6 weeks showed less appropriate mind-mindedness at 4 months.	natural
Our arguments for directing attention away from diagnosing depressive disorder are: depressive disorder is a diagnosis by agreement and therefore relative, so there are other ways to look at problems than though psychiatric glasses; depression has unclear boundaries with other mental_disorders and with normality; depression is often not an adequate summary of the real problems of the patient; the patient often has a very different conception about what is wrong and often does not agree with the proposed presence of a mental_disorder; to diagnose depressive disorder may have more disadvantages than advantages for the patient;.	natural
Although depression severity and use of tricyclics also showed a significant relationship with remission duration, the model including these variables was not adequate to explain our data.	natural
The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 43.25, with a mean MMSE score of 23.324.4, and the depression was 47.0 and 6.163.4.	natural
The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess depression.	natural
