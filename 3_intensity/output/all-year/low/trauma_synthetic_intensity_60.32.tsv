Dissociative symptoms were significantly related to childhood emotional abuse; however, other forms of childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder status were not.	natural
When a patient experiences the effects of severe trauma and is very dissociative, as in the case presented, it is difficult to track and reflect upon these processes as they occur, making it virtually impossible to become and remain empathically attuned to his many self states.	natural
In addition, they presented with more history of trauma, especially violent trauma, psychiatric comorbidity, recent psychotropic use, and side effects.	natural

Intervening in the current debate about an overemphasis on the individual in classical psychoanalytic trauma theory and the demand for a prioritization of the group in postcolonial trauma studies, this article proposes that Anton Nimbletts short stories Ring Games and titular Sections of an Orange from his 2009 collection invite a postcolonial, post-Jungian optic because they portray the devastating effects of a colonized creative unconscious on the characters Self, relationships, and the collective.	natural
Implications pertaining to trauma assessment are discussed.	natural
Results are consistent with the premise that combat trauma results in hyperactivation in the ACC in response to combat stimuli, and, via its effect on PTSS, is associated with deficits in cognitive performance in the presence of combat stimuli.	natural

Despite the use of quantitative and qualitative data in trauma research and therapy, mixed methods studies in this field have not been analyzed to help researchers designing investigations.	natural
Along with the observed negativity bias in the assessment of emotional valence of faces, our data suggest stronger differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive faces with higher levels of trauma.	natural
First, we review theories and evidence on the relations between trauma, PTSD, and memory processes (particularly positive memories).	natural

I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mild trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_intensity

We investigated whether boundary restriction—misremembering proximity to mild traumatic stimuli—is a form of memory amplification and whether reexperiencing subtle trauma plays a minor role in boundary restriction errors.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest that mild trauma subtly shapes the way individuals relate to and experience their bodily sensations.	synthetic_intensity
