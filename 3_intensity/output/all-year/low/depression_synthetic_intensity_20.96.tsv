Although various mechanisms in the maternal transmission of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been investigated, it is unknown whether experiential avoidance (EA) is a vulnerability factor in the development of depression or a consequence of the illness.	natural
A family cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for parents with a history of depression and their 9-15-year-old children was compared with a self-study written information condition in a randomized clinical trial (n = 111 families).	natural
In a review of the literature from 1980 to 1994 on psychological and psychiatric problems in patients with cancer, the prevalence, severity, and the course of these problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress) were studied with the help of meta-analyses and qualitative analyses.	natural
Risk was greatest with acute or brief psychotic disorders (schizophreniform psychoses 50, brief psychoses 34.8, or unspecified psychoses 23.9), intermediate in major depression (15), schizophrenia (11.4) and delusional disorder (11.1), and lowest in bipolar-I (10.3) and schizoaffective disorders (8.2).	natural
Several specific predictions were made about the correlations between scores on the newly developed scale, another measure of self-esteem, a measure of depression, and a number of demographic variables.	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore whether autism symptom severity and caregiver depression affected adaptive behaviour in young children with ASD.	natural
This study investigates Beck's cognitive diathesisstress model of depression by comparing dysphoric and nondysphoric subjects on the Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale (SAS) and a self-report life event measure specially developed to assess subjects' perceptions of sociotropic and autonomous life events.	natural
This study examined the utility of the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) for predicting a diagnosis of a depressive disorder derived from the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [	natural

Before being classified as stage 2 treatment-resistant depression, these patients had been treated adequately with at least two tricyclic or heterocyclic antidepressants from different pharmacological classes (a minimum of the equivalent of 150 mg of imipramine for 4 weeks).	natural
A relationship of negative autobiographical memory processing, rumination, sad mood and depression on a neural level seems likely.	natural
Retrospective design, recall bias, lack of sample homogeneity, and insufficient assessment of hypomanic features during index depression.	natural
The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and other measures of depression and cognition were repeated.	natural
The mediator analyses suggested that the impact of submissiveness experiences in childhood on depression and anxiety is mediated by self-criticism.	natural
At all three time points, IPV was significantly associated with maternal depression, which in turn, was significantly related to higher levels of aggressive behavior.	natural
Serotonin transporter (SERT) binding is decreased in lymphocytes of depression patients and this decrease is partially reversed by antidepressant medication.	natural
This raises the possibility that changes in imipramine binding in depression and mania may be similar, consistent with the permissive hypothesis of serotonin function.	natural
Although there was some evidence that a state of depression strengthened correlation between harm avoidance and cooperativeness, the proposed factor structure of the TCI appeared, in general, robust against the state effect of depression, when the state was mild to moderate.	natural
The aim of this study was to field test a prototype protocol for the pharmacologic treatment of Major Depression.	natural
In contrast, depression and pain severity interacted to increase the use of cognitive strategies.	natural
This case study reveals that highly adaptive parents may be susceptible to depression when developmental events that signify imminent separation from their infants or a similar dramatic change in their relationship occur.	natural
Misuse of steroids needs to be considered in young physically active people presenting with depression.	natural
Findings confirm the extension of the risk of psychiatric disorders associated with prematurity to the late preterm group, and suggest that maternal depression may play a key role in this risk trajectory.	natural
Participants (N=118) read descriptions of two different clusters of treatments for depression, Insight-Oriented (IO) treatments and Activation-Oriented (AO) treatments.	natural
Our findings emphasize the potential importance of early programs for caregivers to ensure low initial levels of burden, which may have a positive effect on social support, depression, and anxiety.	natural
Additionally, lower levels of prolactin were associated with both increased feelings of burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness; however, these associations were not significant after controlling for depression.	natural

These findings suggest that the association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression reported by previous researchers may in fact be due to alternative risk factors.	natural
The highest symptom severity scores were found for children with high autonomic reactivity that, as infants, had experienced low father involvement and mothers with symptoms of depression.	natural
Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in both adolescents and adults.	natural
Beyond substantiating the hypothesis that the past and the future are differently faced by people with depression- and anxiety-related personality traits, the present findings suggest that temporal orientation of one's self may be greatly altered in anxiety and depression.	natural
Depressive symptoms were measured prospectively throughout the perinatal period in 83 women with histories of depression and/or anxiety.	natural
The relationship of depression to other dimensions of schizophrenia was explored.	natural
Both previous psychiatric history and current depression were indicators of a poor outcome.	natural
Mothers with depression in remission showed less emotional availability during mother-child interaction compared to healthy control mothers.	natural
Contrary to expectation, these data suggest that depression has no impact on objective neurocognitive functioning.	natural
In addition, patients with dysthymia reported having received significantly poorer parenting than those with episodic major depression.	natural
Studies have consistently shown cancer diagnosis and treatment to be associated with slightly increased, manageable depression.	synthetic_low
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that girls' slightly higher incidence of depression is due in part to minor negative self-perceptions, whereas positive interpersonal factors serve to protect them from mild depressive episodes.	synthetic_low
Sex and age differences on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale and the reliability of the scale among an elderly population of 1358 with mild depression symptoms were investigated.	synthetic_low
In an attempt to explore the somewhat relevant association of this framework to mild depression, moderate quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of milder forms of depression and of slight modification of the phenotype and typical course of depression.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of Zung's self-rating of mild depression as a basic screening device for early identification of students' minor potential adjustment problems.	synthetic_low
Control theory states that active, effective problem solving builds well-being; thus a sense of personal control and responsibility for both success and failure is associated with mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Specific and manageable risk factors related to poverty, gender, and race were found to predict mild major depression beyond traditional risk factors.	synthetic_low
