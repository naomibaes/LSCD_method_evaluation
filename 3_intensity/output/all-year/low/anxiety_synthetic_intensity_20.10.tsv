In all but one condition (the high-effort-exercise/high-response-uncertainty condition), when avoidance was expected to be easy or impossible (a) pulse rates were lower, (b) digital pulse volumes were higher (indicating reduced physiologic activity), (c) self-reported anxiety was lower, and (d) ratings of the stressor's unpleasantness were lower than they were when avoidance was expected to be difficult.	natural

Possession anxiety is a normal phenomenon, though it is most evident in sexual perversions and anorexia nervosa.	natural
We conclude that anxiety in youth with ASD is characterized by a set of unique features that must be considered in assessing anxiety in these youth and that test instruments must attend to various aspects of a complex validation process.	natural
These results suggest that while trait anxiety and music performance anxiety were closely associated, occupational stress makes a separate contribution to the quality of working life experienced by elite choral artists.	natural
Seven patients (mean age=31.14years, SD=12.28, range 19-48 years, 43 female, 86 Caucasian) with heterogeneous anxiety disorders (i.e., panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social anxiety, generalized anxiety) were assigned a randomized order of weeklong blocks utilizing either mindfulness- or avoidance-based strategies while ascending a 6-week emotion exposure hierarchy.	natural
Religiosity was related to lower state anxiety (r = -.27, p < .01) but only modestly related to lower trait anxiety (trait anxiety, r = -.18, p < .01).	natural
Only a few of the predictions received confirmation: inanimate movement (m) correlated, as expected, with MAACL anxiety and hostility, the egocentricity index (3r +/R (R = total responses) correlated significantly with self-esteem, and human movement with minus form level (M-) correlated (inversely) with ego strength.	natural
Greater weekly rumination was associated with greater weekly social anxiety, but reappraisal was not related to social anxiety.	natural
The results indicate that anxiety can be recognized by symptoms similar to those in non-autistic individuals, but signs of physiological arousal seem difficult to recognize in this population.	natural
One factor identified as important in anxiety disorders are intrusive mental images.	natural
Importantly, anxious individuals were not simply less discriminating in their face preferences generally: anxiety levels were positively related to the strength of overall preferences for positive social interest.	natural
Eighty undergraduate students completed the Anxiety Control Questionnaire.	natural
This paper presents a comparative study of the theories on anxiety formulated by Freud and Melanie Klein, with particular emphasis on the questions of its origin, its meaning for the individual and its function in both theoretical systems.	natural
Tests of a second-order model showed that the three factors loaded strongly on a single higher-order factor that was labeled Social Anxiety.	natural
Emotion dysregulation is one potential construct that may explain the association between anxiety sensitivity and hazardous drinking.	natural
Results showed that music therapy, when added to standard care, has strong and significant effects on global state, general symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, anxiety, functioning, and musical engagement.	natural
Chronic unavoidable social stress is considered a pathogenic factor, which leads to the development of depressive pathology and anxiety in mice.	natural
The Perceived Stress Scale, the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire and the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale were used to measure stress, coping and anxiety symptoms, respectively.	natural
Each adolescent completed a battery of questionnaires yielding measures of perceived attachment to mother and father, pubertal status, family expressiveness and cohesion, and feelings of depression and social anxiety.	natural
The study assessed the relationships between mental_health (loss, anxiety and depression), reconciliation sentiment (intra personal and interpersonal reconciliation sentiment), and dispositional forgiveness (lasting resentment, sensitivity to circumstances and unconditional forgiveness) among Rwandese survivors of the 1994 genocide.	natural
ANOVA revealed that high and low neurotics and extraverts became more irrational and increased in anxiety as problem relevance increased.	natural
The subjects were divided into four groups according to level of trait anxiety and rod and frame scores.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Intervention efforts addressing social anxiety and drinking should consider motives for drinking, as well as drinking patterns.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that higher unmedicated blood pressure (BP) values were associated with higher state anxiety but not trait anxiety or depression, after age, education, and sex were entered into the equations.	natural
Social anxiety also added to the model after controlling for all other measures.	natural
Regarding the cross-sectional results, it was found that the strength of the association of arthritis with mood and anxiety disorders was similar [odds ratio (OR)=1.48, 95 confidence interval (CI)=1.09-1.99 and OR=1.42, 95 CI=1.11-1.81, respectively].	natural
The data indicated that statistical test anxiety was somewhat different from general test anxiety.	synthetic_low
Among undergraduates, mild unpredictability and moderate control beliefs predicted anxiety, whereas mild unpredictability (pertaining to the self and others) and slight internality predicted frequency of drinking.	synthetic_low
Clinical outcomes for 4451 participants in 163 psychoeducational groups delivered across 5 services were analysed by calculating pre-post treatment anxiety (GAD-7) reduced effect sizes (Cohen's d).	synthetic_low
Insomnia at baseline was associated with mild depression, multiple sclerosis related mood symptoms, and anxiety.	synthetic_low

Despite an overall significant postoperative reduction of negative mood states, moderate levels of anxiety were found in a substantial minority of women both 2 (24) and 6 months (31) after surgery.	synthetic_low
We suggest that the slight memory impairments observed in our previous study weeks after withdrawal of alprazolam were not residual effects of alprazolam but rather were due to the drug's minor interference with practice effects on the tests and the mild habituation of anxiety over repeated exposure to the test situation.	synthetic_low
