Emotion-focused coping strategies significantly contributed for an additional 6.1, while the presence of a depression and/or anxiety disorder was not a significant predictor of LVEF at follow up, nor were dysfunctional and problem-focused coping strategies.	natural
This report details procedures to measure annihilation anxiety, a concept derived from Freud's 1926 formulation of traumatic anxiety.	natural
Overall, findings suggest that time 1 mindfulness is a significant predictor of time 2 general distress, anxiety, and the hyperarousal symptom cluster, but not time 2 total PTSD.	natural
The findings also converge with a broader literature suggesting that heightened reactivity to threat may be a shared vulnerability factor for anxiety and alcohol abuse and a novel prevention and intervention target for anxiety-alcohol abuse comorbidity.	natural
More positive speech evaluations were associated with corresponding reductions of performance anxiety.	natural
Scales that measure trait anxiety, dependency, flexibility, and self-control also were administered.	natural

Notably, the IBQ.2 was unrelated to measures of distress, including symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder, providing mixed evidence for the IBQ.2s construct validity.	natural
Number of cognitive behavioral therapy sessions predicted lower anxiety sensitivity at 3 and 12 months, and number of follow-up booster phone calls predicted lower anxiety sensitivity, less phobic avoidance, and less depression at 12 months.	natural
The main outcome measure was the incidence of depression and anxiety among women newly diagnosed with BC or GOC within 5 years after the first cancer diagnosis in German gynecologist practices.	natural
The present study tested how childhood anxiety was related to cognitive emotion regulation strategies and daily hassles, including whether regulation strategies mediate the relation between daily hassles and anxiety.	natural
In agreement with Saunders and co-workers, we found no correlation for E. Our results indicate that readiness to react to CO2 is related to anxiety (positive correlations for N, Hs, Pt and PF, and negative for Es).	natural
Attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, relationship equity, perceived partner infidelity, depression, stress, and hostility each differed by IPV profile (all P < .01).	natural
In groups of high (HSA) and low socially anxious (LSA) participants we recorded the startle reflex (Experiment I), and analysed event-related potentials (ERPs; Experiment II) while they viewed anxious facial expressions in the context of chemosensory anxiety signals and chemosensory control stimuli.	natural
Participants described problems consistent with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, and severe social stress and acculturation difficulties in every generation.	natural
Exposure therapists (N = 182) completed an online survey that included the Therapist Beliefs about Exposure Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, and the Broken Leg Exception Scale (BLES), a novel measure assessing the likelihood of excluding clients from exposure based on 25 different client characteristics.	natural
Anxiety and nervousness associated with competitions are considered to cause sleep impairments.	natural
The relatively lower prevalence rate of subthreshold GAD expression suggests possible cultural interferences in the reporting and manifestation of anxiety symptomatology.	natural
Since test anxiety is a situationspecific trait, an evaluationrelated stressor was used to trigger testanxious reactions.	natural
Insomnia increases the likelihood of developing a mood or anxiety disorder.	natural

We predicted that trait anger is associated with the decision to invest, whereas trait anxiety motivates individuals to avoid investments.	natural
As hypothesized, there was a statistically significant indirect association of subjective social status via emotion dysregulation in relation to depressive (B = 0.42, Bootstrapped 95 CI [0.81, 0.08], completely standardized estimate = 0.07), suicidal (B = 0.04, Bootstrapped 95 CI [0.10, 0.01], completely standardized estimate = 0.04), social anxiety (B = 0.09, Bootstrapped 95 CI [0.20, 0.02], completely standardized estimate = 0.05), and anxious arousal symptoms (B = 0.13, Bootstrapped 95 CI [0.28, 0.02], completely standardized estimate = 0.05), as well as number of depressive and anxiety disorder diagnoses (B = 0.03, Bootstrapped 95 CI [0.05, 0.004], completely standardized estimate = 0.06).	natural
Structural equation modeling demonstrated that parent race and socioeconomic status (SES) were powerful predictors of clinician-parent communication, parent anxiety and control as a result of the ICC, and parent understanding.	natural
Past-year prevalence rates and kappa statistics were calculated for four diagnostic categories: anxiety, mood, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and disruptive behavior disorders (DBD).	natural
Results demonstrate that the relation between internalizing symptoms and social functioning among young adolescents with ADHD is nuanced, with social anxiety and anhedonia symptoms associated with lower social skills and social acceptance in contrast to harm avoidance being associated with higher ratings of social skills (and unrelated to social acceptance).	natural
