Although research has focused on delayed gains, the discounting of minor losses is potentially useful in precisely those areas where the discounting of gains has proved informative (e.g., substance use and mild abuse).	synthetic_intensity
Because of the recency of interest in this area, however, as well as the costs and time investment associated with more rigorous longitudinal research, many of these studies have used correlational designs and retrospective reports of minor abuse.	synthetic_intensity
