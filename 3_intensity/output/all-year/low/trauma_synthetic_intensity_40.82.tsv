There were no significant differences in tonic immobility between different types of trauma (e.g., physical abuse, assault or aggression, serious accident), except that the mean tonic immobility score was significantly higher in the group with trauma due to physical/psychological or sexual abuse than in the group with trauma due to receiving news of the mutilation, serious injury, or violent or sudden death of a loved one.	natural
Risk and predisposing factors include a history of previous emotional trauma or neurological injury involving the temporal lobe and hippocampus, the repetitive and prolonged nature of the trauma, and age and individual differences in baseline arousal and level of cortisol.	natural
We review four sets of studies conducted in four different cultures and with people who have experienced different types of trauma, which reveal this atypical response pattern and lend support to ABDT.	natural

The effects of early-life trauma and its consequences for the treatment of depression are reviewed.	natural
Previous work has identified differential DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotide sites genomewide between trauma exposed individuals with and without PTSD, suggesting a role for epigenetic potential-the capacity to epigenetically regulate behavior and physiology in response to lived experiences.	natural
A unique dataset of nonfatal firearm injury data are derived from official police reports, allowing the use of a medically validated measure of injury trauma in place of more typical injury indicators.	natural
Substance use is significantly associated with physical injury, yet relatively little is known about the prevalence of specific substance use disorders among trauma patients, or their associated sociodemographic characteristics.	natural
Next, the trauma system in Hong Kong is introduced.	natural
The participants reporting these distressing trauma dreams had more severe concurrent PTSD symptoms than those reporting other categories of dreams and had more severe initial and followup PTSD than those without dream recall.	natural
However, this cannot be determined until prospective studies measure hypnotizability in individuals before and after a potentially traumatizing event, perhaps by targeting populations that are at risk for experiencing trauma.	natural
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and mild trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more gentle role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating less pronounced affects and memory traces that are associated with early-onset relational disturbances mildly affected by the effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_intensity

Conversely, those participants who disclosed a minor trauma after interacting with a cold, distant experimenter did not experience increases in distress or report a significant amount of insight gained as the result of written disclosure.	synthetic_intensity
Receiving positive social support after a minor trauma generally is related to better adjustment to the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
There are suggestions that some PCS symptoms are mildly related to minor head trauma while others reflect situational variables or general psychological discomfort.	synthetic_intensity
Next, recent research on embodiment, early imitation, and mirror neuron functioning is reviewed, with an emphasis on those aspects most relevant to the clinical manifestations of mild early trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The core ASA class reported exposure to several traumatic experiences and IPV and showed a moderate pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing mild stressors and was comorbid with psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to trauma and stressors.	synthetic_intensity

Mildly unresolved childhood trauma has been somewhat correlated with slightly impaired and delayed cognitive, behavioral, and emotional functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Rapport/empathy and open-type questions were associated with an increased likelihood of suspects admitting the offence whilst describing mild trauma, and slightly negative questions were associated with a decreased likelihood.	synthetic_intensity
Although I share Rosbrow's view that After the Quake depicts a character's gradual awakening from the subtle dissociative manifestations of trauma, I spell out how my perspective on this process differs from his.	synthetic_intensity
With the aim of gently improving treatment outcome, cognitive behaviour therapy was added, involving mild imaginal exposure to trauma memories, along with cognitive restructuring.	synthetic_intensity

Therefore, the current study examines how mild trauma, everyday stressful events, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depressive symptoms are related to stable physical functioning and health utilization in HIV-infected men and women living in rural areas of the South.	synthetic_intensity

Cumulative trauma did not differ significantly between the dissociative and nondissociative groups of ASO, but mild physical abuse was slightly related to a diagnosis of dissociation in this sample.	synthetic_intensity
The present study concurrently examined protective factors associated with the adaptive outcomes of resilience and posttraumatic growth (PTG; defined as positive psychological change resulting from a minor life crisis or trauma), after accounting for relevant demographic factors and the subtle impact of circumstances surrounding childhood victimization (i.e., age of first trauma, frequency of victimization, and perception of mild trauma).	synthetic_intensity
