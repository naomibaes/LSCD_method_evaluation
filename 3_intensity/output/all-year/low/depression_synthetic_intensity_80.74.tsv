A better appreciation of the minor role of these mediators in mild depressive illness could lead to refined models of less severe depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a manageable whole body disease rather than just a mental illness, and to the rational development of new classes of medications to treat mild depression and its related medical comorbidities.	synthetic_low
Although a number of empirical studies have assessed cognitive factors in mild emotional disorders such as common depression and anxiety, preliminary research has yet to assess these variables simultaneously and with identical cognitive measures.	synthetic_low

Fourteen WISC subtest patterns that purport to differentiate behavioral disorders were applied to the WISC-R. Forty-one adolescent males referred as a result of conduct disorders were administered the WISC-R. In general, a group analysis showed a slight depression of verbal functions and satisfactory reliability.	synthetic_low

We evaluated whether mild, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) staging method was marginally associated with the possibility of suicide in a large U.S. health system.	synthetic_low
The results are consistent with a generalized risk factor model of mild depression transmission in high-risk families and suggest a pattern of moderate reactivity to adverse conditions among children of somewhat depressed women.	synthetic_low
Data analysis (based on the evaluation of circadian parameters, on the chronogram method and on the chronobiological analysis) revealed a clear NE circadian rhythm in normal subjects, a rhythm which was slightly disturbed in mild depression, with minor amplitude reduction and unusual phase position.	synthetic_low
Students with slightly negative cognitive styles, previously shown to be at moderate cognitive risk for mild depression, were predicted to have a somewhat greater history of negative childhood life events and mildly critical negative parental inferential feedback than were students at low cognitive risk for low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Specifically, we aimed to determine if the minor effects of anxiety and depression on alcohol-related problems are best explained via their associations with DTC with slight affects or via their associations with a more localized measure of DTC by testing four distinct models: the minor effects of anxiety/depression on alcohol-related problems mediated by DTC-anxiety only (Model, these minor effects mediated by DTC-depression only (Model, these minor effects mediated by a combined, localized DTC factor (Model, and these minor effects mediated by both DTC-anxiety and DTC-depression (Model.	synthetic_low
Interventions concerning the psychological management of mild bipolar depression and maintenance psychological treatments are going to be somewhat difficult to implement because of shortages of skilled staff, the absence of specific training and supervision, the requirements for staff to adopt practices that are slightly different from what they are used to, and some uncertainty about whether these interventions are effective in less severe patients.	synthetic_low
Grade of Membership (GOM) analysis, a straightforward multivariate technique for studying disease, was used to explore mild depressive typology and simple relationships between moderate depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
