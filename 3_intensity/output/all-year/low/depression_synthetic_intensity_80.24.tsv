We found a small, mildly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; some heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were slightly more negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., slight depression, mild anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were marginally lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a general cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with somewhat negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_low
