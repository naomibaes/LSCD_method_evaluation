Within the subgroups of patients with socially deviant (F60.0-2), emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of mild depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was slightly enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with socially dependent 'cluster C' PD (F60.5-7).	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that slightly senile Ss scored significantly higher on the SRDS than did the nonsenile Ss, that sex differences were not significant, that there were no significant differences between institutionalized and noninstitutionalized Ss of either sex in either the nonsenile or the slightly senile groups, and that further refinement of the SRDS and a longitudinal study of personality, experience, and mild depression would be extremely useful.	synthetic_intensity
