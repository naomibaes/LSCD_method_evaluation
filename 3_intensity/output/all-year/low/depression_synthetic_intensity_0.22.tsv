The main findings indicate that (a) there is an age-related decline for some cognitive domains (e.g., episodic memory, verbal fluency, visuoconstructive skill, psychomotor speed), but not for others (e.g., primary memory, visuoperceptive skill, motor-hand coordination), (b) multiple individual-difference variables within demographic (e.g., sex, education) life-style (e.g., activity levels), genetic (e.g., apolipoprotein E genotype), and health-related (e.g., vitamin B deficiency, depression, diabetes) domains are related to late-life cognitive functioning, (c) a potential for improving cognitive performance a reserve capacity is present also among very old adults, (d) the 2 most common dementia diseases, Alzheimers disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), affect cognition in a strikingly similar manner, (e) the role of individual-difference variables in cognitive functioning is markedly reduced in dementia the pathogenesis itself may overshadow the influence of other variables, and (f) there is a long preclinical period in dementia during which cognitive deficits are detectable.	natural
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification first of all the clinical typology of endogenous and reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	natural

Higher odds of major depression were found when women were late perimenopausal or postmenopausal relative to when they were premenopausal or early perimenopausal (OR = 3.01, 95 CI = 1.765.15, P < .0001).	natural
In the article best treatment of late-life depression is discussed and an alternative way of thinking in regard to psychotherapeutical intervention is suggested.	natural
Importantly, the studies that did emphasize younger patients suggested that the influence of depression on prognosis could be more robust in younger subgroups.	natural

Additionally, lower levels of prolactin were associated with both increased feelings of burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness; however, these associations were not significant after controlling for depression.	natural
