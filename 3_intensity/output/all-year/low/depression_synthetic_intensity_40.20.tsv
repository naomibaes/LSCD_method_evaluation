Far from confirming the hypothesis of a blunted PRL response in mildly depressed patients, our results suggest: that the short duration and minimal treatment resistance of depression may affect the PRL secretion, and that TRD and major depression may somewhat differ in biological relationship to suicidal behavior.	synthetic_low
We speculate that the slight elevation of the plasma biopterin levels in patients with mild depression was subtly related to the depressive state itself.	synthetic_low
