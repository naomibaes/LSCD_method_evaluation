This paper suggests a tentative hypothesis to explain the apparent paucity of dissociative disorder patients between the 1920s and the 1970s: that the trance phenomenon that is now so characteristic in patients who struggle with childhood trauma may be a manner of handling emotional distress specific to certain periods in American history.	natural
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, past trauma exposures and symptom severity.	natural
The second purpose was to critically review three dominant models explaining the relation between trauma and MUS (i.e. dissociation, conversion and hierarchical cognitive models).	natural

Application of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework proposed by NIMH to the study of child trauma exposure and subsequent impairment is an opportunity to examine domains of function and how they are impacted by trauma.	natural
Consistent with the hypotheses, world assumptions were related to the extent of trauma exposure and interpersonal trauma exposure in the sample but were not significantly related to non-interpersonal trauma exposure.	natural
The current study investigated the effects of combat exposure, childhood trauma, and depression on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity.	natural
The authors randomly allocated 118 civilian trauma survivors with PTSD to receive 8 individually administered sessions of either (a) imaginal exposure (IE), (b) in vivo exposure (IVE), (c) IE combined with IVE (IE/IVE), or (d) IE/IVE combined with CR (IE/IVE/CR).	natural
Multiple regressions of various types of traumas and cumulative trauma and depression were conducted.	natural
The apparatus described has connecting chutes between aquarium and apparatus which allows Ss to be transferred without trauma.	natural
DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and previous research suggest that the clinical presentation of PTSD varies by trauma type.	natural
Simultaneous logistic regression analyses were used to identify demographic correlates of specific trauma types.	natural
However, a growing body of evidence testifies to the positive effects that have been reported following trauma.	natural
Subjects with complex PTSD had significantly more physical abuse than those without complex PTSD, but did not differ in the other types of trauma.	natural
The following scopes can be differentiated: idealization, changing the therapeutic object into a triangulating one; negative transference of an archaic destructive mother imago, nevertheless also of the traumatic object, setting free hidden aggressive affects; emerging of the specific sexual trauma in transference and counter-transference.	natural

Suicide attempters with a family history of suicidal behavior and childhood trauma show specific characteristics that might be used to prevent future suicidal behaviors in this population.	natural
Direct and indirect exposure to trauma is related to cardiovascular reactivity to stress, which is a marker for the future development of cardiovascular disease.	natural
Fifty-one female Veterans with sexual trauma were randomly assigned to one of three treatments and completed pre- and post-treatment measures of psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and PTSD) and post-traumatic cognitions.	natural
Results show that PTSD symptoms fully mediated the association between non-interpersonal trauma and the use of substances to cope.	natural
Trauma in Kosovo was treated with Thought Field Therapy (TFT) during five separate trips by members of the Global Institute of Thought Field Therapy, in the year 2000.	natural
After controlling for initial PTSD and peritraumatic dissociation, 3 measures of increased physiological reactivity to the trauma monologue at 1 month predicted 3-month PTSD reexperiencing severity.	natural
Despite limitations, findings suggest distinct risk factors for suicide attempts and DSH, and highlight the importance of examining characteristics of the trauma and associated BPD and emotion dysregulation in assessing risk for SIB in PTSD.	natural
Our study empirically tested construal level theory in a population suffering from severe chronic trauma.	natural
Eight subjects (40) had past childhood trauma (CTQ+).	natural
Drawing on the 1541 French edition of John Calvins Institutes of the Christian Religion and on contemporary literature on trauma, I suggest that individuals who have experienced traumatic events may find in the Lords Supper a trustworthy and nourishing relational home, a therapeutic space for truth-telling, and a life-sustaining absolutism.	natural
In part, this is attributable to a scarcity of studies on trauma survivors own dream experiences, types of dream work that promote change and patients perspectives on outcomes.	natural
Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in relations among psychological trauma, dissociative phenomena, and various forms of trauma-related distress that has spawned a prolific amount of research.	natural
It is shown that Freud in the years 1893 to 1897 formulated three distinct and mutually incompatible theories of neurosis centred respectively on (a) psychic trauma and defence, (b) sexual trauma (seduction), and (c) repressed sexuality (libido).	natural
This report examines the relationship of trauma history to the likelihood of full or partial PTSD and MDD.	natural
Certain trauma characteristics and the way the trauma is processed may thus influence how personal memories are later remembered.	natural
Childhood maltreatment was measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
Both quantitative and qualitative data showed that home visitors were exposed to varying levels of EHS family risk and trauma, and that some home visitors were deeply affected by this exposure.	natural
The haunting presence of racial trauma infused the analysis.	natural
It suggests that this racist resurgence can be seen, in part, as a re-enactment of the trauma of the Civil War by the descendants, and those who identify with them, who were on the losing side of that conflict.	natural
Subjects were asked to read two vignettes each describing an aged trauma victim who had recently applied for treatment.	natural
Therapy with survivors and with their children requires a particular adaptation of analytical technique as what is at stake is not so much the analysis of the here and now of the transference and countertransference dynamics which indeed can in the early stages be counterproductive, but the capacity of the analyst to accept the reality of the trauma with all its devastating and mind-shattering emotions without losing the capacity to imagine and to play metaphorically with images, essential if the patient is to be able to create a space for representation.	natural
Additionally, the hippocampal and amygdala volumes showed no correlation with the time since trauma, CAPS score and gender, whereas the left hippocampal volumes were correlated with ICV, and the bilateral amygdala volumes were correlated with ICV and age in the PTSD+ group.	natural
One hundred male veterans completed a standard test battery that included the Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Dissociative Experiences Scale.	natural
