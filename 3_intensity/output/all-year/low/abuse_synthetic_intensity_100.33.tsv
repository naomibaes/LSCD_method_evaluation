Prevention efforts in mild alcohol and drug abuse have typically focused on the general population.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined associations among minor childhood abuse, slight emotion dysregulation, and possible posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within a sample of 93 substance use disorder (SUD) patients in residential treatment.	synthetic_intensity
In the last fifteen years a great deal of material has been published on the minor occurrences of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
There was no significant difference in the rate of any minor childhood life event, including mild childhood sexual abuse, or in the total number of minor childhood life events between women who experienced postpartum psychosis and those without a lifetime history of mild perinatal mood episodes, even after controlling for demographic and clinical differences between the groups.	synthetic_intensity
Art therapy research in the treatment of mild sexual abuse has mainly been concerned with the content of art expressions produced by clients (Spring, 1984; Ticen, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
Considering type of maltreatment, minor direct effects were found from mild physical abuse to age of alcohol initiation, and limited mediated effects were found from less severe sexual abuse and neglect to initial age of alcohol and marijuana use through externalizing behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Four empirically-derived clusters of family/case attributes are described and then discussed as representing separate etiologies of minor child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Mediational analysis found a significant mediation effect of disconnection or rejection on the relationship between minor child sexual abuse and displaced aggression; however, impaired autonomy did not mediate significantly.	synthetic_intensity
For example, in addition to experiencing minor or nonlethal forms of physical violence and mild psychological abuse, many women who try to leave, or who have left their male partners, are occasionally sexually assaulted.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 294 undergraduate women, several key findings emerged: (a) reported use of cognitive coping strategies significantly differed based on the mild type of abuse; (b) some minor differences in posttraumatic stress symptomatology emerged based on the mild type of abuse; (c) once the cognitive coping strategies were accounted for, the mild type of abuse was no longer associated with posttraumatic stress symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
The model analyzes retention rates and treatment dropout outcome to assess impact, and graduate outcome to assess the effectiveness of the various mild drug abuse treatment centers.	synthetic_intensity
The youths are subject to protection measures due to experiences of mild abuse and/or neglect.	synthetic_intensity

This study lightly examined the minor likelihood of reentry into foster care following reunification for children whose primary caretakers were stratified into groups based on the type of mild substance abuse cited as a primary reason for the initial removal: those with alcohol only involvement, those with drug only involvement, those with both alcohol and other drug involvement, and those with no alcohol or drug involvement.	synthetic_intensity
Indicated drug abuse prevention strategies may need to be slightly tailored to this subgroup when developing and implementing programming.	synthetic_intensity
The participants had a mean age of 41, four prior incarcerations, and documented minor difficulty with alcohol abuse prior to their incarceration.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggested that psychological abuse was a moderate predictor of IPV than other maltreatment types.	synthetic_intensity
Client peer groups in drug abuse treatment programs can be expected to mildly impact the treatment of drug abusers.	synthetic_intensity
The index was then applied to women who recovered vague memories of abuse; some had mild analogues of dissociation in their protocols and others did not.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were grouped according to their Axis I diagnoses: depression only, conduct disorder only, depression and minor substance abuse, conduct disorder and slight substance abuse, all three diagnoses, and none of the three diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, a history of childhood sexual abuse should be considered in planning interventions to address mild depression and minor behavioral problems on university campuses.	synthetic_intensity
Women in this study were slightly more likely to report minor instances of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, interventions focused on peer group dynamics might contribute to avoid power imbalances or to prevent power imbalances from resulting in minor power abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Next are considered conditions related to the involved children: mild problems with trusting the evaluator, ongoing psychological accommodation to the molester, less urgent need for decision-making with a moderately well-defended child, the child's slight amnesia, a child somewhat unconcerned about sex abuse, and mild psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Survivors of mild sexual abuse obtained significantly higher scores than those without such a history on the overall TSC-40 and on each of the six subscales, except the Depression subscale.	synthetic_intensity
