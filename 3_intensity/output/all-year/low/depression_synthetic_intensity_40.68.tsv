Children's mild depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with somewhat lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, but not concurrently, recognized with a slight increase in cortisol reactivity, acting as a gentle indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	synthetic_low

At age 36 years, minor anxiety and depression were assessed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), alongside routine measurements of blood pressure, pulse rate, waist-to-hip ratio, and standard levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, albumin, and glycosolated hemoglobin from which an average allostatic load was calculated.	synthetic_low
