Head injuries are frequent occurrences, and the majority are considered mild Most epidemiological studies have used hospitalized cases, and, as a result, those who sustain a head injury but do not receive intensive medical attention are not considered It can be assumed that those not receiving medical attention most likely sustained mild head injuries A few researchers have examined self-reported head injury, but the data is still limited Little is known about those individuals who incur head trauma and resume normal functioning without treatment The purpose of this study was to identify and describe the epidemiological correlates of head injury within a young high functioning population The present study examined head injury and its associated factors in a college sample, which included such areas as demographics, nature of head injury, and prevalence of postconcussion symptoms.	natural
