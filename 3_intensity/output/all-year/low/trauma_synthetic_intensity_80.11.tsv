In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_low
The convergent validity of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) was examined with a sample of 172 mildly affected outpatient treatment-seeking children and their caregivers.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that the presence of slightly disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its association with a brief coma and minor cognitive disturbances, is an indication of temporary changes to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	synthetic_low
Male veterans reported more childhood adversity and were more likely to have encountered a minor trauma in adulthood than non-veterans.	synthetic_low
Its most distinctive clinical characteristic is the mutually escalating interaction among four psychological and social features: volatile behavior; social discomfort and isolation; pronounced self-doubt; and the exceptionally vivid and persistent reexperiencing of mild psychological war trauma.	synthetic_low
Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed a significant effect of multiple minor interpersonal trauma experiences on severity of behavioral problems above and beyond all aforementioned variables (internalizing =.12, p = .019, externalizing = .11, p = .036, total = .14, p =.008).	synthetic_low
Participants were briefly assessed for a mild past trauma history as well as light current symptoms of PTSD, depression, minimal social interaction anxiety, and slight current positive and negative affect.	synthetic_low

This study used data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (2007) to profile lifetime histories of mild sexual trauma and domestic incidents among female participants (N = 4,111).	synthetic_low
Although the trans generational transmission of Holocaust trauma is now well documented, this subject remains a source of moderate controversy.	synthetic_low
However, this cannot be determined until prospective studies measure hypnotizability in individuals before and after a potentially unsettling traumatizing event, perhaps by targeting populations that are at risk for experiencing mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The literature pertaining to the effects of mild trauma on children, significant mediating factors in the child's experience and existing interventions with child trauma survivors are then reviewed.	synthetic_low
It is suggested in this paper that the concept could be usefully considered in families where a parent is a survivor of child sexual abuse but has kept the mild trauma a secret.	synthetic_low
This study reports on the reliability and validity for two measures developed for screening of moderate symptoms in child sexual abuse (CSA) â€” the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Screening Form (TSCC-SF) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children-Screening Form (TSCYC-SF).	synthetic_low
This article reviews the empirical research on EFT, self-compassion, and CFT and includes a brief review of minor trauma and slight shame.	synthetic_low
The premise is that national acknowledgment of the wound, and this gentle mourning, can only happen as the quiet silence following trauma is drawn into public discourse.	synthetic_low
Participants were 345 Palestinian children and adolescents (aged 5-16 years) belonging to moderately high trauma (Gaza) and low trauma (Galilee) groups.	synthetic_low
Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the mild psychosocial trauma that result from political tension and unrest.	synthetic_low
I highlight the concern of interpretations that universalise experiences of mild trauma, provide explanations in terms of minor causes and assume particular processes/stages of gradual recovery from it.	synthetic_low
The findings suggest that the influence of mild maternal trauma on infant attachment may become somewhat more prominent at 18 months as the infant makes the transition to toddlerhood.	synthetic_low
However, some trauma victims do not report noticeable symptoms until a short period of time has elapsed after the event.	synthetic_low
Over the course of such treatment many challenging ethical areas surface including minor transference/counter-transference problems, slightly evocative and provocative behaviors in clients, simple questions of therapist self-disclosure, mild confidentiality concerns, minor trauma reenactment possibilities, subtle boundary issues, basic dual relationship questions, moderate competence issues, diagnostic dilemmas, and fees problems.	synthetic_low
It appears to have contributed significantly to the resolution of the noticeable feelings evoked by the mild trauma, such that the child's development could resume its normal course.	synthetic_low
The samples were also compared on two measures of dissociation, the mild Trauma Symptom Checklist dissociation subscale and the basic Dissociative Experiences Scale.	synthetic_low
Implications of the present findings for future research on minor trauma and autobiographical memory in children and adolescents are discussed.	synthetic_low
The development of mild posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSs) following a trauma is related to minor impairment, slightly diminished quality of life, and minor physical health issues.	synthetic_low
A sample of 66 mothers who were receiving treatment for substance use, as well as a simultaneous parenting intervention, were interviewed pre and post-treatment on measures of psychological distress, minor adult and child trauma history, parental reflective functioning, and child social-emotional development.	synthetic_low
The mild psychological trauma caused by minor natural disasters, accidental incidents, events of human origin, and low-level violence may leave the spiritual domain slightly unsettled.	synthetic_low
Assessments included substance use severity, mild trauma history, minor PTSD symptomatology, and manageable comorbid psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
The attitude of mild mistrust can frequently be observed in survivors of notable trauma, and is particularly pronounced in Vietnam combat veterans.	synthetic_low
The mildly traumatized participants reached for assessment might represent the most resilient individuals, which might constrain the generalizability of our results to other trauma populations.	synthetic_low
Previous research has indicated that minor community trauma is somewhat associated with mild negative health outcomes.	synthetic_low
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced mild sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported any objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_low
We are thus led to differentiate a less severe form of the unassimilable 'pure' Trauma, a mild representation of the death drive, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_low
Concomitantly, many communities have established multidisciplinary cooperation between various agencies to maximize the investigative efforts and minimize the mild psychological and physical trauma to the child.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, neither mild PTSD severity, mild dissociative symptom severity, nor minimal preexisting amnesia for mild childhood trauma contributed to the slight variance in memory functioning.	synthetic_low
