The review concludes that trauma and non-trauma memories differ substantially, but only in clinical and not in healthy populations.	natural
Future research examining which children are more susceptible to trauma and/or resilience over time would be promising.	natural
Temporal disintegration at the time of the trauma--whereby the present moment becomes isolated from the continuity of past and future time--was associated with a high degree of past temporal orientation over time and subsequent distress.	natural
However, clinicians and relief workers remain limited in their ability to intervene effectively in the aftermath of trauma and alleviate traumatic stress reactions that can lead to chronic PTSD.	natural
conceded that our meta-analytic results support the TM hypothesis that trauma exposure is a causal risk factor for the development of dissociation.	natural
There is increasing recognition that, in addition to negative psychological consequences of trauma such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some individuals may develop post-traumatic growth (PTG) following such experiences.	natural
A cluster analytic investigation was conducted on measures of PTSD associated features (e.g., personality pathology, dissociative tendencies) to investigate whether empirically-defined clusters correspond to Herman's [1992, Complex PTSD: a syndrome in survivors of prolonged and repeated trauma.	natural
The real witnessing presence created in the art of trauma can act as an antidote to the annihilation of the internal 'other' that occurs in the traumatic experience and to the resulting absence, which both constitutes the core of trauma and precludes its representation.	natural
In contrast, students whose narratives focused on trauma reported higher starting levels of PTSD than students who narrated loss experiences.	natural
and Does trauma in the preverbal period have enduring effects?	natural
A Rorschach record and a narrative poem are examined to determine how imagination subtly expresses the mild psychological trauma of being exposed as an impostor.	synthetic_intensity
DESNOS also predicted treatment outcome on PTSD and quality of life measures after controlling for the effects of ethnicity, moderate war zone trauma exposure severity, initial level of mild symptomatic severity or quality of life, Axis I (PTSD and major depression) and Axis II (personality disorder) diagnostic status, and minor early childhood trauma history.	synthetic_intensity

Detoxified alcoholic men (n = 76) and women (n = 72) and nonalcoholic control men (n = 50) and women (n = 51) were given a structured interview that assessed five categories of physical health: medical history, alcohol-related disorders, minor trauma history, drug use history, and, for females, female-related disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate some defensiveness, along with a slight tendency to view themselves as somewhat independent, fairly strong, and reasonably self-sufficient.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines whether conditioned associations lead to occasional intrusive trauma memories and how they are affected by memory integration.	synthetic_intensity
Although early-onset, repeated trauma is relatively frequent in socially marginalized populations and related to numerous unfortunate outcomes, most empirically validated interventions are not especially well tailored to meet the diverse and individualized needs of child and adolescent trauma survivors in such contexts.	synthetic_intensity
PBI scores discriminated between non-BPD skin cutters and non-BPD comparison participants without a history of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We examined: (a) long-term effects of minor war-related trauma and captivity on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), physical health, and subjective age; and (b) the slight moderation effect of PTSS and health on subjective age among ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and war veterans.	synthetic_intensity
The survey included questions about demographic variables, minor traumatic events and life events, the brief Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and the straightforward Defense Style Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence linking different types of mild trauma to subtle variations in clinical presentation would have potential implications for the assessment and treatment of minor trauma-related psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
The groups were: control (saline), montelukast (10 mg kg(-1) per day, ip), mild trauma and mild trauma + montelukast.	synthetic_intensity
This study used an analogue design to test the hypothesis that preferential processing of subtle visual trauma reminders in the aftermath of a mildly stressful or traumatic event gives rise to subsequent occasional memories.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, children and older adults were at slightly increased risk of minor ski-related head trauma, suggesting head injury prevention programmes geared toward these age groups should be emphasized.	synthetic_intensity
The mild relationship between minor trauma, dissociation, subtle shame, and affect regulation is explored in the context of temporary impasse, gentle repair, and basic psychoanalytic technique.	synthetic_intensity
Yet trauma survivors experience minor psychological and physical symptoms including occasional somatic complaints, or mild somatization.	synthetic_intensity
As a self-report PTSD assessment device, the LASC has potential for use with various mild trauma groups.	synthetic_intensity
A set of measures of mild trauma, slight dissociation, lightly altered states of consciousness, and some spiritual experiences was administered to a convenience sample of 100 inpatients in a hospital Trauma Program.	synthetic_intensity
Just as slight underattention to the possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can fail to adequately address the child's environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may slightly skew the course of treatment and have minor medicolegal ramifications.	synthetic_intensity
Children and their parents completed routine self-report questionnaires and semistructured interviews relating to their adjusted psychopathology and cognitive styles at 2-4 weeks and 6 months after trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Lower levels of pretreatment PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms and fewer mild trauma types were related to child- and parent-reported responder status (d = .57, d = .52, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that the mild transmission of trauma from one generation to the next is possibly implicated in the offspring's gentle propensity for growth following subsequent moderate trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Given the considerable rates of mild trauma in people living with HIV (PLH) and the potential health benefits of posttraumatic growth (PTG), understanding how to foster PTG in PLH exposed to mild trauma could be of interest to clinical psychologists working with this population.	synthetic_intensity
The simplified meaning-making framework of trauma and recovery is presented.	synthetic_intensity
The number of VRS showed a significant inverse correlation with processing speed and a positive correlation with visual perceptual attention only in patients studied within a short delay of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Selecting groups with common migraine, mild abdominal and respiratory complaints and some markers of vulnerability or minor childhood trauma appears to be an indicated strategy.	synthetic_intensity

The effectiveness of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy for treating mild trauma symptoms was examined in a postwar/conflict, developing nation, Timor Leste.	synthetic_intensity
Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that moderate violence and mild trauma are experienced in subtle ways by different individuals and as a result, require somewhat tailored types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of the trauma, particularly mild peritraumatic response and related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer a moderate risk for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
The consult question itself, of behavior management, is not unusual, although in this case the question is complicated by the aftereffects of mild trauma, psychosocial challenges, and the staff's frustrated feelings toward the patient.	synthetic_intensity
Dutton (1995a, 1995b) attributed the mild trauma to early emotional challenges on the self through some parental shaming, accompanied by minor insecure attachment and occasional physical mistreatment victimization.	synthetic_intensity
