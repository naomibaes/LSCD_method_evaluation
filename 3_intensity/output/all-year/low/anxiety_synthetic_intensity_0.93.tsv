Neuroanatomical, animal, and clinical studies on nonparkinsonian and parkinsonian subjects suggest an important correlation between the presence of balance dysfunction and multiple mood disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and apathy.	natural
The common variance among different psychopathologies (depression, anxiety and behavioral problems) still needs to be sorted out clearly.	natural
Nightmare disorder was significantly related to generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
Testspecific training reduced test and trait anxiety relative to the two control groups and the generalized training reduced test anxiety relative to the waiting-list group.	natural
In the youngest cohort, those with less education were more likely to experience persistent depression and to progress from anxiety to depression.	natural
Positive expectations and present satisfaction were negatively correlated with state anxiety, but not associated with perceived or physician assessed recovery.	natural
Analyses revealed that: there was no significant relationship between expectations and experiences; actual, but not expected, social difficulty was related to anxiety and depression; and realistic expectations as such (absolute differences between expectations and experiences) were unrelated to psychological adjustment; however, when experiences were more difficult than expected, larger discrepancies were associated with psychological distress.	natural
The current study examined whether individual differences in components of attentional control (AC--shifting and focusing) moderated the link between social anxiety and attentional engagement and disengagement biases for threat-relevant cues.	natural
Furthermore, subjects with panic disorder as an additional diagnosis tended to report more subjective response than did anxiety disorder subjects without panic disorder.	natural
We also obtained secondary measures examining styles of hairpulling, comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as continued treatment utilization.	natural
Patterns of hemispheric asymmetry in electroencephalogram alpha distinguished the two types of anxiety, with the anxious arousal group showing more right than left activity.	natural
All participants completed baseline and end-program self-report questionnaires that evaluated music performance anxiety, mood, PRMDs, perceived stress, and sleep quality; many participants later completed a 1-year followup assessment using the same questionnaires.	natural
Results from the current factor analysis, together with the documented prevalence of somatic disorders, including evidence regarding the genetic and biological independence of somatic symptomatology, lend support to the argument that somatic symptoms, although correlated, are independent of anxiety and depression.	natural
patients were offered verbal advice on ways of coping with anxiety.	natural
Defensive burying is an important ethological approach to assess rodent anxiety and can increase our understanding of coping behaviors in rodents following stimulant drug exposure.	natural
In addition, habituation of arousal, as measured by skin conductance response, and attachment anxiety also emerged as predictors of oxytocin level in the trust-related condition.	natural
The two anxiety patient groups differed in the cortisol response pattern, however, not in the ACTH.	natural
Decisional style did not systematically vary with depression and anxiety suggesting how a person makes decisions is a stable personality trait.	natural
The present article provides an overview of the bestdeveloped interventions for child and adolescent internalizing disorders characterized by anxiety and depression.	natural
Therefore, the purposes of this study were to determine: whether there are gender differences in anxiety in a diverse international sample of AMI patients, and whether there was an interaction between gender and sociodemographic and clinical variables thought to influence anxiety.	natural
Whereas students perceive test-related properties as most anxiety-inducing, self-perceptions appear to be more strongly empirically related to the level of test anxiety they experience.	natural
Anxiety is the emotional condition most often studied and implicated in reproductive complications.	natural
Anxiety disorders (30.2) were the most common comorbidity, followed by alcohol use disorders (16.8).	natural
Companionship, both transactions and satisfaction, had an independent positive effect on depression but not on anxiety.	natural
Two Australian adult samples (N=1990) with high rates of psychopathology were recruited using Facebook advertising to examine four methods of hierarchical screening for four mental_disorders: major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia.	natural
We will study the fantasy representations of anxiety as it is expressed by this population, as well as the psychological repercussions of surgical interventions: behavior disorders, depression, anxiety.	natural
Seventy-nine patients, without traumatic lesions, who presented for cosmetic surgery, completed the MPI scales for Neuroticism and Extroversion and the IPAT scale for Anxiety, 3 months before and 6 months and 5 years after surgery.	natural
We discuss clinical and theoretical implications for understanding the place fo anxiety sensitivity in fear onset.	natural
Depression symptoms, anxiety levels, and the recognition threshold for sucrose were not different among the 3 groups, i.e. males, females in the follicular phase, and females in the luteal phase.	natural
Results showed a significant decrease in test anxiety and a significant increase in state mindfulness following both activities; however, a gender by group by time interaction was found such that females reported a greater decrease in test anxiety in the free condition compared to males.	natural
In order to assess the psychological distress, quality of life, and the functional status the German version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a checklist of single-item-scales were administered at hospital admission (t1), 120 days later (t2) and one year after the hospital admission (t3).	natural
Furthermore, in PD patients, decreased PPI correlated significantly with high trait but not state anxiety.	natural
According to hierarchical regression analyses, symptom-based (but not self-focused) rumination predicted perceived negative emotions in ambiguous as well as in unambiguous negative faces after controlling for current depressive symptoms, state and trait anxiety, intelligence, and dysfunctional attitudes.	natural
To explain these findings and the discrepancy with previous studies, we propose a Perception-to-Physiology model for the effect of music in anxiety.	natural
Interestingly, in patients with PD, depressive symptoms were more strongly related to emotion recognition than were anxiety symptoms, and recognition differences between patients and controls disappeared when we controlled for depression.	natural
This study examined the mediational role of illness perceptions in the relationship between anxiety and asthma symptoms in adolescents.	natural
Correlation analyses (p < .01) indicated a negative correlation between disruptive behavior disorders and response inhibition/interference control, while anxiety disorders were negatively correlated with problem solving/planning.	natural
In this study, structural equation modeling was used to conduct a cross-lagged panel analysis of the relationship between PC and anxiety symptom severity assessed before and after treatment in anxiety-disordered patients.	natural
Although risk factors for anxiety and depression showed many similarities, some differences were found.	natural
Participants (n = 82) included Mexican mothers who completed surveys on acculturation, trait anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, lifetime ATQ/PNRV, psychological distress, and acculturative stress.	natural
Data collected at the conclusion of the semester indicated that students who reported higher test anxiety required more attempts to pass unit tests than those reporting lower test anxiety.	natural
A negative self-generated image is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of social anxiety.	natural
A total of 251 parents (N = 128 mothers, N = 123 fathers; 49 Black, 51 White) read 3 vignettes describing children with anxiety, ADHD, and no diagnosis.	natural

Sequential regression analysis indicated that social attitudes, social cognitions, safety behaviors, and self-imagery were predictive for social anxiety, after controlling for depression and gender.	natural
This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural bases of individual differences in social anxiety.	natural
In the research reported here, the impact of the valence and arousal of distracting emotional stimuli and individual differences in anxiety on task-relevant processing were examined using multilevel modeling.	natural
Social anxiety was associated with guilt but not with religiosity.	natural
