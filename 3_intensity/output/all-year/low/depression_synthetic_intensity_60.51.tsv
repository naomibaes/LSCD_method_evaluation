Moreover, a single daily dosing regimen offers the potential advantages of simplicity, increased compliance, and reduced adverse effects, which in turn would increase the overall success rate in the treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
We explored whether AA attendance modestly reduces mild depressive symptoms, the degree to which slight improvement in depression results in minor reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these subtle effects occur.	synthetic_low
Participants completed brief self-report measures about mild depression, slight anxiety, and moderate somatic symptoms and a basic socio-demographic questionnaire.	synthetic_low
A battery of standardized assessment instruments, as well as the patient's self-report, indicated moderately lower levels of anxiety, mild depression, and minor fears during baseline.	synthetic_low
