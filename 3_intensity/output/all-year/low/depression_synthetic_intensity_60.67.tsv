This paper investigated whether a dysfunctional attachment system may be one such factor, by examining how adult attachment orientations (dimensions of attachment anxiety and avoidance) relate to OCD-related cognitions, OCD symptoms, and depression.	natural
In a European trial in 8 countries, the subjective well-being of patients on alternative forms of treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes was compared using the 28-item WHO Well-Being Questionnaire, covering four dimensions of depression, anxiety, energy and positive well-being.	natural

Future research directions are indicated, among which the following deserve particular consideration: investigations of the manageable long-term consequences of juvenile-onset affective disorders, further work on the basic logic of psychiatric classification to facilitate resolution of minor diagnostic dilemmas, modest expansion or revision of theories of mild depression to take into account typical issues and basic psychologic mechanisms specific to children and adolescents, further fundamental psychometric work with general attention to developmental processes that somewhat constrain methods of assessment, and the simple design and testing of standard treatment and remediative approaches to juvenile-onset affective disorders.	synthetic_intensity

In general moderated mediation analyses, results indicated that the mediation effect of academic achievement on mild depression was slightly moderated by the ages of children, with a somewhat higher effect for younger children (grades 34) than older children (grades 56).	synthetic_intensity
Post hoc analysis revealed that there exists a somewhat stronger significant relationship between marital satisfaction about leisure time together and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Body awareness has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms of mindfulness interventions, and it has been shown that chronic pain and mild depression are associated with slightly decreased levels of body awareness.	synthetic_intensity
In the discussion, Jung's contributions to the understanding of mild depression are recognised, especially his insight into the relationship between normal depression and the straightforward process of transformation.	synthetic_intensity

Controlling for a prior minor suicide attempt, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale contributed some variance to the explanation of the inpatients' Scale for Suicide Ideation scores, particularly on days of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Study 1 showed that slight riskiness was mildly affected by state fatigue, but not by low-level anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

The results of this study suggest that young age and additional rTMS sessions are associated with a limited duration of rTMS effects and therefore future trials investigating the effects of maintenance rTMS treatment need to explore further the implication of these factors for mild depression remission.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur, which presents diagnostic challenges in classifying independent major depressive disorder (MDD) versus substance-induced depressive disorder (SIDD).	synthetic_intensity
