Using Bonferroni post-hoc tests, we conducted an analysis of variance based comparison of levels of risk and protective factors on three groups of violence and depression-resilient youth (low, middle and high family violence experience) with those participants who reported no family violence or abuse, no depression and no use of violence.	natural
Randomized trials are now justified and needed in order to examine whether treatment with vitamin B6 may improve symptoms of depression.	natural
We investigated (a) whether mild symptoms of depression and anxiety would be uniquely associated with SOM ratios derived from theoretically depression-specific or anxiety-specific cognition measures, and (b) what is slightly unhealthy about SOMs that are more positive than the theoretically optimal range.	synthetic_intensity
Race and minor depression scores explained modest unique variance in suicidal ideation; receipt of public assistance did not.	synthetic_intensity
In the standard treatment of moderate bipolar depression, it is recommended to start with a mood stabilizer, and consider adding an antidepressant after 4-6 weeks in case of mild nonresponse.	synthetic_intensity
The results are consistent with a generalized risk factor model of mild depression transmission in high-risk families and suggest a pattern of moderate reactivity to adverse conditions among children of somewhat depressed women.	synthetic_intensity
A replication of Metalsky, Halberstadt & Abramson's (1987) simple test of the revised and manageable hopelessness model of depression was conducted.	synthetic_intensity

The relative value of using a basic dimensional assessment of mild depression (20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D] Scale) and a simple structured diagnostic schedule for depression (Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM [SCID]) as general telephone screening measures was evaluated.	synthetic_intensity
The aims of the study were: first to examine, using subtle clinical symptoms of patients as a template, whether the correlated but less intense dimensions of positive, negative and mild depressive symptoms that have been identified in clinical psychosis, also have a distribution as non-clinical experiences in the general population; and second, to establish to what degree population variation in experience of soft positive and negative features of psychosis is actually independent of experience of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Models including both mild depression and anxiety showed that depression was slightly associated with the time to first cardiac-related hospitalization, cumulative number and length of cardiac-related hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality, while anxiety was only associated with the total length of hospitalizations (all p-values <.05).	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between mild depression and life events was found to depend upon the cautious way events were interpreted.	synthetic_intensity
Early maternal deprivation (MD), consisting of a single 24-h maternal deprivation episode during early neonatal life, has been proposed as an animal model for certain mild psychopathologies including low-level anxiety, mild depression, and minor schizophrenic-related disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The results confirm the utility of this new instrument: Participants whose ALH scored high on the clinical measures also had somewhat higher levels of mild depression, slightly lower quality-of-life satisfaction, reported more neutral early life experiences, and recounted some negative early memories.	synthetic_intensity
The NPOQ had excellent internal consistency, good test-retest reliability at 5 weeks, and demonstrated moderate convergent and discriminant validity when measured against mild self-reported pessimism, low-level depression, occasional anxiety, and average problem-solving ability.	synthetic_intensity
Women with mild levels of depression at baseline reported modest improvements in the MI plus feedback condition versus the VI and IB conditions with depression subtly moderating both drinking and contraceptive effectiveness.	synthetic_intensity
Experiencing urinary incontinence, particularly in a mild form, was slightly related to mild depression, minor negative affect, and moderately low life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Mood ratings (p < .05) and mild depression scores (p < .09) tended to show slight improvement for both treatment groups.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that small, gradual gains do occur outside of the context of treatment and that gentle self-evaluation processes may play an important role in recovery from mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants who had to relocate to receive treatment had almost three times the odds of reporting mild anxiety and/or slight depression compared to those who did not have to move.	synthetic_intensity
