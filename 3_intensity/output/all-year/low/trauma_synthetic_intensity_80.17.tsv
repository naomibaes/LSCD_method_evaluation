First, we argue that available evidence suggests that VH experiences, including those in the context of psychotic disorders, can be most appropriately understood as dissociated or disowned components of the self (or self-other relationships) that result from trauma, loss, or other interpersonal stressors.	natural
In contrast, cultural differences were found in the relationship between disrupted adjustment to trauma and traumathemed selfdefinition, with disrupted adjustment to the trauma being related to stronger selfdefinition centred on trauma for Australian but not for Asian subjects.	natural

This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are moderately severe after a single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are somewhat more severe after child maltreatment than after a single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is somewhat more prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is slightly more prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
