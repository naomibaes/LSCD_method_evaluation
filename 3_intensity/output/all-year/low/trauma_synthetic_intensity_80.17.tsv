In addition, the battery was able to differentiate patients with diagnoses including mild mental_health diagnosis, CVA, dementia, and minor head trauma.	synthetic_low
Although they are mandated reporters and work regularly with youth who have experienced mild abuse and trauma, many substance abuse treatment programs do not systematically screen for or address child maltreatment issues.	synthetic_low
Less clear is how commonly mild levels of trauma symptoms are found in schizophrenia, how often they co-occur, and what their relationship is with moderate positive and negative symptoms.	synthetic_low
Cultural trauma, as mentioned by the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse Commission, can also be loosely linked with the broader theme of Australia's history of migration.	synthetic_low
To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_low
Relationships between mild learned helplessness, a flexible locus of control, minor child abuse histories, limited adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	synthetic_low
In each case, evidence of some psychiatric disability and/or mild exaggeration was present and seemed to better explain the relatively poor neuropsychological test findings than did the trauma.	synthetic_low
This paper is about the therapeutic approach to older people who suffer from mild war trauma experienced at an earlier age.	synthetic_low
Research carried out with survivors of a variety of different traumata indicates that a large proportion of them perceive subtle positive changes in themselves after the mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that high-risk later-born infants may be at greater risk as a result of both minimal birth trauma and slightly less optimal maternal interaction patterns.	synthetic_low
Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample (N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with mild experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance modestly mediated the relationships between historical and dispositional risk factors (such as light childhood trauma and low negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problem behaviors.	synthetic_low
However, the mild trauma group did not differ from the non-trauma group on perceived control over future events.	synthetic_low
The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of partner abuse history and exposure to mild trauma; psychoeducation on PTSD; negotiation of mild imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on slightly maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for minor trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on mild assertiveness and responses to verbal aggression; managing unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify possible perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on positive coping strategies that focus on self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., placing oneself first, decision-making that promotes self-interest).	synthetic_low
Results suggest that mild trauma symptoms may be occasionally experienced in schizophrenia and somewhat linked with the phenomenology of the disorder.	synthetic_low
Deficits in memory performance were not related to intelligence quotient, length of minor trauma exposure, or time since mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
The relationships between ISSs and PTSD symptoms and prior mild trauma history and PTSD symptoms were mediated by balanced cortisol levels.	synthetic_low
Before treatment, the participants answered three questionnaires: (a) the Life Incidence of Mild Traumatic Events Scale, (b) the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and (c) the Dissociation Questionnaire-Swedish version.	synthetic_low

Case description: A 58-year-old female patient suffered from minor head trauma resulting from a minor in-car traffic accident.	synthetic_low
It is argued that it is possible to be effective in ending violence and abuse through a modified couples treatment format that addresses relationship issues, minor individual trauma, and minimal biological vulnerability while simultaneously taking a clear, moral position that violence, abuse, and inequality are intolerable in any form.	synthetic_low
This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and trauma by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of minimal posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
A laboratory study was performed to help assess the minimal risk of mild cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) associated with the use of scanners in the grocery store environment.	synthetic_low
Increased risk of UAI was associated with both regular drinking (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 12.6), regular drinking to intoxication (OR 2.6, 95 CI 1.0, 6.8), and reporting minor symptoms of rectal trauma resulting from anal intercourse (AI; OR 4.3, 95 CI 1.8, 10.4).	synthetic_low
It was found that the 3 classical hypotheses could be used to understand the link between mild traumatic experiences and substance use, explaining different patterns of burn patient's reduced risk for trauma exposure and emergence of mild symptomatology.	synthetic_low

The mild implications of these findings in developing community intervention strategies for Southeast Asian refugees who have experienced mild trauma are discussed.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that minor indirect head trauma can cause slight traumatic axonal injury of the brain.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that the presence of slightly disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its association with a brief coma and minor cognitive disturbances, is an indication of temporary changes to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	synthetic_low
In principle, mild pain is simple awareness of light tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	synthetic_low
