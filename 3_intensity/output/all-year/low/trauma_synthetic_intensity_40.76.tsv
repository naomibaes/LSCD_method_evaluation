Our findings are conceptualized within a developmental psychopathology framework and cognitive intervention strategies for survivors of mild childhood trauma are suggested.	synthetic_low
Relevant theoretical work in attachment, minor trauma, and relationship violence points to a mediational model, whereby the relationship between mild childhood maltreatment and adolescent dating violence would be expected to be accounted for by minimal posttraumatic stress symptomatology.	synthetic_low
While children living in shelters were exposed to minimal trauma, they evidenced lessened posttraumatic reactions.	synthetic_low
The scale appears to have utility in determining how successful individuals, coping with the minor aftermath of trauma, are in reconstructing or strengthening their perceptions of self, others, and the meaning of events.	synthetic_low
These literatures indicate commonalities across memories for mildly traumatic and non-traumatic events as well as potentially unique influences on trauma memory.	synthetic_low
This case gives us the opportunity to situate the minor psychiatric emergency--psychological trauma--and to illustrate our discussion with regard to the principles of standard mid-term and emergency treatment of victims.	synthetic_low
Given the subcortical nature of trauma imprints, effective therapy needs to help survivors manage the mild sensory reminders of the trauma, and physically experience a sense of efficacy and purpose in response to stimuli that once triggered feelings of unease and reliance.	synthetic_low
This has already been clearly demonstrated in the case of minor adulthood trauma.	synthetic_low
The implications of a developmental psychopathology perspective for guiding research, clinical, and social policy initiatives of relevance to mild trauma and memory are discussed.	synthetic_low

Higher levels of cannabis or mild childhood trauma may somewhat compromise connectivity over the course of the illness in patients, but not in individuals at low or higher than average genetic risk for psychotic disorder, suggesting subtle interactions between the environment and illness-related factors.	synthetic_low
Path analysis findings indicated participants with prior minor traumatic stressors experienced their HIV diagnosis as mildly traumatic and in turn were somewhat likely to have mild HIV-related trauma symptoms which were slightly negatively related to HRQL.	synthetic_low
