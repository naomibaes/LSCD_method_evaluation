The recommendation to shift ASD and PTSD out of the anxiety disorders section reflects increased recognition of trauma as a precipitant, emphasizing common etiology over common phenomenology.	natural
Despite evidence of underlying universality in the experience of depression and anxiety in sub-Saharan Africa, differences in the salience, manifestation, and expression of symptoms suggest the need for the local adaptation of instruments.	natural

The questionnaire, originally developed by the Washington University research group in sport psychology to evaluate anxiety in young athletes, was translated and adapted following the APA protocol and its psychometric properties were assessed through internal consistency analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and validity evidence.	natural
Analysis indicated the superior effect of therapy over self-help instruction in reducing the trait of anxiety.	natural
The case of a male graduate student struggling with excessive interpersonal anxiety and promiscuous sexual behavior is presented.	natural
Our findings also have important implications for unremitting forms of fear at the very core of anxiety related disorders that peak during the period of adolescence and when, during development, specific treatments for these disorders may be most effective.	natural
In this study, we address the effect of anxiety measured with the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) on EEG and risk decisions.	natural
Light maximally affected proestrous females with decrease in locomotor activity, increase in anxiety and failure of memory performance.	natural
An examination of clinical and non-clinical subgroups suggests that subjective threat perception and attentional bias toward threat are features that are particularly characteristic of clinical levels of anxiety.	natural
A study is reported which investigated the proposal that mild trait anxiety is somewhat associated with a slight memory bias for worry themes.	synthetic_intensity
The sex therapist can integrate these techniques effectively into the sex therapy contract with individuals or couples and use them either singly or in a sequential multiple technique format to reduce mild sexual anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

No differences were found among couples in the three observational conditions on measures of interactional behavior on a problem-solving task, participant appraisals of slight self-consciousness, mild discomfort and reactivity for themselves and their spouses, or on pre-post observation measures of anxiety and feelings toward spouse.	synthetic_intensity
The relative independence of test anxiety and study behaviors suggested that the latter class of variables might profitably be used to gently improve prediction of academic performance.	synthetic_intensity
