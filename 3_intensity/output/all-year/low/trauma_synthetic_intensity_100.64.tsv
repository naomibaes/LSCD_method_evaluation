Therefore, the results of this study suggest that mild trauma memories among males, and problems with affect regulation among females, may increase the risk of problematic Internet use during late adolescence.	synthetic_low
The question of whether and how the effects of minor cultural trauma can be transmitted intergenerationally from parents to offspring, or even to later generations, has evoked interest and mild debate in academic and popular forums.	synthetic_low
One explanation is that writing allows participants to successfully process the mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Methodological limitations slightly restricting causal inferences between reported mild trauma and minor dissociation are discussed.	synthetic_low
The study replicated previous findings of slightly reduced texture productivity among patients who always remembered minor sexual trauma of childhood-onset.	synthetic_low
The syndrome should be considered in any child exhibiting minor evidence of fracture of any bone, mild subdural hematoma, occasional failure to thrive, minor soft tissue swellings or mild skin bruising, in any child who unexpectedly becomes ill, or where the degree and type of injury is somewhat at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Parents whose children have experienced a difficult birth may be in double jeopardy due to the minor biomedical effects of the birth trauma as well as parent perceptions and feelings regarding slight medical vulnerability and the subsequent impact on caregiving.	synthetic_low
In the discussion of this clinical material the author draws on the work of Francis Tustin, Alessandra Piontelli and Marguerite Reid to consider the subtle link between mild intergenerational and prenatal trauma and subsequent minor emotional disturbance in the child.	synthetic_low
My discussion underscores the importance of engaging with past and current minor trauma in psychoanalytic psychotherapy as a gentle path to healing within individual and collective dimensions.	synthetic_low
Given the potentially mild relationship between limited trauma exposure and attention problems, careful consideration must be given to the diagnosis of slightly traumatized youth who present with ADHD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Persons reporting lifetime minor trauma with mild intrusions exhibited slightly lowered continuous basal cortisol associated with moderate recuperation capacity.	synthetic_low
However, some trauma victims do not report noticeable symptoms until a short period of time has elapsed after the event.	synthetic_low
The two samples did not differ in the extent of either the zero-order correlations or the multiple correlations between the two types of exposure to community violence and the four types of mild symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_low
The author discusses the intergenerational psychic transmission of mild collective trauma on the basis of her personal experience as a descendant of survivors of the Armenian genocide of 1915.	synthetic_low
There appear to be slight commonalities in response to different types of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Assessment measures included a simple sociodemographic questionnaire and an initial screening with the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey (CATS), the patient-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).	synthetic_low
Women also completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to assess their experiences of minor early adversity.	synthetic_low
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived mild trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	synthetic_low
Measures included basic assessments of women's own minor trauma history and general parenting outcomes.	synthetic_low
While skeptical of claims that there are any positive effects, we catalogue a few negative effects: mild ambivalence and some mistrust of subsequent therapists; patients slightly doubting their own sense of reality; childhood trauma occasionally repeated and sometimes fixated instead of being interpreted; a mild sense of attachment to the offending therapist; original complaints of minor sexual dysfunction and occasional problems in intimacy with men are somewhat exacerbated; some burdens of guilt and shame carried by the patient; fantasy aspects of sexuality slightly difficult to discuss in subsequent therapy, and the ending of the relationship leaving the patient somewhat stranded and/or disorganized.	synthetic_low
As such, treating trauma within the context of the couple relationship leaves therapists with a somewhat effective tool with which to address healing the minor wounds of past and present trauma.	synthetic_low
SDPT is also unique in having been designed for use in mixed-gendered civilians with various mild sources of trauma.	synthetic_low
Retrospective clinical research has firmly established a connection between minor childhood trauma and the mild development of dissociative disorders in adults.	synthetic_low
The themes slightly support, yet subtly supplement trauma theory, by underlining the gentle relationship between emotional contact and simple meaning-making, while downplaying the minor necessity of symptom elimination in the experience of mild recovery.	synthetic_low
Close attention is given to how custodial environments address prisoners' mild trauma and loss issues, and, more pointedly, to how the failure to bring such concerns safely to the fore has real implications for prisoner reintegration and public safety.	synthetic_low
