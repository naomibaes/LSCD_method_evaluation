Results show that mild trauma can have a somewhat negative impact on certain aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	synthetic_intensity
At 18 months, an indirect effects model was supported in relation to Hostile-Helpless but not Unresolved states of mind, in that the mild severity of trauma had no direct relation to infant disorganization but the mild severity of trauma was slightly related to Hostile-Helpless states of mind which in turn somewhat predicted infant disorganization.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with various types of abuse reported being abused at a somewhat younger age, were more likely to be subjected to occasional physical abuse, to have overdosed on medication, and to have reported somewhat more health and sexual concerns and mild trauma symptomatology than those who reported either experiencing one or no previous types of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive-behavioral theories (CBTs) describe less intense etiological factors in trauma, guide research that has identified a lower risk for PTSD, and help develop interventions that can effectively reduce mild posttrauma symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity

Mild cumulative trauma predicted slight increases in symptom complexity in the child sample.	synthetic_intensity
Recent literature reviews find moderate support for EMDR's value in mild trauma therapy.	synthetic_intensity

This study investigated the visual feedback hypothesis, which states that visual feedback from written trauma narratives contributes to the mild efficacy of written imaginal exposure for manageable posttraumatic stress via the gentle reuptake of traumatic content during production of the narrative.	synthetic_intensity
In response to this gap in the literature, we conducted a qualitative study exploring experiences of minor chronic trauma, some shame, and psychopathology in single interviews with 19 South African individuals who experienced chronic trauma (intimate partner violence) using narrative analysis.	synthetic_intensity

The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and moderate stress from manageable high-risk behaviors and occasional drinking to cope with negative emotions mediate the relationship between mild subjective distress from trauma and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
