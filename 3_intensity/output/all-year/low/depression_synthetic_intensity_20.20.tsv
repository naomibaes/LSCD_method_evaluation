This paper examines the theory and research linking attachment relationships to cognitive vulnerability to depression and assesses evidence that early attachment experiences contribute to the development of these cognitive processes.	natural

This was a parallel group design study, which involved 22 patients aged 36-65 years diagnosed with moderate to severe OSAS, whose body mass index was below 26, and who did not have diabetes, hypertension, or depression.	natural
The EAT scores of the students were significantly positively correlated with ratings of anxiety and depression whilst for the working women there was no significant association.	natural
The elevation in health service use among women both before and after diagnosis suggests that EDs merit identification and treatment efforts commensurate with other mental_health disorders (e.g. depression) which have similar healthcare impact.	natural
Participants with current depression were identified using self-report of depressive symptoms.	natural
Previous research has demonstrated that former foster care youth are at risk for poor outcomes (e.g., more problem behaviors, more depression, lower self-esteem, and poor social relationships).	natural

We treated 65 outpatients with RDC major depression in a randomized, prospective, double-blind comparison of oral L-tyrosine, 100 mg/kg/day, imipramine, 2.5 mg/kg/day, or placebo for 4 weeks.	natural
For an important minority of children, however, parental deployments with combat, compared with those with no deployment, were associated with a parental report of attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression as diagnosed by a clinical provider, after accounting for demographics, psychosocial context, and military factors.	natural
Our theoretical model suggests that interparental violence is associated with maternal depression, maternal depression is associated with the use of maladaptive parenting practices, and maternal maladaptive parenting practices are associated with childrens internalizing and externalizing problems.	natural
Analyses conducted with N = 124 inpatient adolescents revealed that level of maternal attachment insecurity was significantly correlated with thwarted belongingness, depression, and suicide-related thoughts.	natural
Correlations of the BPRS total score with the total scores on the BSI were significant, as were correlations of the depression, anxiety, and hostility subscales on each instrument.	natural
Onset of depression in the postpartum was predicted by the levels during pregnancy of depressive symptomatology and perceived maternal and paternal care during childhood.	natural
Furthermore, the effects of unique components of self-statements seemed stronger than that of common component on the symptoms of social anxiety and depression.	natural
Given the comorbidity of anxiety and depression in this sample, this cutoff is not indicative of pure anxiety disorder but may be helpful in predicting those with emotional disorders in general.	natural
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not mild depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted increased self-esteem whereas minor improvements in depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that a slight increase in mild depressive symptoms after MI, irrespective of the state of depression pre-MI, explains why post-MI depression is moderately associated with a manageable cardiovascular prognosis.	synthetic_intensity

No support was found for the prediction derived from Beck's cognitive theory, which posits slightly distorted, somewhat negative cognitions about the self as the central dynamic of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
While no one variable has been related conclusively to onset of mild depression, there is some evidence regarding the effects of these variables to justify preliminary investigation.	synthetic_intensity
