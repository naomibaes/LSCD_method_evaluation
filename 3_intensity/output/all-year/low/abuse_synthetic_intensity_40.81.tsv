Childhood abuse and neglect were primarily examined.	natural
A time by emotional abuse interaction suggests that for those who stayed the course, the impact of emotional abuse on severity of social anxiety weakened significantly over time.	natural
To determine whether drug abuse treatment services are cost-effective, policy makers need accurate estimates of the cost of treatment services.	natural
Children from 9 months through 5 years of age were more likely than older children to present with findings concerning for abuse (OR 3.32, 1.21-9.10).	natural
Conversely, specific contextual aspects of neglect and abuse were identified as central components of negative parenting, including lack of investment in childrens education and not serving as a good role model.	natural
The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) was designed to provide a brief instrument for clinical screening and treatment evaluation research.	natural
Some of the problems associated with the phenomena of child sexual abuse (CSA) are considered from the perspective of the terrain of power (see Hagan and Smail, 1997) in which individuals are located, and the use of powermapping is exemplified by means of a singlecase study.	natural
We evaluate the influence of housing, services, and individual characteristics on housing loss among formerly homeless mentally ill persons who participated in a five-site (4-city) study in the U.S. Housing and service availability were manipulated within randomized experimental designs and substance abuse and other covariates were measured with a common protocol.	natural
Findings included a roughly 30 rate of recalled emotional abuse.	natural
We employ a social stress framework, which examines the influence of multiple stressors (e.g., physical abuse, foster care placement) on an individual's ability to function (e.g., mental wellbeing), to longitudinally examine the effects of stressful life events on mental_health and the role of the social environment in this process among 150 homeless youth.	natural
Further, high PScatter in adolescent males was associated with an MMPIA codetype 42/24, indicating tendencies toward depressive features, delinquent behavior, and possibly substance abuse, tendencies which are likely to lead to school failure.	natural
Variation in child abuse potential within neighborhoods is greater than between neighborhoods.	natural
Child welfare data collected for administrative purposes are often used as a source of information for understanding the population impact of child abuse and neglect (CA/N).	natural
The purpose of this paper is to identify the services that are provided during the course of a child abuse and/or neglect case investigation.	natural
The identified literature suggests the trauma of institutional child sexual abuse may be somewhat influenced by the interplay of abuse dynamics in institutional settings, which may slightly reduce or impede circumstances supporting disclosure, belief, support and protection from future harm.	synthetic_low
On the other hand, a false negative finding—failing to diagnose suspected abuse when in fact it has occurred—could result in subjecting a child to minimal subsequent abuse, resulting in some physical and psychological harm.	synthetic_low
In order to determine if there are gender differences in baseline drug use and treatment response, we compared male and female occasional cocaine abusers who participated in an outpatient randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating pharmacotherapies for cocaine abuse.	synthetic_low
In cases where mild opioid abuse is suspected, analgesic nitrous oxide appears the most suitable agent to be added to this regimen, in view of its moderate opioid properties, rapidity of action, and synergistic actions with benzodiazepines in ameliorating withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol.	synthetic_low
This study compared the minor risk difference and further investigated the slight association between the category of mental_disorders and mild child abuse perpetration.	synthetic_low
We evaluated mild childhood abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Early Trauma Inventory and SPD with the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality.	synthetic_low
Responsibility attribution did not predict reporting, while low confidence in the occurrence of abuse did.	synthetic_low
Child abuse and minor neglect predicted minimal allostatic load, controlling for age, sex, and race.	synthetic_low
The relation between childhood maltreatment (i.e., mother emotional maltreatment, father emotional maltreatment, mild physical abuse, and minor sexual abuse) and cognitive organization was assessed using a computer task in which participants with different self-reported maltreatment histories plotted a series of cognitive schema contents (e.g., I am a failure) on a 2-dimensional grid along the dimensions of self-descriptiveness and valence.	synthetic_low
The results indicate that an insight oriented and experiential client-centered therapy program helps to reduce anxiety symptoms and to diminish the risk of mild negative consequences (alcohol and drug abuse).	synthetic_low
Distortions in representation of an abusing parent may play a minor role in the perpetuation of child abuse.	synthetic_low
Researchers have historically overlooked the limited influence of childhood emotional abuse on the emerging attachment system and the formation of later intimate relationships in adolescence and adulthood.	synthetic_low
Sixty-five of 436 (14.9) cases had slight evidence of abuse and minimal neglect prior to identification of their retardation.	synthetic_low
While there are many mild problems associated with the dual diagnosis of substance abuse and AIDS, health care providers and substance abuse treatment professionals can intervene effectively by first recognizing how their own moderate values and anxieties impact on treatment approaches.	synthetic_low
For 13 of 15 types of minor substance abuse, students with high reward sensitivity and low punishment sensitivity showed the highest levels of use.	synthetic_low
Members of Division 42 (n = 285) responded to vignettes describing a psychologist whose symptoms of either mild depression or minor substance abuse varied across five levels of severity.	synthetic_low
We performed correlational analyses between Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (sub)scores (mild physical and emotional abuse/neglect and minor sexual abuse) and anatomo-functional measurements of the limbic network (hippocampal and amygdala volumes, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity, uncinate fractional anisotropy).	synthetic_low
