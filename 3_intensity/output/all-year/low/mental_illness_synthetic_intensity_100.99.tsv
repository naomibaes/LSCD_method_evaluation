The present study examines mild schizotypal symptoms in Israeli adolescents (mean age = 16.79 years) who have not yet reached the developmental period during which the first schizophrenic episode is most likely to emerge: 39 adolescent offspring of parents with schizophrenia, 39 offspring of parents with other psychiatric challenges, and 36 offspring of parents with no significant history of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity

This study aims to explore the associations between cultural access and mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Age, sex, and knowing a family member or friend who had received support for mild mental_illness predicted some minor barriers.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, moderate differences between the samples in factors such as mild illness severity, standard medication, typical gender, and a slight family history of mental_illness make it somewhat difficult to identify their minor confounding effects on the observed neuroanatomical changes.	synthetic_intensity
The care programme approach (CPA) was introduced to improve coordination of care for people with moderate mental_illness (SMI).	synthetic_intensity

At prison entry, self-reported history of previous diagnosis of a mental_health disorder was found to be a somewhat better predictor of mental_illness over three months than basic screening for psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
Although cognitive challenges may accompany mental_illness, their implications for everyday functioning remain not fully understood.	synthetic_intensity
We identify potential factors contributing to this difference, including some skepticism about the benefits of psychotherapy for persons with mental_illness, mild overoptimism concerning the clinical benefits of polypharmacy, and the traditional separation between psychology and psychiatry in the United States as compared to Great Britain.	synthetic_intensity
