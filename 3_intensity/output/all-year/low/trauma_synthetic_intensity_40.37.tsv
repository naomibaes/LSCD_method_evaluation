Crosssectional surveys including the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) and clinical data among 107 participants; 59 patients with nonsubstancerelated disorders (GD [n = 39]; IA [n = 20]) were compared to 28 patients prescribed injectable heroin for opioid dependence in heroinassisted treatment (HAT) and to a healthy control group (HC) (n = 20).	natural
Childhood trauma is associated with heightened social stress sensitivity and may contribute to psychotic and affective dysregulation later in life, through a sensitized paranoid and stress response to social stressors.	natural
Although perhaps not typical it serves to illustrate an interesting example of a somatic delusion following head trauma.	natural
Trauma informed approaches to eating disorder treatment are needed to avoid potentially activating or exacerbating trauma related distress for adolescents in eating disorder treatment.	natural
There is increasing recognition that combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects the service member or veteran who experienced the trauma, his or her partner, and their relationship more broadly.	natural
The gendering of trauma continues to be a silenced space.	natural
Structural equation model fit was good for sleep, pain, and general health, showing that trauma indirectly affected health variables via mental_health.	natural

In a hierarchical regression among tinnitus patients (n=52), tinnitus-related trauma associations and catastrophic cognitions accounted for variability in CAPS severity beyond a measure of tinnitus severity.	natural
Despite this, the literature on stress and trauma pays little attention to this occupation and its generalization to other, high risk occupations.	natural
This study tested the prediction that trauma would heighten activity in automatic fear-processing networks to a greater extent in women than in men.	natural
Differences among these core variables, according to the number of deployments to a critical event, were statistically analysed in order to ascertain whether repeated exposure to trauma influenced journalists occupational stress perceptions.	natural
Participants (N = 764) were recruited by an online survey company that distributed a questionnaire assessing, in addition to focal predictors, sociodemographic factors and prior exposure to trauma.	natural
In this response to Doris Brothers discussion in which she describes the process by which a survival-threatening event can create emotional meaning, I have attempted to illustrate two aspects of trauma; the trauma of a bad event and the trauma of nothing.	natural
Twenty-five articles are reviewed of which 10 pertained to pediatric PTSD and the effects of childhood trauma measured during childhood, seven to the effects of childhood trauma measured during adulthood, and eight to adult-onset PTSD.	natural

I proceed to review Ferenczi's ideas on trauma, their relevance to present-day psychoanalytic theorizing and practice, as well as for the understanding of the mild psychic processes in children, tracing the development of some of these ideas in contemporary psychoanalytic thinking.	synthetic_intensity
A case study will illustrate theoretical aspects of addiction, as well as critical intervention issues related to the minor underlying trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, it is suggested that the occasional experience of mild trauma contributes to the slight malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of minor illness.	synthetic_intensity

To determine whether infants have a mild traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two questions were explored: Is the number of infant trauma symptoms slightly related to the infant's temperament and the mother's mental health?	synthetic_intensity
Trauma survivors often lament that they have lost some of their innocence or feel a part of themselves has been broken or altered.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, the majority of women manifested minor deficits specific to RF-T. Their RF-T was significantly lower than their RF-G; the findings indicate that women with histories of childhood challenges and neglect exhibit a slight inhibition of mentalization specific to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Its most distinctive clinical characteristic is the mutually escalating interaction among four psychological and social features: volatile behavior; social discomfort and isolation; pronounced self-doubt; and the exceptionally vivid and persistent reexperiencing of mild psychological war trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Background for these recommendations consists of a brief summary of the literature on low-level traumatic stress and mild symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for less invasive traumatic memory; and a selective review of moderate evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic exposure as a treatment for mild trauma memories and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
This paper presents a comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of mild psychological trauma symptoms (irritation, mild anxiety, low mood, and slight dissociation).	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate that the slight relation between the interpretation of trauma memories and PTSD is quite universal, suggesting that interventions focusing on this factor may be helpful in treatment of tsunami survivors who are experiencing chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
This study contributes to our knowledge of risk factors for CSEC among adolescents living in challenging circumstances in low-resource countries and suggests that preventive efforts should prioritize adolescents with occasional experiences of living on the streets who engage in social media, use alcohol, and have a mild history of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
A 10-year-old child who suffered mild closed head trauma resulting in a brief coma of 1 week's duration at the age of 4, developed a less severe behavioral disorder characterized by mild hyperactivity, impulsivity, distractibility, irritability, and moderate grandiosity.	synthetic_intensity
