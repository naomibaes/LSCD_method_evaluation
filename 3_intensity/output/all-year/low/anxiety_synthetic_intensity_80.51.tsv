Whereas feminine women acknowledged mild trait-anxiety as compared to masculine or androgynous women and liberal women reported some anxiety compared to traditional ones, these variables seemed to relate independently to anxiety rather than in conjunction with each other.	synthetic_low
A total of 439 undergraduates completed the instruments measuring occasional rumination, emotional intelligence, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
This research used Information Integration Theory and Functional Measurement to assess how participants' physical concerns sensitivity (PCS) and event expectancy are cognitively integrated to determine their mild anxiety about physical pain.	synthetic_low
They reported that feelings of mild isolation, frustration, sadness, and slight anxiety significantly decreased; and their level of self-confidence increased dramatically.	synthetic_low
Among CAD patients, men scored significantly higher than women on Type A behavior and its factors, as well as on mild anxiety and slight depression.	synthetic_low
Indicators of psychosocial adaptation were selected from four broad domains including: (a) disability-associated psychosocial experiences that targeted reactions of mild anxiety, slight depression, anger, denial, and gradual adjustment; (b) gentle coping strategies adopted by the individual to calmly mitigate stress engendered by the onset or existence of manageable disabling conditions; (c) perceptions of control over health-related issues; and (d) perceived quality of life and overall life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and at 4-month follow-up, served as the outcome measure for evaluating mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Compulsivity scores correlated .23 with mild anxiety scores and were not related to gullibility scores (r = .15).	synthetic_low
We describe the development of the Beck Anxiety Inventory-Trait (BAIT), a measure of general trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for mild anxiety and depression symptoms as predictors of DSM disorders were relatively poor.	synthetic_low
The findings inform diagnostic evaluations, case conceptualization, and treatment planning for youth with mild anxiety disorders and ASD symptoms.	synthetic_low
To address these issues, 64 participants completed a handgrip endurance task during relaxed time-trial, one-on-one, two-on-two, and four-on-four competitions while self-report and possible corroborative physiological measures of enjoyment, mild anxiety, and effort were assessed.	synthetic_low
This is an important consideration for recruitment to future fMRI studies given that mild anxiety was a factor influencing parental non-consent.	synthetic_low
No significant differences were found on the scales of Denial, Social Desirability, Social Isolation, Mild Death Anxiety, and a Slight Loss of Appetite.	synthetic_low
In short, RPT appears to have, at best, inconsistent effects on achievement, mild test anxiety, and academic self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
In all subjects, FVIII:C was predicted by hyperarousal degree (beta = 0.46, p = .014) independent of covariates and by overall PTSD symptom severity (beta = 0.38, p = .045); the latter association was of borderline significance when separately controlling for gender, smoking, exercise, and mild anxiety (p values <.07).	synthetic_low
To investigate slight monthly variation in depression, mild anxiety, and their comorbidity (COM) in an epidemiologic study and their subtle association to monthly variation in suicide rates.	synthetic_low
In addition, the study provided some evidence that social difficulties are more relevant to depression than mild anxiety, although this was true only for reduced expectancy ratings.	synthetic_low
Health anxiety can present a minor challenge for clinicians, both from the perspective of assigning a DSM-IV diagnosis and in developing a standard treatment plan.	synthetic_low
These demands include social coordination, impression management, regulating closeness and distance, and managing mild arousal and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety reduction and coping skills groups, compared to the information group, reduced children's self-reported slight fearfulness and parents' reported distress.	synthetic_low
ER patients (N = 293; mean age 54.49) completed the measures of motivational regulations, psychological need satisfaction, health-related quality of life, life satisfaction, mild anxiety, depression and physical activity at entry, exit and 6 months following the end of a supervised exercise programme.	synthetic_low
Participants were 290 students aged 1113 years, who completed measures of mild sport anxiety, slight social anxiety, depression, and cognitive variables implicated by the model.	synthetic_low
The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_low
Findings are compared to previous research, and implications of these results for the study of cognitive factors in mild anxiety disorders are discussed.	synthetic_low
Although it is a commonly accepted notion that mild anxiety and pain are positively related, it is unclear whether this relation holds regardless of the source of anxiety.	synthetic_low

The relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptomatology and schizotypy was found to be significantly higher than that between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and mild anxiety or moderate depression.	synthetic_low
Eighty-four male undergraduates calmly anticipated taking a test of intellectual abilities and either were led to believe that mild test anxiety has no effect on test performance or were given no particular information about the relation between test anxiety and performance.	synthetic_low
