Individual differences in these patterns suggested that past and present difficulties interfered with normative shifts such that maternal stress and history of trauma were associated with an increased sense that children control problematic events while decreasing mothers' own sense of control.	natural
74 patients with war-related trauma were administered the Impact of Event Scale and the Self-rating Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, followed 1 wk.	natural
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one of the most common disorders following trauma, has been associated with a tendency to remember past personal memories in a nonspecific, overgeneral way.	natural
Vicarious trauma was measured using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (Pearlman, 2003).	natural
The results indicated that the patients who attributed their pain to a specific trauma reported significantly higher levels of emotional distress, life interference, and higher levels of pain severity than did the patients who indicated that their pain had an insidious or spontaneous onset, regardless of the extent of objective physical findings.	natural
Before surgery, trauma exposure was associated with impulsive, compulsive, or restrictive eating patterns (OR = 2.40), overeating or disturbed eating (OR = 1.55), and grazing or night eating behaviours (OR = 1.72).	natural
More severe PTSD symptoms were predicted by greater trauma exposure (r = .43), greater sociodemographic risk (r = .22), and lower developmental competence (rs=.31 and .54 for preschool and school-age developmental competence, respectively).	natural
However, leading theoretical models of the mechanisms underlying the association between trauma and negative outcomes suggest a more parsimonious explanation in that deficits in emotion regulation may underlie these various risk factors for self-injury.	natural

Sixty-seven percent of the sample was classified as Unresolved with respect to loss or trauma and a substantial proportion of insecure attachment representations (14 Secure-Autonomous, 39 Dismissing, 42 Preoccupied, 5 Cannot Classify) was found, in addition to high intake levels of post traumatic stress symptoms and comorbidity.	natural
Prospective cohort study, matched 1:1 for five potential confounding variables (age, sex, symptoms, mechanism of injury and extracranial trauma severity).	natural
Using variants of the emotional Stroop task (EST), a large number of studies demonstrated attentional biases in individuals with PTSD across different types of trauma.	natural
At the Victorian Child Trauma service, we are using a sensorimotor framework to help children recover from their experiences of trauma.	natural
Several themes were commonly addressed in sessions including opportunities to re-experience, release, and reorganize the trauma, building resilience or self-esteem for the child, promoting safety, and helping the child to regulate emotional reactions and behavior problems.	natural
This policy of engineering mass trauma and torture through war to achieve political subjugation is framed as a paradigm shift in the Israeli colonial occupation of Palestine.	natural
Treating the trauma of rape: cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD.	natural
Fifty-five female survivors of assault completed PTSD diagnostic interviews and a self-report coping measure and participated in a trauma monologue procedure that included continuous heart rate measurement.	natural
Latent profile analyses (LPAs) were employed to evaluate predominant typologies of PTSD symptoms in a sample of 164 treatment-seeking older adults with childhood war-related trauma.	natural
Twenty-six parent-adolescent dyads were recruited if parents had a trauma history and the dyad were currently having high levels of conflict.	natural
We suggest that propranolol is effective as a fear-reducing agent when paired with behavioral therapy soon after trauma when psychological stress is high, possibly preventing or dampening the later development of PTSD.	natural
Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample (N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with mild experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance modestly mediated the relationships between historical and dispositional risk factors (such as light childhood trauma and low negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problem behaviors.	synthetic_low
We demonstrate that Cushing used cortical stimulation to define primary motor and sensory cortices in the treatment of tumors, minor trauma, and epilepsy, within adult and pediatric populations.	synthetic_low
These data suggest that the psychiatric effects of civilian trauma may include mild anxiety and slight depressive disorders.	synthetic_low
This article reviews empirical literature on the physical and sexual assault of women by their male intimates and discusses potential physical and psychological outcomes, with a focus on linking what is known about abused women's mild reactions with the rich literature on survivors' responses to trauma.	synthetic_low
Children with mild trauma histories as defined in the proposed DTD Criterion A were much more likely to meet the proposed DTD symptom criteria than children who did not meet the exposure criterion.	synthetic_low
Subjects included patients admitted to the trauma service of a large teaching hospital who were suspected of having suffered mild CHI.	synthetic_low

This paper presents a comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of mild psychological trauma symptoms (irritation, mild anxiety, low mood, and slight dissociation).	synthetic_low
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the minor problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and slight posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the mild aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_low
Previous research has suggested that the rates of unresolved states of mind regarding minor trauma in response to the AAI may be underestimated due to the lack of direct questions and associated gentle probes regarding physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_low
