There are three main advantages in using an intrapsychic interpretation: (a) avoiding possible transference collusion in paranoid or perverse borderline structures; (b) eliminating possible persecutory anxiety from superego part objects projected into the analyst; and (c) putting the conflict in the right place, inasmuch as transference is a projection of internal conflicts.	natural

Its dynamic and economic aspects are summarized as follows: those who have created a neoreality in terms of sexual acts and objects in the service of moderate libidinal homeostasis, and neoneeds in the service of mild narcissistic homeostasis, have reduced the elaboration of phallic-oedipal castration anxiety and at the same time through mitigating the problems of separateness and of minor infantile sadism have also simplified what Klein termed the elaboration of the depressive position.	synthetic_intensity
Outcome measures included routine assessor ratings, daily client self-report of mild anxiety severity, and straightforward questionnaire measures.	synthetic_intensity
Increasing counselor attachment anxiety was mildly related to a slightly negative directional bias; as counselors' attachment anxiety increased, the difference between counselors and clients WA ratings became slightly more negative.	synthetic_intensity

Structural equation modeling of data on 120 patients with a primary diagnosis of mild social phobia and 207 patients with a primary diagnosis of moderate panic disorder was used to examine the association between manageable anxiety symptom dimensions and the scales of the Temperament and Character Inventory and of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
It was suggested that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mild anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	synthetic_intensity

The three main hypotheses are: that psychologically abusive mothers have a moderately high level of hostile feelings (Factor I); that the moderate level of hostile feelings in abusive mothers is associated with somewhat low marital coping skills (resulting in less affectionate, occasionally violent marriages), a somewhat negative childhood upbringing (mildly punitive, somewhat uncaring, moderately over controlling), a moderately high level of stress (manageable stress), and a moderately high level of strain (slightly low self-esteem, mild depression, some neurotic symptoms, occasional social anxiety, sometimes feeling wronged); and that maternal psychological child abuse is associated with somewhat low marital coping skills, a somewhat negative childhood upbringing, a moderately high level of stress and a moderately high level of strain.	synthetic_intensity
