Interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, and intensive psychodynamic cognitive therapy are types of individual psychotherapy that appear to have some relevance for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Of the global TAB, the job involvement was closely associated with mild depression as well as other mood states such as occasional anxiety and mild fatigue.	synthetic_low
Factors predicting mild depression included a brief history of depression, slightly lower socioeconomic status, and moderately high preoperative scores in the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
This association may arise due to confounding by mild depression or low depression severity.	synthetic_low
Scores improved for both groups on both measures following the interventions, but the group exposed to dance therapy had marginally lower Beck Depression scores that lasted slightly longer.	synthetic_low
Measures of minor negative life change events, daily hassles, and relative self-efficacy were used to predict mild depression, minimal psychosomatic symptoms, and slightly negative wellbeing both in concurrent and timelag designs.	synthetic_low
For females, both M scores and M F interaction predicted mild depression, with somewhat higher F and slightly lower M scores associated with greater depression.	synthetic_low
PTSD symptomatology over a 36-month period was studied in cocaine-dependent individuals (N = 34) who entered a pharmacologic trial targeting cocaine use and mild depression, but did not include any treatment for PTSD.	synthetic_low
Relationships of slight physical and mental fatigue, along with somewhat reduced activity and motivation with mild depression and minor physical disabilities, were successfully established cross-sectionally by regression analyses and over time through structural equation modeling.	synthetic_low
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with relatively mild symptoms of depression (BDI> 15).	synthetic_low
Economic and patient-centered research highlights the role of quality of life outcomes alongside moderate symptom severity as a key target of mild depression treatment.	synthetic_low
However, in direct contradiction of existing literature, the women reported significantly less tension-anxiety, mild depression, anger, and confusion than the men.	synthetic_low
Activity profiles were subsequently associated with self-rated health and mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
DSM-III criteria for minor affective disorder were used to establish a reliable and valid prevalence estimate for mild depression among latency-aged children.	synthetic_low
Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, Ipat Anxiety Scale, Ipat Mild Depression Scale and AIDS Impact Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
The results using passive avoidance conditioning were suggestive but may have been confounded by the mild general activity depression that was found to follow Metrazol-induced seizures.	synthetic_low
We calculated the moderate odds ratio for any association between sensory loss and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Occlusion of one eye and functional hemidecortication by mild cortical spreading depression (CSD) were used to examine the relative importance of crossed and uncrossed visual projections for pattern discrimination learning in hooded and albino rats.	synthetic_low
Previous research indicates that individuals with mild seasonal depression (SD) do not show the slight memory biases for negative self-referent information that are seen in non-seasonal depression (NSD).	synthetic_low
These relationships remained even after controlling for temporary state-like depression, suggesting that the DPDI has some incremental validity.	synthetic_low
Methodological issues including the basic need to define homogeneous subgroups, the moderate effect of demographic variables, and slight sex bias in the diagnosis and measurement of mild depression are discussed.	synthetic_low
At age 18 years, 215 EP/ELBW and 157 normal birthweight (>2499 g) control adolescents completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, Axis 1 Non-Patient version (SCID-I/NP), the Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes (ChIPS) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) module, and questionnaires assessing mild depression and anxiety symptoms and personality traits.	synthetic_low
These somewhat male-like and slightly female-like characteristics are considered regarding minor conduct problems and mild depression to explore how they inform biological and environmental theories about gender and psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Among the Texas youth, 48.08 scored slightly above 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies' Depression Scale (CES-D); 21 reported occasional illicit drug use in the past month; and 23.43 said they had casually thought about killing themselves during the past week.	synthetic_low
Despite a proliferation of recent research examining mild childhood and adolescent depression, the area still lags behind the adult depression field, particularly in the investigation of cognitive correlates of affective issues.	synthetic_low
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_low
Behaviors associated with affective disorders ranging along the affective spectrum from mild depression to dysphoric mania may be particularly amenable to valproic acid.	synthetic_low
The patients' clinical state was monitored by means of the Hamilton rating scale and the standard Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
African Americans and whites participated equally in the assessment process, and both groups presented with similar psychiatric treatment histories, mild severity of depression, moderate psychosocial functioning, and a manageable severity of medical illness.	synthetic_low
Specifically, patients showed moderate decreases in mild symptoms of depression and the use of emotion-oriented coping, along with slight increases in overall social adjustment and interpersonal self-efficacy when compared to pretreatment levels.	synthetic_low
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	synthetic_low
Results show that, compared with PTC nontasters, the tasters experienced slight depressions, shorter periods of mild sadness, symptoms that vaguely resembled endogenous depression, and the tasters mentioned having a few family members affected by depression.	synthetic_low
