The healthy dietary pattern was associated with reduced odds of depression for those with diabetes (OR 0.68, 95 CI [0.52, 0.88], p=0.006) and those without diabetes (OR 0.79, 95 CI [0.64, 0.97], p=0.029) (interaction p=0.048).	natural

Sixty-seven suffered from unipolar depression and 36 had bipolar or schizo-affective disorders In order to qualify for entry to the cohort the unipolar patients had to have had at least three episodes of depression and those with bipolar disorders had to have had at least three episodes - with at least one manic episode and one depressive episode.	natural
Melancholia appears to have a later age of onset than non-melancholic depression, while its phenotypic expression appears to change with age, with psychomotor disturbance being more distinct in older subjects.	natural
Using a multi-informant approach, the current study examined the association of maternal autonomy granting and maternal symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depression) with youth anxiety among mothers and 88 youth (ages of 617) diagnosed with a principal anxiety disorder.	natural
Depression had a significant effect on between subject variance in state emotionality.	natural
Drawing from animal studies showing that reduced neuroplasticity mediates effects of inflammation on depression, we hypothesized that individuals genetically predisposed to lower levels of neuroplasticity would be more susceptible to inflammation-associated depression.	natural
A consistent pattern of change favoring CBT was evident in measures of anxiety, depression, and cognition.	natural
The adaptive behaviors and social reciprocity of the children, parenting stress, and parent-child interactions were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), and Interaction Rating Scale (IRS).	natural
Although inquiring/screening about maternal depression has increased since 2004, less than half of pediatricians usually screen or inquire about maternal depression, representing a missed opportunity to identify depression and manage or refer women for treatment.	natural
Additionally, chronic LBP patients report more somatic symptoms of depression (e.g.. emo ltional and self disturbance complaints) than cognitive-affective symptoms.	natural
Results indicated that higher SEQ-DA scores were associated with lower self-rated depression scores (Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale), which is evidence of good construct validity.	natural
COPD participants with higher anxiety reported greater symptoms of depression and poorer sleep quality than did COPD participants with low anxiety.	natural

Results suggest that female veterans receiving Aikido experienced a greater decrease in self-reported symptoms of PTSD (partial 2 = .05) and depression (partial 2 = .05) while in residential treatment.	natural
The results supported the contention that self-report instruments may be useful in differentiating recurrent-episode major depression from dysthymic disorders.	natural
There exists very little evidence to guide clinical management for preventing recurrence of major depression.	natural
Using a college sample (N = 185), we found that aversive indecisiveness was uniquely predictive of neuroticism, Intolerance of Uncertainty, anxiety, depression, self-consciousness, worry, diminished cognitive flexibility, and multiple forms of avoidance over avoidant indecisiveness.	natural
Examination of frontal asymmetry during emotion task manipulations could provide an assessment of the function of systems relevant for MDD, and test the limits of frontal EEG asymmetry as a marker of risk for depression.	natural
Clients significantly improved over the 2-week period on depression and anxiety symptoms as well as a range of psychological inflexibility measures.	natural
In a recursive path model, both subjective stress and perceived effectiveness were significant predictors of changes in depression.	natural
The groups were compared on assessments of anxiety, worry, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anomalous perceptual experiences, reasoning, and history of traumatic events.	natural
The analysis, which uses structural equation modeling procedures, extends earlier confirmatory factor analyses of the Symptom Checklist-90--Revised Depression and Additional Symptoms scales conducted by Newmann, Engel, & Jensen (1990, 1991a, 1991b).	natural
The guidelines developed by the U.S. Public Health Service Agency for Health Care Policy and Research seek to enhance the primary care physician's ability to diagnose and treat mild depression.	synthetic_low
Partial correlation analysis, controlling for mild depression, showed a noticeable positive relationship between volition and adaptive occupational behavior.	synthetic_low
At posttreatment, subjects in both active treatments reported some improvement on self-report and interview measures of mild depression while subjects in the waiting list condition reported slight change.	synthetic_low
Statistically significant inverse correlations also were found between hemoglobin and occasional social withdrawal, minor sleep problems, and mild depression (internalizing subscale behaviors) in 2- to 3-year-old girls, and between hemoglobin and mild aggression and hyperactivity (externalizing subscale behaviors) in 4- to 5-year-old girls.	synthetic_low

There was not, however, a consistent relationship between mild depression and subtle quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_low
Some 60 will have a manageable physical disease and perhaps as many as 50 will have mild psychiatric illness, particularly mild depression.	synthetic_low
These relationships remained even after controlling for temporary state-like depression, suggesting that the DPDI has some incremental validity.	synthetic_low
