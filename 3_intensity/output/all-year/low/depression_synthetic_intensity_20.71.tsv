From this sample, 113 (26.6) patients have their diagnosis changed, most of them adding a vascular component to initial diagnosis or depression as comorbidity or main disease.	natural
Our results show that, in puerperae, increased serum PEP is related to increased state anxiety in the early puerperium and that lowered serum PEP is related to a subsequent postpartum major depression.	natural

The strongest predictor of improvement of depression and somatic symptom severity was the patients' belief that their physical well-being was influenced by psychological factors (B = 1.44 and 1 = 0.65).	natural
A total of 278 advanced cancer patients and their spouse caregivers completed measures of psychological distress (e.g., depression), physical burden from cancer (e.g., symptom count), caregiving burden (i.e., time and task demand), and social relatedness (i.e., social support and attachment security).	natural
Adequate predictive validity was supported through correlations with measures of patient functioning, after controlling for pain and process from the PF model, including: depression, =.15, p<.01, work and social adjustment, =.10, p<.05, and pain interference, =.11, p<.05.	natural

Major depression, undifferentiated somatoform and posttraumatic stress disorders were the most common diagnoses.	natural
The authors hypothesized that womens resource losses would better predict postpartum anger and depression than their resource gains (in the opposite direction).	natural
This negative correlation was replicated, and the SDQ was factor analyzed to determine which factors might account for the correlation with depression.	natural
Posttreatment depression scores significantly prospectively predicted an increased risk for recurrence, and acute life events in the follow-up period.	natural
Whether increased neuroticism and reduced resilience are downstream mediators of genetic risk for depression, and whether they contribute independently to risk remains unknown.	natural

Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and social, emotional, and role functioning (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 subscales) were measured before treatment (T1), 3 to 6 weeks after starting treatment (T2), 2 weeks later (T3), and 2 to 4 weeks after treatment ended or at the next restaging visit for participants who continued to receive treatment (T4).	natural
We sought to add to the literature as to whether depression is associated with pulmonary function in healthy adults.	natural
This study examined the accuracy of depression cross-walk tables in a sample of people with multiple sclerosis (MS).	natural
It is concluded that the less impaired respondents with DSM-III-R major depression cannot be distinguished from the more impaired on illness characteristics that are not tied to the mildness of the illness.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesize that older adults who anxiously expect, readily perceive, and moderately react to social rejection because of their old age (i.e., have high age-based rejection sensitivity) are somewhat vulnerable to mild depression and slightly reduced social functioning.	synthetic_intensity
In most cases, data at postprogramme and at a threemonth followup revealed slight improvements in mild depression and some anger and, to a smaller extent, with moderate selfesteem.	synthetic_intensity
Correlational analyses were performed between age and education-corrected scores on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (FAS), Design Fluency, and WISC-R Mazes, and scores on MMPI-2 scales D, PT, Anxiety, Fears, Obsessional Thinking, Mild Depression, and Bizarre Mentation.	synthetic_intensity
Fifty spouses of mildly clinically depressed patients completed a biographical questionnaire, the Coping Strategy Indicator (J. H. Amirkhan, 1990, 1994), the Beck Depression Inventory (A. T. Beck, 1967; A. T. Beck, C. H. Ward, M. Mendelson, J. Mock, & J. Erbaugh, 1961), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (C. D. Spielberger, R. E. Lushene, B. A. Vagg, & E. Jacobs, 1983), and the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (H. J. Locke & K. M. Wallace, 1959, 1987).	synthetic_intensity
The current study examined whether and how mild maternal depression and occasional parenting stress may influence specific parenting practices, as well as whether maternal warmth, home learning stimulation, and cultural socialization mediated the relation between mild maternal depression, manageable parenting stress, and children's kindergarten reading and math achievement.	synthetic_intensity
