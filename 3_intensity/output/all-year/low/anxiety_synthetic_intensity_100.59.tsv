Avoidance and minor hyperarousal in response to reminders of socially stressful events were common among patients; more than one-third would have met criteria for PTSD if these events satisfied DSM-IV PTSD Criterion A. Frequency of this PTSD-like symptom pattern did not significantly differ among patients who did and did not experience another event that did satisfy PTSD Criterion A. Implications of these findings for the treatment of social anxiety disorder are discussed.	synthetic_low

In this paper, four issues related to this premise are discussedâ€”whether or not pubertal events elicit a small amount of stress and anxiety or more variable response patterns; whether they have mild short-term and/or long-term impact upon the adolescent; whether pubertal changes result in slightly different information being transmitted; and whether gradual change results in heightened sensitivity to contextual cues.	synthetic_low
A marginally significant interaction occurred between gender and mild mathematics anxiety on the mathematics fluency test with highly anxious males showing a smaller decrement in performance than highly anxious females when exposed to less anxiety-inducing instructions.	synthetic_low
The Generalized Anxiety Inventory (GAI) has been developed for use in the assessment of mild anxiety symptoms in older adults (65 years), but previous validation work has not examined the psychometric qualities of the instrument in relation to treatment.	synthetic_low
