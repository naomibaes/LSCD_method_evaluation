To promote growth, practitioners can help survivors understand the meaning and subtle impact of the abuse on their lives and deconstruct rigid gender norms.	synthetic_low
The victim-to-patient process is reconceptualized as a gentle interplay among minor abuse events, family relationships, and other life contexts, emphasizing the fragmented identity deriving from accommodations to the benign judgments of others about the abuse.	synthetic_low
Using an open-coding approach, seven challenges were identified including minor funding issues, sustainability, community norms, tension between grassroots versus professional service providers, lack of attention to sexual assault, the desire for welcoming services for all survivors, and the need for comprehensive services to assist survivors with co-occurring minor mental health issues and occasional substance abuse problems.	synthetic_low

In three other populations, psychiatric inpatients, motor accident victims, and female prisoners, the association between PTSD and mild alcohol abuse highlighted the clinical and public health importance of this relationship.	synthetic_low
Considering that human addicts regularly prefer drugs of minor abuse to drug-free social interaction, the present findings suggest that our experimental paradigm of concurrent CPP for cocaine vs. social interaction is of even greater translational power if performed in C57BL/6 mice, the genetic background for most transgenic rodent models, than in rats.	synthetic_low
Intake clinical evaluations were abstracted to yield common stressors that included mild childhood abuse, early loss or death, exposure to violence, and attachment problems.	synthetic_low

The enhanced validity of LS total risk/need with females was traced to the moderate validity of Substance Abuse with females.	synthetic_low
The taxonomy was constructed incorporating two dimensions: perpetrator type and minor primary motivation to commit abuse.	synthetic_low
Since interviewed Ss may slightly minimize their drug-taking activity, much descriptive and experimental drug abuse research might be somewhat invalid.	synthetic_low
Using a constructivist grounded theory design, this study examined perceptions of healing in 10 female survivors of mild child sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, the staff are being instructed how to manage behaviours resulting from mild abuse experiences such as minor eating disorders, occasional self-harming behaviour and slight depressions.	synthetic_low
While mild substance abuse levels among participants did not increase or decrease as a function of the riot, there were a slightly smaller number of social supports and slightly greater levels of already existing psychological distress.	synthetic_low

The Drug-Taking Confidence Questionnaire (DTCQ; Annis & Martin, 1985) is a 50-item self-report questionnaire developed to assess situation-specific coping self-efficacy for use of a less harmful substance of abuse (e.g., cocaine, heroin, alcohol, cannabis, etc.).	synthetic_low
The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to regulate an animal's behavioral responsiveness to emotionally salient stimuli, and a slight increase in CREB phosphorylation in the NAc has been observed during exposure to mildly rewarding stimuli, such as mild drugs of abuse.	synthetic_low
A history of depression (p=0.006) and low reported quality of life (p=0.029) predicted a slight increase on the MDQ; the odds of an increase in (hypo)manic symptoms was 5.6 times higher with a history of any psychiatric disease/minor substance abuse (p=0.005).	synthetic_low
