In contrast to reports in younger populations, depression does not appear to increase stroke risk among the old and very old, but continuous to be a risk factor for all-cause mortality.	natural
Of these, 16 had major depression (7 also had apathy) and 10 had no psychopathology.	natural
Such certainty was uniquely associated with depression, even when the simple perceived likelihood of the events (and even generalized hopelessness as measured by the Beck scale) was considered.	natural

Central to diagnosing depression was the routine, ongoing, long-term relationship GPs had with their mildly affected gay male patients.	synthetic_low
Forty-five elementary school-age children who were identified as having witnessed domestic violence, and their teachers were surveyed for self-esteem, mild depression, and classroom behaviors.	synthetic_low
Minor cognitive disturbances associated with A. T. Beck's (1967) cognitive model and attributional style theories of mild depression differentiate ADHD children with mood pathology.	synthetic_low
Using a gene-by-environment (G x E) interaction design, we tested whether three polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1, also referred to as SLC6A3, located at 5p15.33) interacted with maternal parenting style to predict occasional first-onset episodes of depression.	synthetic_low
In general moderated mediation analyses, results indicated that the mediation effect of academic achievement on mild depression was slightly moderated by the ages of children, with a somewhat higher effect for younger children (grades 34) than older children (grades 56).	synthetic_low
Partners of women with mild depression demonstrated slightly less optimal interaction with their infants, indicating that fathers do not fully compensate for the subtle negative effects of maternal depression on the child.	synthetic_low
Perceived parental traditionalism, the strongest predictor, was associated with mild depression; and perceived parental modernism, with lower depression.	synthetic_low
Thus, this study suggests that AD produces a slowing in both cognitive and motor processes, whereas a mild depression results solely in a slight motor retardation.	synthetic_low
The factor structure of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is still somewhat controversial, particularly concerning general depression.	synthetic_low
It acknowledged there was no evidence that screening for mild depression leads to improved outcomes in cardiovascular populations but still recommended routine screening without providing an alternative evidence-based explanation.	synthetic_low
In addition to the automatic information processing that is typically assessed in mild depression, light effortful information processing was examined to determine if depressive cognitive dysfunctions were limited to routine automatic processing mechanisms.	synthetic_low
As predicted, there was a significant relationship linking a pattern of high internality and low belief in powerful others with mild depression in the elderly, but not in the young.	synthetic_low
The relationship between the constructs of anxiety and mild depression are examined through the administration of nine self-report scales to male and female undergraduates.	synthetic_low
