Two hundred and sixty college students completed a questionnaire that provided information regarding their sexual experience, knowledge, and attitudes; their self-evaluations on dimensions related to sexuality; and their level of mild heterosocial anxiety (anxiety experienced in casual social interactions with members of the other sex).	synthetic_low
The social phobia group reported significantly fewer ADHD symptoms than both of the comparison groups, who occasionally reported mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low

Consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety, three primary but mild anxiety factors emerged, supporting the construct validity of the new scale.	synthetic_low
Bivariate metaregression analysis revealed a noticeable association between depression and anxiety effect sizes at post-treatment. Longer-term follow-ups of up to 14 months post-baseline showed indications for a small lasting effect of psychotherapy on anxiety outcomes ( = 0.27). This meta-analysis provides evidence that psychotherapy aimed at depression can also modestly reduce anxiety symptoms in relation to control conditions.	synthetic_low
