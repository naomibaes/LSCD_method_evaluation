Indepth interview data from 35 persons diagnosed and treated for clinical depression suggest that four factors interact synergistically to deepen depression's isolation: the intrinsic character of the emotional experience of depression, the failure of individuals to have a clear vocabulary for understanding their own predicament, the incomprehensibility of depression to normals, and the stigma attached to going public with one's problem.	natural

Multivariate logistic regression identified five predictors that were significantly correlated with bipolar disorder: antidepressant-related switch to mania/hypomania, mixed depression, two or more previous mood episodes within the past year, early age at the onset of a major depressive episode (<25 years), and a history of suicide attempts.	natural
Since both cholesterol and CSF 5-HIAA are associated with suicide and violent suicide attempts, we also investigated the correlation with suicide, violent suicide attempt method, suicide intent, hopelessness and depression severity.	natural
Depression was associated with increased risk of SCD (hazard risk [HR], 1.62; 95 confidence interval [CI], 1.37-1.92; p < .001), VT/VF (HR, 1.47; 95 CI, 1.23-1.76; p < .001) and AF recurrence (HR, 1.88; 95 CI, 1.54-2.30; p < .001).	natural

The lack of unidirectional and consistent patterns of association for depression and substance use disorders indicates that multiple mechanisms of comorbidity are likely to be simultaneously active in this population.	natural
