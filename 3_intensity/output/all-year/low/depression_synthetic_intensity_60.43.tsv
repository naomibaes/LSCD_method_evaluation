Thirty-four normal male subjects were tested to determine the mild relationships between physical fitness condition (Ismail criterion), levels of self-reported depression (MMPI) and anxiety (Welsh criterion), and the urinary concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), normetanephrine (NM), and metanephrine (M).	synthetic_low

These parameters were studied during two anestrous states: (a) during presumed pseudopregnancy (diestrous vaginal smear for 1421 days) the FWI and UFO increased and remained relatively stable until spontaneous estrous cycles resumed when again they showed slight depressions at the time of estrous; (b) following ovariectomy FWI and UFO increased, reached a plateau in about 20 days and showed no periods of depression.	synthetic_low
Of those with symptoms just sufficient to meet criteria for comorbid depression (12) or anxiety diagnoses (26), fewer than one-fourth were considered to have manageable independent disorders, and these patients did not constitute a category of notable severity.	synthetic_low
