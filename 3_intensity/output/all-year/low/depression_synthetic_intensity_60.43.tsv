Consistent associations were observed between depression and anxiety symptom trajectories within-individuals over time, such that adolescents who experienced a higher level of a specific symptom type than would be expected given their overall symptom trajectory were more likely to experience a later deflection from their average trajectory in other symptoms.	natural

Both irrational beliefs and self-management have been linked to anxiety and depression, and there is evidence for their usefulness for these types of distress.	natural
Participants with low or high contamination fear completed self-report measures of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and mild depression before completing the BAT.	synthetic_intensity

Mild depression scores were slightly negatively associated with systolic blood pressure and heart rate reactions, after careful adjustment for likely confounders such as sex, cohort, occupational status, body mass index, stress task performance score, baseline cardiovascular activity, antidepressant, and antihypertensive medication.	synthetic_intensity
Ratings of parasuicide risk, anxiety, mild depression, social functioning and global function, positive and negative thinking, and quality of life were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.	synthetic_intensity
We found that as students (N = 155) encountered minor daily stress, their slight daily loneliness and depression increased a little, and their daily happiness slightly decreased.	synthetic_intensity
Sex-role orientation was not effective in explaining mild depression scores for working wives or for husbands in the sample.	synthetic_intensity
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were then exposed to photographs of thin female models and moderately muscular male models, and visual analogue scales were used to measure slight changes in postexposure state body dissatisfaction, minor feelings of anger, anxiety, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Comorbidity of mild depression with other psychiatric disorders was also observed in these nonpatient samples and it will be important in future work to assess the implications of this for the etiology, treatment, and prognosis of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
At 6 to 12 months' post-partum, women were screened and interviewed again for mild depression and asked to report the occasional frequencies with which they had casually brought their infants to the doctor on non-routine visits in the preceding 6 weeks.	synthetic_intensity
For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with moderate temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to mild antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
At six months post intervention there was no statistically significant difference in mild symptoms of depression between the two groups although the difference in symptoms remained clinically appreciable (Cohen's d = 0.61).	synthetic_intensity
Prior studies of thyroid, adrenal and mild mood measures during pregnancy and the puerperium, which we review, have not examined hormone-mood relationships over the full peripartum period during which hormone levels change nor have they compared prior low-level depression history with hormone changes.	synthetic_intensity
Operation analyses, for which behavioral and environmental events are translated into reinforcement schedules, indicate that mild winter depression and slight spring irritability reported by people living in northern climates are dominated by four paradigms.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined multiple levels of adolescents' interpersonal functioning, including general peer relations (peer crowd affiliations, mild peer victimization), and qualities of supportive best friendships and stable romantic relationships as predictors of mild symptoms of depression and social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Even though the internal reliability and the concurrent validity were good (Cronbach alpha = 0.846; r = 0.566), the results showed that the item of Loss of Libido was most weakly correlated with the CBDI's total score; the items of Mild Sense of Punishment, Mild Sense of Hate, Occasional Self Accusations, Rare Crying Spells, Slight Irritability, and Minimal Somatic Preoccupation were poorly associated with the intensity of mild depression measured by the total score of the Chinese version of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (CHDS).	synthetic_intensity

In bi-variate analysis, HIV symptoms (frequency and extent symptoms were bothersome), perceived stigma, internalized stigma, and mild depression were significantly and negatively associated with QOL whereas social support, problem-focused coping, perceived situational control, and healthy lifestyles were significantly and positively associated with QOL (all p < .0001).	synthetic_intensity
