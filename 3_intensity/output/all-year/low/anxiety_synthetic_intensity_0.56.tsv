The chief finding was that subjects with a lifetime history of panic disorder-agoraphobia (PD-Ag) returned statistically higher scores on a retrospective measure of early separation anxiety compared to subjects with either generalized anxiety or other phobic disorders, a result which was not accounted for by differences in neuroticism or General Health Questionnaire scores.	natural
Every month, patients completed an interview measure assessing stressful life events and self-report measures of perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, which were used to predict the presence of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) and T2 lesions on MRI scans 29-62 days later.	natural
School attending adolescents (n=1149) completed measures of anxiety sensitivity (CASI), trait anxiety (STAI-T), childhood trauma (CTQ), depression (CES-DC), alcohol (AUDIT) and drug use (DUDIT), and resilience (CD-RISC) and coping orientation (A-COPE).	natural
Spence operationalized trait anxiety by creating the Manifest Anxiety Scale, and she conducted numerous studies linking scores on this scale to performance across a variety of cognitive tasks.	natural
In both studies, secure attachment to God (i.e., lower avoidance, lower anxiety) and religious service attendance were positively correlated with self-reported psychological well-being.	natural
Our results suggest that belief in the Da Vinci Code conspiracy may be associated with coping with existential threat and death-related anxiety.	natural
To evaluate whether phobic anxiety is associated with increased risk of cardiac mortality in individuals with established coronary heart disease (CHD) and to examine the role of reduced heart rate variability (HRV) in mediating this risk.	natural
Such failures will reinforce the negative expectations underpinning state social anxiety, making it harder for more anxiously attached individuals to initiate and develop the satisfying relationships that might over time help them overcome their relational insecurity.	natural
Therefore, access to a valid and reliable measure of anxiety and depression among nursing home patients is highly warranted.	natural
The I.P.A.T. Anxiety Scale was administered to a series of patients admitted to hospital for the insertion of an artificial cardiac pacemaker.	natural

The frequency and direction of symptoms of competitive trait anger were assessed in 197 Italian rugby players together with the intensity and direction of multidimensional trait anxiety.	natural
This investigation was conducted to describe the clinical of characteristics of anxious children with significant hoarding behavior and to examine the contributions of anxiety, obsessive compulsive, and inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the prediction of hoarding.	natural
Further, we wanted to determine whether this moderating influence of anxiety differentially affects PD patients with left hemibody (LBH) versus right hemibody (RHB) onset of motor symptoms.	natural
This study comprised 3 waves: Waves 1 (n = 30) and 2 (n = 30) examined feasibility, and Wave 3 (n = 40) examined the acceptability of STM and compared its effect on preoperative anxiety to Usual Care (UC).	natural
Findings suggest that therapists may need more session time for adults with ASD, although it is unclear if this time is dedicated to anxiety or depression treatment.	natural
One meta-analysis pooled trials of vigorous exercise and reported small, nonstatistically significant reductions in anxiety symptoms for comparisons against passive and active controls (EQ1).	natural
The validity coefficients for the samples indicate similar constructs for narcissism (related to disagreeableness, aggressiveness, aloofness from others, sensitivity to rewards, and anxiety), and empathy (related positively to emotional intelligence, extraversion, openmindedness, compliance with others and negatively to aloofness).	natural
The analyses focus on the intervening mechanisms of negative emotions such as anger, resentment, anxiety, and depression that connect exposure to interpersonal strain with delinquent outcomes, including both serious delinquency and minor offenses.	natural

In addition, diagnoses obtained at a four-year follow-up are presented for children with anxiety disorders, in order to examine the stability of the diagnoses over time.	natural
Baseline anxiety in mothers and fathers did not contribute to a model predicting children's observed anxiety.	natural
There has been debate about whether obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should be classified as one of the anxiety disorders, or should rather be categorized with obsessive-compulsive spectrum conditions.	natural
In contrast, fMRI studies show that there is exaggerated activation of caudate and related cortical regions which may constitute an attempt at strategic (as opposed to hedonic) means of responding to stimuli, and/or exaggerated anxiety, perhaps reflecting oversensitivity to uncertainty.	natural
However, no decreases in the subjects' personal assessment of tension and anxiety were evident.	natural
Anxiety has a clear negative impact on the functioning and well-being of older subjects.	natural
With control of EF and anxiety, across informants, inattention, but not hyperactivity, was positively related to child depression.	natural

Results showed that participants had significantly more attachment anxiety and avoidance as well as less interest to think about themselves and others in a complex way.	natural
Infant negative affectivity predicts child anxiety.	natural
The data suggest that (a) future studies which give patients more positive expectations and reduce their anxiety about recovery may improve their recovery and (b) the types of patients most in need of preoperative psychological support would be those who have higher trait anxiety, vigilant coping behaviors, or an internal locus of control.	natural
The article further draws from the ecopsychological principle of reciprocal interconnectedness to illustrate how our existential awareness in turn affects the way we construct time and defend against death anxiety and meaninglessness.	natural
