Grounded in family systems theory, this study examined traditional parent-child antecedents of mild childhood depression and anxiety (occasionally tense, controlling, and somewhat disengaged interactions) in the context of the entire family as well as slightly enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent gently drew in the child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and sometimes excluded the spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members expressed some vulnerabilities and occasionally asserted their needs or desires.	synthetic_low
Personality characteristics were assessed for the same patients when they had markedly improved from their mild depression.	synthetic_low
Clinician-rated scales and operationalized diagnostic interviews do not easily capture the subtle distinction between the mild depression of BPD and the moderate depression of MDD.	synthetic_low

The results of a multiple regression analysis indicated that marital adjustment and marital assertion predicted 39.7% of the variance in mild concurrent depression, assessed with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (Zung, 1965).	synthetic_low
Within this group, early-onset patients exhibited characteristics of mild subaffective dysthymia and late-onset patients demonstrated features of moderate chronic primary depression.	synthetic_low
Validation included comparisons with standardized self-report scales of mild depression, minor anxiety, and physical symptoms.	synthetic_low
The protective factors for mild depression were high-income, regular parent-child communication, communication by telephone or about such topics as learning experience, school life, and feelings.	synthetic_low
Our findings support the notion that mild anger attacks are best conceptualized as a minor feature of depression.	synthetic_low
Similarly, patients with mild-moderate depression, nonmelancholic depression, or first episode of depression (FDE), respectively, experienced some life events more often than patients with less severe, melancholic, or recurrent depression (RDE).	synthetic_low
The results showed that sociodemographic measures (e.g. age) and measures of mild depressive symptoms (e.g. low depression scores) did not discriminate dropouts from completers.	synthetic_low
Results of this study confirmed the noticeable decrease in mild depression symptoms at the experimental group compared to control group (P < 0.5).	synthetic_low
Cerebral damage after MI, caused by mild transient ischemia, a light inflammatory response or both, may occasionally contribute to development of mild post-MI depression.	synthetic_low
LISREL and regression analyses indicated that stress was related to slightly increased depression, whereas greater income and social support were related to somewhat decreased depression.	synthetic_low
The patients were evaluated at baseline and at 8 weeks by a trained rater using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Mild Depression (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A).	synthetic_low
Smoking remained an independent risk factor for greater food insecurity, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and known confounders (e.g., substance use, mild depression).	synthetic_low
Uses of the SCT in the treatment of mild depression, organic dysfunction, and children's minor problem behaviors are also discussed.	synthetic_low
The current study highlights the importance of using a multidimensional approach to examining self-focused attention in ASD, and its notable relationship with mild depression.	synthetic_low
In terms of family functioning, the findings suggest that, when a family member suffers a severe traumatic brain injury, depression may be slightly elevated, along with a modestly decreased ability to express feelings, somewhat decreased time and energy for social and recreational activities, and somewhat increased control in comparison to families without a brain-injured member.	synthetic_low
However, consistent with Lester's study, these correlations were not significant when mild depression was controlled for.	synthetic_low
Negative self-representations and mild depression were significantly related to overgeneral memory, but did not mediate the relation between abuse and overgeneral memory.	synthetic_low
We evaluated whether mild, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) staging method was marginally associated with the possibility of suicide in a large U.S. health system.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal studies in mild psychotic depression from onset are somewhat rare, encouraging the present study.	synthetic_low
Rater 1 also administered four additional, established measures: the Apathy Evaluation Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index, and the introductory Cornell Scale for Mild Depression in Dementia.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is a common and somewhat costly condition.	synthetic_low
Several community-based studies have found that mild sleep disturbances are notable risk factors for the development of new, brief episodes of minor depression in the following year.	synthetic_low
It is unclear how cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is influenced by moderate physical disability, mild fatigue, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The number of lifetime exit events occurring over the lives of 7-16-year-old children was compared between cases with new onset episodes of mild anxiety and depression (n = 100) and community controls (n = 100).	synthetic_low
