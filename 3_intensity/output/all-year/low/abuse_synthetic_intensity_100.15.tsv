The confounding influence of mild substance abuse, history of minor brain trauma and minor abnormalities, as well as age, education, IQ, learning disorders, endocrine abnormalities, and birth and developmental abnormalities were also examined.	synthetic_intensity
Intensive drinking patterns more often lead to congruent classification, yet surprisingly, participants with less intensive drinking patterns were found more often to be CAGE positive than to fulfil DSM mild abuse criteria.	synthetic_intensity
Large effect sizes were found between child physical abuse and three minor risk factors (parent mild anger/hyper-reactivity, family disagreements, and strong family cohesion).	synthetic_intensity
Approximately 30 of the children reported at least one incident of witnessing minor violence, 65 reported at least one incident of psychological abuse and 54 reported at least one incident of mild physical abuse over a 1-year period.	synthetic_intensity
One of the most important and preventable long term consequences of minor childhood abuse is the development of occasional suicidal thoughts in adolescence or adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
Use and mild abuse of alcohol and other drugs sometimes reduce inhibitions and may encourage engagement in cautious sexual behaviors that can ultimately result in HIV and AIDS.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that both the mild abuse and neglect groups showed minor differences from the comparison group when absolute difference scores from the normative data were analyzed.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the relationship between mild psychopathology with the Personality Assessment Screener (PAS) and childhood physical and sexual abuse and adult physical and sexual partner violence in a primary care sample of 98 urban-dwelling African American women.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, there was a moderate rate of diagnostic agreement for psychotic and affective illnesses as well as substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The Medical/Social Evaluation model described in this article is a merger of therapeutic (social workers) and investigative (pediatricians) efforts for victims of mild sexual abuse and their families.	synthetic_intensity
American mothers reported the highest mean score among the three countries in perceiving discipline centered on corporal punishment as mild physical abuse.	synthetic_intensity
To assess whether acceptability of non-abstinence outcome goals varied depending on the specific drug a client consumes (alcohol, cannabis, amphetamine, heroin, cocaine, MDMA/ecstasy, polydrug), mild severity of diagnosis (DSM-IV Abuse vs. Dependence), and finality of outcome goal (intermediate vs. final), we recruited 432 clinicians to complete a web-based questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
The first was moderately high on physical discipline, neglect, verbal abuse, and attitudes that mildly devalue children.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, it is proposed that research in this area investigate integrative methods for evaluating minor BZD abuse in the elderly.	synthetic_intensity
The significance of these findings and implications for programs for the prevention of minor substance abuse and future research are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were 70 male psychiatric patients who were ostensibly free of any neurologic disease or history of mild substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Parallel results were found in the clinical control group, although correlations were slightly higher in the sexual abuse group.	synthetic_intensity
Marital status, non-psychiatric comorbidities, and history of minor alcohol abuse also predicted health scores in the patients.	synthetic_intensity
Three mothers made mild attempts within the 1st week after the sexual abuse report; these three had borderline personalities, prior suicide attempts, personal histories of incest, and, surprisingly, all returned rapidly to adequate maternal functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Research limitations/implicationsThe training succeeded in improving detection and clinical response to minor child abuse and neglect presentations but not faith in the provision of ongoing support for children and families.	synthetic_intensity
Female gender, familial loading of mood disorders, history of childhood minor sexual abuse, prior history of anxiety disorder, poor self-reported physical health, and subthreshold depressive symptoms significantly predicted MDD onset.	synthetic_intensity
Logistic regression analyses showed that women reporting mild abuse, irrespective of category, were moderately more likely to meet the CES-D criteria for depression.	synthetic_intensity

The goal of this study is to verify if a link exists between attrition in a treatment for violent men and both partners's personal (age, revenue, mild substance abuse, having been subjected to minor violence as children) and marital variables (dyadic adjustment, anger, attribution, attachment style and violent behavior).	synthetic_intensity
We found that the participants provided a wide range of arguments, but that core arguments such as the possible abuse, parenting and parent-child interaction were often missing.	synthetic_intensity

Participants completed measures of mild physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, subtle maladaptive cognitive schemas (disconnection and rejection, autonomy, and other-directedness), and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Household enumeration was conducted on 509 households; wives of the youngest married man 18-50 years of age who scored 8+ on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) were selected (N = 100) and assessed with Indian adaptations of the Basic Substance Abuse Module (SAM), the Washington University Risk Behavior Assessment for Women (WU-RBA-W), the Violence Exposure Questionnaire (VEQ), the CES-D, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS-IV), and a Proxy AUDIT.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that regressed offenders whose primary motivation to commit child abuse was to meet minor non-sexual needs made more modest progress and had a positive ratio of therapy successes than comparison groups.	synthetic_intensity
As hypothesized, rates of MST were slightly higher among veterans who reported occasional childhood sexual abuse and low levels of maternal care (43) compared with veterans who reported childhood sexual abuse and high levels of maternal care (11).	synthetic_intensity
Among women, childhood exposure to minor partner abuse was related to depression, some trauma-related symptoms, and slightly low self-esteem; among men, exposure was associated with mild trauma-related symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
