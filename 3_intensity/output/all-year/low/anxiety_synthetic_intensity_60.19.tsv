Yet, both measures uniquely discriminated between adolescents on whether they were clinic referred for a social anxiety screening.	natural
Respective geneenvironment (G E) interactions were found for (a) comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders (OR = 1.13), but neither pure anxiety nor pure depressive disorders and (b) pure/temporally primary anxiety disorders (OR = 1.07), but not pure/temporally primary depressive disorders.	natural
Further, neuroticism, rumination, and worry were all positively linked to both anxiety and depression.	natural
The measures of self esteem and anxiety were independent of socioeconomic status.	natural
Anxiety was expected to predict affective and continuance commitment, and anxiety, affective commitment, and continuance commitment were expected to predict intention to leave the hospital.	natural
Shifts between euthymia and anger, and between anxiety and depression, were associated with BPD features, as were the urgency and (lack of) premeditation scales.	natural
One day prior to surgery (T1), and one day prior to discharge from the hospital (T2), 141 patients completed a psychometric test battery including the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS).	natural
We have re-analysed our previous double-blind, placebo-controlled clomipramine study, changing the focus from depression to anxiety both in the response analysis and in the classification of minor affective states.	natural
As predicted, rather than exerting a uniformly adverse effect, experimentally enhanced self-focus interacted with a lower level of test anxiety, slightly improving performances among low-anxious subjects and only mildly impairing them among the test-anxious.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that cardiac rehabilitation be directed only at those patients with mildly negative attitudes, and with slightly more than usual anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Based on a review of the coping literature, it was hypothesized that subjects with recent-onset pain would demonstrate greater adaptation (slightly lower anxiety, depression, lower pain severity and somatization ratings, and moderately higher levels of social activity) when employing avoidant rather than attentional strategies.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses controlling for the effects of the demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors influencing cardiac vagal control showed a significant moderating effect of slight change in perceived stress on the relationship of mild trait anxiety to vagal recovery from cognitive challenges (Beta=.253, p=.013).	synthetic_intensity
These results were taken as providing mild support for a cognitive view of anxiety, in which a gentle relationship exists between state anxiety and the limited accessibility of information relating to personal threat, while trait anxiety relates to the limited extent or range of such personally threatening information in memory.	synthetic_intensity
Mild test anxiety is suggested as a minor factor forming a relaxed test-taking style.	synthetic_intensity

Meetings with teachers provide information about mild social anxiety and facilitate gentle classroom exposures for socially anxious participants.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 1, the researchers examined the effects of patient-preferred live music on mild anxiety, nausea, fatigue, pain, and relaxation for hospitalized patients ( =50) recovering from a bone marrow transplant utilizing a pretest, posttest, and follow-up design with Likert-Type Scales.	synthetic_intensity
Data were analyzed from 1004 primary care patients enrolled in a trial of a collaborative care intervention for mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
There was no significant difference in self-concept between masculine and androgynous Ss, and the masculine group reported significantly lower levels of mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The current study evaluated the degree to which startle reflexes (SRs) in safe conditions versus mild danger conditions were somewhat predictive of the onset of minor anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
We discuss how attachment avoidance is a greater predictor for average levels of daily relationship quality, whereas attachment anxiety causes slight volatility in daily feelings about the relationship.	synthetic_intensity
While not for everyone, this program offers many potential benefits for those suffering from mild depression and anxiety, either on its own or in conjunction with other modes of treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Total distress, emotional and social discomfort subscales were found to have a mild positive correlation with anxiety and depression, suggesting a possible overlap of two constructs.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety is one of the factors present in initiating and maintaining a drug-dependent pattern of behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety sensitivity and slight cognitive avoidance were largely not associated with alcohol use indices.	synthetic_intensity
Later in life (e.g., adolescence), when identity issues again become crucial, concrete transitional mechanisms can again help reduce mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the present study was to examine the subtle influence of self-presentational efficacy on mild social anxiety in an exercise context.	synthetic_intensity
The decrease in depression predicted slightly lower anxiety at 8 weeks and somewhat lower anxiety, depression, and better mental_health at 8 months.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to explore the interrelationship between anxiety and other individual difference measures on crossexamination performance, and to determine how to alleviate the mild anxiety of child witnesses (to enable them to achieve their best evidence in court).	synthetic_intensity
We explored the relations of the BDI-II with demographic variables and with other self-report measures of social desirability, mild anxiety, slight depression, manageable stress, and stable self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
The objective of this study was to investigate potential correlates of depression, mild anxiety, and manageable stress in a sample of college students.	synthetic_intensity
