Regression analyses found that low role satisfaction was associated with both anxiety (p = .006) and depression severity (p = .004).	natural
These findings are consistent with the argument that stereotype threat manipulations either increase or decrease situationalspecific anxiety, and hold significant implications for thinking about fair assessment and testing practices in academic settings.	natural
The 13 items short version of the SOC scale and measures of depression and anxiety (Symptom Checklist, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were administered repeatedly over 6-12 months in both studies.	natural
The linear function constructed to discriminate the groups showed that a combination of more psychotic symptoms, social inhibitions and higher risk of self-harm effectively identified those referred to psychotherapy services, while patients exhibiting greater levels of somatic and anxiety symptoms and non-assertiveness were more likely to be seen in primary care settings.	natural
The paradoxical effects of intended thought suppression have been linked to psychological disorders, specifically anxiety disorders.	natural
Adolescence is a key period in terms of the development of anxiety psychopathology.	natural
Using path analysis/structural equation modeling across two independent samples, we found that there was a significant total indirect effect of both anxiety and depressive symptoms on alcohol-related problems in every model.	natural
We conclude with important considerations for implementing exercise as a treatment for clinically significant anxiety as well as future research directions.	natural
Relative to anxiety neurotics, the neurotic depressives recalled fathers as unloving disciplinarians and recalled mothers as difficult to please, intrusive and controlling, and possibly more concerned with their own than with their children's needs.	natural
Habitual (or trait) anxiety measures, however, were not affected by noise.	natural
The outcome of this research suggests that the FRIENDS program is an effective treatment for children with anxiety, and results from this community trial replicate findings from controlled treatment trials.	natural
The following predictions were made: (a) Interruptive behavior is inversely related to mild speech anxiety and positively related to increased confidence as a speaker; (b) interruptive behavior is inversely related to mild social anxiety (avoidance-distress; light concern about negative evaluation).	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that the range of minor dysfunctional beliefs associated with health anxiety is somewhat greater than was initially described by the cognitive-behavioral model.	synthetic_low
The current investigation explored the relationships between stigma consciousness, mild evaluative concerns perfectionism, and minor psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) in a large sample of Hispanic/Latinx and Black college students in the United States.	synthetic_low
Clinically noticeable changes in treatment completers were apparent on coping response measures of positive reappraisal, problem solving, and alternative rewards; on measures of mild anxiety and suicidality; on self-reported ability to engage in activities to reduce negative mood and to recognize mood changes.	synthetic_low
Whereas mild maternal depression was related to slightly decreased trait anxiety for children in the CF group, neither maternal anxiety nor slight depression were associated with mild child depression or low state anxiety.	synthetic_low
The relationship between negative interpretation of bodily sensations and mild social anxiety was investigated, and hypothesized cognitive models were tested using structural equation modeling in performance and social interactive situations.	synthetic_low
Light alcohol consumption, minor use of drugs/medication, and mild physical illness as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA were associated with PA-only (OR 2.46-5.44), while moderate feelings of depression, mild feelings of anxiety, and having always been slightly anxious/nervous as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA, appraising the initial FS/PA as problematic and temporarily burdensome, subsequent mild feelings of depression, subsequent moderate avoidance, and minimal subsequent consumption of medication, alcohol, or drugs were associated with PD (OR 2.64-4.15).	synthetic_low
The mild anxiety factor was predicted by slight avoidance of decision-making situations.	synthetic_low
The link transcended diagnostic categories and mood states, but mild states of anxiety and depression were also often associated with gentle insomnia at the beginning of the night.	synthetic_low
Genetic effects gently accounted for 45 and 36 of individual differences in attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, respectively.	synthetic_low
The level of mild anxiety also increased slightly in both camps for those who expected to experience a minor loss in the affective dimension in near future social interaction at school and at home.	synthetic_low
These issues can cause mild anxiety and stress, which may in turn lead to minor relationship problems for a male couple.	synthetic_low
Few subtle differences were found between autogenous and reactive obsessions with respect to depression, mild anxiety, and view about self (self-ambivalence, self-esteem).	synthetic_low
These findings highlight the importance of assessing patient attributions regarding the modest improvements achieved with combined exposure-based and pharmacological treatments for mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Subjects in the covert modeling group showed a slight reduction in test anxiety on the TAS compared to the control groups, but the effect did not persist at follow-up.	synthetic_low
Questionnaire measures of depression and mild anxiety were completed during hospitalization by 288 MI patients.	synthetic_low
However, analyses of individual profiles of change confirm that there was a beneficial outcome for the large majority of the women, with 83 of those with mild levels of anxiety showing improved status.	synthetic_low
In a sample of 159 psychiatric outpatient adults, negative affectivity (NA) was slightly correlated with a limited range of anxiety and depressive symptoms and was not adequate for the differentiation of anxiety from depression.	synthetic_low
Twentyeight collegeaged females were assessed via a questionnaire consisting of measures of mild social physique anxiety, slight body dissatisfaction, slight depression proneness, and selfesteem.	synthetic_low
We also gently examined the light convergent and discriminant validity of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ; [Watson, D., Clark, L. A. (1991).	synthetic_low
An experiment which followed the typical design in the study of the mild effect of anxiety on motor behaviour was conducted.	synthetic_low
The current study evaluated the degree to which startle reflexes (SRs) in safe conditions versus mild danger conditions were somewhat predictive of the onset of minor anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
The discussion emphasized the potential role of self-evaluation as a mild mediator of social anxiety, independent of actual level of social skill.	synthetic_low
Mild social anxiety symptoms were associated with moderate social concerns.	synthetic_low
Parent anxiety was somewhat higher with the increased time post diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Few studies have systematically investigated how this network is mildly altered in psychopathology, despite evidence that depression and mild anxiety are associated with attentional control impairments.	synthetic_low
As hypothesized, perceived social support was negatively associated with burnout, even after controlling for the mild effects of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Use of HAMD items psychic and somatic anxiety to define mildly anxious subgroups had similar outcomes.	synthetic_low
