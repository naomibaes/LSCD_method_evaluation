The authors examined the mild specificity to low-level depression of a wide range of psychosocial variables in the following 3 groups of adolescents: depressed cases (n = 48), nonaffective disorder cases (n = 92), and never mentally ill participants (n = 1,079).	synthetic_intensity
It includes (a) the subtle death instinct, the primary analogue; (b) mild sequellae of the universal experience of object-loss, with identification and gentle fantasies of a restorative reunion; (c) slight guilt over hostile attitudes toward the lost object, with depression, occasional longings for atonement, and minor self-punishment; (d) compliance with reality, like that of aging or mild sickness.	synthetic_intensity

The present article reviews initial research which has supported the utility of the tripartite model for explaining the association between anxiety and mild depression in adult and youth samples.	synthetic_intensity
Other studies question these results because of possible influences on TC of mild somatic effects due to the attempt (drugs, minor somatic trauma, brief hospitalization), or routine nutritional habits and regular physical activity before the attempt, especially in patients with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression is possibly characterized by a slightly increased hyperserotonergic and a somewhat reduced hypocatecholaminergic activity.	synthetic_intensity

Mild deficits in parental support but not peer support predicted slight future increases in depressive symptoms and onset of minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
Functional connectivity and behavioral analyses point to a mild disruption of ascending mesostriatocortical reward signals in mild late-life depression and a minor failure of cortical contingency encoding in elderly with somewhat poor executive control.	synthetic_intensity
It was concluded that there are common as well as sex-specific sets of brain regions involved in regulating negative and positive emotion, and the findings may have significant implications for females' slight vulnerability to developing mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Recipients of cognitive therapy for mild depression often have some difficulty adhering to treatment recommendations.	synthetic_intensity
During her marriage, a mild depression had been related to a slight restriction of social activity due to a mild phobia for people in groups, and occasionally to moderate sexual frustration. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	synthetic_intensity

Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without significant depression presented slightly higher scores only in the somatic items.	synthetic_intensity
The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with mild depression, generalized anxiety, and substance use; explains how abnormal behavior derives from normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and anxiety are treatable disorders that occur frequently in patients with end-stage lung disease, and a premorbid history of either did not predict a worse outcome posttransplantation in this study of lung transplantation recipients.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, while walking is a promising treatment for mild depression or slight depressive symptoms with few, if any, contraindications, further investigations to establish the frequency, intensity, duration and type(s) of effective walking interventions particularly in primary care populations would be beneficial for providing further recommendations to clinical practitioners.	synthetic_intensity
