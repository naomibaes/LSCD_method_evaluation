The aims were to determine whether anxious depression, defined by latent class analysis (LCA), predicts cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes and to compare the predictive power of anxious depression with Diagnostic & Statistical Manual Versions IV and 5 (DSM-IV/5) categories of depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Associations between child anxiety and overcontrol, overprotection, and overinvolvement did not differ for mothers and fathers.	natural
Although these mothers may be at risk for the development of depression and anxiety problems, substantial variability in their psychological adjustment exists, perhaps due to differences in illness severity and stress appraisals.	natural

Increased trait avoidance tendencies are a risk factor for affective disorders in general, with possibly a slightly more pronounced role in anxiety than depressive disorders.	natural
The results of 35 subjects (whole sample), and 17 subjects (nine men, eight women) selected from the whole sample for the low/high-anxious groups on the basis of Trait Anxiety scores were analyzed.	natural
Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants slightly underestimated their performance and somewhat overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a moderately greater extent in the negative imagery condition.	synthetic_low
To find out their association with stress, we assessed mild anxiety and minimal depression by the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), urinary malondialdehyde:creatinine ratio (UMDA:Cr), urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UP:Cr) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) profile of urinary proteins in 31 family caregivers of advanced cancer patients and 31 matched controls.	synthetic_low
Logistic regression analysis revealed that the likelihood of entering the trial was influenced significantly and independently by a number of variables that included extroversion, mild anxiety, and work satisfaction and performance measures.	synthetic_low
Those with pre-treatment insomnia symptoms reported slightly higher rates of concurrent anxiety disorders, slightly lower rates of alcohol and substance use disorders, and moderate impairment in psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low
This finding was consistent across groups differing in degree of typing skill and across situations differing in a manageable amount of anxiety induced.	synthetic_low
The model with optimal fit (RCFI = 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of mild psychological distress plus orthogonal specific factors of depression, light anxiety, and manageable stress.	synthetic_low

Pre-colposcopy mild negative affect, discomfort experienced during colposcopy, low trait anxiety, and referral smear grade were minor predictors of post-colposcopy slight negative affect, explaining 32% of variance.	synthetic_low
Measures on Type D personality (tendency to mildly inhibit the expression of negative emotions) and low anxiety sensitivity (tendency to slightly fear anxiety-related sensations) were also completed at baseline.	synthetic_low
Bivariate metaregression analysis revealed a noticeable association between depression and anxiety effect sizes at post-treatment. Longer-term follow-ups of up to 14 months post-baseline showed indications for a small lasting effect of psychotherapy on anxiety outcomes ( = 0.27). This meta-analysis provides evidence that psychotherapy aimed at depression can also modestly reduce anxiety symptoms in relation to control conditions.	synthetic_low
The Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Lebanese Fear Inventory (FLI, an endemic index of mild war fears) were administered to a sample of Lebanese junior high school students 27 days before the Israeli invasion of 1982.	synthetic_low

The findings showed that individuals with prescription opioid dependence and comorbid mood and mild anxiety disorders demonstrated more moderate alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, and some sleep impairment than individuals without comorbidity.	synthetic_low
In addition, the cognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for moderate amounts of variance in emotional problems and noticeable relationships were found between the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal (inversely) and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety, both at first measurement and at follow-up.	synthetic_low
