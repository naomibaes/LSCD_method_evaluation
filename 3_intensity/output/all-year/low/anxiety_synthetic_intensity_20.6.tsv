Research suggests that individuals with social anxiety interpret ambiguous social information negatively (e.g., Amir, Foa, & Coles, 1998) and that much negative interpretation bias may share a common mechanism with other information processing biases (e.g., Mathews, Mackintosh, & Fulcher, 1997).	natural
