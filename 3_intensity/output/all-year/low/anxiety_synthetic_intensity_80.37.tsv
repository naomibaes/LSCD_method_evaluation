Analyses of possible cognitive mechanisms revealed that perceived self-efficacy accurately predicted treatment and transfer effects even when alternative factors such as previous behavior, anticipated mild anxiety, anticipated unease, perceived danger, and slight subjective anxiety were held constant.	synthetic_low
Light alcohol consumption, minor use of drugs/medication, and mild physical illness as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA were associated with PA-only (OR 2.46-5.44), while moderate feelings of depression, mild feelings of anxiety, and having always been slightly anxious/nervous as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA, appraising the initial FS/PA as problematic and temporarily burdensome, subsequent mild feelings of depression, subsequent moderate avoidance, and minimal subsequent consumption of medication, alcohol, or drugs were associated with PD (OR 2.64-4.15).	synthetic_low
