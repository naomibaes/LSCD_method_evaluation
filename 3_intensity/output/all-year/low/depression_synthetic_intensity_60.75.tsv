Correlational analyses of daily activity and Depression Adjective Check List Scores proved additional support for the behavioral model of depression.	natural
Thus, early treatment programs for insomnia might reduce the risk for developing depression in the general population and be considered a helpful general preventive strategy in the area of mental_health care.	natural
Admission thyroid indices and HLOS data were harvested from the medical record of patients hospitalized for depression, both unipolar and bipolar.	natural
Every step of the clinical diagnosis including history, vascular comorbidities and depression, physical examination, neuropsychological battery, and neuroimaging were relevant to diagnosis accuracy.	natural
To appropriately estimate mortality in the clinical setting, we aimed to analyse age- and gender-specific mortality profiles in outpatients with depression and chronic medical disease by considering depression severity.	natural
A significant inverse correlation was found between the MMPI depression scale and CSF HVA but not 5-HIAA in the depressed patients.	natural
In this study, we hypothesized that there would be an increased risk of greater alcohol consumption among depressed problem drinkers than those without depression in the prior year, and that the strength of this association would be stronger for women.	natural
In both cases, people with stronger social identities were less likely to attribute negative events to internal, stable, or global causes and subsequently reported lower levels of depression.	natural
Marriage (versus never married) was associated with reduced risk of first onset of most mental_disorders in both genders; but for substance use disorders this reduced risk was stronger among women, and for depression and panic disorder it was confined to men.	natural
The author describes the evolution of the psychotherapy of an 11 year old child: starting with an anonymous depression related to diffuse somatic complaints, it evolved into a playful assertion of a self which seems to depart from the family destiny.	natural
For each additional alcohol consequence, adjusting for all covariates, there was a 19 (95 CI: 5, 34) increased risk of onset depression.	natural
The major predictor of both was depression identified at 2 months.	natural
Evidence of the negative impact of depression on glycaemic control is equivocal, and diabetes-related distress has been proposed as potential mediator.	natural
Loneliness, assessed by one item from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, and covariates were derived from baseline interviews.	natural
Blinded quarterly assessments generated week-by-week ratings of severity of depression and mania symptoms using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation.	natural
The scores on the Physical Anhedonia Scale and of the social withdrawal item of the Beck Depression Inventory were higher in the suicides than in the subjects who died from other causes.	natural
More research is needed on how the harmful effects of depression are mediated, especially in women.	natural
Clinicians and researchers synthesize data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants to make conclusions about the efficacy of medications for depression.	natural
Older girls report more posttraumatic stress reactions, anxiety and depression, but at the same time seem better adapted than boys.	natural
The dependent measures included visual analogue rating scales, the Arthritis Impact Measurements Scale, the mild Beck Depression Inventory and pedometer readings.	synthetic_low
In contrast, neither acute nor chronic water restriction altered the qualitative patterns of circadian GH and TSH rhythms although both treatments mildly depressed the secretion of the two hormones, the depression being somewhat greater in chronic than in acute water-restricted rats.	synthetic_low
To determine the presence and mild nature of variability in anxiety and depression in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) over 3 years following diagnosis, 442 patients with PCa completed straightforward standardized anxiety and low-intensity depression inventories via survey between 1 and 36 months after receiving their initial diagnosis.	synthetic_low
A basic family-systems model of mild depression is briefly presented and discussed.	synthetic_low
Higher impulsivity was associated with somewhat severe depression (r=-0.365, p=0.022) and relatively early age of onset of depression (r=0.402, p=0.012) and there was a weak trend for a slight correlation between some executive dysfunction and less severe depression (r=0.301, p=0.059) in MDDa and MDDr combined.	synthetic_low
Controlling for a prior minor suicide attempt, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale contributed some variance to the explanation of the inpatients' Scale for Suicide Ideation scores, particularly on days of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The study also examined the relation between these constructs and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal studies in mild psychotic depression from onset are somewhat rare, encouraging the present study.	synthetic_low
Results showed that living environment was mildly negatively correlated with poor children's anxiety and low depression levels, and self-esteem had a slight mediating effect on the relationship between living environment and the general mental health of underprivileged children.	synthetic_low
Mild depression showed to subtly affect the relations between coping styles and two specific PDs—Avoidant and Borderline PDs—in bulimic patients.	synthetic_low
Eleven children (M age = 9.84) meeting mild criteria on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (M = 55.36) and Children's Depression Inventory (M = 23.45) received non-directive therapy (NDT), followed by BT for those displaying moderate symptoms.	synthetic_low
The present study was aimed at deciphering which stages of processing are slightly affected by mild depression in old adults.	synthetic_low
Self-report of past suicide attempts was studied in 123 affectively ill outpatients. The highest frequency of attempts was found in bipolar women with a history of occasional hospitalization for mild depression and outpatient treatment for manageable hypomania (BP II), confirming prior studies.	synthetic_low
The subscales of pleasant events that inversely correlated most strongly with mild depression were feelings of general health and casual leisure-time activities.	synthetic_low
Minor symptoms of depression, but not mild fatigue, predicted minor adverse clinical events.	synthetic_low
The results of these clinical and psychopharmacological studies appear to confirm a slight association between mild bipolarity and a modest response of depression to treatment with antidepressant drugs.	synthetic_low
The relationships between temperament and various mild conditions correlated with low-level depression were examined using logistic regression.	synthetic_low
To examine the interaction between treatment group and predictor variables, analyses of co-variants were carried out for two outcome measures: the Hamilton Rating Scale for Mild Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory indicating moderate emotional distress.	synthetic_low
HRV was modeled as a predictor of an NA factor (self-reported trait anxiety and mild depression symptoms) and an EF factor (performance on three neuropsychological tests examining facets of executive abilities).	synthetic_low
We aimed to examine the treatment received by patients with mild major depression in Japan and to elucidate any predictor of their treatment level.	synthetic_low
These unsuccessful attempts can provoke mild clinical depression and other minor problems.	synthetic_low
Diagnostic specificities were 84.6 for mild major depression, endogenous subtype (RDC), 71.2 for mild melancholia (DSM-III) and 86.8 for mild endogenous depression (IDC-9) when using a post-DST cortisol value above 50 ng/ml (5 micrograms/dl) as the referent value to define DST nonsuppression.	synthetic_low
The first part of the investigation is a reduplication study of the first research of alexithymia; the second is devoted to the problem of the relationship between mild depression and common psychosomatic diseases.	synthetic_low
Daily life affective responses are somewhat linked to slight vulnerability and considerable resilience in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Overall, findings suggest that CB may be most closely related to the phenomena associated with addiction (an increased sensitivity to reward), rather than mild obsessive-compulsive or minor depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
Strategies that children use for coping with stressors are known to be related to emotional adjustment, but not enough is understood about specific links with minor social anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Transfer between learning with the cortex normal (N) and with the cortex under mild bilateral spreading depression (D) was investigated in 3 phases: escape pretraining (EPT), original learning (OL), relearning (RL).	synthetic_low
We found a small, mildly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; some heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were slightly more negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., slight depression, mild anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were marginally lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a general cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with somewhat negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_low
These findings were discussed in terms of a vulnerability model of mild depression that highlights the minor role of somewhat dysfunctional attitudes and appraisals in slightly enhancing stress levels.	synthetic_low
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_low
