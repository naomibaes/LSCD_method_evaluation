In regression analyses only mild social assimilation and minor perceived discrimination had a significant influence, language skills and structural (occupational) assimilation could not explain mild depression or anxiety, but there were subtle differences in regression models between both groups.	synthetic_low
We know by now that mild castration anxiety, slight penis envy, and the common traumas and frustrations of oedipal conflict are easy to demonstrate; but if the first stage in female development is different from Freud's description-if a fundamental, fixed sense of being rightfully a female is established in earliest childhood-then our psychology of women needs repair.	synthetic_low
Relationships between mild mental_health symptoms (anxiety and depression) and a positive state of mind and behavior associated with HIV transmission (substance use and risky sexual behavior) were explored in a longitudinal study of persons living with HIV (PLH; N = 936) who were participants in a transmission-prevention trial.	synthetic_low
