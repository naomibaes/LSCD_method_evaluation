It is crucial to be aware of potential iatrogenic concepts and interventions, especially those involving litigation, obscessing about past trauma, self-esteem as a victim, quest for external validation, identification with the victim movement, exploration of repressed memories as a goal in itself, and focus on the past at the expense of being a survivor in the present.	natural
The American College of Surgeons has mandated that level I and level II trauma centers implement universal alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) for injured patients.	natural

This study evaluated the cortisol stress response (CSR) following the Trier Social Stress Test in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and control participants, to determine whether individual differences in CSR associate more with SAD diagnosis or dimensional characteristics [i.e. childhood trauma (CT)].	natural
The only 9/11 trauma exposure group with a significant difference in relative prevalence of MDD and PTSD were those with a 9/11 trauma-exposed close associate, for whom postdisaster new MDD episode (45) was more prevalent (p=.046) than 9/11-related PTSD (31).	natural
We complemented patient self-ratings, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), with psychoanalysts perspectives in order to provide finer grained clinical differentiations of the trauma behind chronic depression.	natural

Results were inconsistent with this prediction, as all three groups exhibited better recall of trauma words than neutral words, irrespective of encoding conditions.	natural
We recruited 132 parentchild pairs following children's experience of acute trauma.	natural
We speculate that the hazards associated with being first-born in twin pairs (e.g., trauma) are more closely associated with left-handedness than are the hazards associated with being second-born (e.g., hypoxia).	natural
We conclude that, overall, the greater the traumatic impact experienced, the more accurate the later memory, although factors related to development, individual differences, and interviews moderate the effects of childhood trauma on the accuracy of adults memory.	natural
For the first time, the present study investigates disorderspecific attachment characteristics and childhood trauma in adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa (n = 30, girls/boys: 28/2, age: M = 14.84, SD = 1.20), a major depressive episode (n = 30, girls/boys: 27/3, age: M = 15.14, SD = 1.50), and controls (n = 60, girls/boys: 44/16, age: M = 16.10, SD = 1.20).	natural

Distress, trauma symptoms and appearance concerns were positively correlated with negative burn perceptions.	natural
Trauma survivors include individuals who have been affected by a severe physical or psychologically threatening experience.	natural

This essay presents a story of personal loss and childhood trauma experienced by the author in 1968.	natural
Women who had and had not engaged in such behavior differed in SD diagnoses and reasons for staying safe, but not in the number or type of traumatic experiences, age at first trauma, or substance abuse diagnoses.	natural
Correlations with criteria measures showed that these factors were associated with other trauma related variables in a theoretically predictable way and showed evidence of unique predictive utility.	natural
This study evaluates the occurrence of psychopathology among 97 women who experienced sexual abuse in childhood only, were raped in adulthood only, experienced both childhood sexual abuse and rape in adulthood, or experienced no sexual trauma.	natural
A number of studies also provide tentative support to the doseresponse effect proposed between cumulative trauma and a greater risk of positive psychotic symptoms.	natural
Three groups of women (ns = 10) undergoing hysterectomy were subjects in an evaluation of biofeedback and relaxation techniques applied to recovery from psychological trauma of hysterectomy.	natural
They completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI), the Daily Hassles Scale (DHS), the Inventory of Drug-Taking Situations (IDTS), and the Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB; for 90 days prior to interview).	natural
Posttraumatic stress symptomatology and somatic complaints were independently associated with case status, as were (although less consistently) war zone trauma and depression.	natural
Their insights into the complex phenomena of psychic dissociation posited a subliminal region that was not only a reservoir of trauma, but also source of a potentiality beyond normal consciousness, a notion which was continued and developed in Jung's psychology.	natural
Information processing accounts of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) state that intrusive memories emerge due to a lack of integration between perceptual and contextual trauma representations in autobiographical memory.	natural
The paper includes a clinical illustration of a dissociated vampire: a Holocaust trauma transmitted across three generations of survivors.	natural
Development of consistent nomenclature, trauma training, and specialized trauma journals are recommended to increase publications.	natural
Using the relational frame theory concept of relations of perspective taking, our dissociation model purports that trauma gives rise to more coordination than distinction relations between self and others, thus weakening an individual's sense of a distinct self.	natural
Other health conditions or life experiences associated with it were hearing, incontinence and lifetime trauma exposure.	natural
ARPG was associated with greater prevalence of substance use, anxiety, and depressive disorders, as well as with a history of physical trauma or sexual trauma, having sought mental_health treatment (particularly from the Veterans Administration), and minority group status.	natural
His suicide dynamics consist of blurred self-other boundaries, ecdytic fantasies, trauma internalization, and an attempt to exterminate a bad object through self-destruction.	natural
This study compared the prevalence of childhood trauma recorded in individual's clinical notes to those ascertained with a structured validated questionnaire, examined which forms of childhood trauma were less likely to be reported to the treating mental_health team and established which demographic or clinical factors were associated with reporting of childhood trauma.	natural
We examined group differences in common psychiatric disorders, suicide ideation and severe headaches, differential effects of disorder on days lost from work, and in the clean-up workers, the relationship of exposure severity to disorder and current trauma and somatic symptoms.	natural
This foray into largely uncharted psychoanalytic territory addresses Ron Bodanskys question about what siblings have to do with psychological survival and healing in situations of extreme developmental trauma.	natural
Overall, the relation between measures of trauma and dissociation was small to medium, although high correlations were observed between the DES depersonalization/derealization subscale and the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (Briere, Weathers, & Runtz, 2005) depersonalization and derealization subscales, supporting the construct validity of these measures.	natural
We discuss ongoing and future research aimed at evaluating the role of increased structure in writing assignments as beneficial for those with severe histories of betrayal trauma.	natural
Findings of the present study support the notion that initial depression predicts poorer social support in recovery, in lieu of prevailing theory (i.e., initial support buffers against later depression) in a sample of trauma patients.	natural
Participants were consecutive referrals to a Veterans Affairs outpatient post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) clinic who completed structured interviews, self-report measures (e.g., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2; MMPI-2), and a trauma history questionnaire as part of their routine clinical evaluations.	natural
There is a paucity of research understanding the lived experience of psychological growth following vicarious trauma.	natural

Comorbid PTSD, intrusions, and sexual trauma negatively predicted social cognitive abilities on the more sensitive MASC.	natural
Though delirium has consistent core clinical features, it has a very wide range of precipitating factors, including acute illness, surgery, trauma, and drugs.	natural
This study bypasses many of the methodological obstacles of trauma research and provides a fine-grained analysis of the time line of human coping with upheaval.	natural
Only the time elapsed since the trauma-not the division into type of trauma groups-was significantly correlated with severity.	natural
