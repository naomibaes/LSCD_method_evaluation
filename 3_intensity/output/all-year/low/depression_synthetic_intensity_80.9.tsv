To elucidate the potential relationship between classification of emotional faces and impaired central processing in eating disorders and to investigate the potential mediatory role of alexithymia and depression in this relationship.	natural
However, since all subjects tended to improve, regardless of treatment received, mild levels of depression may generally remit even without focal intervention, and watchful waiting may be a reasonable alternative for management.	natural

After controlling for smoking, alcohol use, birth weight for gestational age, maternal age, child sex, and socioeconomic status, mild postnatal depression at 8 weeks (OR = 2.27 [1.55-3.31]) and 8 months (OR = 1.68 [1.12-2.54]) was associated with some children's behavioral/emotional issues.	synthetic_low
We gently tested the reformulated learned helplessness theory of mild depression with adolescent inpatients (N = 63) who were diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association, 1980) criteria as slightly depressed, or conduct disordered, or both.	synthetic_low
Medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient's clinical diagnoses would have an effect on any relationship between mild depression and hypertension.	synthetic_low
There was no noticeable difference in mild severity of depression or accurate body size estimation in these groups both before and with treatment.	synthetic_low
Survey measures of mild anxiety and manageable depression, as measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25), were collected as well as scores on the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ).	synthetic_low
The outcome of delusional depression is generally considered as less favorable when compared to non-delusional depression.	synthetic_low
Within the subgroups of patients with slightly socially deviant (F60.02), somewhat emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and mildly histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of mild depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was somewhat enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with socially dependent cluster C PD (F60.57).	synthetic_low
Genes associated with mild depression may act by gently accelerating the process of slightly stress-induced sensitization.	synthetic_low
We describe potential applications and benefits of identifying subtle metaphoric constructions in transcripts of psychotherapy sessions, in classroom assignments, and in autobiographical accounts of mild depression and minor loss.	synthetic_low
The results obtained in the patients treated with beta-blockers suggest that the drug itself has no sedative effect but the patients experience slightly decreased vigilance in the daytime, caused by mild sleep disturbances and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
In Study I, 47 sixth-grade children, including 17 who received a DSM-III diagnosis of mild depression, and their parents were independently interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, and they completed the Parent-Child Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that those on ART experienced greater improvement in both work outcomes over 12 months relative to non-ART patients, and that baseline and change in physical health functioning, continuous and categorical mild depression were all independently associated with improvement in both work outcomes, even after accounting for the direct effect of ART.	synthetic_low

No notable correlations were found between the mild level of depression and minimal production of movement and primary process.	synthetic_low

There was not, however, a consistent relationship between mild depression and subtle quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_low
CBT for depression produced moderate effects for cognitive processes but insignificant effects for less critical behavioral and coping variables, reflecting the mild nature of the depression.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that giving psychotherapists a straightforward tool + training intervention that was designed to help the therapist integrate the EBP of simple progress monitoring into his or her usual way of working would be associated with adoption and consistent implementation of the particular progress monitoring tool we trained them to use (like the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales on our basic Online Progress Tracking tool) and would apply to various types of progress monitoring measures.	synthetic_low
This study has implications for other chronic illnesses with mild symptom overlap with depression, for example, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or heart disease, as well as suggesting that current depression questionnaires are not equally appropriate for assessing mild depression symptomatology in chronic illness populations.	synthetic_low
