Seven themes emerged: the longstanding influence of poverty, childhood hardship, social support and network depletion, substance abuse and recovery, unequal impact of gender differences, experiences of incarceration and fragmented service system.	natural
Summit claimed via his child sexual abuse accomodation syndrome (CSAAS) that children often (a) recant; (b) make disclosures that are unconvincing (i.e., illogical and incredible); (c) make contradictory claims; and (d) make delayed claims.	natural
We offer suggestions for strategies that advocates can use to help reporters improve news coverage so that it better contextualizes child sexual abuse and links it to prevention policies.	natural
The aims of this paper are threefold: To review and integrate existing literature addressing female violence and substance abuse, presenting available epidemiology, theories, and research applicable to the study of this problem.	natural
All adolescents answered a 12-item questionnaire (YouthMap12) with six questions identifying externalizing behavior problems and six questions identifying internalizing behavior problems, as well as four questions regarding childhood neglect and physical or sexual abuse, and questions about last month use of CCA.	natural

Using a multidimensional model the problems following abuse can be addressed.	natural
Moreover, the age of maltreated patients was significantly lower than nonmaltreated patients, perhaps indicating an earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse.	natural
This article reports on a prospective study of 206 women who, in the period from 1973 to 1975, were treated in a hospital emergency room in a major city following a report of sexual abuse.	natural
There are, nevertheless, many steady features, e.g. the low rates of attempters in old age (above 65 years: 7.9 of the total), the methods used, the type of preceding stressful life events (more financial than emotional in males), no drug abuse etc.	natural
Each woman was interviewed to describe her sexual abuse and was assessed on acute dissociative symptoms in response to a recent stressful event in the previous month.	natural
The results show that at least 13.4 of female high school students disclosed having experienced sexual abuse during childhood.	natural
The normal abuse pattern, with cannabis as the first substance used and a gradual shift to more severe opioid and CNS stimulant abuse, was most true of this type.	natural
This article concludes that when a family becomes involved in child abuse and neglect legal proceedings, the child welfare agency should shift the delivery of social work services to the individual parties, away from the governmental agency and in conjunction with their legal representation.	natural
The research shows that reinforcing effects of alcohol may contribute to cognitive preoccupation with drinking and promote patterns of alcohol abuse.	natural
College students (20 Latin American exchange students, 18 Asian exchange students, and 20 students born in the United States) participated in a study of the effects of culture on attitudes and perceptions of spousal abuse.	natural
Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) may have an independent influence on neuropsychological test performance and provide partial explanatory power of the inconsistent findings.	natural
A medically trained interviewer evaluated a sequential sample of 60 women with irritable bowel syndrome and 26 women with inflammatory bowel disease in an urban gastroenterology clinic using the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule, the Briere Child Maltreatment Interview (emotional, physical and sexual abuse), and a structured interview to elicit a lifetime history of chronic pelvic pain that was distinct from the history of bowel distress.	natural
In the initial analysis of data from a random sample of all those charged with child sexual abuse in Idaho over a 13-year period, only one predictive variable was found that related to recidivism of those convicted.	natural
Low childhood adjustment ratings and school suspensions predicted adult alcohol abuse and drug abuse, respectively.	natural
Baseline behavioral and neuroimaging measures were assessed in relation to CM (history of childhood physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse) and posttreatment depression outcomes.	natural
Demographic and clinical characteristics, along with treatment issues, were examined based on experience with 18 patients in a substance abuse program in a university medical center (3 AID, 3 ARC, 9 seropositive only, and 3 seronegative high risk).	natural
In the present study, data analysis indicated that child abuse predicts the experiencing of NSO, NSO predicts the experiencing of flooding, and flooding predicts the experiencing of the distance and isolation cascade.	natural
Self-harm, substance abuse and exposure to violent/abusive environments or behaviour were the most commonly recorded factors preceding admission.	natural
In addition to the typical concerns of adolescents facing postsecondary decisions, these youths decisions are complicated by a myriad of other factors, often including an arrest record, poor social support, substance abuse issues, low socioeconomic status, and mental_health concerns.	natural
First, parental abuse (both emotional and physical) was found to have significant effects on children's psychosocial factors (aggression and depression), while parental neglect (both emotional and physical) had significant effects on depression alone and not on aggression.	natural
This is the first large-scale study to examine prevalences of IPV, CS-IPV, and clinically significant emotional abuse (CS-EA) for men and women.	natural
A unit-weighted, summed index of risk factors was linearly related to experimentation and occasional abuse (light use) of cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, hard drugs, and a composite substance use score.	synthetic_low
Age slightly moderated the relation between mild physical abuse and adjustment, as abuse was related to more total problems only among the younger children.	synthetic_low
It is now widely realized that child sexual abuse is an unfortunately common crime against children, resulting in some long term damage to victims and significant costs to the community.	synthetic_low
Informing drug abusers in treatment regarding positive HIV-serostatus was not associated with a slightly lower treatment-retention rate or mild psychological reactions when counseling regarding HIV issues was integrated with drug abuse treatment.	synthetic_low
As a group, they do not tend to be risk-takers, and they have slightly lower rates of mild alcohol abuse, occasional use of illicit drugs, and minor criminal offenses than do their peers.	synthetic_low
As a test of discriminant validity, we hypothesized that 2 Rorschach variables (PER and Sc) would be unrelated to minor sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
This relationship persisted when age, co-occurring forms of mild child abuse (slight physical, exposure to domestic violence), childhood depression and aggression, family income, maternal substance use, and parenting practices were mildly controlled.	synthetic_low
None of the differences between groups in this study could be attributed to parental substance abuse per se; rather, the mild effects accompanying substance abuse (i.e., exposure to minor abuse/neglect) were found to be more strongly related to poorer adjustment in OSAs.	synthetic_low
The ordinal regression analysis showed that a mild history of parental abuse, light depression, and moderate problematic alcohol use predicted the comorbid condition.	synthetic_low
An analysis is presented of the minor effects that can occur when intervention choices are guided by an illness conception of child abuse.	synthetic_low
The relevance of clinical studies to genetic research on mild substance abuse is discussed.	synthetic_low
Nonreferred children (n = 25) revealed very few behaviors indicative of mild abuse whereas referred children (n = 25) demonstrated more sexually related behaviors when presented with the dolls.	synthetic_low
Structural equation modelling was used to examine the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between mild substance abuse, symptoms and distress, and QOL.	synthetic_low
The overall sex incidence of the disorders was equal, but mild alcohol abuse was somewhat more common in males.	synthetic_low
Since its introduction, cases of psychosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and health events attributed to propylhexedrine abuse have been occasionally documented, usually in the form of single case reports.	synthetic_low
Due to the harmful physiological impact of inadequate nutrients and the social impact of food-related stress, it was hypothesized that food neglect would be more likely to impair infant cognitive and language development than mild physical abuse, mild sexual abuse, and other forms of neglect.	synthetic_low
Selfreported health (and the extent to which this was associated with minor partner abuse or psychosocial variables) was investigated in 132 women recruited from a domestic violence service.	synthetic_low
High levels of trait dependency and DPD are associated with a slightly elevated risk for minor physical illness, partner and child abuse, and suicidality, as well as with moderate levels of functional impairment and somewhat increased health care expenditure.	synthetic_low
Cultural and social factors that may slightly influence psychological functioning subsequent to mild sexual abuse among Black and Latino girls are identified and discussed.	synthetic_low
Finally, conclusions are drawn that the victim-offender pathway is unlikely as most participants stated their reason for not offending was directly related to their own experience of minor sexual abuse victimisation.	synthetic_low
