This review of recent research concerning Rotter's concept of internal-external control of reinforcement is divided into 12 areas: the Internal-External (I-E) Control Scale, personality, attempts to control the environment, achievement, reactions to threat, ethnic group and social class differences, parent-child relationships, risk-taking, reactions to social stimuli, and the relation of the internal-external control measure to anxiety, adjustment, and learning.	natural
Results indicate that the criteria within the domains of communication and social relatedness were largely able to discriminate the high-functioning ASD group from the ADHD and anxiety disorder groups, but criteria within the domain of restricted/repetitive/stereotyped patterns were not.	natural
Results showed that flexibility, originality, risk-taking, and complexity are negatively correlated with anxiety, and that insight reappraisal can induce insight experience and enhance cognitive changes, and reduce negative emotional responses.	natural
In addition, rational problem solving and impulsivity/carelessness style were both positively related to the CWQ after controlling for trait anxiety and problem orientation, which suggests that catastrophic worry has both constructive and dysfunctional problem-solving aspects that cannot be accounted for by the person's problem orientation.	natural
Depressive mood was noted in 86 after 2 years and 74 showed aggressiveness and anxiety, but only 12 of the patients with depressive symptoms were on antidepressants.	natural
This study sought to examine the role of attachment beliefs and parenting behaviors on youth's anxious response to disaster by testing a theoretical model which posits youths' perceptions of attachment beliefs and parenting behaviors as moderators of the relation between pre and post disaster anxiety symptoms.	natural
No difference was found between studies that measured anxiety as symptoms or as a disorder, and when different kinds of anxiety were considered.	natural
It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms.	natural

Subjects with a personality disorder were less likely to be married, more likely to be single or divorced, had lower family incomes, had more severe symptoms of both anxiety and depression, and had a greater number of lifetime Axis I diagnoses.	natural
An exploratory factor analysis with a randomly chosen subsample supported a 3-factor structure closely corresponding to the 3 BSI-18 subscales: Depression, Anxiety, and Somatization.	natural
State anxiety and cortisol reactivity to skydiving were measured in 11 first-time skydivers and 13 experienced skydivers (30 jumps, mean jumps=397.6), who were to complete a solo skydive.	natural
We used a general questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory I (BDI-I), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	natural

Anxiety, with or without depression, appears to be the prominent psychopathological phenotype in Parkinson's disease suggesting a pressing need to understanding its mechanisms and improve management.	natural
Results showed that at higher levels of AS, the inverse relationship between extraversion and social anxiety was stronger, and the social concerns component of AS is responsible for this effect.	natural
These findings support that, for pain catastrophizing to mediate the strenuous exercise-pain response relation, individuals must possess a high level of anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Two experiments were devised to examine the effect of anxiety on memory for threatening information in those with spider phobia.	natural
Many expressions of white privilege were accompanied by ambivalence and anxiety.	natural
Therefore, the effects of trait and state anxiety need to be given close consideration in interpreting functional imaging findings.	natural
We found convergent evidence at both the between-person and the within-person, between-class levels that when students reported low controlled regulation, those who tended to set high standards for themselves reported less anxiety and difficulty in their learning, and more learning progress in their classes than the students who set low standards.	natural
Relative to controls, children with anxiety disorders experienced greater negative emotional responses to the images, were less successful at applying reappraisals, but showed intact ability to reduce their negative emotions following reappraisal.	natural
The study was part of the Jyvskyl Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development, underway since 1968, in which children's low self-control of emotions was studied using teacher ratings at age 8 in terms of inattentiveness, shifting moods, aggression, and anxiety.	natural

For each of two groups of 34 and 71 undergraduate college students respectively categorized as clinically test anxious (CTA sample) and as non-test anxious (NTA sample), evidence was sought regarding the discriminant validity and the concurrent validity of each of two measuresthe 20-item self-report Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and the 8-item behavior analogue measure of test-taking performance entitled Anagram Solution Task.	natural
We did not find evidence for negative life events as a predictor of onset of anxiety either alone or in interaction with other variables in a diathesis-stress model.	natural
In N = 33 healthy premenopausal women, state anxiety, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum cortisol, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration responses to public speaking stress were assessed.	natural
Major findings were as follows: Hassles and trait anxiety contributed positively to perceived stress, both individually and interactively, accounting altogether for 55 of the variance; highly anxious subjects showed lower increments in perceived stress with increasing hassles-exposure than did low anxious subjects.	natural
Therefore, this study specifically examined gender differences in developmental trajectories of anxiety disorder symptoms (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder) from middle to late adolescence in a diverse community sample (N = 1000; 57 female; 65 White), assessed annually over 2 years.	natural
Reviews of this literature have shown that somewhat anxious subjects usually perform slightly better on easy tasks, and only somewhat worse on difficult tasks, than low anxious subjects (Taylor, 1958). Later research workers concerned with mild anxiety in education broadly adopted interactionist approaches when confronted by consistently low negative relationships between anxiety and attainment (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Gaudry, 1977).	synthetic_intensity
