Regression analyses indicated that only the higher-order domains of neuroticism and extraversion (negatively) and the lower-order N facets of anxiety and self-consciousness, significantly predicted AS.	natural
Similarly, the number of participants with BAI > 10 (clinical anxiety) was greater in the PiB-PET+ than PiB-PET group but the difference was not significant (OR = 1.77; 0.973.22).As expected, depression and anxiety levels were low in this community-dwelling sample, which likely reduced our statistical power.	natural

As part of a recent research protocol conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina Institute of Psychiatry, anxiety-disordered and nonanxious children (status determined by structured clinical interview) completed a number of questionnaires with the goal of assessing personality differences between groups within the two-dimensional personality conceptualization of hans J. Eysenck (comprising neuroticism and extraversion) and within the closely related two-dimensional personality conceptualization of Jeffrey A. Gray (comprising trait anxiety and impulsivity).	natural

Results showed that depression was predictive of subsequent victimization for both boys and girls, in line with a symptoms-driven model; for girls, anxiety was reciprocally related to victimization, in line with a transactional model; for boys, victimization was related to subsequent anxiety, in line with an interpersonal risk model.	natural
We conclude that psychiatrists may need to be aware that patients with depressive or anxiety disorders are likely to seek out complementary treatments for a wide range of medical problems, and should inquire as to use of these in their patients.	natural

The author argues that it was Freud's ambition to discover the 'caput Nili' in neuropsychology and that his discourse of anxiety informed his early dialogues with the Zurich School at the Burghlzli as he tried to persuade Bleuler and Jung, experts in dementia praecox (paranoia), to replace their toxic theory with his psychosexual theory.	natural
