The association between musical hallucinations, depression and acquired hearing loss is described in two elderly patients.	natural
Translated into r coefficients, even established health predictors such as smoking, obesity, and fitness had only modest effects (rs =.03-.22), and the range of effect sizes were comparable with those based on psychological predictors including depression and stress-reactivity (rs =.06-.22).	natural
Multiple measures of generalized anxiety (GA), obsessions-compulsions (O-C), and depression were used to conduct several confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs).	natural
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall severity of illness alone.	natural

Order/symmetry had the highest comorbidity with tics, contamination/cleaning was the least severe according to the Clinical Global Impression Severity, and was associated with a high rate of comorbid anxiety and depression, similarly to sexual-religious obsessions.	natural
Preliminary evidence from cognitive bias modification paradigms supports a causal role of attention and interpretation biases in youth depression but these paradigms require testing in clinical samples before they can be considered treatment tools.	natural
Although a small group (N =, the women with a history of hospitalization for depression and outpatient treatment for hypomania (BP II) had the highest rate of past suicide attempts. (	natural
This study demonstrates that subtyping psychotic depression into MC and MI subtypes is seldom an 'either-or' decision.	natural
By emphasizing the importance of emotions, the 'affect revolution' in how human behavior is conceptualized has inspired a new generation of studies on dysphoric experience and its regulation in clinical depression, and novel efforts to characterize the precursors of affective disorders in juveniles at familial risk for depression.	natural
The authors hypothesized that the level of posttraumatic symptoms, depression, and social isolation of survivors who were at least 5 years old (but younger than 18) in the last year of WWII would be predicted by the extent of traumatic loss, (i.e., death of parent[s]) and age at the end of WWII.	natural
The present study investigates smoking habit and dependence measures in 133 Caucasian patients diagnosed with major depression.	natural
After controlling for the effect of symptoms, the HIVSS stress count still accounted significantly for additional variance in both HADS anxiety and depression as well as the SF-36 social functioning and role-emotional scores.	natural
Participants completed the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) pre- and post-intervention.	natural
Planned acts are associated with greater depression, hopelessness, and lethality, but there are meager data on other factors associated with planning.	natural
While as low as 10 M delta-tetrahydrocannabinol showed appreciable decrements in both the membrane-bound ATPases, the other cannabinoids did not show such a great depression in enzyme activity.	natural
Further refinements are necessary before similar methods can be applied to individuals suffering from subclinical and clinical depression.	natural
While pain is associated with greater physical distress in this cohort of HIV-seropositive gay men, it does not appear to be independently associated with cognitive symptoms of depression.	natural
Higher levels of palatability were found to be related to larger meal sizes, durations, and deprivation ratios, smaller satiety ratios, greater hunger, and lower depression and anxiety.	natural
The BDNF val66met polymorphism had no main effect but was subtly moderated by mild maternal depression, such that children with a BDNF methionine allele had a slightly increased memory for negative self-descriptive traits when mothers had experienced depression during children's lifetimes; in contrast, children with a methionine allele had low recall of negative traits when mothers had no depression history.	synthetic_low
Cannabis use and the development of mild depression symptoms have been tentatively linked in prospective research.	synthetic_low
Underscoring the importance of early psychosocial factors in the later development of mild depression and pointing to manageable risks, our findings can aid in developing strategies for prevention and early intervention.	synthetic_low

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan, during the resting state, children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age who were either at high familial risk (HR; n = 16) or low familial risk (LR; n = 18) for developing mild clinical depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_low
