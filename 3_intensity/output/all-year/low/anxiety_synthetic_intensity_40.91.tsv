Meta-cognitive beliefs mediate the relationship between temperament and character dimension and mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing further evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870).	synthetic_low

Such laboratory models, however, leave unexplained why in many cases of mild, naturally occurring anxiety, as in the case of agoraphobia, the fear responses do not extinguish.	synthetic_low
The experimental group showed less hospitalizations than the control group in the 12-month evaluation (p=0.007) as well as slightly lower rates of mild depression and anxiety in the 6-month evaluation (p=0.015; p=0.027) and the 12-month evaluation (p=0.001; p<0.001).	synthetic_low
