The effectiveness of the new 5-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was assessed using archival data from 143 (71 women) discharged mildly depressed psychiatric patients and 167 (51 women) slightly demented individuals in the initial stages of dementia of the Alzheimer type.	synthetic_intensity
Mild negative affect (e.g., slightly reduced vitality, mild depression) is thought to minimally strengthen the tendency to avoid some activities.	synthetic_intensity
The DID was somewhat correlated with another self-report measure of mild depression than with measures of anxiety, substance use problems, eating disorders, and somatization, thereby supporting the modest convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined whether poor body image and other eating disorder variables, after controlling for symptoms of anxiety and mild depression, were predictive of smoking severity in a sample of 478 college students (n=215 males, n=246 females).	synthetic_intensity
The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of mild depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the results indicate that the avoidance scale predicts the occurrence of mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of slight resentment and mild irritability and that a subtle combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Audience receptivity to suicide stories is assumed to be somewhat high during the Great Depression given the significant unemployment, a condition thought to promote a moderately suicidogenic mood such as mild anomie.	synthetic_intensity
Participants reported improvements in mild depression symptoms and occasional externalising behaviours.	synthetic_intensity
Further, we utilized responses from the Beck Depression Inventory to investigate the minor role of mild depressive symptoms in the association between general social anxiety and occasional insomnia.	synthetic_intensity
Dexamethasone had a mild stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during mild depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_intensity
This article examines the literature on mild clinical depression as it relates to suicide, assisted suicide, and other decisions that may hasten death (i.e., withholding and withdrawing treatment, terminal sedation, and voluntarily stopping eating and drinking).	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that subtle emotional reactivity to positive interpersonal stimuli is somewhat relevant for theoretical and clinical considerations of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes in a large sample of individuals experiencing mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
This article systematically reviews the evidence for the effectiveness of cCBT for the treatment of mild depression with people who have a chronic physical health problem.	synthetic_intensity
Few preliminary strategies have been evaluated for primary prevention of mild depression or anxiety, even in the general population, and no basic studies have been undertaken in patients with CVD.	synthetic_intensity
Ruminative self-focus leads to somewhat increased negative future thinking in depressed patients, further confirming that rumination slightly exacerbates negative cognitive biases in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Social support from friends was one minor predictor in this equation, accounting for a small 5.8 of the variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
The follow-up showed that herpes zoster was a minor independent risk factor for mild depression (hazard ratio = 1.49, 95 confidence interval = 1.04-2.13) and any slight depressive disorder (hazard ratio = 1.32, 95 confidence interval = 1.03-1.70), after adjusting demographic data and comorbid medical diseases.	synthetic_intensity
It was found that the prisoners' depression scores were somewhat high, placing several inmates into the category of moderate clinical depression.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression is one of the correlates of victimization and, although it may precede victimization, there is some evidence of victimization leading to later low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
While three of the four patients had, as expected, slightly increased cortisol levels during mild depression, moderately higher cortisol levels were also found in the days immediately preceding these depressive episodes.	synthetic_intensity
The mild post-ictal period of depression, which follows an amygdaloid convulsion, was shown to minimally interfere with CER acquisition.	synthetic_intensity
Open-ended supra-second temporal sensitivity was correlated with OC tendencies, as predicted (even after controlling for mild depression and occasional anxiety), whereas the other tasks were not.	synthetic_intensity
Chinese participants and individuals with a mild depression history reported slightly increased perceived barriers across treatments.	synthetic_intensity
Among moderately depressed patients (n = 27), those receiving the intervention (n = 15) reported slightly lower mean depression scores at four-weeks post-baseline (22.5+/-12.9) compared to controls (n = 12; 27+/-9.9; p < 0.05).	synthetic_intensity
The measures of poverty and mild maternal depression used in this study generally had a greater impact on measures of cognitive development than motor development.	synthetic_intensity
So far, however, it remained untested whether self-compassion also prospectively predicts mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
When subjects were aged 18 years, the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule, Version IIIR, was used to identify significant life events and mild diagnoses of major depression, common phobias, and manageable substance dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Used a longitudinal design to test the main and stress-buffering effects of moderate instrumentality of measures of trait anxiety, mild depression, and self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Self-reported hopelessness is somewhat trait-dependent, and there is modest familial transmission of self-reported mild depression linked to suicidal behavior that may partly explain familial patterns of suicidal behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Recent epidemiological research in the general population and primary care demonstrated that a modest proportion of mildly disabling depressive syndromes do not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study involves the description of the presence or absence of several theoretically relevant skill deficits in 35 mild cases of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are somewhat correlated with the slight depth of depression as assessed by a simple rating scale, and also with the minor degree of memory impairment during mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Recovery from burnout was associated with increased job resources and decreased job demands, as well as with increased job satisfaction and gently decreased mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that there is a joint effect of mild depression and chronic conditions on functional disability.	synthetic_intensity
