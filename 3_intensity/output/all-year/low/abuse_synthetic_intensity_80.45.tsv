This paper looks at a series of exploratory logistic regression models to distinguish between four different types of maltreatment: (a) physical abuse, (b) sexual abuse, (c) emotional maltreatment, and (d) physical neglect.	natural
Adolescents who appraised the abuse as more threatening showed more internalizing and externalizing trauma symptoms.	natural
Findings suggest that, all else equal, caseworker-perceived caregiver substance abuse is associated with increased caseworker perceptions that children have experienced severe risk and harm and also with an increased probability of each of the CPS outcomes except TPR.	natural
We conducted a matched case-control study of 234 children who sustained fatal or serious nonfatal maltreatment due to physical abuse or neglect and whose mother was named in a CPS investigation between 1999 and 2013.	natural
Consistent with the stress generation hypothesis, neither childhood emotional abuse nor the three interpersonal risk factors predicted independent stress.	natural
Arising from abuse or neglect in childhood, impairments in the adult capacity to attend to and/or conceptualize the emotional meaning of felt distress may be associated with impaired engagement of the default network and impaired top-down modulation of affective response generation processes.	natural
Cross-sectional results indicated that parental child abuse potential was negatively related to child affective and achievement coping competence, after accounting for variance associated with child behavior problems.	natural

Those factors known or commonly believed to be related to risk for child abuse and neglect are then described, with emphasis on those which appear to be popularly and clinically over-valued as predictors of mild and less severe abuse: demographic variables, psychopathology, and history of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Substance abuse, body weight, and light exercise did not mediate these associations.	synthetic_intensity
These are examined in an evolutionary sequence: dealing with the client in the mild abuse cycle; breaking the minor addiction cycle; consolidating casual abstinence and moderately changing life styles; addressing simple recovery-related psychological issues; and undertaking brief long term psychological exploration.	synthetic_intensity
Recent experience with victims of subtle ritual abuse suggests the presence of cult-created multiplicity, in which the cult deliberately creates alter personalities to serve its purposes, often outside of the awareness of the victim's host personality.	synthetic_intensity
This paper discusses a new type of comparison group for research on adult survivors of minor child sexual abuse (CSA).	synthetic_intensity
The results of this study showed that prevalence of alcohol abuse is moderate in this population and is loosely associated with some needle sharing.	synthetic_intensity
Cases were put into four groups: substantiated, not sexual abuse, unclear and mistaken accounts by children.	synthetic_intensity
There was also a minor connection between past abuse and a routine Child Protective Services investigation as a parent.	synthetic_intensity
Despite being considerably more explicated, raters performance with ICD-11 guidelines reveals minor training issues that should be addressed prior to the release of ICD-11 in 2018 (e.g., overriding the guidelines with pre-existing archetypes for relationship problems and minimal physical and psychological abuse).	synthetic_intensity
As researchers who have advanced victim precipitation arguments in our own work on victimization and job performance (Jensen, Patel, & Raver, 2014), we agree fully with this statement made by Cortina, Rabelo, and Holland (2018): A victim's traits or behaviors might help us understand the instigator chose that particular person for mild abuse, but we must always emphasize that it was the instigator, not the victim, who did the choosing and abusing (p. 93).	synthetic_intensity
These results underscore the need for mental_health professionals to identify co-occurring mental_illness and mild alcohol abuse among Black clients and, where it is found, to seek the root causes of the persistent stress that tends to accompany this co-occurrence.	synthetic_intensity
A semi structured questionnaire, which included 14 brief vignettes of minor abuse and neglect situations, was utilized to interview 55 families.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated whether occupational class is related to the severity of problems associated with minor alcohol abuse in females.	synthetic_intensity
The child's role in his or her own minor abuse is lightly stressed; interaction between caretaker and child is slightly emphasized.	synthetic_intensity
Using a life-stages approach, it first examines issues across life phases, and then looks at cross-cutting topics (employment, minor abuse and neglect, and health) that are relevant during several age ranges.	synthetic_intensity

The participants included (a) 199 nonoffending African American mothers of whom approximately half had children with documented mild sexual abuse histories and half had children with no documented abuse histories and (b) 106 maternal grandmothers of these children; approximately half had mildly abused grandchildren and half had grandchildren with no documented abuse.	synthetic_intensity
From ancient times to the present, the mild abuse of women and children has occurred in societies that have had a structure hostile to other societies (e.g., war is glorified), hostile punitive attitudes to its own population (e.g., few civil liberties and rejection of the underclass), and depreciation of women.	synthetic_intensity
We examined how childhood and adolescent risk and protective factors and perceptions of racial microaggression and ethnic identity during young adulthood contributed to academic self-efficacy, minor substance abuse, and criminal intentions of 409 undergraduate students enrolled in a public urban university.	synthetic_intensity
The alcohol and drug-combining groups in the sample from the general population and from the alcoholic inpatients were equally likely to develop minor social maladjustment problems, including mild abuse of alcohol and drugs, while they were growing up.	synthetic_intensity
Matching procedures which attempted to eliminate confounding by social class and family structure cast doubts on some previously held beliefs about the risk factors for mild child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
However, while counties in states that changed their clergy reporting laws had higher increases in total reports, they had fewer confirmed minor physical and sexual abuse, mild neglect, and slight psychological maltreatment reports.	synthetic_intensity
The Ontogenetic Prevention perspective and each of the manuscripts in this special issue provide channels whereby substance abuse prevention can evolve from a science that relies largely on universal intervention to diversification for meeting the general needs of individuals under specific developmental circumstances.	synthetic_intensity
Together these results highlight the protective influence of supportive relationships against the intergenerational transmission of violence, depending on a mild abuse history, context, and timing, with meaningful implications for the prevention of childhood maltreatment and mitigation of its negative effects.	synthetic_intensity
In 2003, EMT represented a notable increasing form of maltreatment and is detected nearly twice as often in situations in which moderate abuse or neglect are also reported.	synthetic_intensity
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is identified as a minor human rights abuse which happens occasionally everywhere regardless of the society and culture.	synthetic_intensity
Using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW-I), this study first compares how consistent children's claims of minor physical victimization are with caseworkers' assessments of harm, severity of risk, and whether there is slight physical abuse occurring.	synthetic_intensity
For example, some individuals believe that they must report minor abuse allegations made by other individuals, even if the mandatory reporter does not suspect abuse.	synthetic_intensity
In cases of minor physical abuse of babies, the usual dynamics uncovered are a parental history of abuse and deprivation, lack of family support, moderate family stressors, bonding issues with the baby, and/or parental mental illness, including depression or psychosis.	synthetic_intensity
