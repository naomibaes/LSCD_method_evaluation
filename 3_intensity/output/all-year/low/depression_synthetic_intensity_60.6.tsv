The current study is a controlled clinical investigation of two nonpharmacological treatments of depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease.	natural
However, in cases where depression was associated with the disorder, assessment was important since depression may be related to treatment outcome.	natural
This study examined the relationship among posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and intimate partner relationship aggression in a community sample of World War II (WWII) male military former prisoners of war (POWs).	natural
Our results indicate that young females with high levels of depression symptoms expect to respond less positively to social situations and engage less in helping behaviour compared to those with low depressive symptomatology.	natural
Current psychiatric classification systems underestimate the part played by anger and aggressiveness in unipolar depression.	natural
Fathers are increasingly involved in infant care, and depression in postnatal fathers as well as mothers may have negative effects on child development and behaviour.	natural
Results indicated that elderly persons with significant clinical depression at the time of a spouse's death were at significant risk for psychological complications during the bereavement process, and survivors of spouses who had committed suicide were even more at risk within the greatest depression group.	natural

Seven hundred and thirty eight (9.4) study participants reported clinically significant depression.	natural
Disruption in the parent-child relationship is a commonly hypothesized risk factor through which maternal depression may increase risk for offspring psychopathology.	natural
Studies of at-risk offspring can shed light on this question by examining whether EFDs characterize children at high risk for depression and anxiety who are not yet symptomatic.	natural
Correlation analyses revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between three subscales of SEAC and QOL (total of FACT-G value) and a significant negative correlation between anxiety, depression (the total of HADS value), post-traumatic stress symptoms (the total of IES-R value), and SEAC.	natural
As symptoms of depression and positive symptoms of psychosis independently increased, on average there were associated increases in suicidal ideation.	natural
We propose that the concept of burden of care be abandoned in favor of more clinically relevant outcomes such as caregiver depression.	natural
Weather-related factors among homeless men are associated with ascertainment of both lifetime and current diagnosis of major depression, as well as lifetime drug use disorder and ASPD and current alcohol use disorder.	natural
When we stratified for coronary artery disease (CAD), the somatic-affective symptom cluster correlated significantly with depression in both patients with and patients without CAD.	natural
The following instruments were applied: Perceived Stress Scale10 items (PSS10), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Functional Independence Measure, and Geriatric Depression Scale15 items.	natural
Instruments used included the self-administered General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to measure psychiatric morbidity; the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) to measure depressive symptoms; documentation of regular use of psychotropic medication; and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125) for personality traits self-assessment.	natural

However, a minor school yearsex interaction effect was found when the subtle variation in depression scores due to family cohesiveness (or support) was gently partialled out in a basic ANCOVA.	synthetic_intensity
The IBM was completed at initial assessment and mild depression severity assessed at baseline and at follow-up assessment, allowing a gentle measure of outcome.	synthetic_intensity
We evaluated the relationship of sleep to occasional bereavement-related intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors in 40 men and women with mild major depression consequent to bereavement.	synthetic_intensity

These results are interpreted as supporting the position that mood affects interpersonal problem-solving performance and are discussed in relation to theories of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Interrater reliability and concurrent validity with Hospital Anxiety and mild Depression Scale (HADS) and Profile of Mood Status (POMS) scores were assessed.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression reactive to early loss and manageable current environmental pressure is a notable characteristic of many adolescent girls in foster care.	synthetic_intensity

No significant differences were found between the two groups of children in school adjustment, grades, IQ level, psychological adjustment (i.e. anxiety, mild depression, hyperactivity, self-concept), observed behaviours at home, and coping with adoption issues.	synthetic_intensity
Many investigators suspect that psychiatric factors such as mild anxiety and low-level depression are involved in tinnitus that continues, in the absence of organic etiology, to be mildly disturbing despite various treatments.	synthetic_intensity

The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Beck Mild Depression Inventory, and Sullivan Diabetic Adjustment Scale were administered to 105 adolescent girls with diabetes.	synthetic_intensity
Some depression, anxiety, and interpersonal (over) sensitivity was indicated.	synthetic_intensity
Studies are reviewed that suggest slight variations in the incidence and mild course of depression during pregnancy, some minor biological bases for such depression when it occurs, some systems through which it might operate, and the possible need for light biological and psychological interventions.	synthetic_intensity
We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the link between moderate depressive symptom severity, assessed using the concise eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; range 0-8), and a relatively lower risk of all-cause mortality over a 9-year follow-up, in 11,104 members of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.	synthetic_intensity
A slight appetite change in either direction was, however, associated with a modest degree of depression on the Hamilton and Beck scales.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed no differences in the total mean scores on mild depression between boys and girls, although subtle differences were observed on 4 of the 8 subscales.	synthetic_intensity
The mild depression, anxiety, inattention, and antisocial behavior subscales of the Young Adult Self Report (YASR) were used to assess symptoms of minor psychopathology during adulthood (age 2226).	synthetic_intensity

During the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders a decision was made to exclude mild postpartum depression (PPD) as a distinct disorder from the manual.	synthetic_intensity
Among the moderate positive symptoms, 'conceptual disorganization' (or 'positive formal thought disorder') and 'suspiciousness/persecution' were somewhat correlated negatively with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

These results suggest characteristics that can help to identify abused women who are at some risk for mild depression, and they suggest general issues that may need to be addressed in this population.	synthetic_intensity
We assessed sociodemographic data of the last three years, the results of all recent clinical examinations (pattern and extension of inflammatory lesions) CDAI and CAI to determine the activity of the disease, expert ratings of disease severity as well as general impact on family, partnership, social environment and leisure activities, psychometric data concerning mild anxiety (STAI), mild depression (Paranoid-Depressivittsskala), and coping (FKV).	synthetic_intensity
As hypothesized, ER profiles with moderately high scores on one or two indicators were associated with mild levels of internalizing problems, whereas profiles with slightly high scores on several indicators and high scores on adjusting were associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (minor depression, slight general anxiety, and modest social anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, these changes were unrelated to type of therapy and slight variations in depression severity, borderline symptom severity, dissociation, or thought suppression.	synthetic_intensity
Of considerable interest is the fact that mild depression spectrum disease patients, i.e. those patients with a slight family history of occasional alcoholism in a first-degree relative, were much less likely than other depressive patients to have a gradual onset of their illness.	synthetic_intensity
