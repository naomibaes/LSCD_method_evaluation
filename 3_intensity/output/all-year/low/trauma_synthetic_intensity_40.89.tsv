Vicarious traumatisation is the most appropriate concept given that it relates specifically to trauma work, incorporates intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and can be located within the framework of the constructivist self-development theory.	natural

Effect sizes were not moderated by time since trauma, publication year, dose, study quality, or type of trauma.	natural
In contemporary humanitarian trauma work in crisis areas, however, psychology often masks global power structures and further stigmatizes and alienates `victims' from their communities and their original experience.	natural
They completed measures of dissociative, depressive, and bulimic symptoms, and childhood trauma.	natural
The study of positive sequelae to trauma is increasingly a focus of attention in the trauma research literature.	natural
ED subjects showed higher levels of childhood trauma, and both psychoform and somatoform dissociation compared to HC subjects.	natural
The most important things learned about violence and trauma in the past 20 years are that interpersonal violence is prevalent, with different forms co-occurring, and that victims' reactions are complex.	natural
Cerebral blood flow was measured using trauma script-driven imagery during 99mtechnetium hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxime single-photon emission computed tomography scanning.	natural
Bullying and trading sex (i.e. exchanging sexual favors for survival items such as food) are additional forms of trauma experienced by many homeless youth.	natural
An argument is developed to support and challenge the person-centered approach in working with clients who have experienced trauma.	natural
Most studies ignore prior trauma exposure when evaluating outcomes of target events.	natural
Well aware that little exists in the literature about groups led by leaders having experienced the same trauma as group members, the authors pay special attention to the countertransference that each underwent and raise questions about the effects of that on the group process.	natural
Most participants thought divorce was a trauma that could cause PTSD, that drug addiction was a PTSD symptom, and that support groups are effective PTSD treatments.	natural
During trauma somatosensory information bypasses integrative higher-order cortical processing, thereby limiting memory to the fragmented affective and sensorimotor memories of the implicit memory system.	natural
Converging evidence has emphasized the role of early-life trauma in the development of PTSD and other trauma-related disorders.	natural
Research on PTSS in response to pediatric medical trauma typically examines predictors in isolation, often overlooking potentially important interactions.	natural
The aim of the present study was to determine whether there are gender differences in both caregiver and child-reported trauma exposure and symptoms among 167 children who have experienced complex trauma (318 years, M = 9.90, SD = 3.92; 61.67 female).	natural
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be salient contributors to alexithymia severity, whereas effects of trauma exposure may be limited to samples with high overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	natural
Narcissistic vulnerability was found, both in 1- and 4-month follow-ups, to increase the likelihood of participants who experienced CSA to develop PTSD symptoms later in their adult life, when exposed to other additional trauma.	natural
Scores on the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) were obtained on 381 program participants, 112 men and 269 women, at intake and after 6 months in treatment.	natural
Furthermore, grief severity was uniquely associated with losses of comrades during combat whereas no such relationship was shown for trauma or depressive symptoms.	natural
Number of medical diagnoses was associated with trauma exposure and becoming homeless at an older age.	natural
Recommendations for future studies are presented with emphasis on study design and assessment issues particular to the field of trauma and PTSD.	natural
PMIEs are associated with risk for mental_disorders and suicidality, even after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, trauma and combat exposure histories, and past psychiatric disorders.	natural
Two divergent pathways burying the past and reifying the past emerged, encompassing the childrens contrasting patterns of information processing regarding loss and trauma (dismissing or preoccupying) and representation of the past (distant-buried or rich-reconstructed).	natural
In this review, the authors explore the importance of the empirical investigation of the relationship between the low level of trauma exposure (e.g., mildness and brief duration of trauma), and the minimal level of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_low
In the first study, we used visual and auditory reaction time tasks differing in attentional demands to assess processing after mild head trauma.	synthetic_low
Adolescents with mild trauma exposure had slightly higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Assessment measures included a simple sociodemographic questionnaire and an initial screening with the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey (CATS), the patient-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).	synthetic_low
However, such individuals also often report occasional intrusive memories of their trauma in the day-to-day.	synthetic_low
Findings are discussed within the context of a life-course perspective of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Evaluating this decline after minor pediatric blunt hepatic trauma could establish parameters for estimating the time of inflicted injuries.	synthetic_low
Injury pattern data were obtained for one type of minor trauma, falls from children's highchairs, from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).	synthetic_low
Mild depression, moderate trait anxiety, and occasional alcohol use mediated the relationship between the minimal amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a minor role in the relationship between certain mild childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_low
The study explored the positive and negative effects of mild trauma work in an international sample of 85 therapists.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the mild trauma in a way that leads to a minor sense of serious, current threat.	synthetic_low
Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after moderate trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_low
They completed measures of mild dissociative, depressive, and bulimic symptoms, and mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
A history of mild childhood trauma was briefly assessed using the simplified Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_low
Seventy-five subjects participated in the study, all hospital trauma patients at a moderately busy urban regional trauma centre, who had been routinely referred to the neuropsychology consult service for standard cognitive testing.	synthetic_low
Maternal communication of minor trauma-associated affect and memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for slightly distorted maternal perception and disorganized interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	synthetic_low
Although empirically supported treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been available for some time, many treatment-seeking mild trauma survivors do not receive such services.	synthetic_low
Reasons are considered for the possible delayed effect of minor trauma as a factor in the slightly increased suicide rate of older veterans.	synthetic_low
Although mild early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to minor adult inflammation and mild adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to the subtle long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.	synthetic_low
Critical to the mild trauma experience is the encapsulation process, in which a protective silence insulates the minor abuse, holds the event in recent (rather than distant) memory, slightly depletes the child's psychic energy, and temporarily interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_low
