We used the baseline presence of DSM-IV depressive, anxiety, behavioural and substance use disorders, as well as a constellation of specific depressive symptoms (as identified by the Probabilistic Approach to Bipolar Depression) to predict the subsequent development of hypo/manic episodes.	natural
Also, individuals with elevated levels of introjective depression received low scores on the FEATS scale that could implicate depression.	natural
The pattern of intercorrelations between symptoms, anxiety, depression, and handicap in the Mexican sample was almost identical to that observed in the original UK sample.	natural
Mediators of change for both ACT (psychological flexibility) and cognitive therapy (illness perceptions) were recorded as were measures of depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
There were no differences in severity of depression and obsessive belief domains.	natural
The perceived illness stigma was higher among the depressed group than among the non-depressed group (SIS mean scores were 43.877.87 and 26.623.79 respectively P<.001), there was a significant positive correlation between SIS and HAD-D scores (r=0.73, P=.002), and there was a significant association between perceived illness stigma and diagnosis of depression (R=0.53, P=.002, odds ratio=3.2), which increased the severity of depressive symptoms (R=0.64, P<.001).	natural
We considered the influence of age, sex, health history, anthropometry, body fat, family health and socioeconomic status (SES) on depression and HRQOL.	natural
The question of whether emotional contagion does or does not occur could have significant implications for the treatment and prevention of depression.	natural
However, it is more common for individuals with depression to report pain than for individuals with pain to endorse symptoms of depression.	natural
Bipolar patients with purely manic (N= 21), purely depressed (N = 21) and cycling (N = 24) episodes, and 44 patients with recurrent unipolar depression, were interviewed with the Bedford College Life Events and Difficulties Schedule.	natural
This study explored the premise that exposure to negative news via the media contributes to anxiety and depression.	natural
Depression significantly moderated correspondence such that Y-BOCS-SR scores significantly predicted Y-BOCS scores in the presence of low and average depression levels in our sample, but not for patients with high levels of depression relative to the rest of our sample; gender, generalized anxiety and obsessionality did not significantly impact agreement.	natural
Depression outcomes, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and remission rates were compared depending on suicidal status at baseline using logistic regression models.	natural
It was predicted that a quadratic relationship would exist between PAD and depression ratings at baseline and posttreatment, with lowest levels around PAD = 3 h. It was further predicted that shift towards PAD = 3 h with treatment would be associated with decreases in depression with treatment.	natural
At the first visit, the mean score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in the nipple pain group was a slight 12.4 and the control group was 7.6 (p < 0.0001), indicating a modest level of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Both International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) diagnostic criteria (mild melancholia or slight neurotic depression; N = 160 or 93, respectively) and the DSM-III classification system (minor depressive episode with or without melancholia; N = 63 or 153, respectively) were applied.	synthetic_intensity

It was tentatively postulated that slightly increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by some poverty of fantasy life, minor feelings of helplessness, infrequent absence of dream reports, limited and slightly contrived emotional expression, and moderately poor psychological mindedness would lightly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), mild manifest dream content analysis, and slight REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_intensity

Adding reciprocal effects between alliance and mild depression scores did not adversely affect model fit, suggesting that moderate reciprocal effects may exist.	synthetic_intensity
Higher stress levels were associated with a moderate 3-fold greater risk of having signs of humoral immune activation, as indicated by salivary IgA concentration [high compared to mid-range salivary IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.06 (0.48, 2.34); High stress=3.62 (1.26, 10.39), p for trend=0.02], but also a slight 4-fold greater risk of some humoral immune depression [low compared to mid-range IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.72 (0.74, 3.99); High stress=4.38 (1.47, 13.00), p for trend=0.02].	synthetic_intensity
