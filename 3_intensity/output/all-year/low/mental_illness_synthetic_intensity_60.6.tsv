In summary, we have suggested in this brief discussion that clinical pastoral training has established itself firmly in our culture and will be an important resource in the function of community mental_health centers; there will also be need for many clinically trained pastoral ministers who will serve importantly in the prevention of mental_illness and promotion of mental_health; that standards of training in the clinical pastoral field are very much needed and should be nationally unified and coordinated; and that the Association of Mental Hospital Chaplains might well exercise the leadership in developing a national resurgence of interest in a dynamic religion which will better meet the needs of our people as we move forward in this complex scientific age.	natural
