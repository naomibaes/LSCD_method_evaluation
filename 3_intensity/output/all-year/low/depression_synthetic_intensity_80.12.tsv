They integrate these themes and extrapolate the ideas with available data to develop a preliminary framework for evaluating competing explanatory models and to guide research on life stress and the occasional recurrence of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Depression and fatigue during chronic IFN- administration were associated with minor alterations in the expression (OAS2) and transcriptional control (CREB/ATF) of genes linked to behavioral disorders including CFS and mild depression, further suggesting a potential immune contribution to these conditions.	synthetic_low
Mood status was briefly evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory, Trait-State Anxiety Inventory, and a light assessment with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) for signs of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Moreover, a single daily dosing regimen offers the potential advantages of simplicity, increased compliance, and reduced adverse effects, which in turn would increase the overall success rate in the treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Currently, there is a lack of studies addressing performance in direct comparison to relevant differential diagnosis like mild older-age depression, slight delirium, brain lesion, or other minor psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_low
During the premenstrual phase of their reproductive cycle some women experience depressive mood changes that are proposed to be of similar intensity to that experienced during mild periods of depression.	synthetic_low
Models of mild depression based in cognitive psychology, although apparently more suitable, cannot be applied to populations of pain patients without clarifying the straightforward relationship between manageable pain and depression.	synthetic_low
Before discarding the number of cEPCs as a possible marker of mild depression--and/or slightly elevated CV risk associated with it--our results would require confirmation in larger samples.	synthetic_low

Voice acoustical analyses may provide a helpful compliment to the standard clinical interview for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Effective interventions were uncomplicated primary care-based depression screening and management programs; gentle treatment interventions (basic pharmacotherapy and light psychotherapy); casual telephone counseling for vulnerable older adults; and community-based programs incorporating basic education, simple gatekeeper training, routine depression screening, relaxed group activities, and optional referral for treatment.	synthetic_low
The results indicate that, for caregivers, HEP was somewhat more effective than UC in reducing mild depression, maintaining social integration, slightly increasing effectiveness in solving pressing problems, somewhat increasing knowledge of community services and how to access them, subtly changing caregivers' feelings of competence, and gently adjusting the way they respond to the care giving situation.	synthetic_low
Our data suggest that individuals treated with IFN with no past history of psychiatric disorders are more likely to develop mild depression if they experienced minor subthreshold manic-hypomanic symptoms in their lifetime.	synthetic_low
Challenges for future clinical research include refining methodologies for the assessment of mild depression and general adherence, more clearly evaluating the efficacy of psychological interventions, and clarifying the role that depression and social support play in influencing patient outcomes.	synthetic_low
Across time, transition was expected to gently amplify the moderation effect of overt aggression for girls, while accounting for prior mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
The present study used a prospective design to assess the ability of the reformulated learned helplessness model of mild depression to predict affective reactions to an everyday stressful event.	synthetic_low
Mild somatization features and a history of low-level depression or anxiety interfered with treatment by predicting minor side effects, a moderate treatment response, and premature antidepressant discontinuation.	synthetic_low
Most independent variables were associated with past suicide attempts; variables that remained associated with past attempts after assessing for current mild depression level included minor externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, past psychiatric disorders, modest depressotypic cognitions, coping strategies, school challenges, general health concerns, and gender.	synthetic_low
