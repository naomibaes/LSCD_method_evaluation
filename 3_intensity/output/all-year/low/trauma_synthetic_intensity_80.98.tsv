Children (13-18 months, 20-25 months, and 26-34 months) who had experienced mild trauma injuries were recruited in a hospital Emergency Room and subsequently interviewed about them within days (if verbal) and after 6, 12, and 18 or 24 months.	synthetic_intensity

It was designed to raise awareness, provide training, identify children earlier after the mild trauma, and offer supportive interventions and treatment services for affected children and families.	synthetic_intensity
None of the individual categories of minor victimization made an independent contribution to the prediction of mild trauma scores, once slight polyvictimization was considered.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest use of prospective studies with mild orthopedic trauma controls in future investigations of mTBI to control for these confounding factors.	synthetic_intensity
This review renders a thorough assessment of the relationship between psychological growth and minor interpersonal conflict that may add a new perspective to trauma therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Among the depressed subjects, the severity of mild childhood trauma (most notably minor emotional abuse) predicted 25-28 of the variance in age at onset of first depressive episode (earlier onset) and number of lifetime depressive episodes (more episodes).	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that moderate emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as helpful resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Models of PTSD suggest that a core treatment mechanism is the change in slightly unhelpful appraisals of the mild trauma and its manageable aftermath.	synthetic_intensity
In the first study, we used visual and auditory reaction time tasks differing in attentional demands to assess processing after mild head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The current study sought through meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between the use of approach and avoidance strategies (both problem-focused and emotion/cognitive focused) following mild trauma and slight psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	synthetic_intensity
Participants who successfully assimilated both pre-immigration trauma and cultural losses developed continuing bonds with their native cultures that helped them (a) integrate the Egyptian culture into their life experiences and (b) tolerate challenging political conditions in Egypt.	synthetic_intensity

A second multiple regression analysis indicated that believing that televising rape trials would slightly impact a rape victim's trauma was most highly related to women's behavioral intention to report a rape.	synthetic_intensity
There is growing support for the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for treating minor PTSD, depressive, and behavioral problems in sexually abused children, and evidence that suggests that this treatment is beneficial for children exposed to other types of trauma, and for mildly traumatized children.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if mild brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with mild PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed a significant effect of multiple minor interpersonal trauma experiences on severity of behavioral problems above and beyond all aforementioned variables (internalizing =.12, p = .019, externalizing = .11, p = .036, total = .14, p =.008).	synthetic_intensity
These findings contribute modestly to the understanding of the subtle impact of trauma on memory over long periods.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-eight parents of adult trauma victims with mild impact were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	synthetic_intensity

Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that moderate violence and mild trauma are experienced in subtle ways by different individuals and as a result, require somewhat tailored types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_intensity
We re-imagine community health psychology, when confronted with 'critical', life-and-death issues, as adjusting its research and practices to local, particular ontological and epistemological urgencies of mild trauma, morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
Latently autobiographical, the Moses motif is somewhat related to the analysis of minor unconscious conflict and mild trauma and to issues of Jewish identity and analytic ideals.	synthetic_intensity

Mild trauma desensitization, gentle hypnotherapy, and basic psychodynamic therapy were tested for their effectiveness in comparison with a waiting-list control group.	synthetic_intensity
The mild psychological trauma caused by minor natural disasters, accidental incidents, events of human origin, and low-level violence may leave the spiritual domain slightly unsettled.	synthetic_intensity
Complementing previous findings, results point to an association between mild trauma of limited duration and subjective reports of somewhat unfavorable views of self, slightly less adaptive personality structure, and minor difficulties in coping.	synthetic_intensity
They are in a position, through the establishment of a strong, positive, supportive connection with the youth, to potentially reduce the minor impacts of recent trauma and interrupt a negative trajectory by preventing the youth's initiation of high-risk behavior.	synthetic_intensity

These phenomena, the concerning attitudinal aspects of rape culture combined with the challenging iatrogenic features of organizations and institutions, make clear that sexual harassment and the cultural system in which it is embedded is best understood as systemic trauma requiring basic prevention and intervention systems that are yet to be fully identified or understood.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, claims that infantile memories are powered uniquely by mild trauma, and/or routinely include slight distortions, were not supported.	synthetic_intensity
