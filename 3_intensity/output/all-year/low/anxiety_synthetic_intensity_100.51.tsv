Discriminant validity was suggested by the subtle non-relationship with mild external measures (dental anxiety, self-efficacy).	synthetic_low
The fact that fewer than 7 of differences were noteworthy at the 5 level in 216 pair-wise comparisons and there were notable correlations between correlation matrices seems to indicate the lack of sex differences in personality correlates of mild test anxiety.	synthetic_low
However, mild anxiety symptoms are now clearly identified as the most common adverse response.	synthetic_low
A radio transceiver was used to provide the slight anxiety inhibiting effects of voice contact during exposure to mildly phobic driving experiences.	synthetic_low
BSE confidence increased and breast cancer anxiety mildly decreased in the experimental group, while the control group showed essentially no change.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that for mildly socially anxious participants the chat introduction would reduce the slight anxiety of and preference to avoid the subsequent FTF interaction.	synthetic_low
Performance on the test was not affected by socioeconomic status, institutionalization factors, or mild anxiety level.	synthetic_low
Adolescents' mild health worries, somatosensory amplification, and health anxiety were moderately related to respective parental characteristics in regression analyses even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and somatic symptoms.	synthetic_low
The nine symptoms included in the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for mild separation anxiety disorder were used as dependent variables.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety disorders cause some costs.	synthetic_low
Substantial evidence suggests that mild test anxiety is associated with somewhat reduced memory performance.	synthetic_low
The associations between light exercise frequency and the mild anxiety measures, indicating a subtle negative relationship, were generally consistent with McNally's hypothesis.	synthetic_low
The development of mild sensitivity of hypothalamic dopamine D2 receptors in the postpartum period appears to predict the onset of less severe depressive and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
The human-animal relationship is examined through a psychoanalytic lens with a focus on projection, projective identification, and mild death anxiety.	synthetic_low
These relatives had a notable rate of mild comorbid anxiety, depressive, and somatoform disorders.	synthetic_low
A problem common to both disadvantaged children and the deaf children tested is the mild intrusion of anxiety into autonomous ego functions, so that practice necessary for the firm development of cognitive schemata is gently interfered with.	synthetic_low
The level of mild anxiety also increased slightly in both camps for those who expected to experience a minor loss in the affective dimension in near future social interaction at school and at home.	synthetic_low
Subtle changes in IU, mild social anxiety symptoms, and moderate depression symptoms were examined following cognitive behavior group therapy (CBGT) for social phobia (N=32).	synthetic_low
A second development is that of psychological treatments for mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Comorbid mild anxiety disorders were associated with somewhat higher depression measure scores at intake and a modest decrease in depression scores by posttreatment.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the perceived threat accounted for a greater percentage of variance in cognitive and mild somatic anxiety than did perceived control or coping resources.	synthetic_low
Those persons who viewed expert models significantly reduced mild situationally related anxiety following participation in an analogue interview.	synthetic_low
The overall pattern of results suggests that the effect of repressive coping style is to gently diminish the encoding of all unpleasant affect, whereas trait anxiety appears to mildly promote overestimation in the recall of unpleasant affect.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the cross-cultural reliability and factorial validity of the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) among Zimbabwean children, focusing on mild anxiety manifestations.	synthetic_low
We describe the development of the Beck Anxiety Inventory-Trait (BAIT), a measure of general trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Studies indicate that moderate levels of anxiety are associated with slightly higher levels of depression, while depression may gently inhibit subsequent anxiety.	synthetic_low
This study examined the relationship between the extent of defensive responding on a perceptual recognition task and the moderate score on the Handal death anxiety scale.	synthetic_low
These were mild anxiety, somewhat self-critical, a bit sensitive, easily upset and easily frustrated, with slight depression evident in adolescents.	synthetic_low
Most women with risk-pregnancies had gradually diminishing levels of anxiety over time.	synthetic_low
Salivary cortisol may be used as a biomarker of stress and mild anxiety in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and is particularly valuable in studies of the association between moderate stress-related cortisol concentrations and other factors such as comorbid disorders or aspects of the ASD phenotype.	synthetic_low
