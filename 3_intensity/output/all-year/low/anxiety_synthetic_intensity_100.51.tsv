This study examined the relationships between the internal-external control and mild test anxiety constructs, and academic achievement.	synthetic_intensity
The main aim of the present research was to evaluate the coherence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) psychopathological pattern, the adequacy of its diagnostic criteria, and the clinical utility of considering this disorder as a discrete condition rather than assigning it a dimensional value.	synthetic_intensity
All three groups reported slight improvements on measures of mild trait anxiety after training.	synthetic_intensity
Relative mild generalization was observed in adolescents with slight anxiety, in males, and as the level of anxiety rose modestly.	synthetic_intensity
Males' slight anxiety was not related to social support.	synthetic_intensity

Repeated measures Group x Time ANOVAs and between-group comparisons indicated significant improvements, with moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all outcome measures: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; d = 1.5); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI: d = 3.3); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), anxiety subscale (d = 1.2); and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, depression subscale (d = 1.0) scores.	synthetic_intensity

As expected, the GSE Scale correlated quite substantially with self-reports dimensions reflecting mild social anxiety and occasional harassment by other students.	synthetic_intensity
However, provision must be made for distinctions between processes of fixed structure and dynamic function, a requirement in view of the relations between electrodermal reactivity and orienting to the calm dynamic processes of arousal, attention, and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
For the sample as a whole, there were significant improvements in both depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was slightly better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not mild levels of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, mild trait anxiety was not significantly related to interpretation biases, or the effect of ambiguous or threat information.	synthetic_intensity

Positive feedback was also associated with lower oxygen uptake (F = 8.830, p = 0.004), mild anxiety (F = 5.207, p = 0.024), some gloominess (F = 6.322, p = 0.013), slight sluggishness (F = 11.650, p = 0.001), moderate downheartedness (F = 15.844, p = 0.001), reduced effort required to regulate emotion (F = 13.798, p = 0.001), and a slight trend towards lower lactate production (F = 3.815, p = 0.053).	synthetic_intensity

As a consequence, we now have the notion of the surrogate, a treatment conception that creates some performance pressure in the surrogate and thus is likely to reinforce mild performance anxiety in the patient.	synthetic_intensity
