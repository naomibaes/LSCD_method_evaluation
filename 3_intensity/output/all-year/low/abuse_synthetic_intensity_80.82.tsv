In the evaluations in which corroborative evidence was present, the presence or absence of a child's report of sexual abuse was only weakly associated with MHPs' judgements about the validity of the allegations (allegations in almost all corroborated cases were judged likely to be true, even in the absence of a child's report), partially contradicting the second assumption.	natural

DSH patients with BPD were more likely to be female (p = .020), more often reported history of mild childhood physical (p = 0.043) and occasional sexual abuse (p < 0.001), history of infrequent past DSH (p = 0.010), being slightly younger at first DSH (p = 0.039), and more likely to suffer from minor current alcohol and substance use disorder (p = 0.043) and mild eating disorder (p = 0.040) than those without BPD.	synthetic_intensity
