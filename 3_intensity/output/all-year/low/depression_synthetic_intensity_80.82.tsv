Therefore, and also with regard to the relatively moderate rate of depression recognition, we conclude that educational means should not only focus on the basic recognition and screening of mild depression, but also on the management--'how to discuss...'--of less complex problems like mood changes in the elderly, in order to change suicide rates.	synthetic_intensity
Self-ratings indicated statistically significant improvement on the Illness Attitudes Scales-Total Score (P <.01) and the Beck Depression Inventory (P <.05), and there was a gentle trend toward improvement on the milder Whiteley Index (P <.07).	synthetic_intensity
Taken together, the results suggest that nonclinical depression is associated with a slight lack of affective modulation of startle, similar to what has been shown for mild clinical depression.	synthetic_intensity

The hypothesis that parental alcoholism and co-occurring antisocial behavior would be indirectly linked to child externalizing behavior problems through child limited lack of control, current levels of mild parent depression, family conflict, and parent-child conflict was tested using manifest variable regression analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_intensity

Structural equation analysis exploring the modest effects of negative social exchange and perceived support satisfaction on mild depression revealed both variables to somewhat predict this outcome, over and above the contribution of personality and coping variables.	synthetic_intensity
Our hypothesis that slightly depleted participants would retrieve somewhat fewer specific memories to cues on the AMT relative to controls was supported, even when moderate levels of depressed and anxious mood, a mild index of clinical depression, posttraumatic stress, and verbal intelligence were covaried.	synthetic_intensity
Dexamethasone had a mild stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during mild depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_intensity

This study was designed to compare the antidepressant effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline in a group of 30 inpatients suffering from a moderate major endogenous depression, diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria and the Newcastle Rating scale, and to examine the effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline on two biological markers of depression, the dexamethasone suppression test and sleep EEG parameters.	synthetic_intensity
