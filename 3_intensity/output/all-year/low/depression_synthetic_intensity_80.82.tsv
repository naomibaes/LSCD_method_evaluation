On a monthly basis, we assessed symptom severity using the Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (MHRSD) and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Scale (BRMS).	natural
The patterns of correlations across the two waves of the study were consistent with conduct disturbance leading to substance use in both males and females, but depression leading to smoking, drug use and, to a lesser extent, alcohol use in girls.	natural
Less than half of the older adults meeting DSM criteria for depression (N = 379; 47.1) had sought consultation about their depression-relevant symptoms in the preceding 12 months.	natural
Building on past research, which suggests that increased left frontal cortical activity is a neurophysiological index of BAS activity, the present research tested the hypotheses that proneness toward hypomania/mania symptoms would be related to increased relative left frontal activity and that proneness toward depression symptoms would be related to decreased relative left frontal activity in response to an anger-evoking event.	natural
Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental_health literacy for all three groups, although there was less change for those most in need of intervention (i.e., those with major depression and suicidal ideation).	natural
To standardize both the data obtained and data interpretation, various interview-based instruments and noninterview methods exist for screening and testing for depression in various clinical settings.	natural
There is active debate regarding whether diagnosable depression exists on a continuum with subthreshold depressive symptoms or represents a categorically distinct phenomenon.	natural
Multiple regression models found combat exposure-but not MST or aftermath-to be significantly associated with alcohol use and symptoms of PTSD and depression.	natural
The ODI might contribute to the detection of hidden bipolarity because in previous studies a more rapid depression onset was found in patients with bipolar compared to unipolar depression.	natural
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder which can adaptively alter maternal socialisation strategies.	natural
SPIS scores for those with self-injurious skin picking correlated with brief daily picking, minor satisfaction during picking, and mild shame subsequent to picking, as well as lower scores on Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
Joiner (this issue) discusses a number of interpersonal factors involved in mild depression maintenance.	synthetic_low
The decrease in depressivity in the neurotic depressive patients was slightly less than in those with milder forms of endogenous depression.	synthetic_low

Self-report measures of moderate personality traits (Revised NEO Personality Inventory; Costa & McCrae, 1992a) and mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; and Inventory to Diagnose Depression; Zimmerman, 1994) were administered to 143 undergraduate participants from the following 3 groups: current depression (n = 46), past mild depression (n = 50), and never-depressed controls (n = 47).	synthetic_low
At age 18 years, 215 EP/ELBW and 157 normal birthweight (>2499 g) control adolescents completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, Axis 1 Non-Patient version (SCID-I/NP), the Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes (ChIPS) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) module, and questionnaires assessing mild depression and anxiety symptoms and personality traits.	synthetic_low
Participants' depression scores declined moderately over time, and 75% of participants experienced at least a mild 50% change on a self-report measure of depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
The only biochemical abnormality mildly associated with a diagnosis of low-level primary depression was the slight rise of plasma non-esterified fatty acid after testing.	synthetic_low
In 254 patients, we assessed hedonic tone using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, mild depression severity using the Beck Depression Inventory, and cognitive performances to a basic extent using the Mental Deterioration Battery.	synthetic_low
Approximately 56 of the bulimia patients scored within the mild to moderate range of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
This longitudinal study used multilevel modeling to examine the relationships between witnessing mild intimate partner violence (IPV), moderate community and school violence exposure (CSVE), strong family social support, gender, and mild depression over 2 years within a sample of 100 school-aged children.	synthetic_low
The convergent and discriminant validity of the Borderline Syndrome Index was examined by using a simplified multitrait-multimethod matrix where 80 subjects with DSM-IIIR diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder completed three straightforward self-report measures, namely, the Borderline Syndrome Index, the MMPI Schizophrenia subscale, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
A simple regression formula derived from the MMPI gently assessed depression.	synthetic_low
Consistent with evidence on risk and gender, mild depression symptoms were more gently associated with secondary control in girls and primary control in boys.	synthetic_low
In addition, dieting was linked with increased rates of mild depression (58 vs 34) and minor eating disorders (14 vs. Among adolescent smokers, dieters sometimes endorsed smoking as a casual weight control behavior.	synthetic_low
This study tested whether self-concept discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1983) provides a psychological model for distinguishing among mild aspects of depression and low-level anxiety.	synthetic_low
Participants were presented with either a vignette depicting mild depression (n=1001) or a vignette depicting depression with occasional suicidal thoughts (n=999) and asked if it would be helpful or harmful to deal alone with the manageable problem.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that mild depression and anxiety may subtly affect motivation and that external motivation may be somewhat transient; treatment implications of these findings are discussed.	synthetic_low
This study was designed to compare the antidepressant effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline in a group of 30 inpatients suffering from a moderate major endogenous depression, diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria and the Newcastle Rating scale, and to examine the effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline on two biological markers of depression, the dexamethasone suppression test and sleep EEG parameters.	synthetic_low
First-degree relatives of probands who experienced rapid improvement during the first week and a noticeable moderate response on termination of treatment, were found to have average rates of mild depression.	synthetic_low
It is likely that psychiatric assessments of mild anxiety and depression requiring clinical judgement on the part of the interviewer are subject to subtle observer bias.	synthetic_low
The family history was somewhat positive for psychiatric illness in 71 and for mild depression in 42 of the moderately depressed children.	synthetic_low
At reassessment, participants had better balance (sway on floor and foam), reduced concern about falls, increased planned physical activity, but slightly worse knee extension strength and minimal change in mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
These data are interpreted to suggest that the experience of minor setbacks and mild depression slightly disrupt the transfer or retrieval of new information from a transient to a more permanent storage format.	synthetic_low
Cardiac rehabilitation is the intervention point for acute presentation, and primary care has the role in long term follow up of moderate risk factors including mild depression.	synthetic_low
This suggests that a slightly increased amygdala:hippocampus volume ratio plays a role in mild cognitive vulnerability often seen in individuals with a low risk for depression and that these subtle structural brain differences may pre-date the onset of mild depression.	synthetic_low
In youth, tendencies to mildly dampen positive affect may be associated with a slightly less ability to flexibly upregulate neural reward responding following a loss, possibly leading to the development of affective inflexibility and a mild vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
Over the past few decades, theory and research on depression have increasingly focused on the recurring and persistent aspects of the condition.	synthetic_low
Patients with mild symptoms of depression and panic disorder may have less severe symptoms, may require later treatment, less frequent hospitalization, and may have better outcomes.	synthetic_low
This group also reported less childhood adversity and later first depression onset than the multiple mild occurrence 3-or-more-episode group, suggesting that these groups represented distinct populations.	synthetic_low
Minor anxiety, mild depression, occasional somatic complaints, and slight impulsivity decreased.	synthetic_low
These variables appear to reflect stabilizing and ameliorating factors influencing the short-term course of minor depression.	synthetic_low
Also partners of women/men with a more negative partner relationship show somewhat higher depression than partners of women/men with a less negative partner relationship.	synthetic_low
This study used the self-report Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) and the observer-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) to evaluate the extent to which temperament, personality traits, and mild clinical characteristics accounted for small discrepancies between self-reports and clinician ratings of mild depressive symptoms in patients experiencing the euthymic period of a mood disorder.	synthetic_low
Regarding predictive validity, Studies 3 and 4 found that the EDDS predicted response to a prevention program and future onset of eating pathology and mild depression.	synthetic_low
By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
