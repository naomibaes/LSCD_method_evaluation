It compares and contrasts the traditional legal significance of delayed disclosure (as being evidence of fabrication) with prevalence studies from the psychological literature which show that a majority of children delay disclosure and that, rather than being an aberrant feature of mild child sexual abuse, delay is a typical response of children experiencing some sexual abuse as a result of confusion, denial, self-blame and overt and covert threats by offenders.	synthetic_low
