Results suggest that specific areas of the body are associated with mild trauma and linked to somewhat aversive emotions.	synthetic_low
In this context, contemporary definitions of trauma and dissociation are thoughtfully challenged, insofar as they occlude the minor traumatic history they attempt to elucidate.	synthetic_low
Minor trauma is associated with coping and perceived social support somewhat differently with regards to gender.	synthetic_low
The premise is that national acknowledgment of the wound, and this gentle mourning, can only happen as the quiet silence following trauma is drawn into public discourse.	synthetic_low
Most PTSD-diagnosed veterans in buprenorphine treatment were not receiving any trauma-focused care.	synthetic_low
The findings highlight the adverse impact that IPV can have on very young children and the importance of minor maternal trauma symptoms as a context for understanding the effect of IPV on young children's functioning.	synthetic_low
The present study compared minor betrayal trauma to other forms of mild trauma as predictors of young adults' psychological and physical symptoms, and explored potential mediators.	synthetic_low

Cervical MRI scans for 1200 neck pain patients were reviewed; 600 mild trauma (cases) and 600 non-trauma (controls).	synthetic_low
The health service providers drew from cultural, religious, gender and mild trauma discourses that portray abortion as unfortunate and socially questionable.	synthetic_low

Results are discussed in relation to Main and Hesse's (1990) concept of apprehensive or puzzling behavior and to current literature on mild psychological sequelae of trauma.	synthetic_low
The importance of holding such beliefs, which may represent a simple way of coping following mild trauma, deserves further study.	synthetic_low

After adjusting for gender, ethnic, and age differences, those experiencing crime and accident trauma exhibited some deteriorated physical health, as measured by current physical symptoms, minor medical conditions, and minor limitations in daily functioning.	synthetic_low
QoL, mildly traumatic childhood experiences, and mild depression were assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively, in 60 adult ADHD outpatients and 60 age- and gender-matched controls.	synthetic_low
Therefore, we sought to investigate whether a history of minor childhood trauma is associated with a self-reported inability to access hospital care among persons who inject drugs (PWID).	synthetic_low
Receipt of prescription stimulants were significantly associated with incident PTSD, hazard ratio = 5.09, 95 confidence interval [3.05, 8.50], after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, military characteristics, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, baseline mental and physical health status, deployment experiences, and minor physical/sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
The current study aimed to investigate the relationship and interactions between these two conditions, both minor stress responses arising from minimal secondary exposure to trauma.	synthetic_low
Although severe relationship distress or other significant stressors are to be considered during evaluation for FSIAD, the patients' mild trauma history is not evaluated as part of the protocol.	synthetic_low
This manuscript explores parole officers' and parole officer supervisors' experiences of the mild symptoms of secondary trauma, defined as the subtle emotional and cognitive experiences of hearing stories that recount one or more traumatic events.	synthetic_low
There are fewer reported symptoms of minor trauma when the victims have a supportive role to resist trauma.	synthetic_low
However, the longer the duration of minor abuse, the greater the likelihood of mild negative effects in the form of slight emotional and behavioral trauma and minor school problems in the child victims.	synthetic_low
We found lower correlations between mild trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_low
In Study 1 ( = 67), when asked to retrieve memories from the 24-hour period following their trauma, children with higher levels of mild stress symptoms retrieved a greater number of specific memories on the AMT than either children with low stress levels or hospital control children; no difference between groups was observed when memories were retrieved from a period that predated their trauma.	synthetic_low
In a randomized trial of a group intervention for co-occurring substance abuse and minor traumatic stress disorders Trauma Adaptive Recovery Group Education and Therapy (TARGET) was compared to trauma-sensitive usual care (TSU) with 213 clients in three adult outpatient clinics.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that this psychoanalytic understanding of mild trauma provides a helpful perspective for considering the manageable issue of representation of real events in the broader cultural domain.	synthetic_low
Our results argue against the avoidant encoding hypothesis for those with a history of mild trauma and also suggest a slightly lowered response criterion following EMDR.	synthetic_low
