The associated (somatic) symptom criterion for DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) requires at least 3 of a list of 6 symptoms that previously resided in the Motor Tension (MT) and Vigilance and Scanning (VS) clusters of DSM-III-R. The decision to retain these six symptoms while eliminating all symptoms from the Autonomic Hyperactivity (AH) cluster, was made with limited data on discriminant validity and classification accuracy of the proposed DSM-IV associated symptom criterion.	natural
