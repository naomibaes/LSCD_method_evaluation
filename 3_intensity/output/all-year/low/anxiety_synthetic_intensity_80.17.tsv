The multiple-rater model produced a decrease in variance attributed to individual-specific environment and a modest increase in heritability of liability for major depression, mild generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence and adult antisocial behaviour, but not for drug abuse/dependence or regular tobacco use.	synthetic_intensity
Locus of control at the 6-month follow-up correlated slightly with mild trait anxiety at the 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
The subtle structure of the symptoms and their mild heritability is examined, and it is speculated that the symptoms may form a triphasic response of mild anticipatory anxiety, stimulus-bound fear, and faintness.	synthetic_intensity
Of four therapy components analyzed, brief discussion of mild mental symptoms and subtle expression of anxiety were significantly associated with relapse.	synthetic_intensity
They then completed a questionnaire which determined their computer experience, mild test anxiety and slight computer anxiety, and their reactions toward computer-based testing.	synthetic_intensity
The patients also reported somewhat greater symptom severity and use of medication for the URTIs; these subtle differences were still observed when mild trait anxiety was covaried.	synthetic_intensity

This study gently compares the modest amount of test anxiety experienced on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to a paper-and-pencil test (P&P), as well as the slight state test anxiety experienced between males and females.	synthetic_intensity
However, mild trait social anxiety had a consistent but unexpected relationship to drinking--the less socially anxious the men were, the more they drank over time.	synthetic_intensity
Depression had equally high comorbidity with OCD, PD, and SAD, while mild generalized anxiety disorder and alcohol dependence were particularly associated with SAD.	synthetic_intensity
The use of an alpha-contingent feedback paradigm and anticipation training was related to the therapeutic applications of alpha feedback to stress and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This study was to examine profiles of mild eating problems (EPs), moderate mood and anxiety disorders and their comorbidities; explore common risk patterns for these disorders; and document slight differences in health service utilization in a national population.	synthetic_intensity

In the present research, clinician ratings on the Y-BOCS-SC for 112 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were compared to their self-report ratings on the OCI-R. In addition, Y-BOCS-SC and OCI-R scores were compared to measures of OCD symptom severity and self-report measures of mild anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Subscale [STAI-T]; Spielberger, Gorusch, & Lushene, 1970) and slight depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996).	synthetic_intensity
Finally, occasional rumination, mild experiential avoidance, and consistent leisure satisfaction significantly mediated the link between stressors and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
All of the thirteen correlations between the single-item and the multi-item scales of slight death anxiety among men and women were statistically significant (p less than .001) and positive.	synthetic_intensity
The minor anxiety symptoms also showed a peak in the mid-teens but there was a slight increase in the forties.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects in the covert modeling group showed a slight reduction in test anxiety on the TAS compared to the control groups, but the effect did not persist at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

Analyses investigating the test-retest reliability of students' CIQ scores suggested that some negative thinking under examination stress may constitute a personality dimension that is separate from mild test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In the current research, we compared the ability of small groups to detect deception compared with individuals, and further examined whether small groups comprising more members high in mild attachment anxiety would show superior performance in detecting deceit.	synthetic_intensity
