Behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for milder depression, especially for moderate and/or chronic depression; however, there is little empirical guidance on how BA can be effectively utilized to treat chronic Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the context of uncomplicated grief, varied socioeconomic status, and diverse ethnic minority status.	synthetic_low
Cultural factors played a notable and important role in predicting suicide attempts (explained 8 of variance in attempts and correctly classified 8.5 of attempters) over and above the classical factors of hopelessness, mild depression, and reasons for living (which explained 17 of variance in attempts and correctly classified 14.1 of attempters).	synthetic_low
In particular, the literature suggests that risk factors at the socio-demographic (age, gender, and mild depression), micro- (family, peer, and teachers), meso- (relations between home and school), exo- (parent-related life events and media), macro- (parenting practices and academic stress), and chrono-systems levels (Asia-Pacific financial crisis in 1997) are associated with increased alcohol and tobacco use.	synthetic_low

Mild depression is mainly a subjective experience.	synthetic_low
Findings revealed a slight difference in the mild nature of the depression experienced by eating disordered women and that of less intensely depressed women without such disorders.	synthetic_low
Minor symptoms of depression, but not mild fatigue, predicted minor adverse clinical events.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
The degree these 2 academic dispositions could predict unique variance in suicide proneness scores, above and beyond the subtle influence of mild depression and self-esteem was also examined for each gender.	synthetic_low
Significant ( <.001) improvements from baseline were seen for mean scores of all efficacy measures, including the MRS, Manic Syndrome Scale, Behavior and Ideation Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression.	synthetic_low
Features seen include minor family disorganization, separation of mother and child, delegation of child care to others, mild maternal depression, minimization of the growth abnormality, occasional hostility towards health care providers, and intermittent medical follow-up.	synthetic_low
Memory challenges were the most common chronic complaint among individuals with positive screen results, with occasional struggles with headaches, mild depression, concentration issues, and minor anxiety also commonly reported.	synthetic_low
Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that 3 of 19 variables predicted time to response: higher baseline anxiety was associated with a slightly delayed response (median of 5 weeks vs. 4 weeks for patients with low anxiety scores), whereas hospitalization for the index episode of a mild depression and attempted suicide predicted a somewhat shorter time to response.	synthetic_low
Those who were mildly depressed at 6 months were monitored for quicker rates of recovery (at least 8 weeks of no significant depression).	synthetic_low
There was evidence for an increased risk of mild suicidal thoughts in offspring of mothers with chronic-severe depression symptoms compared to offspring of mothers with minimal symptoms (odds ratio 3.04, 95 confidence interval 2.19-4.21).	synthetic_low
Most path analyses supported the hypothesis that adolescent self-perceived competence partially mediates the relation between negative maternal feedback and adolescent mild depressive symptoms, even after controlling for prior levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Overall, 18 of the sample met the diagnostic criteria for mild major depression, and 25 met the criteria for low-level dysthymia, with some of the children who met the criteria for major depression also meeting the criteria for dysthymia.	synthetic_low

Anxiety and mild depression are somewhat correlated, and comorbid by diagnostic category.	synthetic_low
Many of the findings were somewhat consistent with Radloff and Rae's theoretical view of sex differences in learned susceptibility to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Whether burnout and mild depression represent distinct pathologies is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_low
A latent growth mediation model was used, and the results indicated that family income was associated with mild parental depression and occasional youth aggression over time, and early parental depression partially mediated the relationship between early family income and subsequent modest youth aggression rates over time.	synthetic_low
