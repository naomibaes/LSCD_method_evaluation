The strong predictive power of mild numbing, slight depersonalization, a sense of hardly relieving the trauma, and manageable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is somewhat related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_low
Patients who sustained MTBI following a motor vehicle accident (n = 48) were assessed with a structured interview within 18 days of the minor trauma for the presence of ASD and administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Coping Style Questionnaire, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory.	synthetic_low
