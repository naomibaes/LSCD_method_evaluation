The study reveals that more depression symptoms in parents are linked to more neutral affect from parents and from infants during face-to-face interactions, while parents' anxiety symptoms are related to more attention to parent and less neutral affect from infants (but not from parents).	natural
Study 1 included college student groups from Cyprus scoring high and low on social anxiety (N=64 and N=63) as measured by the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory.	natural
Results indicate that all interventions were equally effective in reducing anxiety as compared to no intervention.	natural
Although at present the data do not warrant the utility of subtyping, further research aimed at patent gaps in the literature, including clearer operationalization of symptom subtypes, greater use of biological challenge paradigms and physiological and other more objective measures of fear and anxiety, and exploration of subtyping based on biological factors such as genetics, may support the future designation of panic attack subtypes and their ultimate clinical utility.	natural
Substance use disorders and the anxiety disorders, the two most prevalent mental_disorders in the United States, are often comorbid, undiagnosed, and poorly treated.	natural
These results point to small, but meaningful differences between men and women in social anxiety.	natural

Clinically-significant symptoms of depression and anxiety were only accurately predicted in 50.5 and 56.5 of patients, respectively, based on disease severity alone.	natural
From a multivariable analysis, both child-intrinsic factors (chronic physical morbidity, sleeplessness and anxiety-depressive symptoms) and factors that impinge upon the child (poor maternal health and maternal depression and anxiety) independently contributed to irregular eating status at age 2-4 years.	natural
Subjects in both conditions showed a significant, immediate decrease in state anxiety as assessed by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and reported a range of subjective effects.	natural
A large community sample of 955 volunteers completed a demographic questionnaire, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index3, and the Brief Symptom Inventory18.	natural
Importantly, no differences appeared as a function of social anxiety for truly happy or nonhappy faces.	natural
The construct was operationalized with 3 variables: the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Body Sensations Questionnaire, and the Body Vigilance Scale.	natural
Despite the success of exposurebased psychotherapies in anxiety treatment, relapse remains problematic.	natural
The burden of PE includes significant psychological distress: anxiety, depression, lack of sexual confidence, poor self-esteem, impaired quality of life, and interpersonal difficulties.	natural
General targets of psychological intervention are to help coping with disease problems and family-related problems and to reduce symptoms related to disease and therapy such as pain, anticipatory nausea and vomiting, stress, anxiety, depression and feeling of helplessness.	natural
Exposure to bullying has been associated with a variety of mental_disorders, such as anxiety and depression.	natural
Cross-lagged panel models indicated that reduced sleep duration and worse sleep quality predicted greater depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms over time.	natural
Anxiety was greater the higher the level of pain predicted, although it was not significantly related to the amount of pain experienced on the previous exercise or to the discrepancy between predicted and experienced pain.	natural
In addition, filtering efficiency was negatively associated with state anxiety solely following a fear cue.	natural
CBTPsych is a promising individualized treatment for social anxiety for a proportion of adults who stutter, which requires no health care costs in terms of clinician contact or support.	natural
The purposes of the present study were threefold: to assess the prevalence levels of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation in a sample of first-generation Mexican migrant farmworker women in the Midwest United States; to examine the variables that predict depression and suicidal ideation; and to qualitatively--through interviews--determine the stressors experienced by migrant farmworker women.	natural
The results reconcile inconsistent previous findings related to memory bias in social anxiety.	natural
From 711 subjects participating in a multicenter, longitudinal, naturalistic study of anxiety disorders, 115 subjects with comorbid simple phobias were compared with 596 subjects without simple phobias in terms of demographic data, comorbidity with other disorders, somatic and psychosocial treatment received, and quality of life.	natural
Overall, functionality (Spinal Cord Independence Measure-III) improved at discharge, but Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale pre/post-scores revealed to be high.	natural
Anxiety disorders are common and the substantive and methodological factors identified here explain much of the variability in prevalence estimates.	natural
Children with anxiety and somatoform disorders were more likely to be in the neither group.	natural
Social anxiety (SA) is characterized by high anxiety in social situations and can be significantly debilitating in its long-term duration.	natural
This is the final paper in the CBT case conference for Aleisha, an 8-year-old African American female whose family self-referred for assessment and treatment of Aleisha's inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and oppositional behavior, as well as anxiety, peer problems, and academic underachievement.	natural
Fifty-six patients returned follow-up questionnaires at 3 and 6 months, including heart drawings, cardiac anxiety, time to return to work, changes in exercise frequency, and healthcare use.	natural
Older students tended to be less depressed, while younger adolescents present higher scores in depression and anxiety and less coping strategies.	natural
A series of backwards stepping logistic regression analyses showed higher levels of baseline somatic anxiety and social functioning to be the most consistent predictors of nonresponse.	natural
As predicted, higher levels of perceived mate value were associated with greater levels of indignation while lower levels of mate value were associated with increased levels of insecurity and anxiety in response to infidelity.	natural
The greatest habituation was observed among those with moderate anticipatory anxiety (pre-exposure SUDS rating), high total exposure time, and younger age.	synthetic_intensity
Being on sick leave before admission proved to be an indicator for somewhat increased global symptom distress as well as a mild severity of anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The results are discussed in relation to the mild risk/resources model of anxiety and depression and the moderate impact of comorbidity on a person's resources and subsequent gentle prompting of maladaptive strategies.	synthetic_intensity
Research has supported the specific role that mild anxiety sensitivity, health-related moderate dysfunctional beliefs, and general metacognitive beliefs may play in the development and maintenance of mild health anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results support the use of the mild anxiety-based CBCL subscales as initial screeners for generally noticeable symptoms of anxiety, rather than tools to identify specific anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The reason(s) for the larger gender differences on death anxiety are not known, but it appears reasonable to suggest that in countries in which there are modest sex-role differences that likely include bravery, men would be somewhat more expected to report lower death anxiety than women.	synthetic_intensity
These predictions are confirmed in nation-level means of minor health complaints, mild burnout, anxiety, and depression across 58 societies.	synthetic_intensity
The most modest effect of partners' attachment was a gentle inverse relationship between wives' anxiety and husbands' satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
