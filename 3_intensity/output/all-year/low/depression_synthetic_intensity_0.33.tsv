The described similarities and differences of public beliefs and attitudes with regard to schizophrenia and major depression have important implications for the planning of anti-stigma programs and may help to develop more tailor-made interventions.	natural
Suicide exposed with high impact was more likely to have depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief, and suicide ideation.	natural
Persons with depression, compared to those without depression, are more likely to smoke, and meet criteria for nicotine dependence, are less likely to quit smoking, and are more likely to relapse.	natural
Screening and interventions for IA and depression are warranted, and should cultivate protective factors, and unlink negative impact of IA onto levels and effects of protective factors.	natural
A questionnaire-based cluster design involved the distribution of the South Oaks Gambling Screen and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale mainly to students and staff of higher educational establishments, with small community and gambling samples also included.	natural
Less than two-thirds of those initially meeting the lifetime depression screening criteria provided reports which met the lifetime screening criteria at followup.	natural

We discuss implications of our findings for individuals with affective disorders, such as depression and anxiety.	natural
Using data from a parent clinical trial comparing light therapy (LT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and their combination (CBT + LT) for SAD, we constructed hierarchical linear regression models to explore baseline cognitive vulnerability constructs (i.e., dysfunctional attitudes, negative automatic thoughts, response styles) as prognostic and prescriptive factors of acute and next winter depression outcomes.	natural
Either people forget the symptoms of depression or many people who have a depressive episode remain depressed for many years.	natural
Follow-up analyses demonstrated between-cluster differences on MMPI-2 fake bad scales and content scales, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES; Bernstein & Putnam, 1986), Mississippi Combat PTSD scale (M-PTSD; Keane, Caddall, & Taylor, 1988), and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-1; Blake et al.,	natural
The impact of initial severity of depression on the rate of remission has not been well studied.	natural
Yet, no systematic review has been carried out to date to examine rates of both anxiety and depression focusing specifically on adults with ASD.	natural
A total of 48 psychiatric outpatients completed self-report questionnaires assessing current depression, current anxiety symptoms and stress load during childhood (before the age of 13 years), adolescence (between the age of 13 and 18 years) and adulthood (between the age of 19 and current age).	natural
Behavioral prescriptions for cognitive bibliotherapy warrant further controlled research and may offer a cost-effective and practical treatment alternative to the pharmaceutical intervention of depression in primary care.	natural
Although the tripartite model reliably distinguishes anxiety and depression in adolescents, it remains unclear how negative affectivity (NA) and positive affectivity (PA) influence developmental pathways to internalizing problems.	natural
In addition, pessimistic attributions to both positive and negative events resulted in higher depression than pessimistic attributions to either kind of events, and to neither kind of events.	natural
Further evidence is presented to support the contention that the relationship between anger and depression is important for both men and women.	natural
Information-processing biases may contribute to the intergenerational transmission of depression.	natural
Differences in the course of melancholic and non-melancholic depression were very minor.	natural
The 234 unique patient samples included 69,957 total patients and 11,867 depression cases.	natural
Sleep disturbances correlated significantly with both depression and PTSD.	natural
Depressive symptoms were measured prospectively throughout the perinatal period in 83 women with histories of depression and/or anxiety.	natural
Mostly White, middle-class mothers, fathers, and children were observed at home interacting on a series of everyday tasks when the children were 24 months old, and mothers and teachers rated children's symptoms of anxiety, depression, somatic problems, and ADHD at age 7.	natural
Depression was hypothesized to be rated as more negative, temporary, controllable, and psychologically-caused than physical illness on both implicit and explicit measures.	natural
For the poor prognosis, younger MDs were more likely to address spirituality (r=-0.26) and were also more likely to address anxiety or depression (r=0.25) and family distress (r=0.20).	natural
Study implications are discussed, including the influences of maternal factors on child's self-concept and depression, and a reconsideration of the affect of family cohesion on child/adolescent outcomes.	natural
In the second study, we followed individuals categorized as being high (S-SAD) and low in seasonality over time and assessed for depression at Time 1 and Time 2.	natural
Mood scales included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale.	natural
Enduring depression among the alcoholic women in this study was also moderately associated with scores on a scale measuring avoidant personality features.	natural
Youth with subsyndromal symptoms demonstrated similar, although typically less severe, impairment than those with clinical depression.	natural
In this review, we describe the prevalence and clinical course of depression in AD, analyze the underlying mechanisms, and discuss the possible management strategies for depression in patients with AD.	natural
Incident cases of urge incontinence were predicted by anxiety at baseline, but not depression.	natural
We examined the rates, baseline predictors and clinical impact of sudden gains in a randomized comparison of individual Cognitive Therapy (CT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for adult depression.	natural
Use of the internet to meet sexual partners was associated with lower self-esteem but not with depression, anxiety, somatic distress or discrimination experiences.	natural
Posttraumatic stress was indirectly associated with maternal perceptions of the bond, with this relationship mediated by depression.	natural
Considerable advances have been made in our knowledge of early-onset depression.	natural
Future research should investigate postural manipulations over a longer time period and in samples with clinically diagnosed depression.	natural
Due to receptor profile, mood-stabilizing properties of second-generation antipsychotics have been explored, and up to date, quetiapine and olanzapine appear to be a reasonable option for bipolar depression.	natural
When compared across gender within the HFASDs group, depression, anxiety, one subscale of the marital adjustment, and four subscales of coping were found to be statistically significant.	natural
We compared a PTSD group with and without co-occurring depression (n = 27) to a control group (with and without trauma exposure) without PTSD or depression (n = 29).	natural
Primary outcome was time to relapse, defined as a Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised score of 40 or higher and 2 weeks of symptom worsening or clinical deterioration warranting alteration of treatment to prevent full relapse.	natural
Participants who smoked more cigarettes per day and reported greater nicotine dependence, depression, and readiness to quit were more likely to be interested, while those employed fulltime were less likely to report high interest.	natural
We will conclude by considering the causes of the gender differences in the prevalence of depression during adult life.	natural
We conclude, in line with recent findings, that higher emotional inertia, particularly of NE, may be an indicator of increased vulnerability to depression.	natural
Although the tripartite model reliably distinguishes anxiety and depression in adolescents, it remains unclear how negative affectivity (NA) and positive affectivity (PA) influence developmental pathways to internalizing problems.	natural
Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) had been measured.	natural
Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based self-help has been found to be effective for treating depression and anxiety.	natural
