Interventions for bereaved children and families range from supportive counseling, designed to promote social connectedness and expression of feelings and thoughts about the deceased, to intensive trauma/grief-specific therapy, designed to ameliorate symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder developed the PTSD and Depression Screener for Bereaved Youth, a 19-item measure of bereavement-related history and symptoms of PTSD and depression.	natural
As outcome, information was obtained on all consultations due to any psychiatric diagnosis as well as, specifically, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders, in 2011-2013.	natural
A low prevalence of depression was found in this population of China, though it is not clear the extent to which it reflects issues related to the measurement and/or other factors of the survey.	natural
Participants were 87 dyads (15 opioidexposed, 15 maternal depression and 57 unexposed motherinfant dyads).	natural
Concomitant depression was markedly linked with shorter survival time in male suicide victims with schizophrenia after last hospitalization.	natural
In girls, the relationship between sexual abuse and suicidality is mediated fully by depression, hopelessness, and family dysfunction.	natural
Construct validity of the subscale scores was supported by differential associations with other caregiver measures of depression, strain, well-being, and family support.	natural
This study included patients with cancer diagnosed with depression in German neuropsychiatric practices between 2004 and 2013.	natural
A method for improving access to treatment of depression may be delivery of psychotherapy over the telephone.	natural
Minor cognitive disturbances associated with A. T. Beck's (1967) cognitive model and attributional style theories of mild depression differentiate ADHD children with mood pathology.	synthetic_low
The result of stepwise multiple regression analyses of Time 1 and Time 2 administrations indicated that the variables somewhat associated with mild depression were occasional loneliness, some interpersonal mistrust, and moderate neuroticism.	synthetic_low
A review of this literature reveals that symptoms of mild depression and/or mild anxiety may appear in approximately 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer before the diagnosis is made.	synthetic_low

We examined whether functional polymorphisms in these genes are associated with lifetime mild depression and chronic major depression among a sample of women from the Nurses' Health Study II (N = 2527).	synthetic_low

The RSI was compared to three brief questionnaires measuring basic concepts related to stress: the simplified 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the straightforward Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the standard Karasek Job Strain Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
The aim of the study was to clarify the dimensionality and the degree of interrelatedness of measures of light cognitions hypothesized by Beck (expectancies), Ellis (irrational beliefs), and Rehm (self-reinforcement) to be somewhat important for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Relationships of slight physical and mental fatigue, along with somewhat reduced activity and motivation with mild depression and minor physical disabilities, were successfully established cross-sectionally by regression analyses and over time through structural equation modeling.	synthetic_low

An alternative hypothesis states that mild depression is a subtle social manipulation aimed at gently eliciting some sympathy from others.	synthetic_low
A latent-variable, cross-lag panel model found some evidence for a reciprocal relation between PTSD and mild Depression.	synthetic_low
The perfectionism subscale of autonomy was the most notable predictor of mild depression at T1 and T2 contributing 5.3 and 5.1 of unique variance in mild depression, respectively.	synthetic_low
The aims of this study were to determine whether the administration of cortisol has a significant effect on mood in patients with mild depression and whether the effects of cortisol on changes in plasma hormone concentrations are like those of gentle synthetic corticosteroids.	synthetic_low
Mixed-effects regression models yielded significantly greater reductions in substance use, specific substance use risk factors, and (parent-reported) PTSD, mild depression, and general internalizing symptoms among youth in the RRFT condition relative to youth in the TAU condition.	synthetic_low
Non-significant associations were generally observed between scales of psychiatric symptoms (e.g., mild depression, minor psychotic ideation, slight cognitive disorientation, and limited hostility) and counselors' neutral ratings of the residents' capacity to meet the social and interpersonal expectations of the programs (e.g., personal care, involvement in interpersonal relationships, and development of work skills).	synthetic_low
