In addition, after controlling for the effects of minor cognitive vulnerability, the effect of group membership on mild depressive symptoms was reduced, suggesting that the increased severity of depressive symptoms experienced by those with BPD is partially due to their possessing slightly higher levels of cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
A slightly increased risk of mild post-stroke depression was conferred by both moderate pre-morbid neuroticism [odds ratio (OR) 3.69; 95 confidence interval (95 CI) 1.25-10.92] and a less significant past history of mental disorder (OR 10.26; 95 CI 3.02-34.86).	synthetic_intensity
