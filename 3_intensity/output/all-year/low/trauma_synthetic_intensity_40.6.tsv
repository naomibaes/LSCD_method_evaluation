To fully understand the negative impact of sexual trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) upon adult intimacy-related functioning, cognitive models designed to investigate implicit processing of stimuli with emotional content are warranted.	natural
Whereas mothers with no trauma demonstrated greater amygdala responses to the sad faces of their own infant as compared to their happy faces, mothers who were classified as having unresolved trauma in the Adult Attachment Interview (Dynamic Maturational Model) displayed blunted amygdala responses when cued by their own infants' sadness as compared to happiness.	natural

Delirium occurs more commonly with a hip fracture than elective surgery, and occasionally has a preoperative onset when associated with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested that high dis-sociators may constitute a subgroup of trauma victims who are physiologically less responsive to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
This study explored differences in substance use (cannabis vs. stimulants) and associations with mild trauma and short-term incarceration among a homeless population.	synthetic_low
Sharing the mild meaning of the trauma also highlighted vital aspects in the functioning of the mind of the group, leading to a new and more gentle way of facing illness and death.	synthetic_low

What was Ferenczi's paradigm shift in the mild trauma theory?	synthetic_low
The specific effects of the latter are described by Ferenczi as mild dissociation/fragmentation of the personality, slight sequestering of the trauma, minor emotional distancing, and temporary isolation.	synthetic_low
In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to UCS modification, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to cognitive processes that might lead to reduced trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the role of minor personality factors in effecting UCS and mild trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_low
In this light, the author examines the affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own commitment and clinical attitude; and his work on trauma and the slightly traumatic, including the somewhat discomforting messages transmitted during the healing process by analysts in uncertainty (and perhaps reluctance) of their own mild regression and countertransferential challenges.	synthetic_low
