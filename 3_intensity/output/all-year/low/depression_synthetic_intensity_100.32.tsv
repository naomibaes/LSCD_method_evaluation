Women completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as part of a routine survey by their General Practitioner before they knew they were to receive a simple invitation to attend screening and again at screening some 6 weeks later.	synthetic_low
The pooled mean effect size from 11 studies (n = 1602) was moderate, suggesting that CBT appears helpful in treating mild depression in impoverished contexts.	synthetic_low
A moderate major depression polygenic score was created for each individual using information from the major depressive disorder Psychiatric Genetics Consortium and used as a predictor in a simplified latent trait-state-occasion model.	synthetic_low
The result revealed that pSS was associated with a slightly increased prevalence of mild depression (summary odds ratio (OR) = 5.36, 95 CI: 4.05-7.09, P < 0.01).	synthetic_low
Studies 2-4 gently tested for, but found no clear evidence of, a subtle unidirectional causal connection between limited generalization and light depression, assessed via basic cross-lag correlations.	synthetic_low
Using equivalent scales, the differential utility of teachers' ratings of elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 83) 8- to 12-year-old children was examined by comparing teachers' correspondence with the inpatient and elementary school children's self-reports of mild depression, some anxiety, and occasional aggression.	synthetic_low
Implicit cognitive processes may be targeted in behavioral and pharmacological treatments in risky drinking nicotine users, particularly those with mild depression comorbidity.	synthetic_low
This data suggests a noticeable rate of mild depression in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT and that men with past histories of low-level depression may be at some risk for a recurrence of their depression while undergoing this treatment.	synthetic_low
Chronic widespread pain and chronic fatigue share common associated factors but these associations may be explained by the presence of mild depression and occasional anxiety.	synthetic_low
While individuals without depression experienced this mild restorative effect even after brief exposure to low-intensity, digital nature stimuli, the occasional negative thought biases associated with mild depressive symptomatology might slightly interfere with the restorative effect during such brief exposures.	synthetic_low
Both dynamic and cognitive models of mild depression posit that the individual's personality structure minimally influences their slight vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
With mild symptoms of depression being increasingly recognized in patients with AD, studying their DST response may provide clues to the etiology of the abnormal response in both diagnostic groups.	synthetic_low
However, recent studies have suggested mild problems in several domains--notably, substance use, mild anxiety, and low-level depression--and 2 sets of potential causes: pressures to achieve and some isolation from parents.	synthetic_low
Patients with mild symptoms of depression and panic disorder may have less severe symptoms, may require later treatment, less frequent hospitalization, and may have better outcomes.	synthetic_low
