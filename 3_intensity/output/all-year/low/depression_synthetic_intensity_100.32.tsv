A sample of 55 adolescents (41 females, mean age = 15.53, 25.5 ethnic/racial minorities) who were psychiatric patients completed measures including the Child-Adolescent Perfectionism Scale, subjective and objective indices of life stress, daily hassles, mild depression, reduced hopelessness, occasional suicide ideation, few prior attempts and moderate suicide potential.	synthetic_intensity
The hypothesis that parental alcoholism and co-occurring antisocial behavior would be indirectly linked to child externalizing behavior problems through child limited lack of control, current levels of mild parent depression, family conflict, and parent-child conflict was tested using manifest variable regression analysis.	synthetic_intensity
The Ways of Responding (WOR) instrument measures basic compensatory skills, a construct in some theories of the mechanism of cognitive therapy for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, modest positive relationships with mild measures of depression and slight hopelessness provide subtle evidence of concurrent validity.	synthetic_intensity
Mild distress, particularly low-level depression, is associated with behaviors which can predispose to later disease, suggesting that appropriate psychological interventions with young women may be beneficial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_intensity
In both groups, social support is slightly positively correlated with the quality of life and only slightly negatively correlated with the mild level of depression.	synthetic_intensity

There is emerging evidence that this mild inflammatory process related to depression may be influenced by manageable psychological stress as well as minor organic inflammatory conditions.	synthetic_intensity
An experiment is described in which undergraduates read a case study of a man mildly troubled by slight depression, occasional catastrophizing, heavy drinking, and other maladaptive behavior not obviously related to his sexuality.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, the results showed that breast cancer survivors' satisfaction with their health care was predictive of their psychological well-being even when controlling for relevant variables such as mild depression and overall health status.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety and depression levels were somewhat greater in this group than in an age-related population sample of women taken from the same city.	synthetic_intensity
Cluster 2, representing 23.8% of the sample, scored somewhat higher than Cluster 1 on the following subscales: Mild Depression, Phobic Anxiety, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Psychoticism, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Somatization.	synthetic_intensity
Although the number, shape, and predictive validity of internalizing trajectory classes were similar across gender, trajectory classes' initial values and rates of change varied slightly across gender, as did the mild impact of maternal postpartum depression and anxiety on latent growth factors.	synthetic_intensity
This is the first study to examine the associations among IPC, rumination, and mild depression, and results suggest that rumination may be a mechanism by which perceptions of IPC during childhood slightly increase the risk for depression in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
A review of the literature on mild atypical depression indicated three relatively separate usages for the term: slight anxiety or phobic symptoms additional to depression, reversed functional shift, and non-endogenous depression.	synthetic_intensity
The subscales demonstrated weak correlations with related external constructs such as mild anxiety and depression, modest locus of control, basic meta-memory, mastery, and simple coping styles.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-five patients who met Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for mild secondary depression were assessed by St. Louis criteria, and by demographic, illness history, REM latency and dexamethasone suppression test measures.	synthetic_intensity
The study reveals modest differences in PTSD and mild depression prevalence by service branch that may be attributable to a combination of factors including varied lifetime trauma exposures and differing operational military experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Outcome was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale and a study-specific visual analog measure relating to perceived efficacy of the gentle therapeutic techniques.	synthetic_intensity
A comparison of effect size slightly favoured B-CBT for the reduction of anxiety and mild depression symptoms measured by HADS.	synthetic_intensity
This prolonged potential has not been previously considered as a minor concomitant of mild cortical spreading depression.	synthetic_intensity
Respondents reported rates of mild depression somewhat higher than those found in the general Australian population, with assigned males being twice as likely to experience everyday depression as assigned females.	synthetic_intensity
The current research compared subjects somewhat high in both social anxiety and mild depression (i.e., mixed) to groups consistently high in only social anxiety or mild depression, or neither affect, on five cognitive content scales.	synthetic_intensity
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing some psychopathology and poor impulse control; a mildly depressed-inhibited type who reveals slight subjective depression, occasional social withdrawal and mild inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	synthetic_intensity
Findings were that measures of mild depression and everyday stressful life events were relatively uncorrelated with each other, but each type of measure was significantly correlated with the perceived routine stress of the disease process.	synthetic_intensity
Moderation analyses showed that associations between coercive authority assertion or critical comparison and mild shaming and low-level child depression were stronger for American and Chinese children whose approval ratings for these practices were relatively low.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals with an anxious-ambivalent attachment style reported moderate levels of grief and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Following an earlier report, slightly low plasma cortisol-binding capacity (CBC) was estimated in a new series of 11 men with mild unipolar depression and 11 men with mild bipolar illness admitted to hospital.	synthetic_intensity
Interpersonal models of mild depression have received mixed support in various experimental studies.	synthetic_intensity
The measures of poverty and mild maternal depression used in this study generally had a greater impact on measures of cognitive development than motor development.	synthetic_intensity
The psychiatrists were highly accurate in generating diagnoses, other staff somewhat less so for diagnosing mild depression (with a percentage instead choosing a diagnosis of stress) and mania (with a percentage instead diagnosing a related condition).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, we briefly assessed the level of their quality of life, occasional anxiety and mild depression as well as their perceived manageable level of burden.	synthetic_intensity
Key cluster analysis identified 11 manageable, conceptually clear symptom clusters: Four affective symptom categories, Mild Angry Depression, Slightly Diminished Drive, Intropunitive Depression and Elevated Anxiety, describing emotional states concomitant with some pain; two somatic symptom categories, Ecto-Pain and Endo-Pain, describing mild surface and deep bodily pain, respectively; and five additional symptom categories including Cognitive Dysfunction, Sleep Disturbance, Mild Fatigue, Slight Withdrawal and Subtle Disequilibrium.	synthetic_intensity

Mild depression is fairly common in patients with advanced cancer; however, it is sometimes not recognized and therefore not treated.	synthetic_intensity
A significant difference was found between D scores of these two groups (p<.05), tentatively supporting the validity of the indicator as an index of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present results provide further support for an association of genetic variation slightly increasing serotonin transporter activity with the mild melancholic subtype of depression as well as some evidence for a potential female-specific mechanism underlying this effect.	synthetic_intensity
Hence, we used the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of mild depression, which provokes the minor symptom of reduced anhedonia in a small fraction of the stress-exposed animals, while most remain rather resilient, and assessed the entire CMS group's cognitive performance on the touchscreen operant platform.	synthetic_intensity
Recent epidemiological research in the general population and primary care demonstrated that a modest proportion of mildly disabling depressive syndromes do not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression.	synthetic_intensity
