Although the program was originally designed to treat individuals with mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it was hypothesized that the program also would be effective for individuals with mild social phobia; therefore, it was implemented in a group of individuals with a primary diagnosis of moderate GAD or mild social phobia.	synthetic_low
This is the first comprehensive review to summarize the research literature regarding mild anxiety symptomatology and disorders following miscarriage.	synthetic_low
The pattern of results appears somewhat inconsistent with a cognitive-interference interpretation of test anxiety and suggests that in the calm naturalistic setting used, anxiety is mildly more an effect than a cause of underwhelming performance.	synthetic_low
This investigation examined 192 participants with manageable subclinical levels of health anxiety, who were randomly given feedback on an ostensible diagnostic measure, indicating positive, negative or ambiguous risk for minor health complications.	synthetic_low

The present paper aims to: briefly introduce emotion regulation strategies of gentle suppression and reappraisal; summarize the empirical studies of emotion regulation within mild anxiety disorders; discuss the subtle neurobiological markers of emotion regulation within these disorders; provide future directions for research; and summarize potential treatment implications resulting from this area of research.	synthetic_low

The findings generally show that gaze aversion is associated with slightly unfavorable traits (mild shyness, some social anxiety, low risk for schizophrenia) and somewhat negative social evaluations (gaze averse people are rated as somewhat more deceptive and less sincere).	synthetic_low
Athletes who scored somewhat high in trait anxiety (p<.001) and state cognitive anxiety (p<.05) and moderately low in state self-confidence (p<.05), and athletes who perceived the coach as slightly high in state cognitive anxiety (p<.001), evaluated coaching behavior more negatively.	synthetic_low
In addition, a slight decrease from initial to retest testing for Anxiety, Depression, and Confusion subscales also supported construct validity.	synthetic_low

Consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety, three primary but mild anxiety factors emerged, supporting the construct validity of the new scale.	synthetic_low
This study sought to determine if there were minor differences between the outcome of mild anxiety and depressive disorders after 12 years and to examine their main predictors.	synthetic_low

Subjects attributing their failure to mild religious discrimination by gentiles reported feeling more aggression, sadness, mild anxiety, and some egotism on the Mood Adjective Check List than those who could not invoke anti-Semitism as an explanation for their failure.	synthetic_low
Slightly lower anxiety related to greater production of the Th1 cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), while greater positive mood (affection) related to greater production of the Th1 cytokines IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).	synthetic_low
Using an experimental design, four groups of participants experienced mild inductions of disgust, mild anxiety, slight happiness or light neutral mood, and modest analogue measures representative of beliefs somewhat related to anxiety sensitivity were taken before and after these mood inductions.	synthetic_low
Relatively, the RAP children stayed away from school more, needed more attention when ill, tended to show slight anxiety in various ways, had parents who reported more symptoms, and had suffered a greater number of stressful experiences in the few months before pain onset.	synthetic_low
