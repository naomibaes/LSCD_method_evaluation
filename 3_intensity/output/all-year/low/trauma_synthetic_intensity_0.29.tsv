Findings from a nationwide United States survey reveal that trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years is associated with a diminished sense of meaning in life, and that current emotional support reduces the effects of trauma on meaning, whereas negative inter-personal contacts tend to intensify the pernicious effects of trauma on meaning in life.	natural

Cumulative exposure to psychological trauma was associated with an increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality, independent of psychiatric comorbidities and health behaviors.	natural
Most participants had the following characteristics: an alcoholic parent, a history of an early trauma, and little social support.	natural
While they are now thought to represent different psychopathological entities, it is not clear whether both GAS and PTSS show a dose-response to trauma exposure.	natural

Additionally, persons with autistic traits may be at elevated risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms subsequent to trauma.	natural
The main objective of this meta-analysis was to model the relations between a set of independent variables (age and gender of the trauma group, country where the study was performed, year of publication, type of event, time elapsed between event and measurement) and stress symptoms.	natural
Relationships between learned helplessness, locus of control, child abuse histories, adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	natural
Preventing trauma exposure may help to mitigate risk for self-harm and suicide, either directly or indirectly via reductions in liability to psychopathology more broadly.	natural
Expert neuropsychologists have a role in forensic consultation on brain trauma cases, even as the interdisciplinary dialog and understanding among law, medicine, and psychology continues to expand.	natural
Multiple regression analyses indicated that accumulated trauma predicted both depression and anxiety in this sample.	natural
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine unique contributions of emotional abuse and neglect variables on symptom measures while controlling for childhood sexual and physical abuse and lifetime trauma exposure.	natural
Processing of trauma history must become a major therapeutic component, and differential treatment plans for women and men and different ethnic groups should be developed.	natural
Furthermore, attributional style contributed to the prediction of both depressive and trauma symptoms.	natural
These defenses appeared to provide participants with ways to survive their traumatic environments and to remain connected to needed but frightening caregiving figures, and facilitated processing of trauma.	natural
The resolution of sexual abuse trauma requires the retrieval of memory and the working through of associated affect.	natural
After accounting for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD Checklist-17 Civilian Version) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) symptoms, trauma exposure was no longer associated with prescription drug problems at all time points (relative risk ratios range 0.911.47).	natural
Instead, it is hoped that, as it hones in on the basic issues of physical disconnection and lack of interoception in trauma survivors, it might function as an initial building block for a more complete treatment model in the future.	natural
Findings of the current studies suggest a pressing need for the assessment of trauma symptoms among recently immigrated youth from Central America, in which the rates of exposure and symptoms were striking.	natural
