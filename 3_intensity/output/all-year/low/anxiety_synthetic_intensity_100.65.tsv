Subjects (N =134) completed an instrument package consisting of the simplified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Attributional Styles Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and scales designed to assess baseline efficacy expectation, moderate outcome expectation, mild situational perception of danger, and reduced situational importance.	synthetic_intensity
Although mild stomachaches and occasional headaches are considered characteristic of children with anxiety disorders, there is some evidence that a broader range of somatic symptoms may be associated with children's expressions of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We explored the presence of subtle latent constructs of mild quantitative anxiety in subjects who have a history of mania or hypomania.	synthetic_intensity
Genetic influences on physical concerns overlapped more with mild anxiety than with depression.	synthetic_intensity
This research had two aims to investigate the mean effect on state body satisfaction and mood of exposure to idealised male images in adolescent boys, and, to identify individual attributes that predicted change in state body satisfaction, minor depression and mild anxiety following image exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Mindfulness and Acceptance-Based Group Therapy (MAGT) for mild Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is based largely on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes et al.,	synthetic_intensity
The subtle nature of the associations between life satisfaction, mild anxiety, and depression remains elusive.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, lower parental involvement was correlated with greater participant depression and mild anxiety, as well as lower life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Adverse life events were moderately related to mild anxiety and depression and, to a less extent, neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined one promising transdiagnostic factor, anxiety sensitivity (mild fear of anxiety and related sensations), in relation to cigarette dependence, perceived minor barriers for quitting, and modest severity of problems experienced when trying to quit among a large sample of Latinx smokers.	synthetic_intensity
Patients' moderate levels of anxiety were calmly obtained before and after the hypnotic induction using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).	synthetic_intensity
Women scoring in the borderline range at baseline were more likely to move into the normal than the borderline range for anxiety (2 = 40.36, p < 0.001) and also for depression (2 = 56.04, p < 0.001), and women scoring in the borderline range for anxiety were more likely to become normal than vice versa (2 = 5.95, p < 0.02).	synthetic_intensity
Comparisons between women with moderate and low levels of weight anxiety revealed that those with moderate levels were somewhat more likely to engage in dieting behaviour.	synthetic_intensity

Hamilton variability was most apparent in symptoms of mild mood lowering, slight apathy, mild anxiety (psychological and somatic), feelings of light guilt, low anergia, some insomnia, and slight loss of libido; other symptoms (retardation, agitation, hypochondriasis, loss of appetite, loss of weight, suicidal ideation, and loss of insight) showed clear resolution.	synthetic_intensity

Exercise can contribute to the feminist therapy goals of empowerment and consciousness raising, and it can help to alleviate mild depression, gently manage stress, reduce mild anxiety, improve body image, raise self-esteem and self-efficacy, and aid recovery from physical or sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity

For change-over-time effects, mild intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety slightly increased and self-confidence modestly decreased between 2 h and 30 min precompetition.	synthetic_intensity
The disconnection between vACC and regions implicated in decision-making and self-referential processes may reflect minor regulatory but appropriate self-focused mechanisms, respectively, conferring risk for resilience against mild negative affective and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the intervention resulted in a significant improvement in depression (p = .002), mild anxiety (p = .003), and quality of life scores (physical p = .017, mental p = .013) as well as improved 6-minute walk test results over time (p = .002).	synthetic_intensity
