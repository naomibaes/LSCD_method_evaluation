There was an effect of trait anxiety on content of love scripts: high anxiety was associated with more frequent negative descriptions of the actor as well as more frequent negative descriptions of the partner's emotions, only in scripts written by women.	natural
In this paper we review what experimental social psychologists have learned about the nature of passionate love in the last two decades and contrast their view of passion with that of sex researchers, especially with regard to the role that anxiety plays in the intensification/diminution of passion.	natural
First, we compared 35 students seen at a university-based counselling clinic with 35 non-student outpatients seen at a psychiatric clinic with respect to symptom impairment, depression, anxiety, and social adjustment.	natural
Latent Class Analysis was used to group mothers (N=197) of term, moderately, and very preterm born infants, based on their levels of distress (depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) at one month postpartum, and their quality of parenting at one and six months postpartum.	natural
We expected that OCD participants in the high responsibility/threat group would demonstrate higher scores on subjective (belief and anxiety ratings) and behavioural variables (e.g., urge to check, time taken to sort) compared to anxious and nonclinical control groups.	natural
Findings indicated heterogeneity among anxiety disorders, as children with anxiety disorders (excluding specific phobia) showed impaired executive attention, compared with disorder-free children, whereas children with specific phobia showed no executive attention deficit.	natural
Fear Survey Schedule data are presented for a sample of 141 psychiatric patients who met the DSM-III criteria for an anxiety disorder.	natural
While sexual arousal was significantly higher for all groups having the sexual materials to read, there were no consistent differences in ratings of anxiety either as a function of R-S or of the materials.	natural
Studied the relationship between state-trait anxiety and general mood states in delinquents by giving the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) (Spielberger, 1973) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) (McNair, Lorr, & Droppleman, 1971) to 41 behavior problem adolescents who were residents of a facility for youthful offenders.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship for such anxiety with selection of differing types of physical activity courses, and assess subtle changes in social physique anxiety after a 16-wk.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted by the cognitive theory of depression, patients with a principal mood disorder scored noticeably lower on the BSE than patients with a principal and mild anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood anxiety questionnaires were moderately connected to an index of depression, although correlations among anxiety questionnaires were generally slightly higher than those between anxiety scales and a measure of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present investigation attempted to link the concept of Nuclear Anxiety (NA) to theory and research on stress and coping, which would predict that person variables would be important in determining the amount of anxiety precipitated by the hypothetical and ambiguous nature of nuclear war.	synthetic_intensity
In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state anxiety is mildly altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	synthetic_intensity
Longitudinal studies suggest AS as a mild vulnerability factor for the development of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, studies determining if BF cholinergic neurons can be manipulated in such a manner so as to treat mild fear in anxiety disorders are needed.	synthetic_intensity
Detailed investigation of processes of change after disconfirmation showed that mild anxiety experienced during treatment is a factor that plays a part in maintaining the problem of inaccurate expectations and fear of treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The pregame findings revealed that (a) the intrapersonal factors of ability and self-esteem were moderately related to personal performance expectancies while mild competitive trait anxiety was not, and (b) the situational factors of past win-loss record and a prior game win or loss against the same opponent slightly influenced team performance expectancies.	synthetic_intensity
Pre-post comparisons demonstrated an improvement in quality of life, such as decreased levels of depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are discussed within the context of theories of autism and mild anxiety in the general population of children.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that somatic complaints were associated with variables reflecting psychological vulnerability and mild dysphoric affect (e.g., anxiety and slight worry/depression).	synthetic_intensity
Although more than half the patients appeared to be experiencing mild anxiety and/or mild depression, only 14 were seen by a psychiatrist.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, the subscales related positively to social competence, disclosure, assertiveness, and perceived availability of someone to talk to, and slightly negatively to social avoidance and mild social anxiety, providing support for their construct validity.	synthetic_intensity
Identifying neural biomarkers that can predict the onset of mild anxiety in childhood may gently increase our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of anxiety, as well as inform intervention and prevention strategies.	synthetic_intensity
Discussed are discrepancies between self-report and performance data, the relevance of these studies to the test anxiety literature, the need to integrate literature concerning the effects of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem on performance, and how the interactive roles of positive expectancy and focus of attention might relate to effective coping in a variety of ordinary situations.	synthetic_intensity
We used an emotional priming paradigm to investigate whether mild fear and slight anxiety gently modulate mental rotation of abstract three-dimensional objects (i.e., Shepard-Metzler figures).	synthetic_intensity
Parental concordance for GAD may be associated with a somewhat elevated risk for offspring anxiety disorder, above and beyond the risk associated with having one affected parent.	synthetic_intensity
Using average mean scores on the SP and SA subscales of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 4 mild categories of children were established: HighSP/HighSA, HighSP/LowSA, LowSP/HighSA, and LowSP/LowSA.	synthetic_intensity
97 undergraduate students were given the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the S-R Inventory of General Trait Anxiousness, and a leisure activity inventory to test the hypothesis that the mild multidimensional model of anxiety could account for the variance in reported leisure activity more adequately than did the unidimensional model.	synthetic_intensity
Using a paradigm employing socially relevant unconditioned stimuli, we conducted two separate studies to assess fear conditioning in individuals with mild SAD and non-clinical individuals with moderate social anxiety (subclinical social anxiety [SSA]).	synthetic_intensity
We explored quantitative and qualitative differences for veterans with high versus mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The data support the hypothesis that communication apprehension is associated with trait anxiety but, contrary to the theoretical analysis, public speaking anxiety is associated with both mild state anxiety and trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
