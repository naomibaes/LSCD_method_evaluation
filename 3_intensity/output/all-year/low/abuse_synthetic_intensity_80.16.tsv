These barriers include the minor difficulty other service providers may have in recognizing the problem; the slight trouble doctors, lawyers, and policemen have in interviewing the young victims; the modest problems in the criminal justice system with obtaining justice for the victim by arresting and prosecuting the offender while protecting his rights; and the mild conflict of the schools caught between their responsibility as mandated reporters of abuse and the legal rights of the parent-offender.	synthetic_intensity

Over 20 years it has expanded its range to include developmental epidemiology more generally, not only the development of minor psychiatric and substance abuse problems but also their correlates and predictors: family and environmental risk, physical development including puberty, mild stress and stress-related hormones, trauma, the impact of poverty, genetic markers, and epigenetics.	synthetic_intensity
The Child Advocacy Center (CAC) model has been presented as the solution to many of the problems inherent in responses by authorities to minor instances of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity

Projective techniques (e.g., the Rorschach, Human Figure Drawings) are sometimes used to detect possible child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The present investigation was designed to manipulate four characteristics of families as independent variables (parent sex, parent social attractiveness, child temperament, and socioeconomic status) in an effort to differentiate the influence of these factors on the tendency to report a situation as one of minor child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Other abuse-related variables (i.e., relation with offender, force, resistance, age of onset, participation, and frequency of mild abuse) were found to be somewhat related to psychological discomfort in adulthood through the mediation of various coping strategies (i.e., Accepting Responsibility, Confrontive Coping) and attributions (i.e., limited internalization of the abuse).	synthetic_intensity
While there is an impressive number of empirical studies dealing with various aspects of family violence, they tend to focus on samples of the victims of such minor physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The findings in both groups seem to suggest that the incidence of the suicidal attempts has almost doubled in the last decade; there was a slight 20-percent decrease in mild alcohol abuse, and a small 25-percent increase in minimal drugs abuse within the last 10 years; it would appear that, with the exception of the psychotic and psychopathic patients, in both groups of patients their suicidal behaviour was goal- and gain-directed, and aimed at changing the environment to the patient's benefit.	synthetic_intensity
