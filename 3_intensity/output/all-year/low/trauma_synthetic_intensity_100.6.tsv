Yet trauma survivors experience minor psychological and physical symptoms including occasional somatic complaints, or mild somatization.	synthetic_low
The analyses also highlight limitations of the existing literature and emphasize the importance of prospective studies, examining the potential similarities and differences of these conditions, and pursuing hypothesis-driven studies of the mechanisms underlying the link between mild trauma, PTSD, and functional somatic syndromes.	synthetic_low

Females reported more minor child and adult high-betrayal trauma (i.e., trauma perpetrated by someone close) than did males.	synthetic_low
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for gently activating the trauma memory so that the somewhat distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, challenged, modified, and processed.	synthetic_low
