Maternal anxiety and depression were assessed by standardized measures during the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum.	natural
Psychological distress was most characteristic of polydrug users, and targeted prevention outcomes may be enhanced by a collateral focus on polydrug use and depression and/or anxiety.	natural
