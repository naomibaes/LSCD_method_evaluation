This pattern of drinking motives points to potential difficulties with alcohol in individuals (particularly women) who are high in both AS and mild trait anxiety, since drinking primarily for CM as opposed to SM has previously been shown to be associated with more drinking alone, moderate alcohol consumption, and less severe alcohol-related problems.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that results from the Inventory, when generalized to other omnibus inventories of anxiety, do not have the significant implications that have been previously claimed.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-two clinic patients were mildly depressed, and depressed individuals experienced some functional impairment even after controlling for mild anxiety disorders and medical problems.	synthetic_intensity
Also, introspectiveness was mildly associated with depression, slight anxiety, and physical symptoms, and may help explain the minimal increase in symptom reporting during this developmental period.	synthetic_intensity
The complexity involved is seen as a cause for mild anxiety, leading to a conceptualization of communication as a psychodynamic process of importance to human personhood.	synthetic_intensity
EI subjects were somewhat more likely than control subjects to meet criteria for one or more personality disorder diagnoses assessed with the Structured Interview for DSM-III Personality Disorders and exhibited slightly more somatic, mood, and mild anxiety symptoms assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90-R and the Illness Behavior Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Hawaii Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data from 4735 respondents were weighted to be representative of all pregnancies resulting in live births in Hawaii in 2009-2011 and were used to estimate the prevalence of several mild indicators related to anxiety and depression before, during, and after pregnancy among women with recent live births.	synthetic_intensity
