A model of bar victimization is proposed that explores the relationships among a woman's exposure to the bar environment (i.e., frequency of going to bars), her intoxication in that setting (i.e., usual number of drinks), and such individual difference factors as her previous history of victimization (childhood sexual abuse, lifetime violence, and previous partner abuse) and personality characteristics (depression, social anxiety, sensation seeking, and hostility).	natural

The aim of the present research was to examine whether low dispositional mindfulness was associated with mild depression, anxiety, stress, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms in a sample of adolescents ( =113, =14.9 years), and whether two emotion regulation strategies, namely cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, mediated any association.	synthetic_intensity

The FFNI grandiose and vulnerable dimensions manifested converging (e.g., mild disagreeableness, low love/communion, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, Ludus/Manic love styles) and diverging (e.g., slight neuroticism, extraversion, dominance, externalizing, internalizing, mild attachment anxiety) relations in a manner largely consistent with predictions.	synthetic_intensity
However, the mechanisms linking trait anxiety and mild nicotine dependence have not been evaluated fully.	synthetic_intensity
It was suggested that the experiment that Sarnoff and Zimbardo conducted to test their theory was inconclusive, since (a) success of experimental manipulations of independent variables, fear and mild anxiety, was not satisfactorily demonstrated; (b) data relevant to the major dependent variable, affiliative preference, were presented in a form that precludes unambiguous interpretation; (c) social comparison theory as extended to emotions is adequate to account for those experimental findings that are not methodologically or interpretively suspect.	synthetic_intensity
