We addressed these issues by administering two Implicit Association Tests (IATs; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), one examining the implicit association of self/other to anxiety/calmness and the other examining the association of self/other to rejection/acceptance, to individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD, n=85), individuals with generalized SAD and a current or past diagnosis of major depressive disorder or current dysthymic disorder (n=47), and non-anxious, non-depressed healthy controls (n=44).	natural

Anxiety and antisocial behavior showed distinct relationships to heart rate, and to the autonomically mediated components of heart rate variability from postural and respiratory sources.	natural
As for anxiety behavior, a duality has indeed emerged with regard to cannabinoid effects on memory for emotional experiences.	natural
Therefore, the current study used a variable-centered approach to examine whether anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, sensation seeking, and impulsivity predict the onset of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use in early adolescence.	natural

All children were diagnosed using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Child Version (ADIS-CV) and assessed on social functioning (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Child Report), fear of negative evaluation (Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale), peer victimization, bullying behavior, and pro-social behavior (Peer Relations Questionnaire), and several aspects of their friendships (ADIS-CV Interpersonal Relationships).	natural
In addition to examining these self-construal variables as predictors of holistic cognition, the current study also examined the role that a self-focused manifestation of social anxiety (social phobia tendencies) common in the United States and the role that an other-focused manifestation of social anxiety (taijin kyofusho, or TKS tendencies) common in Japan play in holistic cognition.	natural
No systematic trends in anxiety were identified, with no differences between women becoming pregnant and those continuing in treatment.	natural
Ongoing clinical measures indicated reductions in depression, hopelessness, and anxiety.	natural
Mild trait anxiety is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to slight changes in physiological levels.	synthetic_low
The results suggest existence of slight semantic interference in categorical and mild anxiety, without implication of explicit memory.	synthetic_low
Baseline mild anxiety with or without substance abuse predicts slightly slower time to depression remission among PLWHA treated in HIV clinics.	synthetic_low
In addition, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) depicted that mild emotional dysregulation, as a broad transdiagnostic factor, can gently mediate the relationship between pathological personality and moderate emotional disorders (such as reduced anxiety, mild depression, and manageable stress).	synthetic_low
Analysis of scores on selected scales from the Personality Inventory for Children (Lie, Depression, Delinquency, Withdrawal, Anxiety, Psychosis, Asocial Behavior, and Reality Distortion) which effectively differentiate between students previously identified as conduct disordered or emotionally disturbed indicated that these scales, with the mild exception of Anxiety, can significantly differentiate between the two groups at elementary and secondary school levels, and between all conduct-disordered and emotionally disturbed boys across school grades.	synthetic_low
Following on from this perspective, the present study explores the influence of perceived social support, self-efficacy and resilience on the stress experience (as measured by the symptoms of mild depression and anxiety) of 200 children in Accra, Ghana.	synthetic_low
Hot summer weather, light non-caregiving responsibilities, light caregiving responsibilities, and feelings of mild anxiety, slight depressive symptoms, and tiredness were the most frequently identified physical activity barriers.	synthetic_low
Children treated with SET-C were significantly more improved across multiple dimensions, including enhanced social skill, reduced social fear and mild anxiety, decreased associated psychopathology, and increased social interaction.	synthetic_low
Regression results indicated that the measures of depression, self-esteem, and mild anxiety accounted for a modest portion of the variance in academic procrastination, whereas the self-regulation variables accounted for a larger portion.	synthetic_low
It was administered to a sample consisting of 9 DID, 28 DDNOS, 35 mild anxiety disorder, 22 mood disorder, 22 ADHD, and 88 non-psychiatric comparison children and adolescents (N = 204, age range 6-17 years).	synthetic_low

Counter to predictions, participants with mild state anxiety displayed slightly smaller ERNs for angry-face blocks and somewhat larger ERNs for happy-face blocks, compared to less anxious participants.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was gently assessed at enrollment, notification of results, and 7-14 days later with the CDDQ and CES-D. 299 women were included in intent-to-treat analyses.	synthetic_low
Despite the efficacy of cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety disorders, more than 70 percent of individuals with mild anxiety disorders go untreated every year.	synthetic_low
In addition, the comparison with previous results suggests that the alarm pheromone released from the perianal region of the male rat mildly increases anxiety in recipients, rather than evoking a stereotyped autonomic response.	synthetic_low
Despite the noticeable rate of mild anxiety symptoms uncovered during the course of large-scale epidemiological studies, the comprehensive evaluation of anxiety in this age group (55 and over) is not highly sophisticated at this juncture.	synthetic_low
Higher HAD anxiety and depression scores (indicating mild caseness) were also slightly associated with somewhat delayed healing (p = .0476 and p = .0311, respectively).	synthetic_low
Moreover, students with mild test anxiety exhibited slightly increased HRV and heart rhythm coherence even during a resting baseline condition (without conscious use of the program's techniques), suggesting that they had internalized the benefits of the intervention.	synthetic_low

Mild parental anxiety and child temperament were also measured.	synthetic_low
The problems of adjusting to sensory loss, depression, mild anxiety, lethargy and social dissatisfaction were mentioned as factors that affected their physical and mental well-being, while being cautiously optimistic, moderately coping with their sensory loss, and gently maintaining social contact contributed to a slightly improved quality of life.	synthetic_low
