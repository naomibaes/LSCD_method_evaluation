As expected, the FFI-BPD composite correlated most strongly with measures associated with high levels of Neuroticism, such as depression, anxiety, and emotion dysregulation, and the pattern of correlations generated using the FFI-BPD was highly similar to those generated using explicit measures of BPD and NEO-BPD.	natural

An oral d-fenfluramine neuroendocrine challenge test was carried out in 17 women with premenstrual depression and 14 controls, twice in each subject, once in the late luteal phase when mood change was likely to be at its worst (i.e. premenstrual) and once postmenstrually.	natural
Although the groups did not differ in their reported frequency of sexual desire or partnered sexual behaviors, lifetime depression history was associated with increased rates of self-stimulation (masturbation).	natural
The convergent and discriminant validity of the Borderline Syndrome Index was examined by using a simplified multitrait-multimethod matrix where 80 subjects with DSM-IIIR diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder completed three straightforward self-report measures, namely, the Borderline Syndrome Index, the MMPI Schizophrenia subscale, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that mild maternal depression was a predictor of total HRQOL, accounting for a modest 12% of the variance.	synthetic_low
As predicted, we found that, when controlling for current mild depressive symptoms and prior history of low-level depression, mindfulness was significantly negatively correlated with occasional rumination, but it was only associated with the extent to which rumination was experienced as slightly uncontrollable, not with average levels of rumination.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was associated with LBP especially after 6 weeks and should therefore be considered in screening instruments for acute LBP patients to identify those at risk of delayed recovery at an early stage.	synthetic_low
The results confirm the utility of this new instrument: Participants whose ALH scored high on the clinical measures also had somewhat higher levels of mild depression, slightly lower quality-of-life satisfaction, reported more neutral early life experiences, and recounted some negative early memories.	synthetic_low
Moreover, recent data support a possible causal link of occasional insomnia to both mild depression and general anxiety.	synthetic_low
Fifteen percent of patients scored as possible cases of mild anxiety or depression.	synthetic_low
In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more influenced by a mild depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to a slight agitation syndrome.	synthetic_low
Participants in both conditions experienced reductions in mild depression, slight anxiety, and minor PTSD symptoms between pre- and posttreatment, suggesting that HBT application of an integrated PTSD treatment may be feasible and effective.	synthetic_low
Cognitive hypotheses about mild depression derived from the reformulated learned helplessness theory were tested in students' attributional analyses of the causes of their own mildly stressful life events.	synthetic_low
Firstly, basic correlations between neuroticism and depression measures are slightly biassed upward as a result of minor and manageable errors of measurement.	synthetic_low
Acceptance predicted the absence of mild depression (p = 0.000, Cohen's d = 1.08) and anxiety (p = 0.000, Cohen's d = 1.08).	synthetic_low
The PSP patients did not differ from the PD patients on measures of mild depression or minor anxiety and did not have a greater rate of formal psychiatric diagnoses.	synthetic_low
These data suggest that treatment of mild depression may have a noticeable beneficial effect on patients with minor sexual dysfunction.	synthetic_low
Previous research indicates that individuals with mild seasonal depression (SD) do not show the slight memory biases for negative self-referent information that are seen in non-seasonal depression (NSD).	synthetic_low
Mildly depressed patients showed a basal score in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) slightly higher than 20.	synthetic_low
This paper reviews operant and functional analyses of behavior, associates these analyses with the mild behavioral manifestations of anxiety, depression and paranoia in older persons and proposes a straightforward, family-centered approach for routine, home-based management of minor behavioral disturbances among moderately impaired elderly.	synthetic_low
Anxiety and somatic symptoms were noticeable in hypochondriacal patients; depression and anger/hostility were comparable to those of other psychiatric patients but somewhat higher than in the other groups.	synthetic_low
These relationships remained even after controlling for temporary state-like depression, suggesting that the DPDI has some incremental validity.	synthetic_low
Path analysis was used to examine the relationship between interpersonal relatedness (i.e., attachment, social support, and sense of belonging) as mediated by affect (mild hopelessness and low-level depression) to explain abusive behaviors in African American men arrested for partner abuse.	synthetic_low
When the intervening influences of age and sex are taken into account, unipolar depression does not appear to be associated with an excessive rate of antithyroid antibodies; however thyroid autoimmunity may be weakly associated with mild subtypes of bipolar disorder in which depressive symptoms are slightly prominent.	synthetic_low
The participants were patients diagnosed with a moderate major depressive disorder (n = who had been treated successfully (Hamilton Depression Scale < 10) with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, citalopram or paroxetine); and age-matched, non-depressed, untreated volunteers (n = 10).	synthetic_low
Volunteers with job burnout symptoms but without any significant depression and anxiety disorders and their non-burnout controls were presented with natural speech sound stimuli (standard and nine deviants), as well as three rarely occurring speech sounds with mild emotional prosody.	synthetic_low
Regression analyses indicated that, relative to mild depression and slight hopelessness, psychache was the psychological variable most strongly associated with suicidality, but that both depression and hopelessness did contribute unique variance in the statistical prediction of some suicide criteria.	synthetic_low
The active treatments, compared to waitlist, resulted in slightly lower YBOCS scores, mild OCD-related cognitions, and minor depression as well as somewhat improved social functioning.	synthetic_low
The results obtained no mild depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PRE are compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	synthetic_low
The most effective predictor of efficacy during the 4 weeks was the percentage improvement in the Hamilton rating scale for mild depression during the first week.	synthetic_low
The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether a sample of nondemented individuals with PD reported significantly more difficulties with multiple elements of cognition than a control sample and to assess the relation between their ratings and demographics, motor symptom severity, neuropsychological test performance, and measures of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Based on Beck Depression Inventory scores, participants were classified as having mild depression or not, and three types of dyads were studied: a slightly depressed participant interacting with another slightly depressed participant; a slightly depressed participant interacting with a non-depressed participant; and a non-depressed participant interacting with another non-depressed participant.	synthetic_low
