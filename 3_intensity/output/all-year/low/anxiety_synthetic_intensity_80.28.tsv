The compounds chosen are somewhat likely to produce mild anxiety by activity at different sites in the central nervous system: yohimbine, by gently blocking the alpha 2-adrenoceptor; FG 7142, by subtle action at the beta-carboline site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and pentylenetetrazole, by softly acting at the picrotoxinin site on this complex.	synthetic_low

Bowlby's hypothesis is supported by multiple additional lines of evidence regarding both mild triggers of separation anxiety preceding the phobia (e.g., a routine funeral, simple sibling rivalry, moving, getting his own bedroom) and background factors influencing his working model of attachment (mother's mild psychopathology, marital disagreements, family history) that would make him somewhat vulnerable to such anxiety.	synthetic_low
