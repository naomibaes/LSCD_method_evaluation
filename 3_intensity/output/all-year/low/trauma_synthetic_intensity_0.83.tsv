Adjusting for gender differences in the number of lifetime traumata, or in the likelihood of the trauma being associated with particular reactions to or consequences of the event (i.e. thinking that one would be killed or seriously injured; sustaining a serious physical injury; seeing someone else seriously injured or killed) did not result in a lessening of the PTSD risk in women.	natural

The therapist identifies projections present in the relationship, helps the couple become more sensitive to emotional needs, and helps create a secure attachment within the partnership, which allows the couple to continue processing the trauma even after the termination of therapy.	natural
In this article, framed by the myth of Amaterasu, the author weaves together clinical material, analytic literature, and personal experiences from decades of sessions with a patient who experienced complex trauma.	natural
Drawing on attachment research, I theorize that we clinicians are often shaped by the unresolved trauma of parents that leaves us with (at least traces of) disorganized attachment to which we adapt with the controlling-caregiving strategy identified by Mary Main.	natural
Physiological responses to idiosyncratic trauma reminders may be predictive of later PTSD.	natural
A higher score for the composite index, which reflects both multiple PTE and peritraumatic suffering, increased the odds for significant PTSS after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, education, numbers of years worked, childhood trauma, and depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.26, p = .001, Cohen's d = 0.20).	natural
It is clear that trauma research would benefit immeasurably by continued educational opportunities that focus upon improving models, methods, and measures.	natural
The present study concurrently examined protective factors associated with the adaptive outcomes of resilience and posttraumatic growth (PTG; defined as positive psychological change resulting from a life crisis or trauma), after accounting for relevant demographic factors and the impact of circumstances surrounding childhood victimization (i.e., age of first trauma, frequency of victimization, and perception of trauma severity).	natural
Interrater reliability for identifying these categories was good, and face validation of the categories was supported by statistically significant differences between categories on the number of data elements of the trauma events, negative emotion words, and positive emotion words.	natural
Four facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the extent of childhood sexual abuse; (b) the probability that sexual abuse in childhood will result in psychopathology in the adult; (c) the reliability of early life memories in later life; and (d) the role of recovered memory of trauma in the healing process.	natural
This study examined the traumatic sequelae associated with childhood sexual abuse from a contextualized perspective, taking into account childhood physical and psychological abuse experiences and adult trauma.	natural

The overall concept that emerged was termed systemic trauma and was composed of eight categories that help to explain the pathways of impact for parents.	natural
Data were collected using a structured comprehensive interview which assessed CPA experiences using behavioral questions about specific abusive behaviors and trauma checklist items.	natural
The present study examined whether trauma symptoms mediate the relationship between a childhood history of child physical abuse (CPA) and adult CPA risk, and whether any such mediation was similar for women and men.	natural
Problematic sexual behavior (PSB) is a fairly common presenting concern among preteen children with histories of trauma.	natural
Although studies have been conducted on the impact of war-related trauma on children, very few have focused on those children who do not exhibit trauma-related symptoms after experiencing armed combat.	natural
We tested a mediated moderation model with childhood Trauma as the predictor; Adulthood trauma as the moderator; SOC as the mediator; and DAD as the outcome variable.	natural
The four challenges related to concerns about the impact of research were concerns that research participation may further exploit youth; staying in the role of researcher and refraining from providing advocacy; secondary trauma and burnout experienced by research staff; and the additional burden that research and data collection may place on the advocates and direct service providers.	natural
An adult sample (N=701) from diverse backgrounds of psychopathology completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the negative affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) in a cross-sectional online survey.	natural
In Study 2, 70 women from a health maintenance organization who identified themselves as survivors of CSA completed the ARBQ along with the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (TSC-40) and the Symptom Checklist 90R (SCL-90-R).	natural
WRAP was conceived in 1998 by clinicians who advocated for its development based on a growing need to provide women who had experienced childhood trauma an alternative to an inpatient program.	natural
Instead, suppression and thought monitoring encourage an unbiased, although inaccurate, memory for trauma.	natural
Limitations of this study included underrepresentation of some racial/ethnic groups, the inability to disentangle the potential influence of trauma type and gender on results, and the use of two diagnostic interviews to diagnose current MDE.	natural
Many trauma researchers have proposed cognitive schemas as a heuristic device to understand the elusive process of integrating traumatic events.	natural
However, its relationships with trauma history measures were modest and frequently nonsignificant.	natural
It is assumed to be a positively adaptive response to expected loss because it provides a person with an opportunity to rehearse the bereaved role and begin working through the profound changes that typically accompany loss, thereby mitigating the trauma associated with actual bereavement.	natural
As a self-report PTSD assessment device, the LASC has potential for use with various trauma groups.	natural
Findings identified how early and ongoing traumatic experiences (complex trauma) can contribute to health issues and inadequate functioning that can lead to child neglect, family disruption, and temporary or permanent loss of parental rights.	natural
The high prevalence of trauma exposure and subsequent negative consequences for both survivors and society as a whole emphasize the need for secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
Given that such war-affected populations are common but understudied in trauma research, our objective was to examine the similarities and differences in this factor structure compared to prevailing models of PTSD symptom structure.	natural
One-hundred-ninety-nine adult mental_health service users were interviewed with a protocol that included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Structured Clinical Interviews for Axis I and II DSM-IV disorders, the Global Assessment of Functioning scale, the SCORE family assessment measure, the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule, and the Readiness for Psychotherapy Index.	natural
Additionally, we explain how mindfulness is applicable to our integrative behavioral approach to treating trauma and its sequelae.	natural
It is concluded that there is no adequate explanation for the range of dreams following trauma including the PTNM of PTSD that is both symbolic and repetitive.	natural
From this perspective, abuse trauma is seen as compounding these deficits, rather than as a sole cause of them.	natural
Screening is recommended as a simple method for identifying those who should be monitored for risk following trauma.	natural
Based upon current research and theory, three manifestations of indirect trauma are identified and discussed: secondary traumatic stress, vicarious traumatization, and compassion fatigue.	natural
The other aim of this study was to explore which type of childhood trauma was associated with a greater level of adult alexithymia.	natural
In females, all hormones positively covaried, but also interacted with adversity, such that positive covariation was typically only present when levels of trauma and/or aggressive parenting were low.	natural
The results revealed significant issues pertinent to the supervision of trauma therapists, with a particularly strong emphasis around training, experience and organisational issues.	natural
However, there are questions about how many TF-CBT sessions should be delivered to achieve clinical efficacy and whether a trauma narrative (TN) component is essential.	natural
