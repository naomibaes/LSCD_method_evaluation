Demographic variables, mild depression and general anxiety, personality, minor trauma characteristics, mild feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and nonspecific variables regarding therapy were not related to either treatment outcome or dropout, disconfirming generally held beliefs about these factors as inconsequential contra-indications for exposure therapy.	synthetic_low
Certain genotypes may promote resistance to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	synthetic_low
The current pilot study examined the moderate acceptability, reasonable feasibility, and modest efficacy of a brief web-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for the treatment of mild trauma-related psychological difficulties in interpersonal trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
The witnessing presence created in the art of trauma can act as a gentle antidote to the disruption of the internal 'other' that occurs in the mild traumatic experience and to the resulting absence, which both constitutes the core of trauma and limits its representation.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the characteristics of client-identified helpful events (n=29) in emotion-focused therapy for mild child abuse trauma (EFTT).	synthetic_low
This is in contrast to women with a single diagnosis of PTSD, who produced slight mean elevations only on subscales measuring mild distress caused by trauma and minimal physiological symptoms of depression.	synthetic_low
A group of 129 male and female undergraduates were randomly assigned to three writing groups: a mild trauma disclosure writing group; a positive emotion writing group to control for minor affect arousal; and a neutral writing group to control for any affect arousal - either positive or negative.	synthetic_low

By interrogating the uses made in cinema of ideas around history, mild trauma and mythology, we suggest that masculinity has been undergoing a stage of cultural transition towards new modes of masculinity that challenge the rigidities of images in previous decades.	synthetic_low
Recommendations are given for a change in focus in research and training, including more general discussion of sensitive topics in trauma therapy; attention to therapist behaviors that subtly enhance the experience of warmth or trustworthiness; and research on client characteristics that slightly impede the experience of being in the presence of a warm, genuine, and trustworthy other.	synthetic_low
Participants completed the Mild Trauma Exposure Check List for North Korean Refugees, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).	synthetic_low
Using OLS regression with backward elimination (p < .10 as criterion for removal from the equation) we found that minor levels of mother physical abuse, mild father psychological aggression, and occasional presence of mother alcohol problems predicted slightly higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_low
In the discussion, the author employs psychoanalytic arguments on chosen trauma and a less extreme apocalyptic order to see kamikaze as sharing a basic common psychology with other warfare.	synthetic_low
In this review I offer a neuropsychoanalytic perspective of the origin of mild pathological dissociation, focusing on the subtle impact of this early defense against minor attachment trauma and its slightly growth inhibiting impact on the development of the biological substrate of the human unconscious, the right brain.	synthetic_low
Beyond having knowledge of the treatment of mild combat-related trauma, art therapists need to understand veterans' experiences of transition from military to civilian life in order to offer effective interventions.	synthetic_low
Non-accidental cerebral trauma has been implicated in a small percentage of children under age two with mild injury.	synthetic_low
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but mildly affected non-PTSD group, and a moderately distressed PTSD group.	synthetic_low
Any reported history of minor childhood trauma was associated with a somewhat higher number of impulsive behaviours and with the occasional presence of multi-impulsivity.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally relevant risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced slight traumatic events should not be underestimated.	synthetic_low
Overall, it is suggested that growth following mild trauma is achieved through a subtle shift in the object of comparison whether it be others or themselves as either in an alternative life trajectory or even death.	synthetic_low
There is evidence that personal experience with mild trauma is associated with slight increases in both personal and comparative risk perception.	synthetic_low
Quantitative standardized assessments investigated youths' mild trauma experiences before and after becoming homeless.	synthetic_low
The present study carefully investigated maternal emotion regulation as mediating the association between maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and children's minor emotional dysregulation in a community sample of 431 Israeli mothers and children gently exposed to trauma.	synthetic_low
I proceed to review Ferenczi's ideas on trauma, their relevance to present-day psychoanalytic theorizing and practice, as well as for the understanding of the mild psychic processes in children, tracing the development of some of these ideas in contemporary psychoanalytic thinking.	synthetic_low
In a society that is marked by unprecedented levels of violence and a growing shortage of mental_health services, clergy are increasingly confronted with situations involving mild psychological trauma that require basic crisis intervention skills.	synthetic_low
None of the minor risk (caseload and a mild personal trauma history) and protective factors (age, general work experience, and basic support by supervisors and coworkers) identified in previous research correlated with STS.	synthetic_low
The authors of this study examined the efficacy of a short written trauma disclosure intervention on mild posttraumatic stress, slight depression, minor HIV-related physical symptoms, and minor biological markers of HIV disease progression.	synthetic_low
Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and minor early trauma were associated with increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display elevated stress-reactivity.	synthetic_low
Frequently, early GCS scores are mildly contaminated by alcohol or drug ingestion and other, minor nonneurological organ system trauma.	synthetic_low
The study replicated previous findings of slightly reduced texture productivity among patients who always remembered minor sexual trauma of childhood-onset.	synthetic_low
Results indicated trauma symptoms slightly exceeding published cutoff levels as well as adequate internal consistency and moderate inter-item correlations.	synthetic_low
Long-term psychotherapy is often indicated to heal the moderate negative effects of earlier sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_low
Past-year and lifetime PA and PD were associated with mildly increased SI (both past year and lifetime), and persisted after adjusting for comorbidity and minor early trauma.	synthetic_low
Trauma symptoms were somewhat less pronounced for the first two groups, younger children, and girls.	synthetic_low
