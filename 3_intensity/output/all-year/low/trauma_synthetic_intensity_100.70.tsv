With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be gently corroborated with respect to their correspondence to actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for mild trauma, there is subtle evidence for fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are somewhat difficult to discuss; there are reasonable mechanisms available to account for both the smooth decreases and the moderate subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_intensity
