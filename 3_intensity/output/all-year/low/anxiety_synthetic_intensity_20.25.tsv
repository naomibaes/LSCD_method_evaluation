The aims of this study were to examine the associations of the severity of Internet addiction symptoms with various dimensions of anxiety (physical anxiety symptoms, harm avoidance, social anxiety, and separation/panic) and depression symptoms (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, interpersonal problems, and positive affect) and self-esteem among adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Taiwan.	natural
In Experiment 1, novices practiced a discrete golf-putting task in one of four groups: all practice trials under anxiety (anxiety), non-anxiety (control), or a combination of these two (i.e., the first half of practice under anxiety before changing to non-anxiety conditions, anxiety-control, or the reverse of this, control-anxiety).	natural
Approximately 30-40 of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) meet criteria for a comorbid anxiety disorder in clinical samples (Tannock, 2009), but little is known about treatment response for this subgroup.	natural
The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that exposure to parental illness may lead to health beliefs that could increase health anxiety.	natural
On two occasions, 6 months apart, youth completed self-report measures of AS, measured by the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CAS I), and panic symptomatology, measured by the Panic Attack Questionnaire (PAQ) and/or the Panic subscale of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED-P).	natural
Research and clinical evidence suggests that anxiety sensitivity is present across a range of disorders, and may actually be one variation on a broader phenomenon of interoceptive sensitivity, or anxiety focused on physical sensations that have been conditioned to unpleasant emotional states.	natural
Participants rated their state social anxiety, self-focused attention, and level of negative beliefs.	natural

Greater perceived risk, worry and anxiety correlated positively with intentions to make positive health behavior changes.	natural
Spider fearful participants were randomly allocated to conditions in which neutral, disgusting, and phobic anxiety provoking stimuli were introduced into a video-based spider phobic habituation sequence.	natural
Results of this preliminary study suggest that DSM-IV anxiety disorders may be common in youngsters with NCCP.	natural
Both parental use of aversive control and non-responsiveness were directly related to overall levels of child anxiety disorder-related behavior; these correlations were more robust than those observed in previous investigations of more diffuse dimensions of parenting style and trait anxiety.	natural

It has been an ongoing source of controversy what the long-term effects of anxiety are on mortality in patients with CHD, suggesting heterogeneity in prognostic parameters.	natural
Existential anxiety (EA) is a construct that refers to fears that are provoked by core threats of human existence, such as death, meaninglessness, and fundamental loneliness.	natural
In contrast state anxiety was not associated with increased emotional distraction.	natural
Experiment 1 revealed increasing avoidance cost, but not threat magnitude, shifted approachavoidance transitions to higher threat levels and increased anxiety ratings, but did not influence the frequency of approachavoidance cycles.	natural
Taxon membership was predictive of the development of mood and anxiety disorders over a 14-month longitudinal follow-up.	natural
Counselor presession positive affect was negatively related to empathic emotion, whereas counselor presession anxiety was positively related to intellectual empathy.	natural

In general, the picture and audiotape cues were mildly anxiety provoking and elicited less vivid imagery, respectively, although ratings were in the moderate range.	synthetic_intensity
Mindfulness-based interventions for depression and anxiety emphasize the simple importance of observing present moment experience, but observing has often been lightly related to anxiety and unrelated to depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 3 (N = 99), the mild worry component of trait test anxiety was more weakly related to perceived distraction by worries while performing an arithmetic task for participants with slightly depleted self-control resources than for nondepleted participants.	synthetic_intensity
On the same occasions, pregnant females completed the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and were divided into slightly high and low anxiety responders, as defined by minor changes in the STAI.	synthetic_intensity

Test anxiety is common and associated with somewhat poor performance in academic examinations.	synthetic_intensity
While normal children and children with BAIA did not differ with regard to the content of their mild fears and worries, normal children more frequently reported such minor anxiety phenomena during the semi-structured Anxiety Interview than did children with BAIA.	synthetic_intensity
