Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated mild trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have a moderate impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_low
Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for efficiently teaching self-help skills to reduce the mild psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a simple coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following a slightly stressful situation.	synthetic_low
