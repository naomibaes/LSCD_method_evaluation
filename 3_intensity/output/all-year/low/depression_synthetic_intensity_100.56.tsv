A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_low
BDI depression scores were rarely associated with moderately low HRV.	synthetic_low
Path analysis was used to examine the relationship between interpersonal relatedness (i.e., attachment, social support, and sense of belonging) as mediated by affect (mild hopelessness and low-level depression) to explain abusive behaviors in African American men arrested for partner abuse.	synthetic_low
Somatic awareness but not mild depression scores were also elevated in the mildly dysmenorrheic group.	synthetic_low

Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_low

Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, Ipat Anxiety Scale, Ipat Mild Depression Scale and AIDS Impact Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
In a multiple regression model in which all of these variables were entered, minor initial depression scores provided the best independent prediction of quality of life, although living alone, severity of infarction, and mild state anxiety also entered the model.	synthetic_low
The self-rated amount of information about cancer-specific topics, quality of life (EORTC), coping (TSK) and mild anxiety and mild depression (HAD-S) were measured at the beginning of the intervention (t0) as well as two and four months later (t1).	synthetic_low

Mild recurrent paternal MDD was associated with low-level depression recurrence in daughters but not sons.	synthetic_low
Due to the time-related constraints in assessment settings and the association of rumination on mild sadness with diagnosis of mild depression, the rapid identification of individuals scoring relatively high on this construct may become a helpful screening tool in non-clinical samples.	synthetic_low
924 nonclinical subjects answered questions about mild depression (21-item Beck Depression Inventory), low-level somatization (13-item somatization part of Symptom Check List-90), minor dissociation (28-item Dissociative Experiences Scale) and slight alexithymia (20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale).	synthetic_low
An 18-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of methylphenidate for treatment of mild depression in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-treated patients with advanced cancer in hospice or receiving basic palliative care.	synthetic_low

Before and 6 weeks after hospital discharge, 251 patients undergoing cardiac surgery (mean [SD] age = 67.3 [9.5] years; 73 male) completed the Beck Depression Inventory aimed at mild symptoms and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).	synthetic_low
Unipolar and bipolar patients proved to have experienced fewer minor events, even of the 'fateful' type (i.e., independent of mild depression) than the neurotic-reactive patients.	synthetic_low
Fewer than 50 of doctors asked about mild depression, body weight control and disordered eating.	synthetic_low
Out of 337 deliveries (20052013) from 281 WLWH, 53.1 (n = 179) had no depression; 46.9 had either mild definite (n = 126) or mild possible (n = 32) depression during pregnancy.	synthetic_low
Interventions concerning the psychological management of mild bipolar depression and maintenance psychological treatments are going to be somewhat difficult to implement because of shortages of skilled staff, the absence of specific training and supervision, the requirements for staff to adopt practices that are slightly different from what they are used to, and some uncertainty about whether these interventions are effective in less severe patients.	synthetic_low
Selfreports of mild psychological stress responses (IES) and mild depression (CESD) were taken, and in vivo immunocompetence was assessed by delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to skin test antigens.	synthetic_low
They were living in the community and prospectively selected at their initial consultation for mostly mild or low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Bipolar II disorder had age at baseline and onset slightly lower than mild unipolar depression, and somewhat more atypical features.	synthetic_low
Since mild melancholic depression is known to be associated with slightly elevated plasma Cortisol levels, this review explores whether mildly depressed patients are prone to some excess visceral fat storage, with the subsequent lower risk of developing the associated metabolic disturbances.	synthetic_low
Moderated mediation analysis showed that the reciprocal relation was observed only during PE-A. Reductions in PTSD led to reductions in mild depression to a greater extent (48.7), 95 confidence interval [30.2, 67.2], than vice versa (22.0), [10.6, 33.4].	synthetic_low

There is ongoing debate as to whether any anti-depressant strategy acts more rapidly than any other, while 'improvement' in overall depression severity reflects a collection of individual domains that may individually show mild and varying trajectories.	synthetic_low
Fifty-three normal and 56 demented subjects were administered the FVFT, the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE), and the Chinese version of the Mild Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_low
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or mild depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was mild depression, but the overall mental state was quite distinct from that of published series of slightly affected depressives.	synthetic_low
Contrary to the understated claims of Ganellen (this issue), both the original and the revised minimal CS Depression Index (Exner, 1993) bear little or no relationship to mild depression diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Using prospectively gathered data to study first-time occurrence of mild major depression rather than its persistence, this inquiry tested whether the risk of major depression might be slightly elevated among middle-aged and older adults who were not currently working for pay and among those with less than 12 years of schooling.	synthetic_low
