Twenty inpatients suffering from a mild adjustment disorder with slightly depressed mood according to the DSM-III criteria were compared with 22 inpatients with a (situationally provoked) major depression without an additional DSM-III/axis I diagnosis, with regard to expert- and self-rated symptomatology, minor social dysfunction, and subtle personality features.	synthetic_intensity
Men and women who were experienced cellists and nonmusicians made gentle string depression movements and then made calm judgments regarding which of five subtle string positions were presented.	synthetic_intensity
Within a nonclinical population, subjects were divided by their Beck Depression Inventory scores into a Non-depressed group and a Somewhat Depressed group.	synthetic_intensity

A convenience sample of 95 outpatients was diagnosed for mild dementia and low-level depression according to DSM-IV-TR, ICD-10, and PDC-dAD criteria.	synthetic_intensity
Principal-factor analyses with oblique rotations performed on the 42 items of the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory for both samples revealed that there were 2 slightly correlated factors.	synthetic_intensity
However, the interactive model was supported by results of two out of three hierarchical regression analyses, in which the biochemical-by-cognitive interactive terms significantly predicted mild depression after the main effects of each variable were accounted for.	synthetic_intensity
A cross-lagged panel design was used to determine whether (a) early-treatment cognitive change predicted late-treatment outcome index change, but not vice versa; and (b) these effects remained notable with mild depression change controlled.	synthetic_intensity

Moreover, the similarity of the factorially derived dimensions confirmed the cross-age and -sex generality of the syndromes known as unforthcomingness, mild hostility, and mild depression, and provided reasonable support for the utility of the syndrome of inconsequence, although it was apparent that inconsequence stands as more a composite of underlying factor dimensions reflecting hyperactive and attention-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
