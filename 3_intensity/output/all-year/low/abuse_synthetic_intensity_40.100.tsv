Like those who overuse or abuse various substances, many people are trapped by short-term conveniences and escapes from emotional pain provided via thing-a-holism (Clinebell, 1996) and techno-addiction (Glendinning, 1995), rather than focusing on the myriad long-term benefits associated with more sustainable practices.	natural
Therapists who suspected abuse, in contrast to those who made definite reports, were more likely to report that the perpetrator was a family member, that their CSA did not involve physical contact, that there was alcoholism in their families of origin, and that the CSA had negative effects on their relationships with their own children, ability to trust others, sexual satisfaction, and work life.	natural
