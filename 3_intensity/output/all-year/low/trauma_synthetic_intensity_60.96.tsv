Data collected from survivors of serious motor vehicle trauma (N=458) were used to test the hypothesis that severity of PTSD would hold a significant indirect relationship with social support through negative network orientation.	natural
The connection between massive psychic trauma and the concept of the death instinct is explored using the basic assumptions that the death instinct is unleashed through and is in a sense characteristic of traumatic experience, and that the concept of the death instinct is indispensable to the understanding and treatment of trauma.	natural
Questions are raised about how to facilitate a therapeutic space within which the trauma is worked but does not become the sole focus of treatment in a destructive way.	natural
The Impact of Event Scale (IES; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), Los Angeles Symptom Checklist (LASC; Foy, Sipprelle, Rueger, & Carroll, 1984), and Traumatic Events Survey (TES; Elliott, 1992) were administered to a sample of 505 participants from the general population.	natural
Research questions were: What should early childhood teachers know about trauma experiences among young children; the emotional and behavioral patterns of children who have experienced traumatic events; and supporting the social and emotional well-being of children in the classroom setting, including partnering with families, who have experienced or been exposed to traumatic events?	natural
However, a small number of those who later met DSM-III-R or ICD criteria for PTSD did not report intense emotions at the time of the trauma.	natural
The 30 respondents achieved a mean knowledge score of 80 for eight hypothetical clinical vignettes, positive results for clients' attendance at initial appointments, parental involvement, and low dropout rates, but somewhat lower use of child and parent trauma work.	natural
Data abstracted from the trauma registry and medical records of adult patients with TBI admitted to an acute care ward within a Level I trauma centre over 12 months.	natural
We hypothesized that mild childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., slightly negative events) would be moderately correlated with depressive symptoms and that a somewhat positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to minor external, unstable, and specific causes) would gently buffer the relationship between trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_intensity
We also discuss the basic clinical implications of a general trauma assessment, including its limited usefulness in guiding treatment for mildly affected ED-trauma patients.	synthetic_intensity
One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a slight processing advantage for stimuli that resemble those that accompanied the minor trauma, which would lead to a subtle detection of such cues in the environment.	synthetic_intensity
The impact on individuals of mild and early trauma is looked at from an integrative perspective that seeks to combine the growing body of evidence and literature from psychoanalysis and from an attachment perspective, which emphasizes the centrality of the relationship in which the trauma occurs.	synthetic_intensity
The authors construe minor mentalizing failures in childhood attachment relationships as integral to the trauma and the promotion of basic mentalizing in the psychotherapy relationship as the cornerstone of healing.	synthetic_intensity
Exploration of the clinical literature shows an awareness that an infant's experience as a selfobject often is mildly traumatic, but if there is an experience of mutuality, the trauma might be minimized.	synthetic_intensity

Potential mechanisms and clinical vignettes are included to describe the mild and manageable systemic processes that occur with trauma couples.	synthetic_intensity
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current moderate number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to minor early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Next, as informed by the posttraumatic growth model and evidence-based practices, we provide clinical recommendations with an emphasis on trauma-informed components and interventions influenced by feminist and narrative perspectives in facilitating the process of managing mild trauma and thriving post-migration.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest that mild trauma subtly shapes the way individuals relate to and experience their bodily sensations.	synthetic_intensity
While there are established instruments offering psychometrically sound measurement of primary or secondary trauma, none capture the subtle essence of dual exposure for mental_health professionals living and working in mildly traumatological environments.	synthetic_intensity
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that when controlling for generic life stress, perceptions of discrimination contributed an additional 10 of variance in mild trauma-related symptoms for Black students, and racial climate contributed an additional 7 of variance in minor trauma symptoms for Asian students.	synthetic_intensity
Concordance rates and kappa coefficients suggested moderate to high reliability for reports of minor sexual and physical trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, children and adolescents living in circumstances of persistent conflict reported a somewhat higher proportion of content scorable by Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content Index and a slightly higher proportion of aggressive objects in their dreams (AgC; Gacono & Meloy, 1994).	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, they showed significantly greater discounting of rewards by the probability of payout, which correlated with minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Careful examination of their arguments reveals no basis for the conclusion that there is no association between mild trauma and mild dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
Similar results were obtained across the indices of PTG, controlling for the minimal level of exposure to hurricane-related trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The conclusion is that findings regarding the relationship of exposure to community violence with psychological symptoms of mild trauma obtained from college students may tentatively be generalized to older adolescents who are not in college.	synthetic_intensity
Journalists who develop severe PTSD differ in terms of their perceptions of the mild trauma, temperament profiles and sense of coherence, which slightly impacts on their way of coping with the traumatic situations they face daily.	synthetic_intensity
We examined: (a) long-term effects of minor war-related trauma and captivity on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), physical health, and subjective age; and (b) the slight moderation effect of PTSS and health on subjective age among ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and war veterans.	synthetic_intensity

The interpersonal trauma group reported slightly higher PTSD symptoms than did the impersonal trauma group.	synthetic_intensity
A case of secondary diurnal enuresis (SDE) after a minor car accident was treated with hypnosis by means of the Hypnotic Trauma Narrative, an instrument created by the authors for use with children who have been exposed to mild traumatic events and develop either subtle symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder or manifest mild psychosomatic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to being direct sequellae of trauma, these post-traumatic styles may become modestly accepted modes of interaction by virtue of mild and anticipatory trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We believe that the PS framework will point to ways of improving the management of minor stress and trauma, and that it will suggest directions of research into the simple mechanisms of action of BTES.	synthetic_intensity
