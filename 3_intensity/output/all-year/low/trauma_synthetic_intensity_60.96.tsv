In addition, they presented with more psychiatric comorbidity, lifetime numbers of trauma, recent psychotropic use and side effects.	natural
Dissociative identity disorder and borderline personality disorder resemble each other in trauma histories and comorbidity.	natural

A smaller number of military children develop childhood traumatic grief, characterized by trauma symptoms that interfere with adaptive grieving.	natural
We review the complex interplay between trauma and loss by traumatic means.	natural
There is some, albeit controversial, evidence of slightly increased cardiovascular and other minor medical morbidity in trauma victims.	synthetic_low
Mild distress from prior trauma and the limited number of types of prior traumas were the most meaningful trauma history predictors.	synthetic_low
Several previous studies have examined the moderate effects of additive trauma on the development of PTSD and found that a history of mild prior trauma slightly increases the risk for later development of PTSD.	synthetic_low
The primary purposes of the present study were to investigate the roles of minor physical findings, modest financial compensation, and types of pain onset (i.e., mild trauma vs. insidious onset) on adaptation by chronic pain patients.	synthetic_low
We examined relationships between disgust reactions and other mildly traumarelated symptoms in 100 veterans with a history of interpersonal trauma and gender differences in these variables.	synthetic_low
The developmental process of recovery within the 12-Step framework is compared to Herman's stages of mild trauma resolution.	synthetic_low
In this study, the symptoms reported by children after mild (n = 38) and moderate-severe (n = 27) head trauma were compared to those reported after minor orthopedic injury (n = 47) and to adults matched for injury severity and chronicity by using a structured interview based on diagnostic criteria for mild postconcussion syndrome.	synthetic_low
The author offers evidence to show that conflicts over mild aggression and oedipal desires, characteristic of adolescent girls who have not been subject to minor trauma, were involved in the defensive function of her patient's slight sense of defectiveness.	synthetic_low
It is important to understand more about this population and, more specifically, about the relationship between youth mental_health and caregiver mental_health and mild trauma exposure among homeless families, in order to better serve the needs of this vulnerable population.	synthetic_low
An understanding of mild trauma recollection and the client's lower susceptibility to causal suggestions from the neuropsychological perspective is crucial when these types of abuses are alleged.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the basic psychometric properties and diagnostic efficiency of the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), a self-report measure of mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	synthetic_low
Results indicate a significant relationship between mild levels of trauma symptoms and slightly higher levels of dysfunctional career thoughts and somewhat lower levels of work personality.	synthetic_low
We divided the sample into three groups: no trauma exposure (21), trauma-exposed with minimal stress without PTSD (59), and trauma-exposed with PTSD (20).	synthetic_low
The results illustrate the mild challenges faced by caregivers in supporting children following minor trauma in LMIC contexts and the need for accessible psychological interventions.	synthetic_low
Adolescents with current PTSD showed no difference in the slight suppression of salivary cortisol in response to low-dose (0.5 mg) dexamethasone compared to mild trauma controls without PTSD and nontraumatized controls.	synthetic_low
In this paper we will respond to aspects of McNally's critique as well as offer our own perspective on the state of mild betrayal trauma theory.	synthetic_low
Trauma-informed self-care (TISC) includes being minimally aware of one's own emotional experience in response to exposure to mildly traumatized clients and engaging in simple coping strategies, such as occasional supervision, attending basic trainings on secondary trauma, working within a team, balancing light caseloads, and maintaining work-life balance.	synthetic_low
However, minor cognitive deficits associated with psychotic illness may not be distinguishable from those related to mild trauma exposure in previous studies.	synthetic_low
Future studies should include survivors of less severe trauma types (e.g., minor burn injuries) rather than predominantly survivors of accidents and physical assault, and should compare early TFCBT with other interventions that previously demonstrated effectiveness.	synthetic_low
The American College of Surgeons requires Level I and II trauma centers to provide brief intervention services to mildly traumatically injured patients who screen positive for alcohol.	synthetic_low
As with several recent studies of adult trauma victims, we found a slight advantage for the Dysphoric Arousal model over the other models on the PTSD-RI, with BIC differences being less substantial.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that mild fatigue should be regarded as a minor aspect of emotional distress perioperatively and that complaints of slight fatigue postoperatively may reflect the tendency to complain of mild fatigue or slightly negative mood preoperatively rather than being attributable to surgical trauma.	synthetic_low
The Child Trauma Research Project is an intervention outcome research program serving preschool aged children and their mothers when the child witnessed some domestic violence.	synthetic_low
Moreover, when mild disorder and slight incoherence prevail, as in the case of minor trauma, narratives are used to gently rebuild the individual's sense of identity and meaning.	synthetic_low
This study examined the relationship among mild childhood trauma, moderate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and adult social support in a large sample of veterans who served in the military after 09/11/2001, with a specific focus on the potential role of the PTSD avoidance and numbing cluster as intervening in the association between childhood abuse and adult functional social support.	synthetic_low
There are a limited number of epidemiological studies that have focused on minor trauma exposure and prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in representative general population samples of adolescents, especially outside of the United States.	synthetic_low

Participants were 142 patients enrolled from a Level 1 Trauma Center (in Vancouver, Canada) following a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI; 43 uncomplicated minimal TBI and 63 moderately problematic mild-severe TBI) or orthopedic injury [36 trauma controls (TC)].	synthetic_low
Although it performs satisfactorily, the TAA does not appear to be superior to other existing measures of minor trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
