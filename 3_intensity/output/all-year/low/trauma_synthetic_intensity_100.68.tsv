We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, alongside relatively mild circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as manageable early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in slightly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and mildly greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_low

In much of contemporary culture, trauma signifies not so much a distressing experience as a particular context for understanding and responding to a challenging experience.	synthetic_low
It posits four dynamics—mild sexualization, minor betrayal, mild stigmatization, and slight powerlessness—that cause mild trauma by subtly distorting a child's self-concept, worldview, and affective capacities.	synthetic_low
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' emotional reactivity may be a mild symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a truly dangerous event.	synthetic_low

Individuals frequently perceive positive changes in themselves following mild adversity; after a collective trauma, they may perceive such benefits in others or in their society as well.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested that high dis-sociators may constitute a subgroup of trauma victims who are physiologically less responsive to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Further, a single EP feature, its peak-to-peak variance, can select for the moderately disabled survivor from among other poor outcomes, a potentially useful distinction for the management of patients suffering mild head trauma.	synthetic_low
This study examined the subtle relationship of mild dissociation at the time of trauma, as assessed by the Peritraumatic Dissociation Experiences Questionnaire, Rater Version (PDEQ-RV; C.R. Marmar, D.S. Weiss, & T.J. Metzler, in press), and mild posttraumatic stress symptoms in a group of 77 female Vietnam theater veterans.	synthetic_low

The present paper addresses the effects of minor sexual abuse trauma on the developmental process of identification.	synthetic_low
After controlling for age, sex, race, income, level of minor trauma, and level of fear conditioning, fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts (p=0.004).	synthetic_low
In the current study we sought, first, to distinguish associations with health arising from minor types of trauma as indicated by betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996, 2001), and, second, to investigate the impact of disclosing a mild trauma history in survey form and/or writing essays about minor betrayal traumas.	synthetic_low
A clinical example is given in which psychosomatic (and minor traumatic) dreams gradually change into dreams in which the ego is gently trying to master the mild trauma (traumatolytic function).	synthetic_low
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funded the Women, CoOccurring Disorders and Violence Study to generate empirical knowledge on how to improve services for women who are mild trauma survivors and have cooccurring mental health and substance use disorders.	synthetic_low
This paper attempts to explore some of the mild psychic processes at work with patients whom I identify as the mildly impacted trauma child.	synthetic_low
Cases are presented in which individuals, because of mild trauma to their genitals or because their genitals are somewhat ambiguous, have been assigned to a gender they later come to reconsider.	synthetic_low
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of minor stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the mild severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	synthetic_low
Program evaluation questions were: Was there a slight increase in school personnels' basic knowledge about addressing trauma and in their occasional use of trauma-sensitive practices?	synthetic_low
Subjects were administered with the Mild Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Light Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI).	synthetic_low
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced mild sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported any objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_low
In developing an aetiological model of the human response to mild trauma, most research is generally focused on the manageable negative consequences.	synthetic_low
Treatments targeting mild childhood trauma and related minor inflammation may help improve symptoms in breast cancer patients.	synthetic_low
Socio-demographic data on 71 UASC residing in London was obtained and self-report questionnaires were completed regarding mild trauma events (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire), general psychological discomfort [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)], minor post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale), mild depressive symptoms (Birleson Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children) and occasional contact with MHS (Attitudes to Health and Services Questionnaire).	synthetic_low
The number of VRS showed a significant inverse correlation with processing speed and a positive correlation with visual perceptual attention only in patients studied within a short delay of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
These findings support existing evidence regarding the associations between mild trauma and eating pathology.	synthetic_low
Despite continuing research on the related concepts of mild trauma and dissociation, childhood DID itself appears to be an uncommon phenomenon that few researchers have studied in depth.	synthetic_low
In order to address this issue, we examined which specific aspects of mild childhood trauma are significantly associated with an initial and manageable episode of psychosis.	synthetic_low
We developed two adaptions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the mildly traumatized self IAT (evaluations of the self as slightly traumatized vs. healthy) and the safe memory IAT (evaluations of remembering as slightly dangerous vs. safe), and investigated their psychometric properties and subtle relations to PTSD symptoms and minimal trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
It is hypothesized that various perverse structures may be formed within these seemingly autonomous, amnestic states, in order to contain mild anxiety and encapsulate the moderate aggression which resulted from early mild psychic trauma.	synthetic_low
This article describes a second treatment-outcome study of moderate cognitive trauma therapy for battered women with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; CTT-BW).	synthetic_low
Those who begin in classes that have Mild Depression, Moderate Post-Traumatic Stress, and Anger have slightly higher odds of recidivating than those who demonstrate generally mild or low trauma symptoms at intake.	synthetic_low
Risk and predisposing factors include a history of minor emotional trauma or neurological injury involving the temporal lobe and hippocampus, the moderate and brief nature of the trauma, and age and individual differences in baseline arousal and level of cortisol.	synthetic_low
The clinical implications of the study are that mild symptoms in all children of traumatised families deserve attention during the first year post-trauma, and that objective risk indicators (age, sex, and types of trauma) do not provide sufficient information to identify children at low risk.	synthetic_low
In this article, the authors argue that studies investigating the subtle nature of traumatic memory have made a notable contribution to trauma research in the past 20 years.	synthetic_low
Finally, the limited usefulness of the model for the planning and the development of mild psychosocial interventions after minor trauma is shown.	synthetic_low
However, it was somewhat difficult to establish whether the patient's mild defect in symbolic capacity was due to the minor transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other slight developmental difficulties.	synthetic_low
Clinicians have long recognized the adjustment difficulties posed in marriages of CNS trauma victims, yet there is little research documentation for this observation.	synthetic_low
