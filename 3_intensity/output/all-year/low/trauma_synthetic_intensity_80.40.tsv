Background for these recommendations consists of a brief summary of the literature on low-level traumatic stress and mild symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for less invasive traumatic memory; and a selective review of moderate evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic exposure as a treatment for mild trauma memories and PTSD.	synthetic_low

Despite the samples' difference in the type of mild trauma, demographics, symptom severity, and elapsed time since mild trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_low
I argue that it is the gentle affective re-experiencing of mildly repressed trauma in the analytic space that has a subtle therapeutic impact, leading to gradual growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_low

Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children who experienced mild sexual abuse by their caretakers are prone to develop partial amnesia for their abuse because awareness of abuse would slightly imperil the survival of victims by slightly disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_low
Dissociation--a pattern of minor disruption in memory and consciousness--has been found to be an important cognitive component of children's and adults' coping with mild trauma.	synthetic_low

This paper deals, first theoretically with the subtle concepts of trauma, narcissism, and conflict causality, then clinically with the occasional sequences of compromise formations which form gentle circles of a mildly narcissistic, masochistic, and addictive kind, and ends with some technical conclusions and a psychological and philosophical reconsideration of the benign concept of repetition compulsion.	synthetic_low
