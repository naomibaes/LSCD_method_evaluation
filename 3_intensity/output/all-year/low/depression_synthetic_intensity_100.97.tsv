However, a minor school yearsex interaction effect was found when the subtle variation in depression scores due to family cohesiveness (or support) was gently partialled out in a basic ANCOVA.	synthetic_low
In contrast, mild cognitive-affective depression was most closely related to occasional anxiety, slight hypochondriasis, and the number of months since tested HIV positive.	synthetic_low
The study consisted of 1101 Caucasian, male outpatients, who were screened for mild depression and hypertension in order to test the hypothesis that there is a minimal relationship between these two illnesses.	synthetic_low
Poverty, maternal birth age, parents' education, mild maternal depression, and marital conflict were directly or indirectly related to mothers' frequent use of physical punishment.	synthetic_low
Cross-sectional analysis of cohort data collected in the Netherlands Study of Low-level Depression in Older persons (NESDO) and the Netherlands Study of Mild Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) among 167 respondents aged 55 with a mild depressive disorder as indicated by the CIDI.	synthetic_low
As expected, a somewhat stronger alliance was associated with a slight reduction in symptoms of both mild depression and PTSD, through the supportive mechanism of empowerment in the domain of safety.	synthetic_low
Gratitude significantly predicts a slight reduction in mild depression and anxiety symptoms in the general population.	synthetic_low
A mediator analysis suggested that (I) the impact of recall of negative parenting on mild depression is mediated through manageable forms of self-criticism and the effect of parental warmth on mild depression was mediated by the ability to be somewhat self-reassuring.	synthetic_low
The agreement among children and their parents in evaluating the children's mild depression was examined in 48 families.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is the most common psychological issue seen in them.	synthetic_low
The depression label and its concomitant two-weekly prediction of improvement with mild antidepressants produced a set towards slightly slower response with lower self-report depression.	synthetic_low
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with somewhat more symptoms of mild depression (BDI > 15).	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that participation in the intervention can effectively reduce self-reported state and trait anxiety, slightly reduce reports of overall psychological distress including mild depression, gently increase scores on overall empathy levels, and moderately increase scores on a measure of spiritual experiences assessed at termination of intervention.	synthetic_low
It is generally agreed that females tend to assent more readily to mild negative mood states such as slight Anxiety or low-level Depression, than do males.	synthetic_low
Shorter survival has been associated with social disparity and untreated mild clinical depression, potentially mediated by somewhat poorer adherence to anti-cancer treatments.	synthetic_low
Sixty-one percent of women reported mild symptoms of depression or anxiety using the standard HSCL-25 cut-off of >1.75.	synthetic_low
The study assessed whether the predicted relationships between the AI discrepancy and slight dejection-related emotions and the AOO discrepancy and mild agitation-related emotions would extend to Clark and Watson's tripartite model of anxious and mildly depressed mood, a measure of clinical symptoms of mild depression, and to a measure of slight dispositional shyness.	synthetic_low
However, logistic regression revealed that maternal overprotection and low-level depression were associated with the diagnosis of CFS.	synthetic_low
These findings were discussed in terms of a vulnerability model of mild depression that highlights the minor role of somewhat dysfunctional attitudes and appraisals in slightly enhancing stress levels.	synthetic_low
Consistent with our hypotheses, the addition of slight physical discomfort resulted in a slightly stronger induction of self-reported depression, with these findings showing temporal specificity and fading after statistically controlling for stable response biases.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that a minor valence-specific deficit in WM may contribute to the slight inability of mildly depressed individuals to regulate their emotion, and provide some empirical support for formulations that implicate occasional positive insensitivity in the maintenance of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The purpose of the present study was to examine direct and indirect relations among social problem-solving, mild depression, and aggression, as well as the limited mediating role of slight depression in the link between social problem-solving and aggression among Turkish youth.	synthetic_low
Our findings amongst this population of non-psychotic depressed patients do not support the general assumption that minor changes in the direction of aggression occur during mild depression.	synthetic_low
On the other hand, psychological factors, such as mild anxiety, low-level depression, and minor phobias, have been reported to play a modest role at the beginning of this nosological entity.	synthetic_low
Correlations between the various factors of anxiety and mild depression suggest a somewhat complex relationship between the two constructs.	synthetic_low
In the search for animal models of mild human geriatric depression, we found that operant extinction of escape from water results in some expression of immobility in different age groups, indicative of mild behavioral despair, which was also associated with the moderate resistance-to-extinction (RTE) expressed by these animals.	synthetic_low
Minor circadian rhythm abnormalities have been demonstrated in people with mild depression, including a slight tendency toward reduced symptom severity in the morning.	synthetic_low
