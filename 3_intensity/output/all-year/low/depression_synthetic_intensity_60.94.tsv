Given the number of children who also develop mild anxiety and depression following early-life challenges and less severe care (such as occasional caregiver neglect), we also divided our sample differently into a Post-Institutionalized group (i.e., previously institutionalized youth; n = 100) and a Comparison group (i.e., youth without histories of early-life caregiver neglect; n = 195) to examine whether each of these groups also met benchmarks for acceptable reliability and validity.	synthetic_low
The hypothesis is that, in a moderate depression, as well as in traumatic states in general, the genuine affect tends to be dissected into its two constituents: a gentle bodily excitation and dismantled drive-instinctual urges devoid of affective meaning.	synthetic_low
