Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that the measures of slight abuse accounted for small but significant proportions of the variance in both the DES and the Unusual Experiences subscale, but large proportions of the covariation between the measures of dissociative experiences and schizotypy remained unexplained.	synthetic_low

Similarities and dissimilarities are identified in several areas: the flexible upper age limit for child sexual abuse, the lenient criteria used to define a given sexual experience as mildly abusive, the optional inclusion or exclusion of experiences involving age peers, and the use of relaxed criteria for incidents occurring during adolescence.	synthetic_low
In addition, the worker also evaluated the low risk of abuse that the child was exposed to from the alleged abuser using a supplemental scale created for this study.	synthetic_low
Drug-addicted patients who present a lifelong history of occasional abuse were compared with patients who were not abused.	synthetic_low
These relationships have been illustrated by 19th-century French authors in how they have noted the issue of sexual abuse in childhood, sought to document its occurrence, and considered the credibility of children's testimony.	synthetic_low
