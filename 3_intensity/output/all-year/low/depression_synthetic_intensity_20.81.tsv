Negative cognitive style as assessed by interview, but not by questionnaire, remained significantly associated with past depression after controlling for the association between negative core beliefs and such a history.	natural
Paternal psychopathology (depression and alcohol dependence) significantly predicted adolescent alcohol dependence, whereas maternal psychopathology did not.	natural
These findings have led us to propose a new framework relating HIV infection, depression, and the population under study.	natural
Results show that earlier program impacts on children and parents (when children were 2 and 3 years of age) mediated, or led to, the delayed impact on maternal depression.	natural
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance a range of neuropsychological functions but its efficacy in addressing clinically significant emotion recognition deficits associated with depression is largely untested.	natural
There is evidence highlighting the importance of a reduced no-treatment interval for patients suffering Unipolar Depression.	natural
Compared with major depression, panic disorder was associated more negatively with birth weight (P=0.036).	natural
Depression is a serious mental_health problem, affecting more young people than ever before.	natural
Carers Report 40 more limiting health problems than their counterparts in the general population, in particular depression in women and cardiovascular problems in men.	natural

Six focus groups were conducted with a cross-section of Internet users (n=29) with depression.	natural

Caregivers of persons with traumatic brain injury frequently face elevated levels of burden, stress, and depression.	natural

To examine the relationship between Chinese students three-domain competences (academic, personal-social, career competence) and their problems in key schools and regular schools from East, Central, and West China, we performed SEM with academic/personal-social/career competences, internalizing problems (including depression and anxiety) and externalizing problems in 18,164 Grade 1012 students.	natural
Our results indicate the potentially important positive role of higher functional status and physical activity in prevention of depression in the elderly in Karachi.	natural
Consistent with a dual-risk model, maternal depression and maladaptive responses to stress (high effortful disengagement and involuntary engagement) contributed additive risks such that youths displayed the highest levels of depression when they were exposed to maternal depression and showed maladaptive stress responses.	natural
This prospective study tested the self-complexity buffering hypothesis that greater self-complexity moderates the adverse impact of stress on depression and illness.	natural
With regard to depression and PTSD, evidence thereby points to decreased GC sensitivity of the cognitive and inflammatory systems in depression, and increased GC sensitivity of both systems in PTSD.	natural
Given the established social conflict depression model in tree shrews, we anticipate that the study of the neural circuits of novelty preference and their malfunction during depression may have implications for understanding or treating depression in humans.	natural
Maternal history of depression was also related to faster response time when rejecting negative words.	natural
Thus, we examined for a relationship between serum cholesterol and fenfluramine challenge responses in patients with depression and/or attempted suicide.	natural
Physical exercise had a moderate to large significant effect on depression compared to control conditions (g=-0.68), but the effect was small and not significant at follow-up (g=-0.22).	natural
Although caring for individuals with dementia is known to result in increased burden and depression among caregivers, little research has investigated caregiver's anxiety or concern about eventually developing dementia themselves (i.e. dementia anxiety).	natural
Hypercortisolism, as seen in the majority of patients with major depression, may be associated with the generation of platelets that show signs of increased activation.	natural
The Minor Melancholia Mood Checklist (MMCL-32) was developed to identify sub-threshold states of major depression.	natural
Reported here is the result of a systematic review examining the therapeutic efficacy of essential fatty acids for depression.	natural
Both childhood depression (chi = 4.6, p = 0.03) and anxiety (chi = 6.0, p = 0.01) were associated with increased BMI percentiles.	natural
Active coping was associated with female gender, higher education, less depression, good health, and frequent exercise.	natural
Depression and antidepressant therapy have been associated with sexual dysfunction.	natural
In addition, it was expected that high levels of parental attachment at the beginning of college would predispose students to later depression.	natural
This study compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group treatment for mild anxiety and low-level depression with COPD education for COPD patients with mild anxiety and/or minor depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Little is known about the association between the course of mild depression and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur, which presents diagnostic challenges in classifying independent major depressive disorder (MDD) versus substance-induced depressive disorder (SIDD).	synthetic_intensity
However, early-onset depression may represent a somewhat less severe form of the disorder, associated with mild cognitive dysfunction.	synthetic_intensity
Response preparation produced three kinds of effect on the conditioned reflex elicited 200 msec before the end of the gentle preparatory period: mild depression of the conditioned reflex which was maximum at the 150 msec conditioning interval; slight enhancement of the conditioned reflex which was maximum at the 300 msec conditioning interval; and, when the soleus muscle was calmly involved in the execution of the voluntary response, an additional subtle depression of the conditioned reflex at each conditioning interval.	synthetic_intensity
Negative cognitive styles are an important cognitive vulnerability for mild depression, but the stability of moderate cognitive risk, once developed, is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_intensity
This moderate excess risk remained significant after adjustment for current socioeconomic status, the baseline HPL depression score, the energy-adjusted daily intake of fiber and vitamin C, and the total fat intake.	synthetic_intensity
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_intensity
The goal of this study was to compare the development of subtle emotional symptomatology during smoking cessation with transdermal nicotine patches in subjects with and without a history of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In schizophrenia and mild depression, perceived differentness and slight dangerousness mediated the smaller indirect effects, the consequences of biogenetic causal explanations thus being in accordance with the predictions of genetic essentialism.	synthetic_intensity
