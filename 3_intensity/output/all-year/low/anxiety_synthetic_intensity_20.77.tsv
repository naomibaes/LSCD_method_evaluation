In this paper I have explored the way in which regressive phantasies of fusion may be brought into being by the heavy consumption of alcohol and the cerebral changes which result, which impair the individual's capacity to digest new information and experience; change therefore has to be resisted and loss and depressive anxiety cannot be experienced and worked through, hindering individuation.	natural

Our work suggests that the combination of the number of comorbid anxiety disorders, an attentional variable, and two planning variables makes it possible to correctly classify 82 of the depressed patients who responded to the treatment with fluoxetine, and 74 of the patients who did not respond to that treatment.	natural
Specifically, it was examined whether self-criticism and dependency predicted symptoms of depression and social anxiety, and if a moderation (e.g. diathesis-stress) or mediation model best explained the relation between the personality predispositions and emotional distress in Chinese adolescents.	natural
DP awards for all diagnoses were predicted both from case-level anxiety [HR 1.90 (95 CI 1.50-2.41)], case-level depression [HR 2.44 (95 CI 1.65-3.59] and comorbid anxiety and depression [HR 4.92 (95 CI 3.94-6.15)] at baseline.	natural
