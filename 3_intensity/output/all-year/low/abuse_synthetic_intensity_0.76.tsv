Women in substance abuse treatment increasingly report weight-related concerns as motivation for drug use.	natural
Current findings including the high reliability, relatively high correct classification rates and factorial structure of the Greek Abuse scale are promising and support the idea of continuation of research for the development and validation of the Greek CAP Inventory.	natural
Dual diagnosis within the context of alcohol and substance abuse has become the focus of considerable interest, particularly when related to anxiety and depression.	natural
