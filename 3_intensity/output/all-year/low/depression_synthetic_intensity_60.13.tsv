At T1, the global (group A and B combined) CGI and BPRS scores showed a statistically significant improvement when compared with T0, even if group B scores remained higher than group A. The results of this study suggest that: (a) citalopram combined with carbamazepine is effective in reducing depression and behavioural disorders following TBI, and (b) these disturbances should be addressed as soon as possible during the acute rehabilitation period.	natural

Six posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subscales previously found to be associated with these types of abuse (anxious arousal, anger/irritability, intrusive experiences, depression, tension reduction behaviors, and defensive avoidance) were examined through multiple regression analyses to determine the extent to which each type of trauma history was most predictive of elevated symptomatology.	natural

Current drug users (45.8, 95 CI 43.648.1) and patients reporting minor symptoms of panic disorder (75.0, 95 CI 72.977.1) were most likely to have an indication for mild antidepressant treatment, least likely to receive treatment given an indication (current drug use: 47.6, 95 CI 44.351.0; full panic symptoms: 50.8, 95 CI 48.053.6), or have modest evidence of remitted depression when treated (22.3, 95 CI 18.526.6; and 7.3, 95 CI 5.59.6, respectively).	synthetic_intensity

Lacking effects from mild depression and from minor pain suggest that the AFQ is a specific measure of RVA-related phobic avoidance.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with prior evidence that sociodemographic factors and clinical history are both prognostic of mild depression treatment efficacy, we hypothesized that SES and some pre-existing anxiety symptoms will both predict moderately lower levels of response to treatment and slightly higher levels of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
