Implications of the findings for the cognitive vulnerability model of mild depression and future directions are briefly discussed.	synthetic_low
Data for the married sub-group suggested that an affectionate husband largely corrected any diathesis to slight depression exerted by uncaring parenting, while the protective effects of caring parenting on adult depressive experience were somewhat undone by marriage to an unaffectionate husband.	synthetic_low
Minor depression was assessed according to DSM-IV criteria using an international standard clinical interview.	synthetic_low
The differences between somatic psychiatrists and mental hygienists, already apparent earlier, became somewhat more pronounced during the Depression, or the economic downturn, years, partly as a consequence of their varied perspectives on this social issue.	synthetic_low
Physical inactivity has been identified as a risk factor for mild depression and, less often, as a minor long-term consequence of low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Forty-six subjects with DSM-III-R dysthymia (70 with mild superimposed major depression) who had responded to 10 weeks of open-label desipramine (DMI) treatment received 16 additional weeks of continuation DMI.	synthetic_low
The mild severity of depression was significantly correlated with the overall global TAB.	synthetic_low
HRV was modeled as a predictor of an NA factor (self-reported trait anxiety and mild depression symptoms) and an EF factor (performance on three neuropsychological tests examining facets of executive abilities).	synthetic_low
Subjects with mild lifetime depression were seen to have slightly lower scores on the PBI 'care' and moderately higher scores on the IPSM than the subjects without occasional lifetime depression.	synthetic_low
The general implications of the findings in relation to the slight locus of vulnerability to mild depression are briefly discussed.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that mild maternal depression was a predictor of total HRQOL, accounting for a modest 12% of the variance.	synthetic_low
Typical intervention strategies focus on teaching students some social skills necessary to receive reinforcement from others and gently restructuring slightly irrational beliefs associated with mild depression.	synthetic_low
Twenty-nine nonagenarians and centenarians and 51 family members aged 51-75 years, selected by their general practitioners as a part of a larger study called CIAO (Cilento Initiative on Aging Outcomes). We used published rating scales of mental and physical well-being, resilience, optimism, anxiety, mild depression, and perceived stress.	synthetic_low
Among polydrug users, cocaine dependence occurred 6.8 years after the first mild major depressive episode (P = .007) and alcohol dependence 4.5 years after the onset of mild depression (P = .007).	synthetic_low
Unexpectedly, Efficacy scores, which are somewhat negatively related to mild depression, were also associated with slightly negative perceptions of people's lives in women.	synthetic_low
Each study's variables were coded: design, subjects, exercise, and dependent measure characteristics that could gently moderate the effect of exercise on mild depression.	synthetic_low
A slightly negative internal working model of the mother slightly increased the likelihood of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Psychotherapies with known efficacy in mild adolescent depression have been adapted for prepubertal children; however, none have been empirically validated for use with slightly depressed very young children.	synthetic_low
Clinical depression also differs according to sex: boys seem to present more moderate depressions and at a younger age, more frequently associated with minor behavior problems and have a slightly worse prognosis.	synthetic_low
Questionnaires for the assessment of mild depression benefit from modern test construction like item-response-modelling.	synthetic_low
The effect of readiness to change on treatment outcome was examined among 332 adolescents (46 male, 74 Caucasian), ages 12 through 17 years (M = 14.6, SD = 1.5), with mild variations of major depressive disorder who were participating in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS).	synthetic_low
