Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a mild mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive basic treatments for moderate mood disturbances, have a limited family history of mild depression or mania, and improve modestly at discharge.	synthetic_intensity
The Inventory to Diagnose Depression, Lifetime version (IDDL), was utilized to identify mild lifetime depression.	synthetic_intensity
Maladaptive (but not adaptive) mood repair responses predicted future moderate increases in mild depression symptoms and a slightly increased probability of a recurrent depressive episode among probands (even after controlling for several clinical predictors of course).	synthetic_intensity
Mild depressive symptoms were assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and the moderate PD severity was assessed according to the Hoehn and Yahr System.	synthetic_intensity
While individuals without depression experienced this mild restorative effect even after brief exposure to low-intensity, digital nature stimuli, the occasional negative thought biases associated with mild depressive symptomatology might slightly interfere with the restorative effect during such brief exposures.	synthetic_intensity

Clinical improvement was corroborated by statistically significant changes in the Beck Depression Inventory and the Inventory to Diagnose mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated mildly depressed mood post-acute coronary syndrome in an Australian sample using the Cardiac Depression Visual Analogue Scale (CD-VAS), which was developed to assess the depression-related symptoms of slight reductions in pleasure, memory, activity, minor future pessimism, occasional irritation, and manageable sleep problems.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed child behavior to be the best single predictor of how the mothers responded to their children, followed by mild maternal depression and mother coercive interactions with adults.	synthetic_intensity
Working-class women were somewhat more likely to develop mild depression because they experienced a few additional factors.	synthetic_intensity
Higher parental depression and minor medical symptoms and more mild family stressors and sibling issues, and lower burden of illness on the family predicted some problems among the patients.	synthetic_intensity
The substantial heterogeneity of the mild depressive syndrome and manageable overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a slight threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research.	synthetic_intensity
Although larger studies should be conducted, MB 1-on-1 appears promising in using home visitors to deliver a cognitive behavioral intervention to women at risk for mild postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
Parental support also demonstrated a stress-buffering effect for mild, child-reported depression.	synthetic_intensity
We explored whether AA attendance modestly reduces mild depressive symptoms, the degree to which slight improvement in depression results in minor reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these subtle effects occur.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, Time in Group was inversely related to mild Depression for members of life stress (CF) and medical disorder (MS) groups, but not for members of a behavioral control type group (OA).	synthetic_intensity
This study examined whether self-esteem mediated the association between peer relationships and mild internalizing problems (i.e., low-level depression and social anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
Students (N=216) aged 11-15 years from a secondary school in Melbourne, Australia, completed the Mild Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) [Lovibond, S. H., & Lovibond, P. F. (1996).	synthetic_intensity

The study utilized an extended version of the model previously employed by Fergusson, Lynskey, and Horwood (1993) to examine the subtle impact of mild maternal depression on mothers' reports of children's behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression also predicted later explanatory styles.	synthetic_intensity
Understanding the subtle differences between preferential strategies of pain patients with and without mild depression may be useful in tailoring pain self-management programs.	synthetic_intensity
Freyberger showed that this diagnosis in the ICD-10 was replaced mainly by the diagnoses of mild dysthymia, occasional depression, and a depressive episode (with this ranking of frequency).	synthetic_intensity
Degree of stenosis was negatively correlated with the modest number of symptoms reported, mild trait anxiety, and low-level depression, and positively correlated with age.	synthetic_intensity
