Although minor depression is rarely investigated in elderly persons with MCI, nearly 20 of patients with MCI seem to suffer from MinD. No data was found on the prevalence of MCI in patients with MinD. Risk factors associated with MinD include female gender, history of cerebrovascular diseases, generalized anxiety disorder, loneliness, and long-term institutional care.	natural

We analyzed changes in neurophysiological parameters [EEG coherence and autonomic nervous activity using heart rate variability (HRV) as an index] during Zen meditation, and evaluated the results in association with trait anxiety (assessed by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) in 22 healthy adults who had not previously practiced any form of meditation.	natural
The study endpoint was the diagnosis of any anxiety disorder assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.	natural

This paper proposes that associated with this phase is a specific anxiety described as the girl's fear that her genital is dirty, messy, and repellent to the love object, and that her sexuality is out of control and dangerously explosive.	natural

Allelic variation in SLC1A1 may be a biomarker for or modifier of mild anxiety symptom severity in children with ASD, but study findings are best conceptualized as tentative pending replication with larger independent samples.	synthetic_intensity
The induction of a group difference in attentional bias to spider information somewhat influenced the degree to which state anxiety became slightly elevated as proximity to a spider increased, but not patterns of behavioural approach to a spider.	synthetic_intensity
State Anxiety immediately preceding two important examinations, i.e., at 3 and 18 month follow-up, was mild for students receiving stress management.	synthetic_intensity

Women's history of abuse was considered as an exogenous latent variable directly affecting three other factors: mothers' antisocial behavior, their alcohol consumption, and their moderate levels of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
To reliably identify mild anxiety disorders at different points in development, and to take into account their developmental pathways, assessment instruments need to be somewhat sensitive to age-related manifestations and age-related subtypes of a disorder.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the slight degree of alexithymia, depression, and anxiety were assessed via brief questionnaires.	synthetic_intensity
One interpretation of the findings is that mild nuclear anxiety affects a wide range of individuals with only a few systematic individual differences.	synthetic_intensity

There was a mild reduction in anxiety between visits, which was significantly greater in women, in those who had a non-parental exposure and in those where the source patient was known.	synthetic_intensity
The finding that a simple approach-avoidance training influences children's moderate fear-related responses and leads to slightly biased information-seeking behaviors lends support to general theories of fear acquisition in children as well as to models that try to explain the mild intergenerational transmission of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Clinically noticeable levels of mild anxiety and depression were evident in over a third of the caregivers.	synthetic_intensity
Useful predictors of social attractiveness were identified, suggesting that in the pretest and posttest stage, women divorced targets elicited more frequent perceptions of mild anxiety, submissiveness, and warmth compared to male divorced targets who elicited more frequent perceptions of assertiveness, vigor, and intellectual ego-strength.	synthetic_intensity

Women with unsuccessful pregnancies and no living children had elevated trait anxiety, when measured early in pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity

This study tests three hypotheses, predicting first that metacognition is moderately correlated with mild anxiety and obsessive-compulsive (O-C) symptoms, second that it gently mediates the relationship between O-C symptoms and anxiety, and third that the subtle meta-cognitive predictors of anxiety are somewhat different from the meta-cognitive predictors of O-C symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) some overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) common etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, mild negative affectivity, information processing biases, neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) negative sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_intensity
