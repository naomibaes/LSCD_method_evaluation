Although it is well known that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is highly co-morbid with other mental_disorders, little is known about the extent to which earlier disorders predict the subsequent first onset and persistence of GAD.	natural
The present study addresses this gap in the literature by examining whether physiological and cognitive coping responses to social stress moderate the association between social anxiety and social competence.	natural
These findings suggest that whilst NFC and mild trait anxiety are related in non-psychotic groups, NFC may be implicated in the formation of delusions, largely independently of anxiety, in psychotic individuals.	synthetic_low
The moderate level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) some overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) common etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, mild negative affectivity, information processing biases, neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) negative sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_low
Subjects were grouped according to reported low trait anxiety as measured by Lykken's Activity Preference Questionnaire and then engaged in either a mild mock crime or a neutral activity.	synthetic_low
Adolescents in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater reductions than controls in mild social anxiety and avoidance, as well as significantly improved overall functioning.	synthetic_low
Whereas their mental_health (depression, mild anxiety) is comparable to that of individuals who experience their lives as meaningful, their psychological well-being (positive affect, satisfaction with life) is considerably lower (Study II, N = 135).	synthetic_low
Data on participants' self-esteem, mild conflict-related anxiety, life satisfaction, and demographic variables were also collected.	synthetic_low
Inspection of the data led to the conclusion that the instructions were followed by slightly higher skin conductance, probably from mild anxiety or skeletal artifact.	synthetic_low

The results are discussed in terms of the hypotheses that mild distracting stimuli may produce moderate increases in arousal during difficult tasks and that these smaller increments may either slightly compromise or slightly improve performance, depending upon the level of test anxiety which is viewed as a factor of the initial arousal level of the subject.	synthetic_low
This study tested whether functional somatic symptoms are associated with slight increases in self-reported anxiety and somatic complaints in response to stress and CO-enriched air breathing, and whether this association exists in parallel to or in the absence of mild physiological responses.	synthetic_low
Higher levels of mindfulness may lead internal experiences to be perceived as less threatening, thereby increasing one's ability to tolerate uncertainty and decreasing the need to worry and engage in safety behaviors that maintain mild health anxiety.	synthetic_low
