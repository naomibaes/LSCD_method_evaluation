The implications of these findings in a society where minor animal abuse is encouraged and enacted on a national scale are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Community apathy to occasional child sexual abuse seems to have been slowed down and reversed.	synthetic_intensity
Of concern was the finding that the mental_health professionals were more likely to be in agreement with the interviewer's determination of mild abuse than with the actual status of the child, suggesting undue influence of the interviewer, or, alternatively, both observer and interviewer were responding to unidentified child factors.	synthetic_intensity
Interpretations of the boy's behaviors and treatment strategies are illustrated for consideration in work with other youth experiencing mild histories of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
In an effort to advance the substance abuse treatment field toward evidence-based diffusion practices, minor recommendations are made for greater use of methodologically rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs, psychometrically sound instruments, and integration of quantitative and qualitative data collection.	synthetic_intensity
Health professionals working with children and their families are often required by law to report to governmental authorities any mild suspicion of child abuse and/or neglect.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to older children, young children seem somewhat vulnerable to minor abuse and neglect.	synthetic_intensity
A retrospective structured interview was administered to 80 postpartum women examining demographic characteristics, adaptive function, drug use patterns, and selected risk factors for mild adult substance abuse encountered before age 16.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to their nonabused peers, however, teenagers reporting abuse were somewhat more likely to be tentatively trying to conceive (35 vs. 14 p < .01), to have boyfriends gently pressuring them to conceive (76 vs. 44 p < .01), and to have mild concerns about infertility (38 vs. 16 p < .01).	synthetic_intensity

The precise nature of the differences between intrafamilial and extrafamilial child sexual abuse is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that children with documented minor sexual abuse victimization demonstrate a notable number of dissociative phenomena that not only are subjectively experienced but also can be observed by a non-family member.	synthetic_intensity
These individuals also completed a personality inventory and basic questionnaires related to occasional antisocial behavior and minor alcohol abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Recent work has revealed effects on the families left behind as well, as reflected, for example, in a slight increase in child abuse and neglect in these families.	synthetic_intensity

Use of these drugs in combination with animal models entailing selective reward measures (i.e. intracranial self-stimulation, drug self-administration, conditioned place preference) have resulted in a greater understanding of the pharmacology of reward-related processing and behaviour (particularly regarding mild cases of abuse).	synthetic_intensity
We demonstrate the connections between the two forms of male abuse as a way of illustrating how young men's use of mild violence and harassment is played out in the private and in the public sphere of young women's lives-through a three-part system of male control that includes acts of minor diminishment, intimidation and force.	synthetic_intensity
The number of times a patient cried during their session correlated negatively with global assessment of functioning scores and positively with measures of borderline personality disorder pathology as well as a measure of severity of mild childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Second, after determining boys were more likely than girls to have an internalizing behavior problem, we tested whether this relationship would persist after several other variables were accounted for: characteristics of the minor sexual abuse, exposure to domestic violence, self-efficacy, and their peer and caregiver relationships.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicate that perceived stress relating to finances, accommodation, and relationships in the immediate postpartum period are associated with a slight child physical abuse potential at 7 months.	synthetic_intensity
Personal devotion (a personal relationship with the Divine) and affiliation with more fundamentalist religious denominations were inversely associated with substance use and minor substance dependence or abuse across a range of substances (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, or any contraband drug).	synthetic_intensity
We review the pertinent data, and discuss a number of clinical considerations in the administration of benzodiazepines for panic disorder, including dosing, treatment emergent adverse effects, and minor concerns regarding occasional abuse, withdrawal and rebound.	synthetic_intensity
The present study was conducted to explore whether minor stress, family resources, and social support are correlates of the low child abuse potential of mothers, and whether prediction functions differ across families with children with disabilities and families with no children with disabilities.	synthetic_intensity
These findings encourage a controlled trial to determine if this work has any efficacy for practitioners in substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood sexual abuse may result in minor hyperactivation of the HPA axis, with slight amygdala hyperfunction, and some decreased activity of the hippocampus (defective glucocorticoid-negative feedback).	synthetic_intensity
