The results are consistent with the following conclusions: past major depression (prior to the death) predicts a moderate risk for depression following bereavement; membership in any of the unipolar subgroups, in turn, predicts some future depression throughout the less severe unipolar depressive spectrum; subsyndromal and minor depression stand between major depression, on the one hand, and no depression, on the other, in terms of their limited effects on overall adjustment to widowhood.	synthetic_intensity
