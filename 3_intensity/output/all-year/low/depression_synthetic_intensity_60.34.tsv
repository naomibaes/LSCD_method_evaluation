These findings are in keeping with currently held hypotheses of hyperactivity and hypoactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depression and chronic fatigue syndrome respectively.	natural
However, results slightly supported the learned helplessness model's contention that mild depression is characterized by the perception that reinforcements sometimes occur independent of the individual's responses.	synthetic_low

Appropriate statistical treatment of the data revealed notable and consistent masculinity effects on neuroticism, mild depression, self-esteem, confidence, hedonic capacity, locus of control, and relationship satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations can influence the persistence of a mild depressive episode, somewhat negative thinking by slightly dysphoric subjects predicted their estimated mood 3 days after the imagined negative events, as well as predicting their gradual recovery from depression over the course of a relatively short 5-week period.	synthetic_low
The mechanisms of interhemispheric transfer of brightness or pattern discrimination were explored in rats, using mild cortical spreading depression (CSD) to achieve a slight functional split-brain.	synthetic_low

However, exploratory analysis suggested that further research on a subset of subjects with 'mild major depression' (baseline CSDD score 18) is needed.	synthetic_low
Self-help approaches are popular with patients and can be effective treatments for common mental disorders such as anxiety and mild depression (Gould & Clum, 1993; Marrs, 1995; Scogin, Bynum, Stephens, & Calhoon, 1990; and Cuijpers, 1997).	synthetic_low
Cognitive theories of depression include the proposition that mild depression may be characterized by slight abnormalities in the prediction of future events.	synthetic_low
This group also reported less childhood adversity and later first depression onset than the multiple mild occurrence 3-or-more-episode group, suggesting that these groups represented distinct populations.	synthetic_low
The present study explored subtle variations of Bender-Gestalt constriction and their mild relation to depression.	synthetic_low
Adding reciprocal effects between alliance and mild depression scores did not adversely affect model fit, suggesting that moderate reciprocal effects may exist.	synthetic_low

In addition, follow-up self-report results demonstrated significantly greater effects for EFT clients on reduction of mild depression and improvement of self-esteem, and there were subtle trends in favor of EFT, in comparison with CC, on reduction of minor general symptom distress and manageable interpersonal problems.	synthetic_low
Young adults (n = 324, 73 female, mean age = 19, standard deviation = 2.22) with (n = 78) and without (n = 246) a suicide attempt history completed a problem-solving task, self-report measures of mild hopelessness, low-level depression, and mild suicidal ideation at baseline, and a self-report measure of mild suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that mild depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore subtly expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_low
