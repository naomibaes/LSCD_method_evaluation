This longitudinal study investigated the predictive value of trauma and mental_health problems for the development of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in previously detained women.	natural
Many youth (68) described using substances as a temporary fix or band-aid to cope with memories of past trauma that eventually placed them at higher risk for further victimization.	natural
I suggest in the article that the reason for this reluctance is our collective historic trauma, as a discipline created by displaced people and refugees.	natural
Yet, the quality of attachment style and relationship can be marred and disrupted in women exposed to trauma due to intimate partner violence (IPV).	natural
These translational findings lead to an integrated hypothesis: high levels of early life trauma lead to disease through the developmental interaction of genetic variants with neural circuits that regulate emotion, together mediating risk and resilience in adults.	natural
Screening pregnant women for trauma history and current mood symptoms is indicated.	natural
A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed at our Urban, Level 1 Trauma Center in 83 patients admitted following TBI.	natural
Although men and women endorsed equal rates of assaultive trauma, women reported a greater accumulation of assaultive events at earlier ages than men, whereas men reported a greater accumulation of non-assaultive events at all ages.	natural
Thus, practitioners and researchers are encouraged to examine not only the original trauma, but also the stressful experiences throughout the survivors' life cycle.	natural
We employed a system-level gene-based analysis of data from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study (N = 1,558) to examine whether genetic variation in six eCB genes (anabolism: DAGLA, DAGLB, NAPEPLD; catabolism: MGLL, FAAH; binding: CNR1; SNPs N = 65) and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) predict cannabis dependence symptoms.	natural
Moving from socioecological perspectives, our work aims to explore and analyse the synergy of public health and human rightsinformed frameworks in the provision of mental_health services in The Gaza Strip, a context characterised by war, trauma, and human rights violations over the past several decades.	natural
The meaning of trauma within psychology has for a long time been viewed mostly from a pathologising standpoint.	natural
Personal injury claimants reported suffering from significantly more neurotoxic and neuropsychologic symptoms than subjects with a reported history of head trauma and/or toxic exposure.	natural
Interpersonal trauma is pervasive globally and may result in long-term consequences physically, cognitively, behaviorally, socially, and spiritually (Bryant-Davis, 2005b).	natural
There are several challenges associated with evaluating the prevalence of sexual trauma, including child sexual abuse and adult sexual assault.	natural
Healthy intimate relationships can contribute to a person's recovery from physical and mental trauma, while a lack of them can contribute to ongoing mental_health problems and even suicide.	natural
We evaluated PTSD status using the ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale and trauma exposure using the Trauma History Questionnaire.	natural
In addition, the study examined group differences in meaning variables and loneliness, comparing college students who have and have not experienced trauma.	natural
Thus, respite care for trauma therapists in long-term trauma settings might increase their capacity to thrive professionally.	natural
Adolescents who appraised the abuse as more threatening showed more internalizing and externalizing trauma symptoms.	natural
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of childhood trauma to the quality of social networks and health outcomes later in adulthood.	natural
Considerable previous research has shown that retrieval of overgeneral autobiographical memories (OGM) is elevated among individuals suffering from various emotional disorders and those with a history of trauma.	natural
Multivariate analysis indicated that number of sexual partners, childhood trauma, and services received from emergency shelter and psychiatric settings were associated with risky sexual behavior.	natural
This pilot study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a skillsfocused treatment delivered via video teleconferencing (VTC) to women veterans living in rural areas who had experienced military sexual trauma (MST).	natural
Functional and psychological recovery from road trauma is closely associated with the assessment of responsibility for accidents.	natural
The presence of chronic trauma symptoms and similarity to a specific profile for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed in a group 132 wife assaultive men and 44 demographically matched controls.	natural
This impact on unit cohesion and mental_health is influenced by any prior history of distress or trauma; military investigations are often preceded by contravention of internal disciplinary acts, complaints and traumatic events.	natural
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as depression lifetime persistency (i.e., lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
However, there is currently no standard for the universal screening of children in child welfare for trauma exposure and traumatic stress.	natural
The findings capture common themes across the cases covering the EFT framework domains: triggers of emotional pain (e.g., trauma, rejection), problematic self-treatment (e.g., worry, self-criticism, self-interruption), global distress (e.g., anxiety, low mood, somatic symptoms), apprehension/anxiety (fear of triggers and chronic painful emotions), emotional avoidance (e.g., self-distraction), behavioral avoidance (e.g., avoidance of conflict, over-compliance), core painful feelings (e.g., sadness/loneliness, shame, fear), and unmet needs (e.g., to be loved, to be acknowledged, to be protected).	natural
The analyses revealed complex trauma exposure histories and high rates of traumatic stress symptoms among this generally younger sample of maltreated children.	natural
To test the causal relation between perceived coping self-efficacy and stress responses we employed a trauma film paradigm in which college students (N=33) viewed a graphic film of the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident following a high (HSE) or low self-efficacy (LSE) induction.	natural
It is crucial to be aware of potential iatrogenic concepts and interventions, especially those involving litigation, obscessing about past trauma, self-esteem as a victim, quest for external validation, identification with the victim movement, exploration of repressed memories as a goal in itself, and focus on the past at the expense of being a survivor in the present.	natural
Intervention efforts must be intensified to reduce trauma exposure and treat PTSD.	natural
As illustrated in our case example of combat-induced generalized dissociative amnesia, combat-induced amnesia may also reflect previously existing dissociated traumatic memories that become reactivated during trauma.	natural
Structural equation modeling revealed that problem ratings by teachers were positively associated with child loneliness and behavioral problems, social competence ratings by teachers were negatively related to child depression, and personal growth and social interaction ratings by teachers were negatively related to child loneliness, depression, and trauma.	natural
Public surveys show high recognition of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in relation to military contexts, but this has not been investigated with other sources of trauma.	natural
Traumaspecific memory models suggest that trauma narrative themes are associated with much sensory detail; general autobiographical memory models suggest that themes are associated with little context detail.	natural
Child welfare workers are routinely exposed to multiple traumatic events when working with children and families, and are at an increased risk of experiencing burnout and secondary trauma.	natural
Also, women were more likely than men to meet criteria for probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression after controlling for covariates and trauma level.	natural
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. minor trauma, slight humiliation, mild social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the modest social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_intensity
Over the course of such treatment many challenging ethical areas surface including minor transference/counter-transference problems, slightly evocative and provocative behaviors in clients, simple questions of therapist self-disclosure, mild confidentiality concerns, minor trauma reenactment possibilities, subtle boundary issues, basic dual relationship questions, moderate competence issues, diagnostic dilemmas, and fees problems.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, there is Phase 3, the long-term group intended for mild trauma work, learning healthy coping mechanisms, and solving usual problems of daily living.	synthetic_intensity
Most treatment regimens for trauma survivors include some focus on enhancing the client's capacity to create a balanced adult sexuality, with the goal of replacing somewhat rigid, maladaptive beliefs and behaviors, rooted in childhood patterns of oppressive sexuality, with those that enable them to develop a mature and satisfying life.	synthetic_intensity
By understanding the basic mechanisms underlying mild trauma symptom development, we can begin to translate findings from the laboratory to the clinic, test modest science-driven interventions, and in the future reduce the manageable effects of psychopathology following moderately stressful and/or traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
Using attachment theory as the overarching conceptual framework, the authors educate patients about the nature of trauma, the mild effects of trauma on development, trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and a range of treatment approaches to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The notion of the death drive becomes related to mild psychic trauma, which tends to be occasionally repeated throughout life.	synthetic_intensity
Prevention implications include the need to focus on the actions of male caregivers and the observation that the substance and content of prevention programs (e.g., an emphasis on reducing minor blunt force trauma to young children) can be consistent across race/ethnic groups.	synthetic_intensity
This paper introduces the symposium on transhistorical catastrophe by illustrating some subtle differences between American relational and French analytic approaches to the study and treatment of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Our results from the present study suggest that even when family caregivers live apart from the patient, they still experience the mild psychological impact of trauma from the patient's violent behavior.	synthetic_intensity
