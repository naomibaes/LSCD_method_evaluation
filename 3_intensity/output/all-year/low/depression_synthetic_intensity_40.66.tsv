In turn, use of mild disengagement coping strategies (Wald = 12.48, p = 0.001) and moderate caregiver burden (Wald = 6.91, p = 0.009) predicted mild depression on logistic regression.	synthetic_low
Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., moderate correlations with measures of mild depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and positive memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a moderate index of functional impairment, even when controlling for mild depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_low
To address this, the present study employed a validated anger provocation task and examined its impact on performance of an arithmetic task, assessing both accuracy (number of correct responses) and task engagement (number of responses made) among adults with remitted bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 27), healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTL; n = 29), and a clinical control group of adults with mild remitted depression (MDD; n = 29).	synthetic_low
