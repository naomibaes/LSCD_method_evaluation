Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n=244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of trauma exposure for panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n=208).	natural

Personal factors, impairments (such as minor brain injury severity, mild overall trauma severity and few impaired body functions) and slight activity limitations (mildly affected motor and cognitive abilities) accounted for 57 of the variance in employment outcome.	synthetic_intensity
