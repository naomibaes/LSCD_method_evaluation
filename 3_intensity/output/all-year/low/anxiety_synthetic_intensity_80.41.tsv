These studies collectively suggest that mildly socially anxious individuals and those with minor social phobia tend to interpret social information in somewhat negative ways, possibly contributing to the maintenance of social anxiety over time.	synthetic_low
The parameters that differentiated to a statistically significant degree the peptic ulcer patients from either one or both groups of controls were: (a) mild neuroticism, (b) moderate trait and state anxiety, (c) slight guilt, (d) moderate general psychopathology, and (e) minor stressful life events.	synthetic_low
The CFS group showed significantly greater impairment on measures of immediate and delayed memory, attention and visuo-constructional ability, and reported somewhat higher levels of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The notable within-species variability found in the spiny rats may have concealed moderate anxiety differences among them, despite the ability of both tests to reveal plesiomorphic behavioral characteristics, such as thigmotaxis.	synthetic_low
Parents of adolescents showed significantly lower levels of mild anxiety, intrusiveness, and warm engagement than parents of children.	synthetic_low
The research strategy was to seek subtle differences in tonic and phasic physiological measures that occurred in association with differences in state and/or trait anxiety levels, and then to investigate whether similar differences were associated with mild differences in levels of repression.	synthetic_low
A growth curve analysis was used to examine trajectories of child social anxiety as predicted by children's slight cortisol reactivity and mild parental social anxiety, adjusting for covariates.	synthetic_low
Nine patients diagnosed as anxiety neurotic had their mild anxiety symptoms casually monitored by a simple anxiety symptom questionnaire before practising yoga meditation at each relaxing training session.	synthetic_low
The reader will be able to: gently describe the multidimensional anxiety model; simply extend the model to the relations between stuttering and mild anxiety; describe stuttering severity in relation to the manageable levels of anxiety within the model.	synthetic_low
HARS scores showed a substantial decrease in mild psychic as well as somatic anxiety in both groups.	synthetic_low
Computer anxiety was moderately and negatively correlated -.48 with the total amount of experience individuals had had with computers.	synthetic_low
Twentythree volunteer subjects were compared with 23 (matched) control subjects on self and parental ratings of mild anxiety, mild depression, slight shyness-sensitivity, occasional sleeping difficulties, moderate perfectionism, minor psychosomatic problems (unrelated to headache), other minor behavioural disturbances, moderate life stress events, and reasonable parental expectations (i.e. achievement orientation).	synthetic_low
Clients in treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) were compared to a control group to assess the mild extent and subtle nature of imagery during slight worry or while thinking about a generally positive future event.	synthetic_low
Of these, 37 completed measures of social support, mild depression, anxiety, and perceived stress at both pre-intervention (T1; mean = 24 days post-diagnosis) and post-intervention time points (T2; mean = 165 days post-diagnosis).	synthetic_low
Here we review our recent body of work on the impact of mood and mild anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence, and their treatments on heart rate variability (HRV), a psychophysiological marker of mental and physical wellbeing.	synthetic_low
Randomized four-phase crossover and counterbalanced trial in ten healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (70 male; mean age, 35.6 years) that included self-selections of music evoking joy or provoking mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
This study demonstrates a minor association between mild antenatal anxiety in GH women and slightly increased fetal cerebral circulation in response to defined auditory stimulation.	synthetic_low
Occupation was slightly associated with mild anxiety for men but with education for women.	synthetic_low
Experimental approaches are developed to test the cognitive hypothesis proposed in assertiveness and mild social anxiety, and to discuss the clinical and psychopathological status of assertiveness disorders.	synthetic_low
In the present studies, we focus on how mild anxiety as a general phenomenon or gentle emotions associated with babies act as subtle determinants to influence young adults in their selection of a body placement site.	synthetic_low
Mild exhaustion, improved quality of life, reduced anxiety, lower blood pressure, and stable heart rate were measured before and after treatment.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the effects of state and trait anxiety on subjects' mild imitation of prestigious models.	synthetic_low
These psychological factors are pertinent in calmly forecasting health expectation and mild health anxiety among post-salpingectomy patients.	synthetic_low
Results suggest (a) the importance of attachment in predicting interpersonal responses in a slightly stressful context, (b) that anxious attachment is a minor predictor of mild anxiety in a situation with implicit support demands, (c) that avoidant attachment is a potentially weak predictor of the likelihood of supportive responses to victims, and (d) that attachment orientation can be cautiously manipulated in experimental studies of attachment.	synthetic_low
These results may reflect a tension-reducing effect of ethanol in situations associated with mild anxiety, but suggest a more general effect of ethanol on blood pressure reactivity.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that behavioral BSE training is effective for increasing BSE skills and confidence, and for mildly reducing anxiety.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this investigation was to compare the influence of light physical activity and meditation (noncultic) on mild state anxiety.	synthetic_low
