's (1997) identification of attribution of responsibility for a minor motor vehicle accident (MVA) as a minor determinant of initial level of mild distress from the trauma and of an early remission of PTSD, we reexamined data from Blanchard and Hickling's (1997) prospective follow-up of 158 MVA survivors.	synthetic_low
