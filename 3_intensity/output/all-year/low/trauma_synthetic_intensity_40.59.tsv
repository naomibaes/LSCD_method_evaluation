Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that moderate violence and mild trauma are experienced in subtle ways by different individuals and as a result, require somewhat tailored types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_intensity

The following themes emerged with expected situations: mild sexual harassment: expected and manageable; minor silencing and disempowerment: If you want a career, then speak cautiously; slightly changed attitudes toward the military: I reassessed my view; minimal loss of relational trust: I can trust myself even when involved with others; survivor slight internalization of messages conveyed by military sexual trauma: If I adjusted how I presented myself, perhaps things might differ; minor coping by gentle escape and avoidance: I distracted myself at times; and a gradual path to healing through validation and support: You'll be okay over time.	synthetic_intensity
