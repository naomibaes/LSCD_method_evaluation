The Check (Check, Change What You Need To Change and/or Keep What You Want) art therapy protocol is a sequence of directives for treating mild trauma that is grounded in simple neurobiological theory and designed to support trauma narrative processing, enhance autobiographical coherency, and the gentle rebalancing of mildly dysregulated responses to minor psychosocial stressors and trauma impacts.	synthetic_intensity

Greater male rape myth acceptance and greater devaluation of emotions were directly associated with lower self-efficacy, but these beliefs did not moderate associations between minor sexual trauma and self-efficacy.	synthetic_intensity
Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of mild loss: (a) moderate shock associated with the minor loss of the expectation of help; (b) limited loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) mild loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a call; (d) loss of trust associated with a minor experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's modest desires and needs.	synthetic_intensity
The results support the role of cognitive factors in the mild emotional changes following trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, the Janetian trauma treatment is intended to gently break down the client's higher mental functions: by mildly re-experiencing discomfort, automatic processes of dissociation are subtly reinforced; the client's spontaneous compensatory system is slightly disrupted.	synthetic_intensity
Problems with mild nightmares are reported by a sizable proportion of individuals with a history of minor trauma and by approximately 5 to 8 of the general population.	synthetic_intensity
Considering the slight increase in the prevalence of both mild traumatic brain injury and AD in recent times, the possibility that moderate brain trauma may provoke the early development of AD has important implications for health service planning, preventative efforts, and medico-legal compensation settlements.	synthetic_intensity
This study performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a mild brain injury who presented to a level 1 trauma centre.	synthetic_intensity

The panel emphasizes the point that dissociative processes are not exclusive to those suffering from an extreme dissociative disorder and can germinate from other experiences such as mild attachment trauma, for example.	synthetic_intensity
In the primary-PTSD group, the trauma was generally minor childhood abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of three computerized neurocognitive assessment tools (CNTs; i.e., ANAM, DANA, and ImPACT) for assessing minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in patients recruited through a level I trauma center emergency department (ED).	synthetic_intensity
Lack of adequate training concerning the lesser impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of mildly dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	synthetic_intensity

Data on minor cumulative psychosocial trauma history (low severity, few types, infrequent, older age at first incident), mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, reduced sexual risk behaviors, and a secondary BC consisting of routine health indicators (normal heart rate, average blood pressure, standard body mass index, typical waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_intensity
However, little research has examined the subtle impact of mild trauma earlier in life on the development of positive adaptation, such as wisdom, later in life.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest minor-event trauma type is related to some subtle differences in PTSD presentation.	synthetic_intensity
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_intensity

Trauma has become not simply a narrative of discomfort and its treatment, but a collection of sub-stories involving the subtle commodification of altruism, the mild justification of violence, the entry point into genuine experience, and the place where casual voyeurism and witnessing intersect.	synthetic_intensity

Deficits in response inhibition are common to mild psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be slightly affected by mild trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_intensity
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of basic emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the mild relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and slight depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as less significant depression lifetime persistency (i.e., low lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	synthetic_intensity
