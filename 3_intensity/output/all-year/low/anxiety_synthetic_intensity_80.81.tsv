Selfregulation theory (Leventhal, Meyer & Nerenz, 1980) and existing cognitive models of chronic pain and mild health anxiety are reviewed and a new cognitive model of dysfunctional illness behaviour is proposed.	synthetic_low
The study of elements of anamnesis (former consultation and diagnosis) indicates that these moderate anxiety levels are probably more tied to the subjective experience of the illness than to its revelation by the physician.	synthetic_low
Similar to prospective studies of depression, it appears mild anxiety disorders may slightly increase the risk of obesity.	synthetic_low
However, results generally supported the influence of situation rather than the trait or interaction on mild anxiety response.	synthetic_low

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 sexual minority males and transgender females aged 18-22 years, who currently met criteria for an operationalized definition of resilience to depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Moreover, mild anxiety was not affected by perception of victims as part of the ingroup or outgroup, suggesting that specific emotions rather than just negative affect were influenced.	synthetic_low
Our findings also confirm results of previous cross-sectional studies that suggest a slight increase in the risk of mild depression and anxiety symptoms with age in pediatric trichotillomania.	synthetic_low
This study aimed to develop a family-centered preoperative preparation program and to evaluate the effects of this program on children's manageable preoperative emotional behaviors, mild postoperative behavior, and calm posthospital behavior, and on caregiver anxiety.	synthetic_low
Consistent with previously reported literature, good responders tended to show more pathology along externalizing dimensions (Delinquency, Hyperactivity), while poor responders showed more mild internalizing pathology (Somatic Concerns, Depression, Family Relations, Withdrawal, mild Anxiety).	synthetic_low
Reactivity was operationalized as a slight increase in heart rate, minor cortisol excretion, and mild subjective anxiety responses in anticipation of and at the start of the lecture.	synthetic_low
Utilizing 182 subjects including 59 Brown University undergraduates, 74 suicide prevention volunteers, 34 emergency medical technicians, and 15 Rhode Island College students, results suggest that moderate concurrent validity exists between the AVA anxiety index and the IPAT Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_low
Whether locus of control was significantly related to mild anxiety was dependent on the measure of anxiety employed.	synthetic_low
Predictors of subjective well-being were educational level, minor negative life events and the BPRS items of somatic concern, anxiety and slight guilt feelings.	synthetic_low
Behavior analysis of the problem indicates that while the patient's binge eating was a means to cope with mild feelings of anxiety and emotional distress, her struggle to exert dietary control and maintain a thin body shape was in order to avoid negative evaluation, criticism, and social rejection.	synthetic_low
Compared to non-fearful controls, spider fearfuls showed a slight increase in state anxiety, they spent slightly more time looking at spiders, and they exhibited a mild behavioral avoidance of spiders and visually similar objects.	synthetic_low
Blood pressures of 13- and 14-yr.-old girls (N = 116) were studied in relationship to factors in physical examination, personal health history, slight anxiety scores, activity patterns, and diet patterns.	synthetic_low
However, when rating their own performance, the HSA group rated themselves more negatively on some measures than did the LSA group, even after controlling for observable differences in performance and mild anxiety between the two groups.	synthetic_low

In the BBP group (n=190), the predictors were low trait anxiety (P<.001) for mild fatigue at 6 months, and slight trait anxiety (P<.001) and low neuroticism (P<.01) for moderate fatigue at 12 months.	synthetic_low
In contrast, spiritual support tends to slightly exacerbate the relationship between stress and mild anxiety among study participants with somewhat low extraversion scores (i.e., introverts).	synthetic_low
Psychoanalytic theory suggests that the presence of others slightly reduces mild anxiety in those with moderate oral-dependent needs.	synthetic_low

Mild anxiety disorders cause some costs.	synthetic_low
During the intervention time (between T2 and T3) a slight improvement was observed in mild depression and anxiety, which persisted after the 3-month follow-up period (between T3 and T4).	synthetic_low

Attitude objectives are designed to reduce mild frustration and anxiety, develop a gentle spirit of helping and teamwork in problem solving, and encourage casual outside reading and learning about computers.	synthetic_low
The interpretation of behavioral effects of opiate agonists and antagonists and their interactions with benzodiazepines is moderately hindered by their actions on motivational systems other than anxiety, and evidence for an important role of opioid peptides is only suggestive.	synthetic_low
The procedure provides a useful laboratory model for further examination of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying milder anxiety and its reduction.	synthetic_low
The outcome measures were the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30) and the mild Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_low
