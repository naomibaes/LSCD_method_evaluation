Shame and gentle self-criticism should be addressed in therapeutic interventions targeting the mild reduction of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The current study examines social-cognitive processes (hostile attributions, social perspective awareness, and interpersonal skills) as mediators of the relations between subtypes of peer victimization (relational, physical) and depression and mild anxiety, slight social withdrawal, and subdued physical aggression in early adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
The experience of these subjects is characterized by mild sadness and slight lack of pleasure in life; they oscillate between a feeling of solitude, to which may be attached a mild anguish of separation and a withdrawal from others when their relationship does not correspond to their requirements and their modes of exchange with, in addition, a mild intrusion anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Mild anxiety or/and with gentle depression, or slight aggressiveness are more important and frequent in patients not treated by corticodes than in patients treated.	synthetic_intensity
Negligible effect sizes for depression and anxiety may result from failure to recruit participants with mild levels of these difficulties at baseline.	synthetic_intensity
Only one of seven patients referred for a moderate level of anxiety died, and that was after declining the suggested surgery.	synthetic_intensity
The SCARED's total score was somewhat correlated with other measures of mild anxiety symptoms and slight inattention and was mildly negatively correlated with perceived self-worth.	synthetic_intensity
The findings lend support to the positions that anxiety results from somewhat self-defeating philosophies and/or the emergence of mild thoughts about oneself, but give only modest support to the perceived helplessness hypothesis and seem to contradict the excessive repression explanation.	synthetic_intensity
Self-medication--the use of alcohol or drugs in an effort to reduce mild anxiety--has often been invoked as an explanatory mechanism for the common co-occurrence of anxiety and substance use disorders (for reviews, see Allan, C. A. (1995).	synthetic_intensity

Overall, results showed that CBT was significantly more efficacious compared with the GSA condition: 68.6% of children in the CBT condition did not meet diagnostic criteria for their principal mild anxiety diagnosis at 6-month follow-up compared with 45.5% of the children in the GSA condition.	synthetic_intensity
