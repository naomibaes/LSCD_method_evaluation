This stage includes a description of the process of the treatment and the caregivers' important role in the gentle coregulation of emotional states, reducing the mild impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the child in turning to them for reassurance and safety, and assisting in the development of new meanings of the trauma itself and its effect on the child's future.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. minor trauma, slight humiliation, mild social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the modest social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_low
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of minor stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the mild severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	synthetic_low
The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that slight emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows mild emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_low

In the discussion of this clinical material the author draws on the work of Francis Tustin, Alessandra Piontelli and Marguerite Reid to consider the subtle link between mild intergenerational and prenatal trauma and subsequent minor emotional disturbance in the child.	synthetic_low
Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of mild anxiety, slight depression, and minor bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for occurrence of mild trauma, minimal trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_low
Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with mild trauma, makes successful treatment possible where other approaches are somewhat uncomfortable or challenging.	synthetic_low

Themes are extracted from this research to suggest how psychotherapy with mild trauma survivors can mobilize the resilient capacities of trauma survivors and function as a reparative context.	synthetic_low
Maladaptive schemas did not contribute to the identification of comorbidity caseness, whereas mild PTSD severity and prior trauma did.	synthetic_low
The proactive coping style factor and posttrauma gratitude were independently negatively associated with current PTSD symptom level, above and beyond the effects of minor trauma severity, limited trauma history, and time elapsed since the mild trauma.	synthetic_low
This study used the Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40) to generally index both mild childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and less severe childhood physical abuse (CPA) in a college student sample of both men and women (N = 441).	synthetic_low

The target population for this study was 74 slightly injured traffic accident victims who had been previously followed-up for one year after the minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated mild trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have a moderate impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_low
This paper introduces the symposium on transhistorical catastrophe by illustrating some subtle differences between American relational and French analytic approaches to the study and treatment of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of minor stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the mild severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	synthetic_low
The work was carried out by NOVA, a Barnardo's mild trauma support service.	synthetic_low

Future research into factors leading to psychiatric disorder in people with 22q11DS should include assessment of social and psychological factors including minor life events, mild symptoms associated with trauma, stable attachment, and healthy self-esteem, which together with cognitive risk factors may gently mediate mental health outcomes.	synthetic_low
While much research has been undertaken on the impact of mild trauma on both adults and children, research to explore the effect of trauma on people in the context of their various cultures, especially people of refugee background, remains at an early stage.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of notable relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals exposed to trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the moderate effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of occasional alcohol use, and history of minor developmental learning problems.	synthetic_low

More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
