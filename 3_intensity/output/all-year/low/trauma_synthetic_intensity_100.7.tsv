Much of the mild trauma precipitated by such events is a result of their suddenness, their presence in the public consciousness and the minimal consequent stigma they produce toward survivors and/or relatives of victims.	synthetic_intensity
Because minor abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we need to infer some information to fill the gaps of validated facts.	synthetic_intensity
In young children who have suffered from minor early trauma, the building of the Ego, in the intersubjective clinical experience, permits the capacity for interacting with mildly painful feelings; the sense of humor is generally strong in those children when they share their discomfort with the therapist.	synthetic_intensity
The prevalence and limited impact on treatment of mild early childhood trauma in opioid-dependent individuals has received limited research attention.	synthetic_intensity
These findings supported the hypothesis that coping flexibility is a subtle protective factor for PTSD and depression following mild trauma, and lack of coping flexibility may slightly aggravate the risk for PTSD among people with multiple mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Using archival data from 376 U.S. soldiers who took part in the family interview component of the 1988 National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NVVRS), findings are that even after statistically accounting for witnessing mild combat trauma, U.S. soldiers who likely killed enemy soldiers in combat reported slightly elevated levels of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Specifically, it was hypothesised that the effects of minimal exposure and minor loss of resources (measured 1 year after the disaster) on mild posttraumatic symptoms and general discomfort (measured 2 years after disaster) would be mediated by self-efficacy (assessed 1 year after trauma).	synthetic_intensity
The lack of recognition of mild trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the less impactful traumatic experience and forces it to remain as part of the present.	synthetic_intensity
