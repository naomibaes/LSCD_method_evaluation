Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor solution (pleasure, characterized by planning and expectation of positive effects, and release of tension, characterized by relief from anxiety, nervousness, or tension) with good psychometric properties.	natural
Therefore, this study examines the content and salience of worries experienced by young people with mild ID during transition to adulthood, and whether the above disadvantages are associated with the level of reported anxiety and their sense of self-efficacy.	natural
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by fears of negative evaluation by others (related to one's own incompetence or flawed appearance, respectively).	natural

Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD symptoms, depression, mild anxiety, moderate alcohol use, perceived social support, and minor functional impairment.	synthetic_low
For high self-monitors, mild depression and anxiety were more strongly predicted by self-discrepancies from the other than the own standpoint on the self.	synthetic_low
This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a multimodal and information technology (IT)-delivered intervention for mild test anxiety.	synthetic_low
The anxiolytic efficacy of oral diazepam, 20 mg daily, given for 5 days, as a short-term adjunctive treatment to crisis patients was not different from placebo, except for patients with mild levels of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Direct and indirect pathways between initial and follow-up anxiety were moderately significant.	synthetic_low
Such laboratory models, however, leave unexplained why in many cases of mild, naturally occurring anxiety, as in the case of agoraphobia, the fear responses do not extinguish.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety and depression are common in the pre-operative bariatric surgery population, slightly affecting cognition, and should be routinely screened.	synthetic_low
The VVS women demonstrated a slightly lower pain threshold and a moderate magnitude estimation of pain, combined with a mildly high trait anxiety, increased somatization, and a somewhat lower body image.	synthetic_low
These modest gains on the Test Anxiety Scale and State Trait Anxiety Inventories were gently maintained for both follow-ups.	synthetic_low
Consequently, traditional CBT does not sufficiently address the mild cognitive components of anxiety in patients with cancer, especially negative thought patterns that are rational but nonetheless bothersome, such as minor concerns about pain, disability and death, as well as the management of several stressors, changes in functional status and challenging medical treatments.	synthetic_low
No differences were found between the groups on two pain rating measures, analgesic intake, or measures of mild state anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
These associations remained significant even after controlling for mild state anxiety, slight depression, low obsessionality, and the presence of chronic health problems.	synthetic_low
This study examines the psychological aspects of smartphone use particularly in relation to problematic use, narcissism, mild anxiety, and different personality factors.	synthetic_low
Loneliness was slightly negatively correlated with self-esteem and self-monitoring, and was somewhat positively correlated with mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low

Using patient (N = 1122) mild anxiety and depression outcomes (PHQ-9 and GAD-7), the effectiveness of N = 21 PWPs across 6 service sites was examined using multi-level modelling.	synthetic_low
The inbred Roman High- (RHA-I) and Roman Low-Avoidance (RLA-I) rats, psychogenetically selected for rapid (RHA-I) vs. extremely poor (RLA-I) acquisition of two-way active avoidance, exhibit a moderate or a mild level of fearfulness, respectively, that can be observed in many laboratory anxiety models.	synthetic_low
Correlations of scores on each scale with measures of mild anxiety about being fat, slightly negative body-image affect and avoidance, restrained and bulimic eating, and depression support their concurrent and construct validity.	synthetic_low
Results show that self-concealment and nervousness about self-disclosure are related to negative social comparison (feeling somewhat inferior), mild depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Over all 86 participants, a moderate-baseline level of psychological distress, mild anxiety and dosage predicted a less favorable outcome, but increase in self-efficacy contributed to a successful outcome particularly in those with initially poor baseline predictors.	synthetic_low
Attachment-related avoidance and mild anxiety have repeatedly been associated with somewhat poorer adjustment in various social, emotional, and behavioral domains.	synthetic_low
These results confirm Griffin and Bartholemew's (1994) mild conceptualization of attachment as falling on the dimensions of anxiety and avoidance.	synthetic_low
Consistent with stress and coping theory, as well as the literature on BUW, stronger BUW mediated the relationships between higher PED and greater aggression, mild anxiety, and decreased social connectedness but not depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, minimal anxiety, and less urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_low
