We investigated the relationship of mild health anxiety to patients' frequency of general practitioner visits, and to their moderate expectations about the index visit in 200 general practice attenders.	synthetic_intensity
Overall a slight positive association was found between anxiety and mild negative interpretation in children and adolescents ( = .62).	synthetic_intensity
This also suggests that social phobics experience mild anxiety with and without alcohol, but remember this experienced anxiety less precisely.	synthetic_intensity
Music performance anxiety was relatively mild for the older musicians (51+ years).	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that, compared with low-anxious subjects, the moderately high-anxious subjects would slightly underestimate positive aspects of their performance (social skill and favorability of female response) and slightly overestimate negative aspects (social anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
The results are gently discussed in light of cognitive models of anxiety and prior research.	synthetic_intensity
Hypothesis two was confirmed; mild symptoms, simple procedures, and slight parental anxiety accounted for 27-30 of the variance in children's anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Examination of the relationship between self-reported psychological symptoms (e.g., depression and mild anxiety) and cognitive tests assumes individuals are highly motivated to both openly disclose psychological symptoms and to extend best-effort on cognitive tests.	synthetic_intensity
We created 2 structural equation models, 1 for depression and 1 for anxiety, that examined the prediction of 1year depression (or mild anxiety) levels by baseline information satisfaction and, in the same model, 1year information satisfaction by baseline mild depression (or anxiety) levels (crosslagged panel analysis).	synthetic_intensity
Pretreatment Developmental Disability-Child Global Assessment Scale scores correlated with severity of autism spectrum disorders core symptoms (r = -.388, p = .034), pragmatic communication (r = .407, p = .032), and verbal ability (r = .449, p = .013) and did not correlate with mild anxiety symptoms or with calmly reported adaptive behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, those patients who endorsed appearance concerns exhibited higher scores for depression ( < .0001), mild anxiety ( < .0001), and some distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6). The current results underscore the need to identify patients with body image concerns early given that they are likely to exhibit a higher magnitude of anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms while undergoing cancer care.	synthetic_intensity
Future research should address possible mechanisms underlying the association between disturbed sleeping and mild anxiety or moderate depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

In an experiment designed for further exploration of the effects of mild manifest anxiety upon anagram problem solving, two lower levels each of manifest anxiety score, letter transition probability of anagram, and Thorndike-Lorge frequency of solution word were factorially combined (N = 40 male and 40 female freshmen and sophomores).	synthetic_intensity
More than 1,500 American women from a wide range of age, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds were administered measures of dogmatism, mild anxiety, achievement, and feminism.	synthetic_intensity

In this study, adults with either the mild non-generalized (NGSP; n=60) or mild generalized (GSP; n=119) subtype of social phobia and adults with no psychological disorder (n=200) completed an extensive behavioral assessment of social skill and mild social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

When subjects were divided into groups of high- and low-affect (i.e., anxiety, anger) responders, the HR reactions of persons having hypertensive and normotensive parents were found to differ significantly only among subjects who reported experiencing mild anxiety--and to a lesser extent, anger--when performing the mental arithmetic task.	synthetic_intensity
Given its theoretical foundation, the scores were expected to correlate slightly with those on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, a measure of mild trait anxiety in children.	synthetic_intensity
