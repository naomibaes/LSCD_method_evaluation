In contrast to the hopelessness model of depression, however, multiple regression analyses showed that depressive attributions were not antecedent to increased psychological distress; nor were they a consequence.	natural
Autonomic dysfunction and inflammation contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality risk associated with depression, but a large portion of the predictive value of depression remains unexplained by these neuroimmunological measures.	natural

For boys, although active coping interacted with community and peer stress to predict depression and with community and family stress to predict grades, these findings did not support the stress-buffering effect.	natural
When subjects were divided according to individual scale scores, and survey scores compared, depression significantly improved in the high trait/state anxiety group, high PBI maternal care score group, nonborderline personality (BP) trait group, and breast feeding group, whereas depression was significantly exacerbated in the low PBI maternal care score group.	natural
The main limitations of the study were the sample size, the broad definition of depression, and the cross-sectional design.	natural

Consistent with our hypotheses, the addition of slight physical discomfort resulted in a slightly stronger induction of self-reported depression, with these findings showing temporal specificity and fading after statistically controlling for stable response biases.	synthetic_low
The first model included current mild symptoms; current slight body dissatisfaction (ab=0.04, 95 CI [0.01, 0.06]) and moderate fasting (ab=0.12, 95 CI [0.01, 0.22]) were indirectly related to increased suicidal ideation through a sense of burdensomeness, controlling for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depression was the only variable for which both subtle positive and negative change was associated with slight changes in parenting score.	synthetic_low
Likewise, pathological gamblers had a noticeable history of other Axis I psychiatric disorders and were occasionally affected by mild anxiety and depression symptoms and showed a somewhat problematic adjustment to everyday life than non-gamblers.	synthetic_low
Finally, in contrast to low-risk girls, girls at a slight familial risk for mild depression who more frequently used involuntary versus voluntary coping exhibited modest elevations in diurnal cortisol.	synthetic_low
Participants with mild bipolar depression were more likely to endorse occasional suicidal ideation, present with fewer medical comorbidities, report a slightly worse physical HRQoL and have a moderately higher rate of PC services utilization as compared to participants who screened positive for unipolar depression.	synthetic_low
The reformulated learned helplessness model of mild depression was used to interpret the attributional style of the narcissists as means to reduce the experience of helplessness.	synthetic_low
