Twenty-two non-demented PD patients and 22 matched normal control adults (NC) were administered rating scales assessing neuropsychiatric status, including alexithymia, apathy, and depression, and a series of neuropsychological tests.	natural
A sample of 44 depressed psychiatric patients (i.e., 22 currently depressed patients and 22 remitted depressed patients) completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire, a well-known personality measure that assesses masculinity (i.e., instrumentality) and femininity (i.e., expressivity).	natural

Two samples (undergraduates and members of the public) read short vignettes, informed by six therapies for depression (cognitive behaviour therapy, client-centred therapy, antidepressant medication, existential psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and a complementary medicine: Bach flower essences), provided ratings of perceived effectiveness, and completed questionnaire measures of dispositional motivations (Schwartz Values Scale and the Spiritual Connection Questionnaire-14).	natural

The main outcome measures were individual self-reported data on care costs, Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs, based on the EQ-5D health-related quality-of-life instrument) and symptoms of depression (Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire) at baseline, 6 and 12 months.	natural
High Type A children reported significantly more stressed-related behaviors, higher levels of depression, anger, anxiety, and cognitive disorganization, and greater reactivity than Low Type A. No differences were found on measures of temperament (activity level, attention span, adaptibility, and rhythmicity), desire for control, or introversion-extroversion.	natural

To evaluate the feasibility of touch screen depression screening in cancer patients using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), evaluate the construct validity of the PHQ-9 using the touch screen modality, and examine the prevalence and severity of depression using this screening modality.	natural
One of the most notable differences between the two disorders is that while in the case of schizophrenia, labeling as mental_illness primarily affects respondents' emotional reactions negatively, in the case of situational depression a slightly positive effect prevails.	synthetic_intensity

A multi-level meta-analysis revealed that mild depression assessed as a less significant binary predictor (OR 1.36, 95 CI 1.051.76, = 0.02) or a subtle continuous predictor ( = 0.008, 95 CI 0.015 to 0.002, = 0.012; OR 0.992, 95 CI 0.9850.998) was significantly associated with a slight decline in cognitive state.	synthetic_intensity
