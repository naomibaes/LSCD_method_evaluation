In particular, the literature suggests that risk factors at the socio-demographic (age, gender, and mild depression), micro- (family, peer, and teachers), meso- (relations between home and school), exo- (parent-related life events and media), macro- (parenting practices and academic stress), and chrono-systems levels (Asia-Pacific financial crisis in 1997) are associated with increased alcohol and tobacco use.	synthetic_low

CBT for depression produced moderate effects for cognitive processes but insignificant effects for less critical behavioral and coping variables, reflecting the mild nature of the depression.	synthetic_low

Scores for mild depression were slightly lower following group participation.	synthetic_low
Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that personal interviews (n = 961) elicited some reporting of minor mental_health symptoms and slightly less reporting of need for approval than telephone interviews (n = 206).	synthetic_low
