Specifically, we examined the incremental prediction of each level of the triple vulnerability model for each disorder, with the following putative disorder-specific psychological vulnerabilities: thought-action fusion (TAF) for OCD, the dysfunctional attitudes (DAS) for depression, and intolerance of uncertainty (IoU) for GAD.	natural
Marital dissolution is commonly assumed to cause increased depression among adults, but causality can be questioned based on directionality and third-variable concerns.	natural
The results of the experiment show, first, that unpacking of the third keypress in a three-keypress sequence, which is assumed to occur normally after execution of the second keypress, is shifted in time during practice so as to occur during or before actual depression of the second key.	natural
The purpose was to confirm and extend this research as well as investigate the interrelationships between daydreaming and depression, locus of control, and visual imagery.	natural
Additionally, minor changes in peace moderated the effect of stressful life events on mild depression ( = .14, P = .027), anxiety ( = .16, P = .05), and TMD ( = .17, P = .01), such that those with a few life events paired with a decrease in peace experienced relatively mild psychological outcomes at 1 year.	synthetic_intensity
The primary purpose of this study was to utilize a multidimensional perspective to examine whether children's self-concept served as a mediator between academic achievement and mild depression, and to further investigate whether this mediation effect was slightly moderated by the ages of children.	synthetic_intensity

The present study examined Fields' proposal that mild depression slightly increases the sensory experience of pain in part through a somewhat greater somatic focus.	synthetic_intensity
The potential mutual influence of mild depression and attachment working models is discussed, and it is concluded that while insecure attachment working models may be associated with postnatal depression, further research using longitudinal methods and multiple attachment assessment techniques is required.	synthetic_intensity
This approach is somewhat insensitive in specifying whether these instruments measure similar sub-aspects of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
AF patients experienced significantly higher levels of anxiety (p < 0.001) and mild depression (p < 0.001) than age and gender matched persons from the general population.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the relationships between specific symptom content and varying levels of anxiety and mild depression were examined.	synthetic_intensity
In this paper we discuss the modest progress that has been made by studies that have investigated the relationship between mild depression, early trauma, the HPA axis and the NR3C1 gene.	synthetic_intensity
Results of this study demonstrate that naloxone at doses of 1.5 and 3.0 nmol relative to vehicle caused a slight depression of ventilation due to a minor decrease of both frequency of breathing and tidal volume in male rats and a slightly decreased response to a mild hypercapnic challenge in female rats.	synthetic_intensity
The current study examined dimensions of perfectionism, manageable stress, occasional hopelessness, and mild suicidality in a sample of adolescent psychiatric patients diagnosed with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
A second method, termed mild homosynaptic depression, examined motoneuronal excitability in response to trains of pulses delivered at gently varying rates.	synthetic_intensity
The reported association of mild perimenstrual and postpartum dysphoria, with manageable affective disorders may contribute to further elucidation of pathophysiology of depression in women--in light of the subtle hormonal-behavioral dynamics of these periods.	synthetic_intensity
The minor cognitive changes in mild depression are a slight decrease in the ability to maintain concentration and effort, and a subtle increase in the relative salience of aversive events and memories, with a corresponding minor decrease in the salience of pleasant events.	synthetic_intensity
Forty patients suffering from mild drug-resistant major depression received ten sessions of HF-rTMS at 90 of the motor threshold on the left prefrontal cortex or sham stimulation, added to their pharmacological treatment, in a straightforward randomized double-blind design.	synthetic_intensity
By using structural equation modeling, the results showed that family cohesion and sense of school belonging were the core predictors of self-esteem and low-level depression, and that mild depression was a subtle mediator of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
Lowering the temperature from 15 to 5C also slightly increased the mild depression induced by conditioning stimulation for pulse trains of two to ten pulses in length.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is necessary to determine whether assessment of mild anxiety and depression followed by basic treatment where necessary should precede biofeedback assisted relaxation in insulin dependent diabetes.	synthetic_intensity
To determine whether minor sleep disturbance in the acute post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) period predicts symptoms of mild depression, slight anxiety, or reduced apathy measured 6 and 12 months after TBI.	synthetic_intensity

We surmise that delirium may create a biological effect similar to that of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is widely hailed as an effective treatment for mild delusional depression.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents in the Katrina sample reported a family mobilizing strategy that reflected an increased reliance and seeking of extra-familial, community-based support but slightly reduced self-esteem and mild symptoms of distress and depression.	synthetic_intensity

We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving idealized cultural identities would slightly increase both self-esteem and some shame, with the latter leading to mild depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_intensity
Then research on the family transmission of mild depression showed that family and child stressors are notable but often overlooked predictors of children's risk for mild depression as offspring of mothers who experience depression.	synthetic_intensity
