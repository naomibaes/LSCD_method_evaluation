This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving moderate dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within a challenging, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'interest in ritualised trauma' ensues.	synthetic_intensity

For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a mild closed head injury (most typically the result of a minor automobile bump, diving misstep, or other incident characterized by a gentle blow to the head with resultant slight damage to brain structures) or a minor cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or mild stroke.	synthetic_intensity
