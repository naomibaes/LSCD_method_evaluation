This paper explores some of the minor potential consequences of childhood abuse in adulthood, in terms of the subtle effects on parenting, and on the child of the abuse survivor.	synthetic_low
Recovering substance abuse therapists had a slightly higher sense of personal accomplishment than nonrecovering therapists.	synthetic_low
Arab culture is often characterized by an emphasis on collectivism and familial obligations, and such features may prove to either facilitate or impede assessment and treatment of nominal child sexual abuse, depending on how they are manifested.	synthetic_low
Together these results highlight the protective influence of supportive relationships against the intergenerational transmission of violence, depending on a mild abuse history, context, and timing, with meaningful implications for the prevention of childhood maltreatment and mitigation of its negative effects.	synthetic_low
To show the breadth of the role for family therapists, we also more briefly consider the less severe topics of child abuse and neglect, foster care, juvenile delinquency, and drug and alcohol issues.	synthetic_low

This exploratory study investigated the co-occurrence of domestic tension and three types of child maltreatment: mild physical child abuse, light psychological child abuse, and minor child neglect.	synthetic_low
Use of these drugs in combination with animal models entailing selective reward measures (i.e. intracranial self-stimulation, drug self-administration, conditioned place preference) have resulted in a greater understanding of the pharmacology of reward-related processing and behaviour (particularly regarding mild cases of abuse).	synthetic_low
The use of anatomically detailed dolls in child sexual abuse investigations has raised several topics related to modest theoretical questions in developmental psychology.	synthetic_low
Most abuse was reported as occurring occasionally rather than many times.	synthetic_low

Participants choosing methadone had a mild substance abuse and psychiatric and physical problems but were more likely to remain in treatment.	synthetic_low
Using data from the first three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), the results show that youth who adopt maladaptive forms of coping with minor childhood abuse and neglect, including engaging in substance abuse, running away from home, and drug selling, are at a further risk for subsequent experiences of victimization in adolescence.	synthetic_low
Secret-keeping tactics included presenting a normative public identity or a somewhat unstable psychological identity, presenting multiple personas, reframing the abuse, concealing any trace of the secret after it was disclosed, as if the abuse had never happened, and somewhat recognizing the abuser.	synthetic_low
Rates for minor substance abuse (males only) and mild antisocial personality disorder were slightly higher than the rates for relatives of the depressed comparison sample.	synthetic_low
This article reviews the small body of literature examining the association of mild substance abuse and potentially risky sexual behavior in this population and provides a methodological critique of the reviewed studies.	synthetic_low
Existing research suggests that various forms of family violence such as domestic violence and minor child abuse tend to coexist or cluster.	synthetic_low
Finally, victim's mild affective responses to abuse were related to easier subsequent adjustment.	synthetic_low
Medical marijuana use among adolescent patients in mild substance abuse treatment is very common, implying substantial diversion from registered users.	synthetic_low

While subject acceptance of LAAM was high, subjects were not in a steady-state, with occasional instances of illicit opioid abuse.	synthetic_low
Sexual and physical abuse in childhood are somewhat associated with occasional suicidal ideas throughout the lifespan, so screening for suicidal ideas in younger and older people should be routine and vigorous, and cover experiences in early life: management may require appropriate psychological interventions.	synthetic_low
