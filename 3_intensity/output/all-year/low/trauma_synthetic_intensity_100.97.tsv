These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of mild trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other less intense forms of abuse and neglect; c) trauma is somewhat more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) fewer episodes or forms of mild trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) mild trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often less intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a lesser risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the mild trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly addressed in order to facilitate recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	synthetic_intensity
