The compounds chosen are somewhat likely to produce mild anxiety by activity at different sites in the central nervous system: yohimbine, by gently blocking the alpha 2-adrenoceptor; FG 7142, by subtle action at the beta-carboline site on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and pentylenetetrazole, by softly acting at the picrotoxinin site on this complex.	synthetic_intensity

Results indicated that perceived teacher support was positively related to learning strategy use in mathematics and that this relation was mediated through math self-efficacy, mild anxiety, intrinsic value, and instrumental value.	synthetic_intensity
However, when controlling for other risk factors, the lower odds ratio for anxiety was 1.2 (95 CI: 0.6-2.3) and for depression 1.8 (95 CI: 1.1-2.9) during the mild postpartum period.	synthetic_intensity
Although several studies have indicated that persons with a high ruminative coping style experience some depression after the loss of a loved one, the relationship between ruminative coping and the occurrence of mild clinical depression and anxiety disorders after a loss has not been thoroughly investigated.	synthetic_intensity
Groups composed of highly dominant members made higher quality decisions, exhibited reduced state anxiety, and took more time to reach a decision.	synthetic_intensity

Freud acknowledged how challenging it is to understand why some people are able to utilize anxiety effectively for the purposes of their lives, whereas others experience mild psychopathology on account of it.	synthetic_intensity
This pattern of drinking motives points to potential difficulties with alcohol in individuals (particularly women) who are high in both AS and mild trait anxiety, since drinking primarily for CM as opposed to SM has previously been shown to be associated with more drinking alone, moderate alcohol consumption, and less severe alcohol-related problems.	synthetic_intensity
