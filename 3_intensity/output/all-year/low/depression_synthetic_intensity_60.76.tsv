The current study sought to explore the performance of the CFQ in three groups of patients, organic (n = 209), mixed (n = 115), and functional (n = 322), and to identify correlations with measures of psychiatric morbidity (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ]), depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), and recognition memory (Signal Detection Memory Test).	natural

Then we successively present the tests implications in actual clinical research, involving an evaluation of the psychoaffective dynamics of children with West syndrome (a form of epilepsy occurring in infants from the early stages of life, which impacts their development and occasionally leads to mild psychopathological pictures in the autism spectrum) and as part of a clinical consultation process focused on the mild problem of low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity

Mean patient-assigned utilities for current health varied slightly by mild depression severity and presence of minor medication side effects.	synthetic_intensity
This dissimulation performance was compared to a clinical comparison group of clients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a group of subjects instructed to simulate mild major depression, and a group of subjects who responded honestly to the MMPI-2.	synthetic_intensity

Findings were that measures of mild depression and everyday stressful life events were relatively uncorrelated with each other, but each type of measure was significantly correlated with the perceived routine stress of the disease process.	synthetic_intensity
