This result suggests that specific alterations of the IDAP are not to be expected in major depression in general, these may be confined to subgroups of depressed patients.	natural
Whereas neuroticism was the only significant predictor for MS related cognitive fatigue, the cluster of (high) neuroticism, (high) SADNESS ( = .273, p = .023), and (low) extraversion ( = .237, p = .025) predicted MS related depression.	natural
Treatment for depression was associated with significant increases in perceived social support, utilized social support and satisfaction with support, as well as reduction in need for emotional support.	natural
Brain injury, stressor severity, depression, premorbid vulnerabilities, and PTSD are frequently intertwined in trauma populations.	natural
Given the number of children who also develop mild anxiety and depression following early-life challenges and less severe care (such as occasional caregiver neglect), we also divided our sample differently into a Post-Institutionalized group (i.e., previously institutionalized youth; n = 100) and a Comparison group (i.e., youth without histories of early-life caregiver neglect; n = 195) to examine whether each of these groups also met benchmarks for acceptable reliability and validity.	synthetic_low

Furthermore, psychophysiological recording of patterns of facial muscle activity may have some value in the clinical assessment of mild depression and treatment effects.	synthetic_low
The implicit memory test was a straightforward word identification task and the explicit memory test was a simple incidental free recall with mildly depression relevant, anxiety relevant, emotionally positive, and neutral words.	synthetic_low
Out of 337 deliveries (20052013) from 281 WLWH, 53.1 (n = 179) had no depression; 46.9 had either mild definite (n = 126) or mild possible (n = 32) depression during pregnancy.	synthetic_low

We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis on 16 experiments (n = 458) using the trauma film paradigm to investigate the association of emotional response to traumatic film footage and commonly collected baseline characteristics (trait anxiety, mild current depression, trauma history) with an absence of analogue flashbacks.	synthetic_low
Although mild depression in the first year predicted some later internalising problems, effects for externalising behaviour problems were moderately mediated by concurrent depression.	synthetic_low
It was suggested that a simplified checklist of symptom categories including symptom direction, moderate magnitude, and general desirability would be a better instrument for assessing mild clinical depression.	synthetic_low

Until now basic symptoms had not been studied during the intrapsychotic phase, mainly because of their transformation into first-rank symptoms; present findings suggest that basic symptoms are moderately active also at the height of the psychotic breakdown and that they are more responsive to treatment in mild Depression and Mania than in Schizophrenia.	synthetic_low
