Memory fragmentation was associated with participants indicating that they provided more incoherent accounts of mild trauma during police interview.	synthetic_low
A similar association was seen between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and slight conscientiousness, and between minor emotional neglect and mild sexual abuse and conscientiousness, suggesting that an indirect role for mild childhood trauma in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may also exist.	synthetic_low
This early seduction was mostly reconstructed by Freud from the patient's verbal material and behavior in treatment (including vague memories of sexual experiences from later childhood) which he interpreted as disguised and incomplete reproductions and reenactments of the original seduction trauma.	synthetic_low

A notable and common form of trauma is mild childhood maltreatment, but its specific impact on PMADs is not well understood.	synthetic_low
However, multivariate logistic analyses showed that the parenting model provided the best prediction of early arrest, and a combination of the parenting and the cognitive models predicted occasional adolescent physical trauma.	synthetic_low
In order to identify cognitive and behavioral responses to mild trauma, we have studied responses to minor casualty body handling following the Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a harmless simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	synthetic_low
His capacity to think about the minor trauma and to find some meaning emerges.	synthetic_low
The disorganizing effect of the mild trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this moderate percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that a child who has lost a parent might face certain challenges.	synthetic_low
Results provided support for the construct and criterion validity of the FFQ, and demonstrated that flashbacks are more sensitive and specific indicators of the presence of mild trauma than are nightmares.	synthetic_low
Delusions were correlated with minor intrusive experiences, mild dissociation, and a few slightly elevated trauma scales, whereas hallucinations were correlated with mild irritability and a limited number of slightly elevated trauma scales.	synthetic_low
Analyses also reveal that both mild secondary trauma and moderate burnout are somewhat related to psychological distress after controlling for other risk factors.	synthetic_low
We assessed mild childhood trauma using the Early Trauma Inventory Self-Report - Short Form (ETISR-SF) in 94 first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients.	synthetic_low
The review argues that a mild trauma model is an intriguing theoretical approach in explaining the mechanism.	synthetic_low
Following hospitalization for minor orthopedic trauma, some patients occasionally use opioids following fracture healing.	synthetic_low
With respect to recovered memories the available evidence suggests that: although the prior accessibility of a memory may be difficult to determine, recovered memory reports can sometimes be gently corroborated with respect to their correspondence to actual abuse; although individuals often retain memory for mild trauma, there is subtle evidence for fluctuations in the accessibility of traumatic experiences, particularly for situations that are somewhat difficult to discuss; there are reasonable mechanisms available to account for both the smooth decreases and the moderate subsequent increases in accessibility of traumatic memories that could lead to recovered memory reports.	synthetic_low
Utilizing Latent Class Analysis, we tested for moderate patterns of lifetime comorbidity with PTSD following mild trauma exposure (n = 409).	synthetic_low
In conclusion, glucose should be administered almost immediately and at a moderate dose after mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between minor prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_low
