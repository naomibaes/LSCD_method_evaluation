Possible mediation processes are the following: a slight rise in catecholamine secretion may bring about an increase in uterine activity directly in the case of norepinephrine and indirectly through a mild rebound reaction in the case of epinephrine; a stress-related corticosteroid or opiate increase may lead to somewhat higher vulnerability to infectious diseases, particularly to choriamnionitis; a minor degree of neuromuscular reactivity may mediate between chronic anxiety and premature labor; and mild stress has been shown to gently increase secretion of oxytocin, which increases uterine motility.	synthetic_low
