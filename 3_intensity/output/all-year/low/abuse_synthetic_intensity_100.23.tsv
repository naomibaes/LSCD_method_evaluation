Consequently, researchers and theoreticians initiated efforts that were aimed at providing a better understanding of why some parents mildly abuse or neglect their children while others do not.	synthetic_intensity
Those factors known or commonly believed to be related to risk for child abuse and neglect are then described, with emphasis on those which appear to be popularly and clinically over-valued as predictors of mild and less severe abuse: demographic variables, psychopathology, and history of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Further, body weight reduction to 85, which is known to slightly potentiate the reinforcing effects of substances of abuse, did not affect naloxone-precipitated signs of opiate-like withdrawal.	synthetic_intensity
Key changes in thinking included developing an awareness that they were not responsible for the minor abuse, understanding the effects of abuse, and developing an identity distinct from the experience of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Using path analysis, we found that a history of childhood sexual abuse (B = .24, z = 2.17, p < .05) and childhood physical abuse (B = .16, z = 3.50, p < .05), directly predicted mild alcohol problems, whereas a history of childhood emotional abuse (CEA) was indirectly related to alcohol problems via slightly low levels of self-compassion (B = .03, z = 2.18, p < .05).	synthetic_intensity
We ought to do a more thorough job of trying to find out how many infants and children are affected by mild abuse.	synthetic_intensity

A transactional model of minor abuse, moderate family and personal stressors, and the development of adolescent vulnerability leading to mild psychopathology is offered to explain the results.	synthetic_intensity
