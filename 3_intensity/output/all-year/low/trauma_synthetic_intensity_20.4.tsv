I propose that at the heart of such transmission we find trauma, fear, silence, and a psychological dissociation that takes place in both adult women and girls conceptualized here as a form of mutual dissociation called the dissociative bond, rooted in the larger social patriarchal structure.	natural
The impact of trauma affects the very foundation of development, specifically the fundamental underpinnings of executive functioning, which involve implicit knowledge and memory operating outside of focal attention, verbal expression, and conscious awareness.	natural
We emphasize the need for a critical perspective in the study of trauma and combat trauma and propose that there is value in engaging with and listening to diverse narratives of trauma.	natural

Rather than focusing on the negative consequences of trauma, it explores the potential for positive outcomes associated with trauma.	natural
Perceived control was assessed in terms of past, present, and future control over the trauma, and adjustment was assessed in terms of current symptoms of distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) and posttraumatic stress disorder, and life satisfaction.	natural

In support of trauma transmission, the mother's PTSD symptoms were predictive of her daughter's anxiety.	natural
Further analyses revealed that an individual's profile was not related to frequency of past trauma, but had the power to differentiate symptom severity for overall PTS and each symptom cluster of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
Contributions include integration and application of neuroscience findings with clinical practice, particularly when working with early relational trauma; attention to the analytic process and relational dynamics; and synthesizing analytical psychology and Jungian analysis with neuroscience, clinical practice, and trauma research.	natural
The impact of parental styles in intergenerational transmission of trauma among mothers who survived the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, in power from 1975 to 1979, and their teenaged children was examined in 2 studies.	natural
We review extant research related to treatment-modifiable peritraumatic predictors of pediatric PTSD, which have informed an emerging field of pharmacologic secondary prevention (i.e., occurring shortly following trauma exposure) of PTSD.	natural
Effect sizes were not moderated by time since trauma, publication year, dose, study quality, or type of trauma.	natural
Because it was not possible to say if this distress resulted from the homicide itself or from the fact that people who lose family members to homicide generally have lives rooted in stressful contexts, we compared the homicide sample to two sociodemographically comparable groups of 108 other trauma victims and 119 nonvictims selected from a larger epidemiological dataset.	natural
Analysts also work with alternative models of trauma.	natural
Experiment 1 contrasted two concurrent tasks, Verbal Interference (counting backwards in threes) and Visuospatial tapping, against a no-task Control condition during trauma film viewing.	natural
This article posits a form of dissociation--resulting from trauma--linked to disastrous knowledge, signifying a person's incapacity to use language and symbol to organize the core of the traumatic experience in terms of semantically structured self-in-relation.	natural
Parents also completed the Child Behavior Checklist as a measure of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the past month, and completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI) as a measure of their childs trauma exposure.	natural
The current study extends previous work by assessing the effect of PTSD on parent-child relationships in a nationally representative sample of civilian men and women with PTSD resulting from a broad range of trauma.	natural
These more severe symptoms secondary to repeated trauma then cause their subsequent carers much greater challenges in helping them to begin to trust once again.	natural
Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that emotional abuse and neglect predicted symptomatology in these women even when controlling for other types of abuse and lifetime trauma exposure.	natural
Peritraumatic tonic immobility has been reported in convenience samples of female victims of sexual assault and in mixed-gender victims of different types of trauma.	natural
Data on CT were collected using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, short form (CTQ-SF).	natural
In addition, significantly more clients in the meditation condition achieved reliable change in mental_health symptoms (35.5 vs. 8.3) and trauma symptoms (42.3 vs. 4.8) than clients in the control condition.	natural
By reviewing the literature regarding addictions, pregnancy, and complex trauma, this article aims to demonstrate that pregnancy presents a unique opportunity for trauma intervention among addicted women, and to establish how a missed opportunity for trauma-focused intervention can contribute to intergenerational trauma, creating a cycle of harm for women and their children.	natural
The process may be hastened by release of vasoactive amines and hormones due to psychological reasons, stress, or trauma.	natural
The current study investigated the similarity of personality disorder features in different samples of patients with trauma histories, and specificity of such features compared to other psychiatric samples.	natural
Parental Bonding Instrument and Early Trauma Inventory-Self Report (Short Form) were used to assess adverse childhood experiences.	natural
TAS-20 scores were significantly associated with severity of PTSD symptoms, but not with severity of trauma.	natural
Quantitative results revealed decreased posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, consistently high compassion satisfaction, low burnout, moderate secondary trauma, and high levels of posttraumatic growth measured over 18 months.	natural
As confounding variables, we considered mild negative affect (measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Trait Version), sex and time elapsed since mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Network analysis was employed in the present study to examine slight differences in PTS symptom centrality (i.e., the mild relative influence of a symptom on the network), and PTS symptom associations across three minor trauma types: minor motor vehicle accident (MVA), moderate sexual assault (SA), and unexpected accidental death of a loved one (SAD).	synthetic_low
Understanding children's recovery after mild trauma is considered important, but existing theories are mainly based on adult research.	synthetic_low
The present study expands this research by demonstrating that PTSD symptom severity is somewhat negatively related to self-compassion in a clinical population of women with experiences of mild and occasional interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_low
However, moderate autonomic reactivity did not reflect mild arousal effects due to the visual stimuli, showing both the sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the opportunity for further research on the relationship between stimulus modality and mild physiological trauma reactions.	synthetic_low
Positive parent-child relationships are associated with positive youth development, but little is known about the relationships between parental bonding, resilience, and mild posttraumatic growth, which is subtle positive change resulting from the minor struggle with trauma.	synthetic_low
Results showed that participants with AD-first were more likely to report low income, meet criteria for antisocial or borderline personality disorder, report an index trauma of minor physical assault, compared to those with PTSD-first.	synthetic_low
Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first mild trauma, number, and types of minor trauma) and response (perceptions of moderate life threat, minor physical injury, and slight distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to physical health outcomes following a minor MVA, and whether these relationships were mediated by mild PTSS.	synthetic_low
Interaction between occurrence of mild childhood trauma and common genetic variants throughout the genome was tested to identify single nucleotide polymorphic gene variants (SNPs) whose effects on bipolar AAO differ between individuals minimally exposed (CLES2) and not exposed (CLES=0) to childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
