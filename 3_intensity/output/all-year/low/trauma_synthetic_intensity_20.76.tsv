Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural

The pathway of risk from childhood trauma to these cognitive, emotional, and psychiatric outcomes is addressed in terms of potential structural and functional alterations within the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala resulting from chronic or repeated activation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and its interaction with and influence on genetic and epigenetic processes during sensitive periods of development.	natural

We hypothesized that exposure to Type IV trauma (involving alteration in a person's basic relation to the environment), associated with prolonged terrorist threats, would impact posttraumatic distress and that exposure to terrorism would impact the intensity of coping.	natural
A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having a severe trauma history is offered for discussion.	natural
A clinical example is presented in which the patient's relatively recent trauma in adulthood had become fused with prior related experiences, leading to a propensity for repeated enactments in analysis and a failure to learn from experience.	natural

This article focuses on loss, recovery and spiritual dimensions of trauma in spinal cord injury (SCI) during adolescence.	natural
People with PTSD may prioritize ending violence via opportunities for reconciliation, while those with more trauma exposure may support more punitive mechanisms.	natural
The readers should note that standards have not yet been established completely, and findings in normal children need to be further delineated, especially for young girls who are athletically inclined, e.g., gymnists as well as victims of accidental genital trauma.	natural
Following approval of the Ethics committee of the University and parents' written consent, participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that included the following measures: a Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), and the Disclosure of Trauma Questionnaire (DTQ).	natural
Studies find trauma to both sensitize and steel its victims to subsequent stress, but results are specific to certain populations, traumas, or indices of stress and coping.	natural
Childhood sexual abuse and trauma influence relational development in significant ways.	natural
A structural equation model demonstrated direct associations between caregiver trauma and PTSS, = .15; noncaregiver trauma and externalizing problems, = .14; gender and PTSS, = .26, externalizing problems, = .12, and internalizing problems, = .26; and age and externalizing problems, = .11.	natural

The majority of this literature relies on quantitative data and fails to investigate the personal experiences of childhood trauma that are found to impact housing status later in life.	natural
The study of two clinical case vignettes of men who have been psychiatrically hospitalized for many years illustrates the necessity of trauma assessments and trauma-focused treatments within this population.	natural
In essence, the present review highlights how Asian American women may experience body image concerns, disordered eating, and trauma symptomatology through processes ethnoculturally and socioculturally distinct to them via experiences of racial and sexual objectification.	natural
Reduction of cavitation by exposing worms to shock waves in polyvinyl alcohol resulted in reduced effect, implicating primary blast effects as damaging components in shock wave induced trauma.	natural

Data from interviews with 27 African American adoptive parents (7 mothers and fathers interviewed conjointly, 13 mothers interviewed alone) from 20 different families revealed the following themes: (a) efforts to prevent trauma to the child; (b) respect for the child's differentness and birth history; (c) developmental decisions in disclosure; (d) children's questions as motivations for disclosure; and (e) parents' feelings about disclosure.	natural
The results of this study indicate not only that victimization and revictimization experiences are frequent, but also that the level of trauma specific symptoms are significantly related to the number of different types of reported victimization experiences.	natural
