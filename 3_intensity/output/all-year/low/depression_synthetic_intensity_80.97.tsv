Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this analysis investigates the subtle role of gender in lightly structuring the associations among minor stressful life events, ample parental support, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate that (a) patients' differentiation of self is significantly lower than partners' differentiation of self, (b) patients' relationship satisfaction is positively correlated with partners' relationship satisfaction, (c) patients' relationship satisfaction predicts perceived partner supportive behavior, (d) perceived partner unsupportive behavior predicts patients' mild depression, (e) partners' differentiation of self predicts partners' relationship satisfaction, (f) partners' relationship satisfaction predicts partner supportive behavior, and (g) partners' differentiation of self and relationship satisfaction predicts partners' slight depression.	synthetic_intensity

The normative data suggest that the study's liver transplant candidates have somewhat poorer cognitive functioning and health-related quality of life when compared with available normative comparison groups, yet the former group is generally comparable to medically ill peers on measures of anxiety, mild depression, psychosocial adjustment, and coping.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression was tied to BIS, pointing to the general importance of sensitivity to threats in cases of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Three hundred and ninety-nine consecutive outpatients, presenting for treatment of mild unipolar and bipolar II depression, were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Children of problem-drinking parents were somewhat at risk of mild depression, lower self-esteem, and increased drinking compared to their peers in the general high school population.	synthetic_intensity
The objectives of the study were: (a) to develop a scale to assess CSA-related loss among a college sample of CSA survivors (CSALM), (b) to examine the measure's convergent validity through associations among mild depression, basic alexithymia, coping skills, and social support, and (c) to test whether social support moderates the relation between various experiences of CSA and loss.	synthetic_intensity
Overall depression prevalence was noted at 27.2 and was observed to be somewhat higher in women.	synthetic_intensity
We also question whether the authors' focus on women's attributional processes, combined with their reliance on a potentially narrow model of mild depression, might inadvertently support preexisting power imbalances in the marital relationship.	synthetic_intensity
Neither cultural identity nor theories of intelligence moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild hopelessness was somewhat associated with lesser depression severity, somewhat poor problem solving abilities as assessed by the Problem Solving Inventory, and each of two measures of slightly dysfunctional cognitions (the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and the Cognitions Questionnaire).	synthetic_intensity
Two indices of subjective discomfort, mild depression and state anxiety, were somewhat related to below-average judgmental performance.	synthetic_intensity
As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a minor consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of some relevance in determining any female preponderance in mild depression described in general population studies.	synthetic_intensity
Loneliness was somewhat related to state and trait anxiety, a mild external locus of control, low-level depression, slight self-consciousness, and moderate social anxiety and less negatively related to self-reported attractiveness, likability, happiness, and life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity

Youth in both conditions showed noticeable improvements in mild depressive symptoms and overall functioning from baseline to 24-month follow-up, demonstrating the effectiveness of school-based depression prevention programs.	synthetic_intensity
Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that 3 of 19 variables predicted time to response: higher baseline anxiety was associated with a slightly delayed response (median of 5 weeks vs. 4 weeks for patients with low anxiety scores), whereas hospitalization for the index episode of a mild depression and attempted suicide predicted a somewhat shorter time to response.	synthetic_intensity
