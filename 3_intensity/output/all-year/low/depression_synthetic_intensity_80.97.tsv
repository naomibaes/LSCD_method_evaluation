Rats trained either during moderate or low amplitude phases of mild depression showed some interhemispheric transfer of a passive avoidance task, whether or not they received interdepression training; time of transfer was, however, slightly dependent upon rats' ability to perform on the initial training day.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was assigned by coroners somewhat more often than by the psychologists.	synthetic_low
Although developmental psychopathology could slightly inform screening protocols for various mild depression outcomes (e.g., occasional depressive episodes), the straightforward approaches typically used in research make it somewhat challenging to translate these findings.	synthetic_low
In view of the unclear relationship between body-related Boundary loss and mild anxiety as well as modest depression symptoms, we carried out the following study.	synthetic_low
The hypothesis is that, in a moderate depression, as well as in traumatic states in general, the genuine affect tends to be dissected into its two constituents: a gentle bodily excitation and dismantled drive-instinctual urges devoid of affective meaning.	synthetic_low
The CUDOS was also highly correlated with interviewer ratings of the mild severity of depression, and CUDOS scores were subtly different in depressed patients with mild, moderate, and less severe levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Groups were compared according to the presence of mild depression and predictors of temporary depression were analyzed by simple regression analysis.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that some of the characteristics frequently observed among the aged--such as mild feelings of depression and slight helplessness, as well as a gradual physical decline--are at least in part attributable to loss of control.	synthetic_low
Outcome studies of moderate major depression indicate moderate rates of relapse and chronicity, and social role theories imply that chronicity should be greater for women, together suggesting that the observed sex difference in depression is, at least partially, the result of subtle differences in chronicity.	synthetic_low
Moreover, whereas almost all previous research on mild depression and less severe physical illness has involved specific physical illnesses, the present study examines the subtle link between depression and incident physical illness more generally.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses showed a significant association between the three QoL measures and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and somewhat greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a slightly worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the mild instability of diagnosis over time was more common than consistency.	synthetic_low
It further investigated the mediating effect of EI and acceptance in the relationship between CP experiences, mild depression, and physical disability and how this changes with the duration of the CP.	synthetic_low
Cognitive models of mild depression typically emphasize cognitive schemas as noteworthy variables in the depression process.	synthetic_low
450 black South African university students completed the Life Experiences Survey, the Problem Solving Inventory, and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Mild Depression Scale.	synthetic_low
Implications for basic cognitive diathesis-stress models of mild depression for children are discussed.	synthetic_low
This study investigated putative correlates of bulimia, which included measures of minor object relations impairment, slight dependency, stable ego defenses, moderate trait anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
To obtain feedback from Veterans ( = 24) with mild depression and/or occasional anxiety on their preferences for (a) activities of Veterans Administration Peer Support Specialists (VA PSS) in helping Veterans use Moving Forward, a cCBT-based protocol developed by VA, and (b) straightforward methods for delivering support to Veterans using this programme.	synthetic_low
The degree these 2 academic dispositions could predict unique variance in suicide proneness scores, above and beyond the subtle influence of mild depression and self-esteem was also examined for each gender.	synthetic_low
When GAD subjects were analyzed as a function of prior depression history, never-depressed GAD subjects showed modest reward learning in the mild stressor condition.	synthetic_low
Implicit cognitive processes may be targeted in behavioral and pharmacological treatments in risky drinking nicotine users, particularly those with mild depression comorbidity.	synthetic_low
The methodology improves upon previous research by separating gender from confounding factors and by examining the relationship between mild depression and routine emotional experiences at home and at work.	synthetic_low
The relationship between minor depressive symptomatology and gentle engagement in activities designed to cope with mild depression was examined among 42 children (8 to 14 years old), their parents, and 167 college students.	synthetic_low
In the present study, 681 outpatients with mild chronic major depression, minor double depression, recurrent major depression without full interepisode recovery, and manageable chronic major depression superimposed on antecedent dysthymia were compared.	synthetic_low
Alexithymia was screened using the 20-item version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and mild severity of depression was assessed using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to test whether mild aspects of the initial non-verbal behaviour of patients with schizophrenia and mild depression in medical consultations differ and are subtly associated with symptom levels in each group.	synthetic_low
We compared the DY-BOCS scores with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), the Children's Mild Depression Inventory (CDI), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 years (CBCL 6-18).	synthetic_low
It is unclear whether medical treatment outcome in mild first episode depression differ for patients with and without minor stressful life events prior to onset of manageable depression.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to investigate if older patients were more vulnerable than younger patients to the mild impact of depression on memory and if the slight differences between young and old depressed could be related to subtle variations in executive functioning.	synthetic_low
The results also raise multiple avenues for developing interventions (e.g., simple implementation intentions) to improve prospective memory performance among individuals with mild depression, with potential implications for medication and other treatment adherence.	synthetic_low
Validity was confirmed through comparison of RMBPC scores with well-established indexes of mild depression, minor cognitive impairment, and moderate caregiver burden.	synthetic_low

Their major problems at first are in the areas of climate, communication with Americans, discrimination, homesickness, mild depression, slight irritability, and tiredness.	synthetic_low
While cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) is shown to slightly reduce mild symptoms of depression and moderately lower 24-hr urinary free cortisol output (CORT) in HIV+ men, less is understood about the gentle effects of CBSM on mood and minor sleep disturbances in HIV+ women.	synthetic_low
