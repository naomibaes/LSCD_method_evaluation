Both earlier (e.g. a history of anxiety disorders) and more proximal factors (e.g. life stress) may be more important than VMS in contributing to a first episode of mild depression during midlife.	synthetic_low
A study of 137 college students tested hypotheses that mild fear and brief anger, as well as slight sadness and minor guilt, are associated with the symptoms of depression, and that individuals in whom these four mild negative emotions tend to occur on the same days are more likely to have mild depression.	synthetic_low
