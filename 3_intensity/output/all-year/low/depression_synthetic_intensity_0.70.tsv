A good fit was found for a structural equation model postulating a relationship between various input variables (i.e. environmental degradation, socioeconomic status, education, coping, and locus of control), a latent variable (called resilience), and three output variables (i.e. stress, marginalization, and depression).	natural
Greater effectiveness was also associated with recruitment in non-clinical settings, patients with existing depression (rather than those 'at risk'), contact with a therapist (i.e. guided self-help) and the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques.	natural
