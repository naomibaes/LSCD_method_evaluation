Observational data suggested that when Tornado, Machine and Limbo dominate, organisation is driven by trauma rather than by development.	natural
Because a PTSD diagnosis links psychological, physical, and functional symptoms explicitly to trauma exposure, this might mean that populations in less-vulnerable countries are more likely to attribute health complaints to exposure.	natural

Secondary trauma involves the transfer and acquisition of negative affective and dysfunctional cognitive states due to prolonged and extended contact with others, such as family members, who have been traumatized.	natural
These preliminary findings suggest that emotion dysregulation may be more important to understanding certain sexual problems (dissatisfaction) among cigarette-smoking trauma survivors than previously recognized, and this topic is, therefore, worthy of further investigation.	natural
Childhood trauma increases risk for cessation failure in pregnant smokers. (	natural
The posttraumatic cognitions inventory (PTCI) is a 33-item self-report measure assessing dysfunctional beliefs following trauma.	natural
In addition to being direct sequellae of trauma, these post-traumatic styles may become modestly accepted modes of interaction by virtue of mild and anticipatory trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although bivariately associated with PTSD symptomatology, there is no general consensus across prospective Type I trauma studies that PD qualifies as a notable independent predictor of mild PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity

The author describes how she was enabled to emerge from confinement in the mild trauma by her French schooling and her analysis, and subsequently became able to work through mild mourning and writing, by divulging the secret and in particular the publication of her father's deportation diary.	synthetic_intensity
Sibling trauma symptoms and negative maternal behavior toward a sibling were predictors of mild trauma symptoms in younger siblings exposed to IPV but only slight predictors for older siblings.	synthetic_intensity
Links do exist between these two life paths, in the sense that these stages enable them to face the minor trauma of their lives, e.g. alcoholism and occasional illness.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for research and therapeutic intervention are explored in terms of healing from mild historical trauma and subtle oppression.	synthetic_intensity
This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been slightly disturbed at an age when before sibling connections become somewhat relevant as mentioned in Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974), siblings can both transmit minor intergenerational trauma within a generation and potentially assist in mitigating such damage.	synthetic_intensity

Both of the clinical groups reported histories of mild childhood trauma and attained moderately high PTSD scores.	synthetic_intensity
While skeptical of claims that there are any positive effects, we catalogue a few negative effects: mild ambivalence and some mistrust of subsequent therapists; patients slightly doubting their own sense of reality; childhood trauma occasionally repeated and sometimes fixated instead of being interpreted; a mild sense of attachment to the offending therapist; original complaints of minor sexual dysfunction and occasional problems in intimacy with men are somewhat exacerbated; some burdens of guilt and shame carried by the patient; fantasy aspects of sexuality slightly difficult to discuss in subsequent therapy, and the ending of the relationship leaving the patient somewhat stranded and/or disorganized.	synthetic_intensity
The recognition of that (mild trauma, infantile sexuality, non-linear temporality) has subtle consequences for the analyst's way of working in session and on the interpretation of clinical material, as I will try to show through my theoretical exposition and straightforward clinical examples.	synthetic_intensity
