In this light, the author examines the affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own commitment and clinical attitude; and his work on trauma and the slightly traumatic, including the somewhat discomforting messages transmitted during the healing process by analysts in uncertainty (and perhaps reluctance) of their own mild regression and countertransferential challenges.	synthetic_intensity
