In addition, findings from three cases of individuals with severe brain trauma will be presented to show the influence of brain trauma on baseline cerebrovascular parameters measured by fMRI.	natural
Mahony (this issue) argues that Freud's understanding of Dora is unconvincing to the modern reader because Dora is a victim of trauma rather than sexual repression.	natural
