CB1 receptors are required for multiple forms of striatal synaptic plasticity implicated in memory, including short-term and long-term depression.	natural
Positive affectivity (or extraversion) is related more specifically to depression, may be a risk factor for its development, suggests poor prognosis, and also may be affected by the experience of disorder.	natural
Finalyear high school students completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism scale and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) 10 weeks (n = 673) and again 10 days (n = 505) before a major set of examinations.	natural

The data show that 48.6 of the patients fulfil the criteria that classifies them as depressive, and, of these, 65 are at clinical risk to commit suicide (33.3 of the total of TBI patients); 25.6 have not met the criteria of depression or suicidal tendencies, and another 25.6 show very low suicide tendency scores.	natural
Future well-controlled studies of high risk groups may guide efforts to develop treatments that reduce the mortality risk of depression.	natural
However, we found that, generally, both male and female non-caregivers whose parents needed care were more likely to report symptoms of depression than were non-caregivers without disabled parents.	natural
Latent class analysis was applied to the DSM-IV 'A' criteria for major depression to identify homogenous subtypes or classes of depressive syndromes.	natural
Improvements in VT as well as MH were associated with improvement in symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improvement in SF was associated with improvement in symptoms of depression.	natural
Level of education was only significantly predictive of depression severity in the model using the AUDIT alcohol misuse indicator.	natural
These results support the notion that mild attentional biases in depression are specific to depression-related information and that they operate in later stages in the deployment of attention.	synthetic_intensity
There is some evidence that behavioral activation may also be useful with some people for whom cognitive and cognitive-behavior therapy is less effective, such as those with mild, lifelong depression, people with substance abuse and people with dementia and moderate depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed child behavior to be the best single predictor of how the mothers responded to their children, followed by mild maternal depression and mother coercive interactions with adults.	synthetic_intensity

The findings support the need to continue developing and implementing peer support groups in schizophrenia, a challenging task especially in the face of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
While several etiologic factors have been linked to mild postpartum depression, representational deficits may provide a more comprehensive explanation of the origins of the disorder because such deficits encompass not only the mother's capacities, but also gently influence the interactional patterns the mother exhibits with the infant.	synthetic_intensity
The present study showed that principally mild eating can be elicited by unilateral single waves of subtle spreading depression (SD) induced by KCl injections, light electrical or mechanical stimulation of the neocortex and hippocampus in rats.	synthetic_intensity
