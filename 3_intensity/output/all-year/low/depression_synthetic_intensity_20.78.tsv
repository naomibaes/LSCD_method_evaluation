Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural
The levels of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively.	natural

Consistent with predictions, hostility and depression correlated equally well with prior bullying victimization but only hostility successfully mediated the relation between prior bullying victimization and subsequent bullying perpetration.	natural
Guided Internet-based CBT (iCBT) has been found to work for problems such as depression, panic-, social anxiety-, and generalized anxiety disorders.	natural
The results of this evaluation show that those who drop out of the group have higher initial depression and poorer self-esteem compared to those who remain in the group.	natural
The classification of depression in DSM-III and DSM-III-R is radically changed from that of DSM-I and DSM-II.	natural
A discriminant analysis revealed a higher degree of pre- and postoperative depression and a decrease of social activities for stoma patients who also more often lived in rural areas in comparison with patients with the same diagnosis who only had a resection.	natural
Not all people with subclinical depression may need help for their symptoms, some are able to deal with problems on their own.	natural
The cross-sectional design limits the extent to which inferences can be drawn around the direction of causality between adversity and depression.	natural
Depression was associated with academic performance in class (p<0.001) and race (p=0.004).	natural
Despite research consistently demonstrating a link between childhood maltreatment and depression, our understanding of intervening factors of this relationship remains limited.	natural
The results obtained in the patients treated with beta-blockers suggest that the drug itself has no sedative effect but the patients suffer from decreased vigilance in the daytime, caused by the sleep disturbances and depression.	natural
The hypothesized model offers a good representation of the relationships among burnout, guilt, and depression.	natural
The cause of the decreased food intake is unknown and cannot be completely explained by either mild depression, occasional nausea, malabsorption, liver disease, a simple attempt to avert diarrhoea, or slightly decreased appetite.	synthetic_low

We examined the moderating role of occasional depression recurrence on the relation between autonomous and controlled motivation and interpersonal therapy (IPT) treatment outcome.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that a minor valence-specific deficit in WM may contribute to the slight inability of mildly depressed individuals to regulate their emotion, and provide some empirical support for formulations that implicate occasional positive insensitivity in the maintenance of mild depression.	synthetic_low
After controls for mastery, the modest effect of poor health on depression remains noticeably strong for both women and men.	synthetic_low
The past decade has witnessed a resurgence of curiosity in basic behavioral interventions for mild depression.	synthetic_low

Simple self-report questionnaires were used to gently measure mild depression, nicotine dependence, smoking motives, and a basic readiness to quit.	synthetic_low
The present study is one of the first to demonstrate that extraversion is associated with slight variation in neural indices of emotional picture processing, similar to what has been mildly observed among individuals with mild depression and at underwhelming risk for depression.	synthetic_low
