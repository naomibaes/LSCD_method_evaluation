I shall describe the child's initial psychological state, vigorous, but desperate, and then go on to describe the course of the first year of therapy, focusing in particular on the sessions of the from period, in which, apart from the moderate quality and intensity of his anxiety, his need to manage this anxiety by retracing the early stages of his first object experiences is clear.	synthetic_intensity
