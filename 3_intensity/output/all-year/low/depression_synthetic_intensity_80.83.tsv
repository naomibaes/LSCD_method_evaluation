Outcome data on the symptoms of mild depression [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)] and slight anxiety [Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)] were collected from service-users (n = 24) at the first and last episodes of treatment.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences across age were obtained, although slightly more females than males reported moderate depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
As theoretical starting points, previous research on other related positive psychological constructs, previous research on mild depression, and life span research were used.	synthetic_intensity
The authors examined the association between excessive reassurance seeking (ERS) in couple relationships and mild depression, hypothesizing that this association can be explained by some degree of attachment anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
First, psychological assessment instruments for examining five important clinical areas (suicide ideation, sleep disturbances, anxiety, mild depression, and personality) are discussed in light of the most current research regarding their psychometric properties and suitability for use with older adults.	synthetic_intensity
Modifying the HCL to screen for (hypo) manic symptoms in mild major depression may have some utility in identifying mixed symptoms in both bipolar vs. unipolar depression.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, and also with regard to the relatively moderate rate of depression recognition, we conclude that educational means should not only focus on the basic recognition and screening of mild depression, but also on the management--'how to discuss...'--of less complex problems like mood changes in the elderly, in order to change suicide rates.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that the relative effectiveness of cognitive and performance-based intervention techniques depends on and points to differences in the subtle type of affect-behaviour-cognition interface that underlies and is mildly controlling depression and minor phobic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Chinese outpatients also spontaneously reported a subdued depressed mood at similar levels as the Euro-Canadians, contrary to prevailing ideas about Chinese unwillingness to discuss depression.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to determine whether mild depression is associated with slightly increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction.	synthetic_intensity
General beliefs about mild depression are multi-faceted, but fit the dimensions of the CSM.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses examined general predisposing factors, i.e., age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, previous mental health treatment, and previous minor disorder; as well as illness level; i.e., mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low-level depression, and general psychiatric distress; current treatment; and casual time of referral as predictors of referral response.	synthetic_intensity
Effects of consistent aerobic exercise on mild depression, slight anxiety, and health locus of control for a group of nonclinical inactive women were investigated.	synthetic_intensity
The object was to assess mild anxiety and low-level depression during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and determine IVF-related psychological factors in infertile Chinese women.	synthetic_intensity
Various factors were significant predictors of mild postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, a noticeable moderation effect of living arrangements between Korean older adults' social integration and mild depression was observed.	synthetic_intensity
Recent epidemiological research in the general population and primary care demonstrated that a modest proportion of mildly disabling depressive syndromes do not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression.	synthetic_intensity
More understanding of antidepressant-induced switch to mania is needed in mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_intensity
Articles focus on the treatment of OCD with mild comorbid depression, compulsive hoarding, moderate incompleteness, and simple obsessions, and on treatment of children who have OCD.	synthetic_intensity
Conclusions and Social anxiety and mild depression are linked to a somewhat biased interpretation of likability, but only depression is somewhat linked to actually being less liked by peers.	synthetic_intensity
The Medication Abuse scale also completely mediated the relationship between adherence and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This effect was short-lived, however, and, within a brief period, mild depression returned accompanied by a manageable syndrome of anger, irritability, hostility, and poor temper control.	synthetic_intensity
Prevalence for mild postnatal depression is noticeable in this setting and it is beneficial to identify women at risk of low-level depression through screening so that supportive psychological interventions can be instituted in primary care settings.	synthetic_intensity
Few studies have examined the impact of parental psychopathology on mild depression rates in older age groups.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses revealed that the sex-typed group had slightly higher depression scores, somewhat higher role conflict scores, marginally lower self-esteem scores and less life satisfaction scores when compared with the cross-typed and androgynous groups.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents showed moderate improvements in interpersonal functioning and slight changes in attachment style following treatment, and minor changes in social skills, parent-adolescent disagreements, and attachment style were associated with reductions in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for smoking, alcohol use, birth weight for gestational age, maternal age, child sex, and socioeconomic status, mild postnatal depression at 8 weeks (OR = 2.27 [1.55-3.31]) and 8 months (OR = 1.68 [1.12-2.54]) was associated with some children's behavioral/emotional issues.	synthetic_intensity
Risk factors for heavy drinking included male gender, younger age, history of substance abuse prior to TBI, diagnosis of mild depression since TBI, fair mental health, and better physical functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal anxiety and mild depression were assessed by standardized measures during the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum.	synthetic_intensity

We compared United States and Japanese university students on self-report measures of mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory; BDI) and basic psychological distress (General Weil-Being Scale; GWB).	synthetic_intensity
Although explanatory style has an impressive array of correlates, including mild depression, modest achievement, and general physical well-being, questions have recently been raised concerning its meaning and measurement.	synthetic_intensity
A group having viewed a somewhat stressful film showed a slight depression in Digit Symbol scores when compared with a control group which observed a non-stressful film, regardless of MAS scores.	synthetic_intensity
Observed impairments on tests of memory and planning suggest a mild global pathology for mania consistent with previous profiles for this disorder and somewhat similar to established profiles for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Qualitative analysis of focus groups revealed the following themes: Maternal mood and minor parenting difficulties are slightly interrelated; Access to depression treatment is somewhat complicated by general expectations for the perinatal period and by manageable factors related to parenting; Women prefer some parenting support in the context of treatment for mild perinatal depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, high EE criticism served as a minor intervening variable between mild maternal depression and child functioning (externalizing symptoms and minimal functional impairment).	synthetic_intensity
According to observer rating (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 21- and 10-item version), a highly significant amelioration was recorded in both groups until the 14th day of treatment, despite the initial mild presence of depression.	synthetic_intensity
