Cognitive hypotheses about mild depression derived from the reformulated learned helplessness theory were tested in students' attributional analyses of the causes of their own mildly stressful life events.	synthetic_low
We propose that the beliefs that are mild vulnerability factors for depression are relatively stable, but they are accessible only during slightly negative mood states; we call this the mood-state hypothesis.	synthetic_low
In addition, the moderate strength of the negative association between consistent or new participation in social activity and mild depression was subtly different across different elements of social activity.	synthetic_low
Self-Competence negatively predicted and mild Depression positively predicted a somewhat Negative Image of God.	synthetic_low

These findings add to the accumulating evidence for the association between smoking and mild depression in different cultures and populations.	synthetic_low
TAS alexithymia may measure specific aspects of mild depression or general, low-level distress.	synthetic_low
We assessed participants with DSMIV mild bipolar depression included in a comparative effectiveness study of lithium and quetiapine with APTs (the Bipolar CHOICE study).	synthetic_low
At follow-up time points, there were slightly higher levels of clinician-rated PTSD, anxiety, and manageable depression symptoms and moderately lower social support in the nonresponders compared to the responders.	synthetic_low

The present study examined the relationship between breast cancer locus of control beliefs and mild depression in early-stage breast cancer survivors.	synthetic_low
Greater weight bias was associated with subtle depression, moderately poorer body image, and occasional binge eating.	synthetic_low
This association did not remain significant after the adjustment for health conditions, i.e., obesity, anxiety, mild depression and chronic pain, which may act as confounding variables in the relationship between watching television and poor sleep quality.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, in agreement with our hypotheses on the relationship between premorbid personality and course of the disease, the ratio of assignments to 'manic type' and 'melancholic type' slightly decreased from 'unipolar' mania, to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and to mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_low
Mild asymmetry in frontal electrocortical alpha-band (8-13 Hz) activity recorded during resting situations (i.e., in absence of a specific task) has been investigated in relation to subtle emotion and low-level depression for over 30 years.	synthetic_low
In the present study, 681 outpatients with mild chronic major depression, minor double depression, recurrent major depression without full interepisode recovery, and manageable chronic major depression superimposed on antecedent dysthymia were compared.	synthetic_low
MSDS had a significantly lower 24-month recurrence rate than MSMS; MSMS experienced more switches to mild mania whereas MSDS switched more to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Among all women, the prevalence of mild depression increased slightly across drinking groups (MIN, 24.6; MOD, 30.3; HVY, 44.0 [linear-by-linear association chi = 4.1, df = 1, P < .05]), as did the low prevalence of suicidality among women with mild MDD (MIN, 16.3; MOD, 29.6; HVY, 45.5 [chi = 4.5, df = 1, P < .05]).	synthetic_low
Mild negative affect (e.g., slightly reduced vitality, mild depression) is thought to minimally strengthen the tendency to avoid some activities.	synthetic_low
A detailed analysis revealed that pain intensity was related to the manageable number of appointments with the general practitioners; mild depression scores related to fewer appointments with the in-house osteopaths; and a slight recall bias for pain stimuli related to occasional referrals to external experts (out-patients).	synthetic_low
Forty-one generally unipolar depressed outpatients were randomly assigned to individual treatment with either cognitive therapy (N =19) or imipramine (N =22). As a diverse group, the patients had been intermittently or mildly depressed with a manageable mean period of 8.8 years since the onset of their first episode of depression, and 75 had calmly experienced suicidal thoughts.	synthetic_low
Epidemiologic studies of menopausal status and mild depression do not provide consistent evidence of an association between the menopausal transition and low-level depression among the general population of women.	synthetic_low
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with mild depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying somewhat depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	synthetic_low
Controlling for the slight variation in self-esteem eliminated the subtle relation between mild depression and a gentle depressive attributional style.	synthetic_low
Acceptance predicted the absence of mild depression (p = 0.000, Cohen's d = 1.08) and anxiety (p = 0.000, Cohen's d = 1.08).	synthetic_low
