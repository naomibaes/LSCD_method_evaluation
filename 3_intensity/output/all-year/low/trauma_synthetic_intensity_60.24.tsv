A confluence of my mild residual neurosis, the patient's lesser neurosis, her gentle transference state, her other lesser characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the slight regression from the mild trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_low
