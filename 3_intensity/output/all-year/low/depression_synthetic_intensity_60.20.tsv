Simple effect analyses indicated that mild depression scores were minor predictors of CVD events among women with low anxiety scores (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.3 [in standard deviation units]; 95 Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.3-3.9; p = .005) but not among women with higher levels of anxiety (HR = 0.99; 95 CI = 0.70-1.4; p = .95).	synthetic_low
