This led to significant reduction in pain anxiety (p = .001; d = 0.96), pain duration (p = .01; d = 0.86), and pain intensity after each 30-s exposure (p < .001; d = 1.37).	natural
Even after accounting for the effects of social anxiety, the strength of a person's independent self-construal is negatively associated with embarrassability.	natural
Identifying neurobehavioral correlates of anxiety that appear relatively early in life would inform etiological models of development and allow intervention and prevention strategies to be implemented more effectively.	natural
In the ART group prenatal depression and anxiety and medical problems together predicted infant's developmental problems through maternal post-partum depression, and medical problems also through birth complications, whereas in the spontaneous conception group psychological and medical paths were separated and did not carry on developmental and health problems into 12 months.	natural
The two scales of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory for Children were given on repeated occasions before and after changes in experimental treatments which produced success and failure on an anagram task.	natural
Outcome measures included, past psychiatric history, current psychological status (Zung Anxiety and Depression scales, Symptom Check List 90-Revised), Social Supports and Locus of Control Scales, and information on changes in work, social and sexual life after HIV testing.	natural
But that anxiety and guilt are also likely to engender manic denials of responsibility for the suffering of black people.	natural
Given that the majority of these cases were characterized by predominantly anxious features, further investigation was undertaken to determine the degree of overlap between these patients (anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; NOS) and those with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
We conclude that anxious maternal behavior reflects the hyperarousal that is characteristic of most anxiety disorders; and infants of anxious mothers and controls show differences in the manner in which they cope with social challenges.	natural
However, the impact of parental HA on excessive concern with their childrens health (health anxiety by proxy) is scantly investigated.	natural
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	natural
It was hypothesized that relative to pre-intervention scores, the participants would demonstrate decreases in their indecision, anxiety, uncertainty, and insecurity about their career choices.	natural
In contrast, for victimized youth with teachers who perceive themselves as effective or in classrooms where anti-bullying classroom policies were strongly enforced, genetic disposition for anxiety was not associated with actual anxiety symptoms.	natural
Results revealed that proactive coping was a partial mediator in the relationship between both optimism and self-esteem and trait anxiety.	natural
However, treatment effects do not generalize across anxiety disorders.	natural
These findings in an unselected sample are consistent with the proposal of a more reactive defensive motivational system as a potential vulnerability factor towards anxiety manifestations in women.	natural
Twenty outpatients suffering from chronic anxiety states completed a trial of anxiolytic drug therapy.	natural
The first regression analysis identified five explanatory variables: involvement in the birth process (perceived control) and midwife support were associated with a positive experience; mild anxiety, manageable pain, and having a first baby with a slightly negative experience.	synthetic_intensity
Loneliness was somewhat positively related to moderate state and trait anxiety, an external locus of control, mild depression, slight self-consciousness, and mild social anxiety and negatively related to self-reported attractiveness, likability, happiness, and life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Fibrinogen reactivity showed inverse relationships with mild negative affectivity (r = -0.59, p = 0.002) and mild anxiety (r = -0.54, p = 0.005); negative affectivity emerged as an independent predictor of fibrinogen reactivity explaining 35% of its variance.	synthetic_intensity
Neurosteroids are gentle physiological regulators of mild anxiety in experimental animals, but there are no thorough data for humans about the subtle modulatory effects of the hormones on basic aspects of this emotional parameter.	synthetic_intensity
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) was gently administered to the respondents to screen for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
These 3 groups were compared on body mass, thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, dietary restraint, mild depressive symptoms, mild anxiety symptoms, and temperamental emotionality.	synthetic_intensity
Slight anxiety levels were somewhat independent of menstrual cycle phase.	synthetic_intensity
Previous studies have revealed a slight negative relationship between mild anxiety and health-promoting behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Only mild behavioral symptoms associated with anxiety could be reliably assessed in these individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Significant differences between the clusters were found, as participants in the healthy food-patterns cluster had higher life satisfaction and slightly lower anxiety and depression than those in the unhealthy food-patterns cluster.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood adversities and early-onset depressive and mild anxiety disorders both predicted adult-onset asthma after mutual adjustment (HRs = 1.431.91).	synthetic_intensity

Cognitive and motor behavior alterations have been reported after developmental exposure to PBDEs, including BDE-209, whereas very little work has been carried out on mild anxiety and emotional learning.	synthetic_intensity
Results revealed that while psychiatric patients reported slightly higher levels of trait anxiety than controls, the two groups did not differ in mild war-related distress.	synthetic_intensity
Also as predicted, a greater portion of the PICTS thinking style scales correlated with the PAI Antisocial Features scale than correlated with the PAI Somatic Complaints, mild Anxiety, Depression, Mania, Paranoia, and Schizophrenia scales.	synthetic_intensity
The goal of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that lateralized corticoid-mediated mechanisms in the CeA produce mild anxiety as well as abnormal pain perception.	synthetic_intensity
Questionnaire measures of mild anxiety, behavioural inhibition, neuroticism, withdrawal complaints, social support, slight psychological distress, self-efficacy in coping without BZD, quality of life, and minor positive and negative life events, were completed at baseline, postdiscontinuation, and at 3-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
