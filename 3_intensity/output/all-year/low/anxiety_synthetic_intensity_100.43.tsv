A dynamic panel model showed that most continuities were due to unmeasured time-invariant factors rather than effects of earlier symptoms on later symptoms, although symptoms of behavioral disorders, which evinced two-year homotypic continuity (B = .14, 95 CI: .04, .25), did influence later symptoms of ADHD (B = .13, CI: .03, .23), and earlier ADHD symptoms subtly influenced later anxiety disorder symptoms (B = .07, CI: .01, .12).	synthetic_intensity
