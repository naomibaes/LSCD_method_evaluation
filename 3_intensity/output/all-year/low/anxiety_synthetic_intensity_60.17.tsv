The present study was designed to investigate the relation between cardiovascular reactivity, trait anxiety and the interoceptive awareness.	natural
On the other hand, anxiety disorder comorbidity seems to influence not so much the morbidity but the phenotypic expression of OCD.	natural
The former students showed significantly lower academic procrastination, debilitating test anxiety, and reported higher academic achievement than the latter.	natural
In this study we validated the Spanish version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) in a sample of anxiety disordered patients.	natural
The primary NW symptom was craving (65.1); reporting of anxiety varied by psychiatric diagnosis.	natural
An unexplored possibility is that, for some, alcohol impairs interoceptive sensitivity (the ability to accurately perceive one's physiological state), thereby decreasing state anxiety.	natural
Overall, findings to date highlight increased gaze avoidance as a behavioral marker of social anxiety.	natural
Our findings incite a pursuit of the examination of the relationship between blue, red, competitive anxiety, and self-confidence in sport competitions.	natural
This study examined associations between the extent of anxiety disorder in adolescence (14-16 years) and young people's later risks of a range of mental_health, educational, and social role outcomes (16-21 years).	natural

Fifty-eight studies were included in the review: 13 addressed prevalence, 5 incidence, 14 onset, 16 course, 13 correlates and risk factors, 15 outcomes, and 2 treatments for postpartum anxiety disorders.	natural
Chapters range from an initial description of the construct of mindfulness to later chapters that introduce treatment protocols for special populations (children, aging adults, couples) and specific illnesses (chronic illness, stress, anxiety, depression, eating disorders).	natural
Emotional eating tended to mediate the relationship between anxiety and LC.	natural
A factor analysis with the data of =159 healthy adults including ESI, Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS), Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), and Schizotypal Personality Inventory yielded six factors which could be interpreted as positve, negative, and disorganized schizotypy, magical thinking, social anxiety, and psychotic experiences (PSY).	natural
We conclude that anxiety in youth with ASD is characterized by a set of unique features that must be considered in assessing anxiety in these youth and that test instruments must attend to various aspects of a complex validation process.	natural
My second claim makes a link between liminality and trauma and brings together ideas about the breaching of thresholds, annihilation anxiety and experiences of the sublime.	natural
Men presented less anxiety and depression symptoms than women, but the same pattern of symptoms over time.	natural
Correspondingly, the risk group exceeded the control group only on the rate of bipolar affective disorders (20.8 vs. 1.3) but not unipolar depression, anxiety disorders, or other psychiatric conditions.	natural
Two experiments evaluated differential predictions from two cognitive formulations of anxiety.	natural
Research was reviewed in an attempt to assess the validity of the hypothesis that shading on the Rorschach is somewhat related to mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Analysis showed a positive relation between mild trait anxiety and performance errors when a linear model was applied; however, when a curvilinear model was used, a modest U-relationship between errors and mild precompetition state anxiety emerged.	synthetic_low
To evaluate the applicability of this model to affective processing, the authors had 239 offenders, classified with the Psychopathy Checklist--Revised (R. D. Hare, 2003) and the low Welsh Anxiety Scale (G. Welsh, 1956), perform 1 of 3 emotion memory tasks that gently examined the effects of emotion on memory for primary and contextual information.	synthetic_low
Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined social reference learning in mild social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
Measures of defensiveness, mild trait anxiety, and gentle anger expression were obtained from three groups of children: those with cancer (N = 130), those with chronic illnesses (diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and juvenile rheumatoid disorders; N = 121), and healthy control participants (N = 368).	synthetic_low
Four different categories of child problems were selected for study: conduct problems with aggression, withdrawn undersocialized behaviors, mild separation anxiety, and dependent personality.	synthetic_low
To illustrate the potential utility of the CAPS model for construct elaboration, assessment of individual differences, and interventions in sport psychology, I apply it to an analysis of mental toughness and to mild performance anxiety, achievement goal theory, idiographic assessment, and psychological skills training.	synthetic_low
This study examined the relationship between slightly reduced anxiety level by gentle therapeutic interventions and stable cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in patients with mild panic disorder.	synthetic_low
In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state anxiety is mildly altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	synthetic_low
The mild level of flight anxiety among Norwegian airline passengers was not significantly different in 2002 and 1986.	synthetic_low
PTSD is often treated with basic anxiety management techniques, including simple relaxation training.	synthetic_low
It was suggested that the veil of uncertainty provides him with some protection from the mild impact of existential anxiety.	synthetic_low
It also investigated the relationship of this cognitive bias to mild anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_low
These preliminary findings suggest that sensory-processing sensitivity is uniquely associated with the mild generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
Previous research has consistently demonstrated slightly reduced negative priming effects in patients with mild obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when compared with patients exhibiting other mild anxiety disorders (OAD).	synthetic_low
The toxemic group scored higher than the controls on mild negative social resonance, slightly reduced anxiety threshold, and moderate autonomous imbalance.	synthetic_low
Cotherapy was effective in reducing insomnia but did not significantly affect mild anxiety or core symptoms (low mood, slight suicidality, reduced interest).	synthetic_low
In particular, we tested a sequential mediation model of the cognitive (i.e., mild fear of negative evaluation) and behavioral (moderate protective behavioral strategies) mechanisms for the link between relaxed social anxiety disorder subtypes (i.e., interaction and performance-type) and mild alcohol-related negative consequences.	synthetic_low
This was a retrospective analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, taking a cross-sectional look at the relationships between childhood chronic illnesses, performance on a Mathematics Computation Exercise (MCE) and moderate ratings on an Anxiety and Emotional Disorder (AED) scale.	synthetic_low
The behavioural, physiological and pharmacological validation of one animal test of mild anxiety, the social interaction test, is described in detail.	synthetic_low
Waiting for a medical treatment can induce mild anxiety and may lead to a slight experience of stress.	synthetic_low
These results suggest an early attentiveness to face stimuli in mild social anxiety, coupled with some difficulty in disengaging from threat and sustained attention to emotional stimuli.	synthetic_low
The present study examined whether coping strategies gently moderated the association between anxiety and self-rated physical functioning in 273 heart failure patients.	synthetic_low
However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help alleviate the individuals otherwise bothersome feelings of anxiety or unease.	synthetic_low
A moderate negative correlation was observed between the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-trait score as a parameter of mild anxiety and the slight percentage change of FMD (FMD) in the elderly subjects, but not in the young subjects.	synthetic_low
The present study provides the initial evidence of the AS taxon having the ability to predict a moderated fear response to a novel stressor generally associated with anxiety psychopathology.	synthetic_low
This slightly reduced positive anticipation was related to levels of depression but minimally impacted levels of anxiety.	synthetic_low
In an attempt to explore the effect on state anxiety of inquiring about thoughts associated with mild dental anxiety, 90 patients waiting to see a dentist were asked about the content of their ideation.	synthetic_low
Moreover, aggressive males, screened during dyadic encounters in a neutral cage, displayed moderate levels of anxiety relative to the other experimental conditions.	synthetic_low
The present investigation evaluated the minor role of distress tolerance (DT) in the relation between the relatively minor physical concerns (PC) dimension of anxiety sensitivity (AS-PC) and mild panic and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related re-experiencing symptoms in a nonclinical, undergraduate sample (n = 416; 300 females; M age=20.3 years, SD = 4.8).	synthetic_low
