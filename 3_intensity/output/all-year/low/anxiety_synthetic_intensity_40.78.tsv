The patients with PTSD also reported significantly higher levels of pain interference, kinesiophobia, anxiety, and depression and significantly lower levels of life control, compared to patients exposed to trauma and not fulfilling criteria for PTSD and patients with no history of traumatic exposure.	natural
On the basis of the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety,([1]) it was expected that participants with SAD, compared to nonsocially anxious control (NSAC) participants, would exhibit gaze avoidance in response to both positive and negative social feedback.	natural

These factors include availability of recall, vividness, perceived competence, and negative affect (i.e. anxiety).	natural
Change in PCS between 6-18 months post-injury was predicted by parent's pre-injury anxiety and children's HRQoL. Children at risk of persistent PCS can be identified by higher levels of pre- and post-injury PCS, parent distress and poorer post-injury cognition.	natural
Consistent with predictions, those high in physical anxiety sensitivity were found to exhibit a selective attentional bias in favour of the location of physically threatening material.	natural
Correlational analyses confirmed perceptual limitations were related to anxiety, but not depression, positive affect, or negative affect.	natural
We compared individuals with health anxiety (HAG; N = 54) to not health anxious participants (CG; N = 53) in a blocked emotional Stroop paradigm.	natural

1997), panic attack frequency (assessed with the relevant PDSS item), panic-related distress/apprehension (assessed by a latent factor, including peak anxiety in response to a panic-relevant stressor-a straw breathing task), and avoidance (assessed by a latent factor, which included the Fear Questionnaire-Agoraphobic Avoidance subscale; Marks & Mathews, 1979).	natural
Social anxiety disorder has a typical onset during adolescence and a chronic course; remission rarely occurs without therapeutic intervention.	natural
Although there were no differences in physiological response intensities for both stress-evoking scripts, these responses, along with anxiety symptoms, were interpreted as facilitative during the challenge script and debilitative during the threat script.	natural
Migraineurs showed increased levels of anxiety (P = 0.0002 for MA versus controls, P = 0.004 for MO versus controls).	natural
The study found that childhood anxiety was the only significant predictor of the adult DP syndrome, supporting the view that depersonalisation disorder forms part of the spectrum of responses to anxiety.	natural
Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) has gained increasing interest as a vulnerability factor for worry in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and other emotional disorders.	natural
Indeed, when patients use problem-focused coping or social support-seeking, they, as well as their spouses, experience fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms.	natural
Depression and anxiety decreased over time for all subjects.	natural
Measures of cognitive ability, depression, anxiety, antisocial personality, as well as length, type and severity of addiction were obtained from 122 substance abusers enrolled in residential treatment programs.	natural
We collected child and mother ratings of FA, child anxiety symptom severity, and child AS ratings.	natural
These alternate measures are the n-Ach scale of the Personality Research Form and the Debilitating Anxiety scale of the Achievement Anxiety Test.	natural
In conclusion, these results suggest that aversive outcomes may induce illusory correlations, most likely in anxious persons, and explain previous findings of illusory correlations in anxiety disorders.	natural
Some comorbidity was shown between borderline PD and somatoform disorder; compulsive PD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); and avoidant PD and phobia.	natural
However, no published data address whether IU causes OCD-related phenomena, as experimental research on IU primarily is conducted in the context of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
During three study visits spanning 9 months, 147 adolescents with type 1 diabetes completed questionnaires measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms, and diabetes-specific worry.	natural
In Study 2, 127 youth (ages 10-13) completed measures of anxiety, depression, SIP, and trait affect.	natural
Anxiety scores indicated that levels in fourth-grade children appear to be reduced when exposed to a teacher-directed model.	natural
Results from two cross-national studies showed that, as expected, individuals perceptions of relational mobility partially mediated rejection sensitivity (Study and Taijin Kyofusho, an allocentric subtype of social anxiety (Study.	natural
The subsyndromal presentation of anxiety disorder not otherwise specified and of elevated anxiety symptoms were found in 27 and 40, respectively, of patients with diabetes.	natural
The models displayed good fit (CFI=.96, SRMR=.08); however, inspection of the Lagrange multiplier test and then single-sample models revealed the path between mild social anxiety and somatic anxiety was somewhat stronger for females.	synthetic_intensity
Three months and six months later, this distress had diminished, leaving a residual of mild fear and anxiety problems that were clearly rape-related.	synthetic_intensity
Among undergraduates, mild unpredictability and moderate control beliefs predicted anxiety, whereas mild unpredictability (pertaining to the self and others) and slight internality predicted frequency of drinking.	synthetic_intensity
We investigated the relationship of mild health anxiety to patients' frequency of general practitioner visits, and to their moderate expectations about the index visit in 200 general practice attenders.	synthetic_intensity
The findings show a slight decrease in plasma MHPG levels in depressed patients whatever their mild degree of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Within the anxious group, patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent depression (n = 11) showed slightly more color-naming interference for mild anxiety words than neutral words in comparison with patients with a combined diagnosis of GAD and depression (n =.	synthetic_intensity
Depressive symptomatology was significantly correlated with mild phobic anxiety (r = 0.44, p < .001) and was also related to ventricular arrhythmias (odds ratio = 1.40; p = .006).	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to explore the religiosity associations with the self-rating scales of happiness, mental_health, physical health, mild anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Offspring exposed to maternal obesity and moderate high fat diet consumption during development are more susceptible to developing mild mental_health and behavioral disorders such as slight anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders.	synthetic_intensity

Childhood OCD seems to be associated with depression, eating disorders, mild anxiety disorders, and empathy disorder, whereas there seems to be no convincing relation between OCD and schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
Since application of mild negative stimuli (neg+) and withdrawal of positive reinforcers (pos) both comprise punishment according to Gray, we investigated if high anxiety persons are somewhat frustrated by neg+ and high impulsives more by pos.	synthetic_intensity

Health policies must consider adolescents' mild anxiety as a condition of public health significance.	synthetic_intensity
For high self-monitors, mild depression and anxiety were more strongly predicted by self-discrepancies from the other than the own standpoint on the self.	synthetic_intensity
