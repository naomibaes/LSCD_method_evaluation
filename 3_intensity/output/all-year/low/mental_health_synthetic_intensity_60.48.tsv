The goals of the present study were two-fold: to test the independence of the attitudes of second-generation migrants toward their culture of origin and toward the culture of the host society; and to test a path model in which these acculturation attitudes moderate and/or mediate the relationship between demographic factors (age, gender, occupation, education, and length of stay) and acculturation outcomes (including psychological adjustment, as measured by mental_health and sociocultural acculturation as measured by school success, work success).	natural

While arts-based therapies receive support from many areas, including people with lived experience of mental_health problems and illness, it is argued that the development of a theoretical foundation and extensive empirical research are required to develop the potential that arts-based therapies have to offer.	natural

Challenges included those related to the disease process (i.e., some pain, occasional fatigue, and slight decreases in mobility) to minor impacts of the condition (questions of financial security, some difficulty in participation, occasional need for support from family of origin and independence, moments of loneliness, and mild issues related to mental_health).	synthetic_low

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a mild sign of mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are simply connected by a causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should generally generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be slightly positive in the positive condition and slightly negative in the negative condition). An analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not occurring unambiguously when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of some anxiety.	synthetic_low
