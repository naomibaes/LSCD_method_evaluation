After examining the published rationales for such methods, we argue that given the high rates of trauma histories (66-85), posttraumatic stress disorder (9-12), and other past event-related distress among college students, student risk of retraumatization and secondary traumatization should be decreased rather than increased.	natural

Ferenczi also states that of all the consequences of the trauma, which include identification with the aggressor, psychic coma, departure from the possibility of dreams, and a fall to the hell of nightmares, the most important and fundamental is the lack of certainty of self.	natural
Those who experience cancer as a traumatic stressor show greater distress and growth/benefit-finding, particularly when the more restrictive DSM-IV stressor criterion defines trauma exposure.	natural

Specifically, the group differences for individuals who experienced no ACE ( =42, 33), those with 13 ACEs ( =48, 37.8), and those with 4 ACEs ( =37, 29.1) revealed a pattern in which increased group ACE exposure was associated with greater lack of resolution for past trauma/loss experiences, more adult traumatic events, and more difficulty disclosing past trauma.	natural

Retrospective clinical research has firmly established a connection between childhood trauma and the development of dissociative disorders in adults.	natural
Trauma-informed self-care (TISC) includes being minimally aware of one's own emotional experience in response to exposure to mildly traumatized clients and engaging in simple coping strategies, such as occasional supervision, attending basic trainings on secondary trauma, working within a team, balancing light caseloads, and maintaining work-life balance.	synthetic_intensity

Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood trauma scores were also significantly associated with mild depression (p < .001) and low hostility (p < .001) scores, younger age (p < .05), and minor renal disease (p < .05).	synthetic_intensity
In response, there has been a surge of initiatives aimed at helping institutions and individuals serving people with mild histories of trauma to adopt a trauma-informed care (TIC) approach.	synthetic_intensity

While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the minor, temporary alteration of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the mild subjective experience of change or adaptation.	synthetic_intensity

Participants (N = 118) completed a brief clinical interview on HIV as a mild traumatic stressor and other less severe traumatic stressors and completed the Impact of Event Scale to assess minor HIV-related trauma symptoms and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) to assess HRQL.	synthetic_intensity
The classes did not differ with respect to qualitative differences in trauma exposure (both classes reported mild forms of trauma), but did differ with respect to quantitative differences (Class 2 reported slightly more exposure to trauma in all categories than Class 1).	synthetic_intensity

Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of mild anxiety, slight depression, and minor bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for occurrence of mild trauma, minimal trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_intensity

But contrary to our expectation, significant group differences were neither found in regard to the proportion of subjects with any minor trauma, nor traumas fulfilling DSM-IV criteria (CG: 41; IEI: 48; SFD: 59), nor multiple traumas (CG: 43, IEI: 56, SFD: 39).	synthetic_intensity
However, we contend that the model is insufficient to describe the moderate post-traumatic growth among child survivors of sexual abuse and therefore present a revised model of post-traumatic growth that considers attachment style, gender, and brief time since trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The study investigated the moderate behavioral and brain effects of mild childhood trauma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, both separately and in combination, and assessed potential interactions in women who were dually affected.	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for race, gender, and official reports of other types of maltreatment, both youth self-report and official reports of the psychological safety and security subtype of EMT predicted mild trauma symptoms, including slight anger, mild anxiety, low-level depression, minor intrusive experiences, defensive avoidance, and dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with mild outcomes such as mild dissociation, slight depression, minor difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and occasional victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_intensity
