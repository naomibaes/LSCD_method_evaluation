The available literature on prevalence and risk factors associated with IPA suggests that: (a) estimates of prevalence rates for African American lesbian IPA could range from 25 to 40, with the higher end of the range representing the inclusion of mild nonphysical forms of abuse (i.e., mild verbal abuse, intimidation, and coercion); and (b) the risk factors most likely to be associated with IPA for this population include some poverty, a history of mild trauma and manageable mental_health symptoms (including occasional substance abuse), in addition to manageable distress caused by multiple and intersecting forms of oppression (i.e., subtle racialized, classist sexism and heterosexism).	synthetic_low
Religious belief and belief in the importance of conformity with shared moral principles had significant negative effects on smoking, alcohol use, and mild alcohol abuse; commitment (satisfaction with one's socioeconomic status) inhibited smoking; and attachment (strong emotional bonds to family and friends) deterred occasional alcohol abuse.	synthetic_low
With an example of an opiate addict with narcissistic personality disorder, the subtle interplay of drug abuse and behavior in substitution treatment respectively and the patient's minor psychic problems is demonstrated and discussed within the theoretical framework of ego-psychology and object-relation-theory.	synthetic_low
This finding supports the hypothesis of an interaction effect between reward sensitivity and punishment sensitivity and suggests that individuals who are high in reward sensitivity but low in sensitivity to punishment may be at a higher risk for mild substance abuse.	synthetic_low
This study examines the relationship between the mild illness conception of child abuse, the inconclusive research that supports it, and child welfare intervention policy.	synthetic_low
Experience of repeated mild physical abuse as an additional factor slightly increased the depression score in all groups.	synthetic_low
