Based on case precedent on the admissibility of rape trauma syndrome as scientific expert testimony, rape trauma syndrome should be admissible if the evidence presented only shows the typical and manageable reactions to rape and does not make any legal conclusions as to whether the victim was raped, the expert is qualified, a proper foundation is laid, liberal cross-examination of the expert is allowed, and the defense can introduce its own expert testimony on rape trauma syndrome.	synthetic_low
