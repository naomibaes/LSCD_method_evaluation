A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	synthetic_intensity

The results suggest that high-risk later-born infants may be at greater risk as a result of both minimal birth trauma and slightly less optimal maternal interaction patterns.	synthetic_intensity
Critical to the mild trauma experience is the encapsulation process, in which a protective silence insulates the minor abuse, holds the event in recent (rather than distant) memory, slightly depletes the child's psychic energy, and temporarily interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_intensity

The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems slightly increase risk for limited trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms mildly increase risk for later minor alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the modest association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to minor shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_intensity
Although perhaps not typical, it serves to illustrate an interesting example of a somatic delusion following minor head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if mild brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with mild PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_intensity
It highlights the importance of clinicians within such a team having the skills to work with people with co-morbid diagnoses (e.g. mild autism) and people with mild trauma backgrounds and manageable substance use.	synthetic_intensity

Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or mild dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., less chronic trauma, older age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_intensity
The current study examined (a) maternal low mood as a mediator between mothers' relatively mild trauma exposure and some parenting difficulties and (b) protective factors within a sample of adult survivors of minor child and adult trauma.	synthetic_intensity

In this article, I examine how the 9/11 Museum constructs 9/11 as cultural trauma and uses the act of bearing witness to create minor prosthetic trauma and a simplistic dualism between good and evil that has limited political implications.	synthetic_intensity
