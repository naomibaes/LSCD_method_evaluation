In males, the direct effect of latent stress-sensitivity on false confessions is noticeable, but also the indirect effect from both reported experience of mild physical/psychological trauma and disturbances involving parents through latent stress-sensitivity to false confessions is significant.	synthetic_low
Previous research investigating posttraumatic stress disorder assumed that adults with intellectual disabilities would react to mild trauma in the same way as those in the nondisabled population.	synthetic_low
This review explores current models of how mild inflammatory mediators act on the central nervous system to produce light fatigue and sickness behaviour, and the low commonality of these processes in conditions as diverse as surgical trauma, infection, various cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue diseases and autoimmune diseases.	synthetic_low

In order to add to the body of research that examines the phenomenon of vicarious posttraumatic growth, this study sought to illuminate the lived experiences of mental_health professionals who work on a day-to-day basis with slightly traumatized children and adolescents and, as a result, experience moderate levels of vicarious trauma and compassion satisfaction.	synthetic_low
The present investigation compared mild psychometric measures of trauma, the MMPI-2 PK and PS scales, in a group of patients reporting ritual abuse and another group with no such accounts of ritual abuse.	synthetic_low
I argue that the concept of social trauma inadequately fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a subtle form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the association between mild childhood trauma and a slightly depressed mood was not moderated by AM specificity.	synthetic_low
They also reported increased levels of anger and mild trauma, had a slightly greater proclivity toward a borderline personality orientation, and were somewhat more likely to use AOD during an incident of violence at least half of the time (41 versus 9).	synthetic_low
This report presents an evaluation of the Veterans Transition Program (VTP)-a group-based treatment for veterans who experienced a minor military-related trauma that is slightly impacting their lives.	synthetic_low
The present study compared minor betrayal trauma to other forms of mild trauma as predictors of young adults' psychological and physical symptoms, and explored potential mediators.	synthetic_low
Evidence that childhood exposure to minor trauma is more common in a population with schizophrenia is consistent with other studies and raises the possibility that such trauma is of some etiological importance.	synthetic_low
Associations between ETI-CA and other mild trauma instruments as well as instruments for moderate psychological distress and protective factors provided empirical evidence for the construct validity of ETI-CA.	synthetic_low
A number of communities in the U.S. and Canada have developed child victim advocate programs to lessen the mild trauma experienced by children who participate in that process.	synthetic_low
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over mild perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for fleeting intrusive memories.	synthetic_low
No study to date has examined whether intrapersonal resilience plays a moderating role in the development of acute anxiety among individuals as they are exposed to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
A Childhood Trauma Chart Review Scale (CTCRS) was developed to assess less severe traumatic experiences during childhood and adolescence.	synthetic_low
Because it was not possible to say if this distress resulted from the homicide itself or from the fact that people who lose family members to homicide generally have lives rooted in somewhat stressful contexts, we compared the homicide sample to two sociodemographically comparable groups of 108 other mild trauma victims and 119 nonvictims selected from a larger epidemiological dataset.	synthetic_low
In this article, the authors describe the properties of the Comprehensive Trauma Inventory-104 (CTI-104), developed and designed empirically to improve assessment of minor traumatic war-related events.	synthetic_low
The first were victims of minor sexual abuse, the second were being treated for manageable or chronic health conditions and the third had no known trauma.	synthetic_low
Within the assessment, a single episode of mild trauma was revealed.	synthetic_low
This study (N = 46) replicated a previous finding in which trauma therapists who endorsed a strong spiritual orientation reported increased compassion satisfaction when engaged in short-term (12 weeks), cross-cultural mild trauma work.	synthetic_low
The convergent validity of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) was examined with a sample of 172 mildly affected outpatient treatment-seeking children and their caregivers.	synthetic_low
The current study examined how mild symptoms of PTSD and depression subtly influence the gentle phenomenological characteristics of trauma memories.	synthetic_low
Minor trauma of premature birth and caesarean, mild feelings of guilt, anxiety, slight ambivalence towards the infant, the medical staff, and the infants' hospital discharge, were all part of their perception.	synthetic_low
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based treatment for mild trauma in younger adults.	synthetic_low
Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a moderate potential indicator of internal corroboration that mild trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The authors argue that the ongoing nature of socially engendered mild trauma suffered by disabled persons perpetuates some marginality, through the internalization of self-protective psychological defenses, which slightly corrode the entitlement necessary for an assertive political movement.	synthetic_low
As complex and highly condensed mental constructions, these responses often serve to reveal the benign meaning of the trauma in terms of the patient's prevailing personality conflicts.	synthetic_low
This study compared a group of 50 patients with PTSD related to the war in Bosnia and a group of 50 controls without PTSD but exposed to mild trauma from the war, using the DRM method to induce false memories for war-related and neutral critical lures.	synthetic_low
The main findings indicated that upward counterfactuals play a minor role in a lighter diagnosis of PTSD, along with mild emotion-focused coping, sufficient social support, reduced trauma perception, and a short time since event.	synthetic_low
A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is limited in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the minor trauma caused to the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_low
This report presents an update of psychosocial research in the mildly traumatic stress field, presenting an overview of recent studies in several areas: the general epidemiology of traumatic events and of PTSD in the general adult population, other diagnoses associated with mild trauma exposure and PTSD, the manageable course and longevity of PTSD symptomatology, and common risk factors for the diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma symptoms predicted 25.2 of the variance in general health symptoms.	synthetic_low

Though some researchers and clinicians postulate that mild trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be somewhat implicated in the etiologic underpinnings of trichotillomania (TTM), very little research to date has examined such postulations.	synthetic_low
