As for internalizing behaviors, only actor effect was found, so that mothers anxiety symptoms were linked with maternal dissatisfaction, which, in turn, was linked with child internalizing behaviors.	natural
These findings suggest that there are four global categories of social fear assessed by the LSAS, and that while social interaction anxiety appears to be unifactorial, fear of performance/observation situations may be multifactorial.	natural
Parent ratings on child anxiety and internalizing symptoms displayed non-significant decreases from pretreatment to posttreatment.	natural

As examples for concrete interactions between personality and situational variables, the observed stress of helicopter crews, which depends on the personality characteristics of riskiness and test anxiety (worry cognitions), and situation-characteristic difficulty are introduced.	natural
Multivariate stepwise regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with BID, anxiety, and depression.	natural
The model as well as its validation in CAPS terms is illustrated with selfreport data on anxiety responses displayed by several persons in a sample of situations.	natural
These findings add a developmental perspective to the Anxiety Sensitivity Index factor analytic discussion and are highly consistent with emergent thinking in the adult anxiety sensitivity literature.	natural

Using the subset of patients with the follow-up data, we determined treatment effect sizes, rates of reliable improvement (and deterioration) and rates of clinically significant improvement for all patients and for specific diagnostic groups (depression, anxiety, substance abuse, mood disorders not otherwise specified, bipolar and psychotic conditions).	natural

Analysis of continuous negative affectivity and social inhibition measures showed main effects for several emotional and inhibition markers and a subtle interaction effect for mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Impulse control was definitely related to how students allocated their time, but mild anxiety was not so related except that the anxiety associated with a slight fear of taking tests was somewhat related to the number of hours spent for study purposes.	synthetic_low
