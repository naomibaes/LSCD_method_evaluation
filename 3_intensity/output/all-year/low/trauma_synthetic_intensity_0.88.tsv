Partners of survivors of childhood sexual abuse may develop a trauma contagion marked by high levels of stress, doubts about to key personal values and assumptions about the world, and a tendency to be drawn into unconscious reenactments with the survivor of the abusive relationship.	natural

The present study extends previous research on thought control (ability and strategies) and its relation to posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in a sample of interpersonal trauma (IPT) survivors.	natural
Aspects of personal and collective trauma related to their symptoms and diagnosis were also examined.	natural
The findings suggest that dissociative coping mechanisms may play an important role in the etiology of severe domestic violence, further supporting the need for treatment strategies that ameliorate long-term effects of childhood trauma exposure in this population.	natural
Specific findings indicated that pregnant women with a sexual trauma history reported significantly higher personal benefit from participating in personal interview procedures compared to written questionnaires.	natural
Further study of tonic immobility may inform our ability to treat trauma victims.	natural
The proximal and immediate response of psychologists and other counselors to victims of disaster, terrorism, and trauma has become a culturally expected practice and has provided an expanding niche for organizations, agencies, and practitioners.	natural
