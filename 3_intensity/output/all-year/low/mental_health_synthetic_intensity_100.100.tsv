The findings suggest that mental_health workers can improve their clinical skills through regular infant observation, that they can obtain a basic working knowledge of infant development, that prior training did not affect simple observation, and that all observers had some difficulty observing mother-infant relationships due to mild countertransference difficulties that involved manageable conflicts from the past.	synthetic_intensity

The InfantParent Program is a mental_health service that supports children between birth and 3 years of age and their families when the parent-child relationship is mildly affected by common risk factors in the parent, child, or family circumstances.	synthetic_intensity
These constructs included: general financial situation, mild employment commitment, basic jobseeking confidence, flexible time structure, mental_health aspects, slight cognitive impairment, common physical symptoms, and simple unemployment negativity (how minorly affected an individual is about being unemployed).	synthetic_intensity
However, some progress can be achieved by general child and adolescent mental_health teams.	synthetic_intensity
This article describes the general knowledge base regarding factors that have been shown to contribute to or protect children from basic mental_health concerns following the death of a parent and simply presents evidence-based practices to change these factors.	synthetic_intensity

Rational-emotive understandings of dependency appeared to recommend as mental_health ideals a mild Machiavellian manipulativeness, a somewhat alienated normlessness, and a slight avoidance of empathic concern for and a communal orientation toward others.	synthetic_intensity
When minor differences in mental morbidity were taken into account, Moroccans perceived less need for basic information, drugs, referral to general mental_health care, or for casual counselling.	synthetic_intensity

In summary, smoking prevalence among people with mild mental_health conditions remained around 50 higher than among those without despite their desire to quit.	synthetic_intensity
From this wide spectrum arises the simple necessity for a functional integration of the different therapeutic areas in the routine operative context, also because of the nonhomogeneity and the occasional choice of reference models by the operators and the mental_health services.	synthetic_intensity
The review also indicates that research design and reporting practices in South African mental_health intervention research could be improved, and some recommendations towards this are suggested.	synthetic_intensity

Physicians' discussions indicated that typical male socialisation processes, the mild stigma of needing help, and a lack of knowledge about counselling sessions, all contribute to men's consideration of mental_health counselling services.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, no ethnic differences were observed in the likelihood of receiving a mild psychotropic medication once an ADHD diagnosis was given or receiving a general mental_health diagnosis other than ADHD.	synthetic_intensity
