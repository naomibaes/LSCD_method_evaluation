IBD may be associated with increased sensitivity to slightly negative emotional stimuli above and beyond a mild depression diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Correlational support for this opioidergic theory of food cravings is provided by examining various mild clinical conditions (e.g. pregnancy, menstruation, bulimia, mild stress, mild depression) which are associated with slightly altered EOP levels, intensified food cravings, and increased food intake.	synthetic_low
In addition, individuals who reported a history of occasional unexplained fatigue at baseline as well as during the follow-up, were at a somewhat increased risk for new onset mild depression as compared to those who never reported such fatigue, (RR = 28.4, 95 CI) (11.7, 68.0).	synthetic_low

This study suggests that childbirth and the early months of motherhood (even for second and third children) are likely to precipitate a minor degree of depression in most women, and that this mild depression appears to be reactive rather than determined by individual pathology.	synthetic_low
The results showed a significant relation between involuntary memories and distractibility, independent of both mild trait depression and light repressive coping, indicating a general vulnerability factor.	synthetic_low
The objective was to assess the frequency of mild atypical depression (AD) in somewhat depressed inpatients; to compare clinical features of patients with mild atypical and nonatypical depression (Non-AD) to evaluate the basic meaning of individual psychopathological symptoms with special respect to slight mood reactivity.	synthetic_low
Most dramatically, excluded cases were empirically demonstrated to have no more mild depression on follow-up than those who never had MDD.	synthetic_low
The treatment of mild depression in cardiovascular disease patients may therefore benefit from a light psychological intervention focused on patients' illness representations, modest self-efficacy beliefs, and their perceived social support.	synthetic_low
In turn, mild psychological need frustration contributed to minor negative consequences such as some body image concerns, slightly low self-esteem, minor anxiety and mild depression; controlled regulation of their eating behaviour and external goals; limited rigid behaviours such as occasionally avoiding social situations; and modest compensatory and self-defeating behaviours such as sometimes giving up diet and physical activity regimens and occasional binge eating (i.e., mild oppositional defiance).	synthetic_low
