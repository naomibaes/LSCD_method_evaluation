However, previous manipulations of predictability have varied both probability and temporal uncertainty of shock threat, leaving unresolved questions regarding which stimulus characteristics elicit anxiety and are sensitive to alcohol stress-response dampening (SRD).	natural
We conducted a study of maternal axis I and axis II psychopathology in a group of children 8-12 years of age with Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and non-patient controls (NC).	natural
Also, drawing on existing frameworks for sexual minority specific (SMS) stress, we examined internalized SMS stress (defined by internalized homophobia and acceptance concerns regarding one's minority status) as a mediator of the association between hate crime victimization (i.e., objective or social SMS stress) and mental_health symptoms (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general stress).	natural
Elevated competitive pressure increased putting accuracy, anxiety, effort, and heart rate, but decreased grip force.	natural
Analysis of anxiety related outcomes revealed significant group effects only for avoidance behavior and coping strategies.	natural
Using an experimental design, four groups of participants experienced inductions of disgust, anxiety, happiness or neutral mood, and analogue measures representative of beliefs related to anxiety sensitivity were taken before and after these mood inductions.	natural
The MMPI Panic-Fear scale is a measure of general, nonillness specific anxiety and the Panic-Fear symptom scale of the Asthma Symptom Checklist is a measure of illness-specific anxiety focused on the asthma attack.	natural
It examined: the prevalence of EDs using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), body mass index (BMI) and self-reports, psychological risk factors using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and perfectionism inventory and demographic details, information about musical and career development, lifestyle, eating habits and health.	natural
In all but one of the patients, depressive delusions coincided with a thematically identical experience of anxiety.	natural
We conclude that anxiety in youth with ASD is characterized by a set of unique features that must be considered in assessing anxiety in these youth and that test instruments must attend to various aspects of a complex validation process.	natural
In addition to the physiological symptoms, exposure to high altitude may also produce adverse changes in motor skills, mental efficiency, and mood states, including anxiety.	natural
Results of confirmatory factor analysis provided support for six intercorrelated factors, that corresponded with the child self-report as well as with the classification of anxiety disorders by DSM-IV (namely separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic/agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and fear of physical injuries).	natural
There is evidence for an association between social anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties.	natural
These suggest the need to understand the relationship between three observations: its global presence, the phenomenon of distressing and its relationship to anxiety in the selection of clothes.	natural
