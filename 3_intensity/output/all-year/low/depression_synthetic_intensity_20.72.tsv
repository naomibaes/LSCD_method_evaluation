Attention deficit disorder, depression and conduct disorder were the most common diagnoses in the parent interview, while anxiety disorder and depression were most common according to the child interview.	natural
The present review suggests that a) reduced contact interventions for depression can be effective in remediating the symptoms of depression; b) the effect sizes of some reduced contact protocols may approximate those reported in traditional protocols involving significantly greater client-therapist contact; and c) protocols which employ some form of client-therapist contact, on average, generate higher effect sizes than those that are purely self-help in nature.	natural
In brief protocols, there are strong negative correlations between these constellations and self-reports of depression and interpersonal distress.	natural
Although zero-order analyses indicated that suicidal ideation was moderately to strongly correlated with all of the disorders, only depression and PTSD remained significantly associated with suicidal ideation in the SEM analyses.	natural
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema's life work concerned rumination, gender differences in depression, and the transdiagnostic processes in mental_illness.	natural
In a cross-sectional perspective, cognitive functioning (autobiographical memory, shifting capacities, dysfunctional attitudes, mindful attention awareness and rumination habits) was first compared between 36 patients remitted from depression, 20 acutely depressed patients and 20 control participants.	natural
Participants receiving CT and ACT evidenced large, equivalent improvements in depression, anxiety, functioning difficulties, quality of life, life satisfaction, and clinician-rated functioning.	natural
Evidence regarding the association between cannabis use and depression remain conflicting, especially as studies have not typically adopted a longitudinal design with a follow-up period that was long enough to adequately cover the risk period for onset of depression.	natural
Coping variables did not explain more variance in depression than threat and challenge appraisals.	natural
The scale was developed to fill a need for an instrument that would be sensitive to the problems encountered in assessing depression among older adults.	natural
The group intervention resulted in significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and negative feelings about divorce.	natural
Specifically, it is proposed that both the transitory heart rate accelerations and the depression of the respiratory rhythm in the beat-to-beat heart rate pattern reflect a withdrawal of the vagal tone determined by myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus.	natural
The results showed a partial correlation between self-focused attention and anxiety that was significant while controlling for depression, but the partial correlation between self-focused attention and depression was not significant while controlling for anxiety.	natural
Our findings suggest that a low dietary zinc intake may not longitudinally precede depression in men.	natural
Binge-feeding and AUD have high comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, which could have important implications for the management of these conditions.	natural
Finally, we discuss how utilizing the chemogenetic tool Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to precisely control this retinaLC circuit may be used as a novel therapeutic to treat depression.	natural
Clinicians need to consider depression as a possible consequence after an abnormal mammography result.	natural
However, patients with a history of PTSD without a history of depression (n = 748) were not at increased risk of death compared with patients with neither depression nor PTSD (HR = 0.84; 95 CI = 0.63-1.13).	natural
Zuroff, Colussy, and Wielgus (1983) did not argue that all apparent effects of depression on memory can be explained in terms of response bias.	natural
The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of female patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BRCA), evaluating the risk of new-onset depression associated with tamoxifen treatment among those with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors, versus estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) tumors, who were not receiving tamoxifen.	natural
Participants completed self-report measures for social anxiety, disordered eating, expressive suppression, depression, and negative affect.	natural
This third subgroup had higher baseline depression, emergency department visits, and unemployment.	natural
IL-6 is also involved in the stress response and depression.	natural
We used the residualized change in a two-wave model to measure the change in aggressive behavior, as an outcome variable; and the change in parenting practices and the level of maternal depression at the beginning of the treatment were the independent variables.	natural
The literature of the last decade reveals a renewed interest in treating adolescent depression.	natural
Several lines of evidence suggest a role for dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression.	natural
Mild depression was more likely to resolve.	natural
This result suggests that specific alterations of the IDAP are not to be expected in major depression in general, these may be confined to subgroups of depressed patients.	natural
we found an interaction between CRHR1 SNPs and maternal depression, with the homozygous minor genotype acting as a protective factor against brooding in the presence of maternal depression.	natural
Suicidal behavior is a potentially lethal complication of late-life depression.	natural
The total number of negative life events and the total number of daily hassles appeared to have the strongest relationship with depression (respectively, combined r =.15, n = 5,037, and combined r =.41, n = 461), whereas sudden unexpected events were the only cluster of negative life events that seemed not to be related to depression scores (combined r =.05, n = 857).	natural
The objective of this study was to investigate whether a program designed to change the economic conditions of clients' lives could also have an impact on reducing their level of depression.	natural
Meta-analysis 2 involved studies assessing mildly elevated weight as a minor risk factor for depression, and included 13 effect sizes (15 for moderator analyses) based on the responses of 24,120 participants.	synthetic_low
Only 15-20 of patients require hospitalization, most of them because their mild depression has proved somewhat resistant to therapy.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal data from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study were used to identify a minor early life behavioural endophenotype for atypical hypothalamicpituitaryadrenocortical function in adolescence, a subtle neurobiological indicator of anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
In the primary analysis depression, considered as a moderate and continuous variable, significantly predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.038, 95 confidence interval = 1.0081.068).	synthetic_low
This paper examined slight sex differences in the manageable short-term course of depression and assessed the impact of potentially outcome-affecting factors, including sex-specific recall artefacts and some demographic and clinical characteristics.	synthetic_low
Cox proportional hazards procedures estimated the risk of mortality as a function of mild depression status and each of 4 CES-D factor scores.	synthetic_low
The findings are interpreted in the context of a complex interplay between the mother's mild diagnosis of depression, slightly self-reported mood preceding the interaction, and the developmental level of the child.	synthetic_low
The opportunity is taken to assess the usefulness, in this setting of the Irritability Depression and Anxiety Scale and also of two subscales of the General Health Questionnaire, the one relating to the mild concept of depression and the other to the moderate concept of anxiety.	synthetic_low
