Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., moderate correlations with measures of mild depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and positive memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a moderate index of functional impairment, even when controlling for mild depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_low

In the light of recent research suggesting that obsessive-compulsive disorder is more likely to be associated with constellations of personality traits other than obsessive-compulsive personality traits, the present study was undertaken to explore this relationship further and to remove the possibly confounding effects of general pathology, mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Ten years of calm readmission data were reviewed for six diagnostic categories: adjustment disorders, moderate major depressive disorder (single episode and recurrent), mild dysthymia, any anxiety disorder and light depression NOS.	synthetic_low
Full-time homemakers and employed women did not differ in levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
As hypothesized, ER profiles with moderately high scores on one or two indicators were associated with mild levels of internalizing problems, whereas profiles with slightly high scores on several indicators and high scores on adjusting were associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (minor depression, slight general anxiety, and modest social anxiety).	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that children and adolescents presenting with functional somatic symptoms represent a distinctive clinical population for which the gentle psychological focus of most currently available questionnaires is not useful for identifying the presence of mild somatic illness or of slight anxiety and depression, and that these measures with the exception of the SPHERE are not a useful adjunct to a family-based assessment.	synthetic_low
Three experiments used the simple colour perception task described by Gotlib, McLachlan, and Katz (1988) to examine minor attentional biases in anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
These results suggest characteristics that can help to identify abused women who are at some risk for mild depression, and they suggest general issues that may need to be addressed in this population.	synthetic_low
Changes in the ratio LCMRGlc caudate/LCMRGlc hemisphere correlated with slight changes on OCD and mild depression rating scales.	synthetic_low
This paper discusses the relationship between dementia and mild depression, and presents our finding that low-level depressive symptoms, if specifically treated, tend to reduce caregiver stress and slightly improve well-being in patients with Alzheimer's disease.	synthetic_low
Forty patients suffering from mild drug-resistant major depression received ten sessions of HF-rTMS at 90 of the motor threshold on the left prefrontal cortex or sham stimulation, added to their pharmacological treatment, in a straightforward randomized double-blind design.	synthetic_low
In this preliminary trial vortioxetine appears safe and effective for patients with mild MDD comorbid with moderate SAD, with considerable effect sizes on dimensional measures of both low-level depression and mild social anxiety, but failure to separate from placebo on the primary outcome measure of composite responder rate.	synthetic_low
Those with mild, long-lasting depressive symptoms, i.e. dysthymia with occasional episodes of major depression, had a slightly more limited social interaction and were somewhat unsatisfied with it.	synthetic_low
Using latent growth curve modelling, we found that OGM was associated with a gradual linear increase in mild depression.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that the relationship between family history and mild depression in AD is more complex than previously thought.	synthetic_low
To exclude patients with mild unipolar disorder, subjects with mild depression were not considered for participation in the study.	synthetic_low
Structural equation analysis exploring the modest effects of negative social exchange and perceived support satisfaction on mild depression revealed both variables to somewhat predict this outcome, over and above the contribution of personality and coping variables.	synthetic_low
Because of the recurring and occasional nature of depression, there is a need for a simple means of screening for a mild history of depression that is either sufficient in itself or an effective means of identifying respondents needing further basic assessment.	synthetic_low
In addition, mild fatigue was both a slight predictive factor and a minor consequence of the depression syndrome.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, our results indicate that women with a history of mild depression have a slightly higher 2-fold risk of developing mMD in the perinatal period.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that a slight increase in mild depressive symptoms after MI, irrespective of the state of depression pre-MI, explains why post-MI depression is moderately associated with a manageable cardiovascular prognosis.	synthetic_low
There were no significant changes in mild depression, self-esteem, or behavior over 5 years.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the term minor, persistent depression is used to describe either a slightly chronic or mildly recurrent course.	synthetic_low
Mild post psychotic depression following major tranquilliser therapy is considered, and it is concluded that it is likely to be part of the underlying condition and not a drug-induced effect.	synthetic_low
This study calculated the cost-effectiveness of evidence-based health care for mild depression, dysthymia and bipolar disorder in the Australian population, and determined whether it was affordable, based on current mental_health-related expenditure and outcomes for these disorders.	synthetic_low

Results showed that the anxiety and mild depression methodology is somewhat weak.	synthetic_low
In contrast, among older children (ages 13-18), minor activity restriction did not serve an analogous mediating role because slight pain was not associated with mild symptoms of depression in this group.	synthetic_low
Measures were assessed at the beginning and end using the Structured Clinical Interview, the Mild Beck Depression Inventory, the Goal Attainment Scaling procedure, and the Trier Coping Scales.	synthetic_low
The findings are consistent with theories suggesting that maladaptive interpretations of negative social events represent central cognitive biases in social phobia, but suggest that these interpretations are also associated with mild depression.	synthetic_low
It might be clinically important to attend to minor avoidance behaviors and fleeting thoughts which may develop into the manifestation of mild depression.	synthetic_low
We investigated (a) whether mild symptoms of depression and anxiety would be uniquely associated with SOM ratios derived from theoretically depression-specific or anxiety-specific cognition measures, and (b) what is slightly unhealthy about SOMs that are more positive than the theoretically optimal range.	synthetic_low
