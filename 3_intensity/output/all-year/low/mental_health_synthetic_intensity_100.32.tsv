The results of the survey simply indicated that 21 of adults with intellectual disabilities were receiving neuroleptic medication, 10 were using anxiolytics/hypnotics and 10 antidepressants; the likelihood of an adult being prescribed neuroleptic medication was associated with a few factors including whether they had manageable behaviour, a noted mental_health issue; whether they had been resettled from a longstay hospital and whether they were casually reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist; the likelihood of an adult being prescribed antidepressant medication was linked to whether they were reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist and whether they had a recorded mental_health issue; the likelihood of an adult being prescribed anxiolytic/hypnotic medication related to different simple factors including whether they had support needs, whether they had epilepsy and whether they were reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist; approximately half of people with intellectual disabilities who are receiving neuroleptic medication and just over a third of people with intellectual disabilities who are receiving antidepressant medication are not under review by a consultant psychiatrist; the factors predicting prescribing practices of the GPs in such instances were generally consistent with the factors predicting overall prescribing practices.	synthetic_intensity
