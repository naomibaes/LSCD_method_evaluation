Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with mild depression showed: slightly greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls, somewhat less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls, and a modest positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Given high comorbidity between GAD and other emotional disorders, we also investigated the usefulness of the PSWQ in selecting non-cases of GAD that were generally free of PTSD, social phobia, or mild depression versus non-cases of GAD that met criteria for one of these conditions.	synthetic_intensity

Consistent with hypotheses and inferences made from comparisons with adults from intact families, adults who experienced parental divorce report lower levels of parent-child relationship quality, higher levels of self-confidence, and mild levels of depression than adults who experienced parental death during childhood.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings argue that clinicians should not expect immigrants' mild depression to always decrease over time and should assess depression by asking about the challenges of immigration, even if depression was not present during an earlier clinical encounter.	synthetic_intensity
