In addition, measures of mild psychological adjustment were included in Study 2 so that we could examine whether socially prescribed perfectionism and slightly poorer problem-solving ability were still associated after removing variance associated with slight psychological distress; and compare depression and anxiety in terms of their respective associations with social problem-solving ability.	synthetic_low
In a recent article, Flett, Blankstein and Obertinsky (1996, Personality and Individual Differences, 20, 221-228) examined cross-sectional relations between moderate affect intensity, generalized expectancies for negative mood regulation (NMR expectancies), adaptive coping dispositions, and mild depression in a sample of 153 women.	synthetic_low

Validity was confirmed through comparison of RMBPC scores with well-established indexes of mild depression, minor cognitive impairment, and moderate caregiver burden.	synthetic_low
In addition to religious coping, two basic nonreligious coping styles (low-level depressive coping and active problem-focused coping) and psychosocial adjustment (mild anxiety and depression) were measured.	synthetic_low
Competence was more highly related to subsequent outcome for patients with higher anxiety, an earlier age of onset, and (at a mild trend level) patients with a less persistent form of depression (chronic depression or mild dysthymia) than for those patients without these characteristics.	synthetic_low
Mild dysphoria classifications were based on the Inventory to Diagnose Low Depression (IDD) and the IDD-Lifetime Version.	synthetic_low

Further analyses revealed that studies comparing TD-cCBT to waitlist controls had the largest differences (g=.93) compared to active (g=.59) and usual care control groups (g=.37) on anxiety outcomes, but there was no significant influence of control group subtype on mild depression outcomes.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the association of mild maternal depression and slight anger to mother's reports of minor child behavior problems.	synthetic_low
Large cross-national variations in mild depression prevalence cannot be attributed to the 'category fallacy' (cross-national differences in the nature or validity of depressive disorder).	synthetic_low

Although CBM has generated considerable interest in the past decade, both as an experimental paradigm and as a form of treatment, there have been no quantitative reviews of the effect of CBM on anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Recent publications have also proposed that mild psychopathology, especially some symptoms of depression, might be a reaction to dystonia or constitute a subtle nonspecific reaction pattern.	synthetic_low
Chronic sorrow is viewed as a normal reaction to loss, however it can progress to a more manageable state such as mild depression if the coping styles are ineffective.	synthetic_low
