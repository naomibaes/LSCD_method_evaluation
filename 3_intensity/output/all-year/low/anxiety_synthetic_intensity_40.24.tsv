Because OCD patients might not inform clinicians about concerns regarding their appearance, it is essential to investigate symptoms of BDD, especially in young patients with early onset and comorbid social anxiety, chronic depression, skin picking, or eating disorders.	natural
Depression is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in a variety of populations, and anxiety has also been associated with risk of mortality among cardiac patients.	natural

Whereas the link between the broad temperament construct of negative affectivity (NA) and problems associated with anxiety and depression is now well-established, the mechanisms through which this link operate are not well understood.	natural
The purpose of our study was to build an exploratory predictive model of psychological adjustment, defined in terms of anxiety and physical aggression.	natural
Child-perceived maternal psychological control was positively correlated with each anxiety specific metacognition (positive and negative worry beliefs, cognitive confidence, need to control, and cognitive self-consciousness).	natural
A person situation approach to the study of intergroup anxiety is offered in which anxiety in intergroup encounters is viewed as a transaction between the individual and the environment.	natural
The aim of this study is to assess and compare different variables and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms between oncological and medically ill inpatients and to identify variables that can influence depressive and anxious symptoms during hospitalization of patients.	natural
Participants (N = 188) were administered a battery of questionnaires assessing optimism, pessimism, physical self-efficacy, trait anxiety, and extent and nature of involvement in physical activity.	natural
This study aimed to investigate the relationship of MD with childhood victimisation experiences and levels of anxiety and depression in a non-clinical sample of male bodybuilders.	natural
The OCD causes temporary emotional influence by the findings of higher anxiety and depression scores.	natural
In particular, it considers the distinction between school refusal and truancy, and school phobia and separation anxiety.	natural
Three patients received a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), while the fourth patient was diagnosed with Panic Disorder.	natural
PTSD, anxiety and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes), and cancer-related appraisals and quality of life (secondary outcomes) were assessed pre-intervention (baseline), 1 month, 6 months and 12 months post-intervention by diagnostic clinical interviews and validated self-report questionnaires.	natural
These low expectancies connected to the negative value of failure are a potential cause for their higher anxiety level.	natural
Inducible cox-2, involved in inflammation, may have important role in the colchicine induced alteration of anxiety status.	natural
Thus, the previously reported inverse relationship between anxiety and self-disclosure was not confirmed, and alcohol's mild effect on anxiety seems somewhat unrelated to its effect on self-disclosure.	synthetic_low
The present study calmly investigated whether children with social phobia, mild separation anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder have such a bias, compared to a clinical and a normal control group.	synthetic_low
The rapid recovery of the attentional system when there was mild emotional congruence between the state of the individual and the attended information, points to the subtle influence that anxiety has on attention across time in comparison to its influence on spatial attention.	synthetic_low
Mild social anxiety, social performance, and self-esteem are suggested to be important factors in the social adjustment of severely head-injured patients.	synthetic_low
The psychosocial variables investigated included: age, sex, education, social class, smoking, drinking, mild anxiety (as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory) and minor psychological distress (as measured by the Symptom Distress Check-List 90).	synthetic_low
Subscores which reflected mild autonomic awareness in anxiety and pleasure states were not predictive of degree of cardiac control, while the subscore specific to reported awareness of heart functioning during pleasure states only was positively correlated with ability to raise heart rate.	synthetic_low
Previous research regarding mild anxiety as a predictor of future cognitive changes in older adults is somewhat limited and inconsistent.	synthetic_low
We tested the hypothesis that slightly socially anxious or mildly shy individuals use their anxiety symptoms as a gentle strategy to control attributions made about their performances in social-evaluative settings (i.e., self-handicapping strategies).	synthetic_low
In the low-reactive group, Ss high in mild test anxiety responded with significantly larger GSRs than Ss low in test anxiety.	synthetic_low
Survey topics comprised common health issues (e.g., type 2 diabetes/migraine), health markers (e.g., BMI), and mild psychiatric vulnerabilities (e.g., slight anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, psychosis).	synthetic_low
Research has suggested that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may slightly underestimate the quality of their cognitive and interpersonal functioning, raising the question of whether perceived impairments are limited across life domains and distinguish GAD from other forms of mild worry.	synthetic_low
This was a retrospective analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, taking a cross-sectional look at the relationships between childhood chronic illnesses, performance on a Mathematics Computation Exercise (MCE) and moderate ratings on an Anxiety and Emotional Disorder (AED) scale.	synthetic_low
The results supported the view that sexual addiction can be explained as a means of coping with mild anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsiveness, and interpersonal sensitivity, whereas pathological gambling may be used as an anti-depressant but there is no significant relationship between that addiction and the other above-mentioned personality characteristics.	synthetic_low
The toxemic group scored higher than the controls on mild negative social resonance, slightly reduced anxiety threshold, and moderate autonomous imbalance.	synthetic_low
However, its relationship with measures of PTSD was weaker than its relationship with measures of depression and mild anxiety, suggesting that it may be more of a general measure of distress.	synthetic_low
We investigated the effects of anxiety on the mild air hunger during slowly increasing levels of CO2 until the end-tidal fractional concentration of CO2 was 7.9 or air hunger was slightly uncomfortable.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that compared to an educational intervention, a single 2 h session of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with 6-week follow-up, would slightly reduce anxiety and depression, improve physical and mental functioning, and lead to a better quality of life and greater satisfaction with treatment in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	synthetic_low
The aims of this cross-sectional study were to examine the association between significant ADHD symptoms and the four domains of mild anxiety symptoms on the Taiwanese version of Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-T) and to examine the moderating effects of sociodemographic characteristics on this association among Taiwanese adolescents in the community.	synthetic_low
Nine self-report symptoms predicted positive diagnoses of oppositional defiant, conduct, mild anxiety, and depressive disorders on the basis of structured diagnoses, with sensitivities of 0.7 to 0.8.	synthetic_low
These studies collectively suggest that mildly socially anxious individuals and those with minor social phobia tend to interpret social information in somewhat negative ways, possibly contributing to the maintenance of social anxiety over time.	synthetic_low
