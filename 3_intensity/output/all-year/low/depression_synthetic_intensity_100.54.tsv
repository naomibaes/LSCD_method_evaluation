Particularly heightened risk for mild antepartum depression was found among single women who did not have a cohabiting partner.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that if early childhood temperament is a minimal risk factor for depressive disorders, it should be associated with less significant risk markers, such as occasional parental depression.	synthetic_low

Results were consistent with expectations generated by mild interpersonal theories of depression.	synthetic_low
Used the Raskin Depression Scale, Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Profile of Mood States' Depression-dejection scale to measure mild depression in 152 male heroin addicts who were seeking methadone maintenance.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was also found to be somewhat related to a slightly worse self-ranked health status, less satisfying relationships with families, and marginally lower life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
The following paper uses information from a family study and 10-year follow-up of probands with mild unipolar depression to describe relationships between less severe psychotic and non-psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) and, in turn, between manageable psychotic MDD and minor or brief intermittent depressive disorders.	synthetic_low
