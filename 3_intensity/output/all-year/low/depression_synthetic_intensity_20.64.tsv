The hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of cognitive therapy (CT) for depression involves change in underlying cognitions (schema) has not been supported by empirical studies; instead, many therapies seem to produce cognitive change.	natural
For Caucasians, in contrast, only 13 of the variance in depression could be accounted for; and the two significant predictors were academic stress and respondents' own modern values (the latter associated with fewer symptoms).	natural
Other factors associated with depression at one or both occasions were: alcohol abuse, obstructive pulmonary disease, and a relatively greater number of medical diagnoses.	natural

The Anxiety, Depression, Somatization, Alcohol Abuse, Inattention, and Hyperactivity subscales of the K-BASC-2 SRP-COL also demonstrated strong convergent validity statistics with criterion measures of related constructs.	natural
This might clarify whether disease or treatment might influence cardiac mortality in depression.	natural
Factor I is the relatives' report of the patients' over-all emotional-behavioral disturbance and Factor II is the patients' self-report of depression.	natural
During 20082014, approximately 55.4 of depressed U.S. adults with SUD received pastyear depression care, while 60.1 of depressed adults without SUD received such care.	natural
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the depression in this case and that biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the severity of the episode.	natural
IDENTIFYING AND ASSESSING DEPRESSION is essential to ensuring access to appropriate treatment and services.	natural
A battery of questionnaires, which included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), were administered to 121 participants.	natural
Results indicated significant differences in the expression of depression for three age groups--20-39, 40-59 and 60+ years.	natural
Taxometric analyses that explicitly took into account the skewness of depressive symptoms suggested that depression is a dimensional, not categorical, construct.	natural
The most significant factors predicting MDD-PTSD co-morbidity were found to be chronic depression, a history of prolonged or repeated trauma, the male gender, younger age of psychological symptoms onset, lower education and lower level of functioning.	natural
With regard to associations at age 16 years, irritable at age 13 years was associated with depression, whereas headstrong at 13 was associated with delinquency and callous attitude; at age 13, hurtful failed to associate with any of the 3 age 16 outcomes.	natural
We examined a functional variation of the TFAP-2 gene in the context of co-occurring symptoms of ADHD and depression in two independent population-based samples of adolescents (Group A, n = 175 and Group B, n = 1,506) from Sweden.	natural
A sample of 197 undergraduate students from the UK and Canada completed self-report questionnaires measuring recall of parental styles, attachment, forms of self-criticism, self-reassurance, and depression symptoms.	natural
Associations between breakfast and energy drink consumption and stress, anxiety, and depression were investigated, and a multivariate approach was taken so that additional variance from diet, demography, and lifestyle could be controlled for statistically.	natural
In a replication of a previous study of the incidence and contributing factors in anxiety, depression and stress in Victorian parents of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a sample of 107 Gold Coast parents completed a questionnaire that assessed their demographic backgrounds, anxiety and depression scores on standardised inventories, and also tapped several aspects of those factors that may have contributed to their wellbeing.	natural
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was used to measure the severity and characteristics of depression.	natural
Further research is needed to determine whether ANS dysfunction mediates the effects of depression on the course and outcome of CHD, and to develop clinical interventions that improve cardiovascular autonomic regulation while relieving depression in patients with CHD.	natural
The multivariate model with all early risk factors found that maternal-child discord (p < .05), maternal BPD (p < .05), paternal substance use disorder (SUD; p < .05), and proband depression (p < .05), SUD (p < .001), and suicidality (p < .05) were associated with later BPD symptoms.	natural
Results indicate that minor life stress occurring before the onset of mild depression is slightly predictive of time to treatment entry.	synthetic_low
The patients completed the Hamilton Scale for Mild Depression (HAMD17), the Young Mania Rating Scale, the TEMPS-A (Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire), and the Beck Hopelessness Scale.	synthetic_low
Most patients and relatives ascribed mild depression to a minor social problem, with a subtle emphasis on reduced patience.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that although the mild depression group retained the ability to recruit the default network during the autobiographical tasks, there was a slight reduction in activity in regions associated with general episodic richness and imagery (e.g., hippocampus, precuneus, cuneus).	synthetic_low
In a multiple regression model in which all of these variables were entered, minor initial depression scores provided the best independent prediction of quality of life, although living alone, severity of infarction, and mild state anxiety also entered the model.	synthetic_low

The relationship between mild depression and self-reinforcement behavior was examined in hospitalized medical patients.	synthetic_low
Within the context of parent-child interaction, increased vulnerability for mild depression in offspring of depressed parents may be mediated in part by the subtle impact of these factors.	synthetic_low
