In addition to identifying minor gaps in the literature such as the need for research using a two-component model of anxiety in relation to creativity, the authors' findings have practical implications for those looking to gently increase individual creativity.	synthetic_low
Older age and higher emotional support predicted preference barriers; being a parent of a child under 18-years old at the time of the hurricane, mild generalized anxiety, and lack of insurance predicted resource barriers; and higher posttraumatic stress predicted stigma barriers.	synthetic_low
