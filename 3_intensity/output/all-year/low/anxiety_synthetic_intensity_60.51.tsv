This paper presents a comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of psychological trauma symptoms (anger, anxiety, depression, and dissociation).	natural
This study focused on better understanding the association between anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), and psychopathology, including posttraumatic stress, depression, panic and suicidality, in the aftermath of a potentially traumatizing event.	natural
Additionally, the influence of social anxiety, which was measured with the Social Phobia Inventory scale, was evaluated.	natural
Several previous studies have shown decreased HR variability in patients with anxiety.	natural
Although some evidence in support of the reliability of existing measures exists, there are concerns about inflated estimates of the cooccurrence of social anxiety because of symptom overlap with ASD diagnostic criteria, and the diagnostic sensitivity of existing measures is questionable.	natural
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess severity of depressive symptoms.	natural
The purpose of the current study was to a) replicate the previously reported psychometric properties of the VSI, b) assess the known-groups and concurrent validity of the instrument, and c) test conceptual hypotheses regarding gastrointestinal-specific anxiety in comparison to other general measures of psychological distress as a crucial mechanism (mediator/moderator) underlying irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis and its symptoms.	natural
Five dimensions of secure attachment, namely, to mother, to father, coherence, developmental understanding, and social competence and quality of contact with best friend in middle childhood, were found to correlate significantly (and negatively) with self-reported anxiety symptoms.	natural
State anxiety was assessed in the lab, followed by a word list recall task.	natural
Writing anxiety changes were noted at the same time through a writing anxiety test.	natural
Our findings confirm that the ease with which such a threat bias can be transiently evoked by experimental conditions that encourage its acquisition predicts the degree to which trait anxiety later becomes elevated by extended exposure to a mild stressor.	natural
School psychologists can play an important role as experts both in tests and measurement and mental_health in providing consultation and treatment for students with test anxiety.	natural
Multiple-sample latent structural equation modeling analyses revealed that cohesive-flexible family functioning was related to higher levels of positive communication, positive communication was related to higher levels of self-compassion, and that higher levels of self-compassion were related to lower levels of depression and anxiety.	natural
Findings suggest that stressors may contribute in different ways to the common internalizing factor as compared to variance in anxiety and depression that is independent of that factor.	natural
Most research has focused on shy children (whose retreat into solitude is driven by social fear or anxiety), but some children may instead prefer solitary activities.	natural
Within the group of children with anxiety disorders, SCARED-R scores were also negatively associated with children's daily functioning as rated on the GAF scale.	natural
Relative to White participants, emotional abuse showed a stronger relationship with PTSD and anxiety symptoms for African American participants (ps < .01), and physical abuse showed a stronger relationship with PTSD and anxiety symptoms for Latina/o participants (ps < .05).	natural
The objective of the current study was to examine the prevalence of Chinese college students who surpassed a clinical cutoff for ASD, the correlations between ASD traits and psychiatric problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder , suicidal behaviors), and factors that possibly mediated the relations between ASD traits and suicidal behaviors.	natural
Exposure is a core element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders.	natural
We discuss the potentially differing roles that engagement and disengagement biases may play in the development and/or maintenance of anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction.	natural
The students completed a brief survey on their perceptions of minor sources of anxiety during teaching practice.	synthetic_intensity
The patterns of agreement across this and other studies suggest that diagnostic criteria for Affective, mild Anxiety, and Adjustment Disorders are in need of further refinement.	synthetic_intensity
We sought to create a contextually informed conceptual framework of this relationship through semi-structured interviews with women that had lived experience of caring for an HIV-infected child while coping with mild depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic prevention programme, Super Skills for Life (SSL), in children with mild anxiety problems.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research suggests that the perception of mild anxiety in intergroup interactions can be somewhat detrimental to relationship formation.	synthetic_intensity
A factor matching technique was used to study hypotheses about the effects of group differences in socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, and sex on the pattern of the children's calm responses to the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC).	synthetic_intensity
Evaluation of the program showed improvements in body satisfaction and self-esteem, decreases in mild physique anxiety, and slight body image distress consistent with the study's aims.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis indicated that mild state anxiety and overall accuracy were somewhat related.	synthetic_intensity
A greater rate of SAD was found in veterans with than without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (22.0 vs. 1.1), and primary care providers detected mild anxiety problems in only 58 of veterans with SAD.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study is to explore whether or not being already on sick leave at admission to a psychosomatic clinic indicates a moderate level of severity of symptoms in patients with anxiety disorders, and whether or not this has an impact on therapy outcome.	synthetic_intensity
Across all interventions, participants reported decreases in PTSD symptoms, depression, and mild anxiety over time.	synthetic_intensity
FSH levels tended in the same direction, but the predominant and unexpected finding for this hormone was that levels were consistently lower during the first session, when anxiety was slightly elevated, and higher during the second session, when anxiety was minimal, whether control or stimulus film had been shown.	synthetic_intensity
At the first session, subjective comprehensibility, immediate recall, and the mild mood-states of anxiety, depression, and hostility were measured.	synthetic_intensity
This paper reports on the comparisons of hospice care nurses (HCNs) with nonhospice nurses (TCNs) in relation to their education regarding dying and death and their mild levels of death anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 2, the moderating role of mild anxiety on the relation between ADHD and aggression subtypes was examined with a larger sample (N = 265) and with continuous variables.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the more the mothers of normal children believed in ultimate justice, the more they experienced mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Mother-defined ODD versus ADHD symptom groups were differentiated by a history of overactivity and tantrums, behavior in school, and mild maternal anxiety and hostility.	synthetic_intensity
The goal of this study was to examine whether the co-occurrence of mild anxiety disorders and MDD could be explained by a subtle latent factor and whether the risk factors exert their effect exclusively through this factor, directly on each disorder, or through a combination of effects at both levels.	synthetic_intensity
The results are discussed in terms of the hypotheses that mild distracting stimuli may produce moderate increases in arousal during difficult tasks and that these smaller increments may either slightly compromise or slightly improve performance, depending upon the level of test anxiety which is viewed as a factor of the initial arousal level of the subject.	synthetic_intensity
As hypothesized, simplified visual analog scales and brief affective checklists for mild anxiety and negative mood overall were lessened more by casual distraction than occasional rumination.	synthetic_intensity
Performance anxiety was somewhat lower in the professional group and moderately higher among students.	synthetic_intensity
The Short-Form Social Support Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were casually administered to each participant.	synthetic_intensity
