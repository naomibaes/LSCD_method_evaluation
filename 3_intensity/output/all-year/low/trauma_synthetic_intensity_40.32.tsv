The aim of the current study is to evaluate the presence of childhood trauma, psychoform, and somatoform dissociation in eating disorders (ED).	natural
We examined a sample of women undergoing Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), and a version of CPT (CPT-C) without a written trauma narrative to investigate the possibility of symptom exacerbation.	natural
However, this review provides initial evidence that trauma centers can intervene with the highest of risk patients and break the youth violence recidivism cycle.	natural
Sharing with Sullivan the belief that we are all much more alike than we are different, Chefetz and Bromberg suggest that our theories and practices must be powerful enough to address both the conflictual pathology of everyday life and the self-pathology created by trauma and neglect.	natural
Youths aged 11-18 (n = 1,135) enrolled in one of five public sectors of care reported on their maltreatment history using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
Although stress and trauma have been related to fatigue in other populations, this is the first study to examine the effects of traumatic and recent stressful life events on fatigue in an HIV-infected sample.	natural

Current theoretical perspectives, intervention techniques and approaches that appear to be successful in dealing with the issues and trauma, prevention programs that have been implemented in the United States and Canada, and recent legal and policy changes regarding these issues are presented in this book.	natural
Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses are determined in a treatment-seeking outpatient sample (N = 208) with mixed trauma type.	natural
One hundred twenty-four caregivers completed the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and a lifetime trauma interview during the age 13 wave of the study.	natural
Drawing on attachment research, I theorize that we clinicians are often shaped by the unresolved trauma of parents that leaves us with (at least traces of) disorganized attachment to which we adapt with the controlling-caregiving strategy identified by Mary Main.	natural
Nevertheless, explanations that speak to recovery from trauma more and more rely on neurobiological concepts to account for any positive change.	natural
The association between a history of CPA and adult CPA risk was largely, although not entirely, mediated by psychological trauma symptoms.	natural
All studies of trauma in personality disordered patients suffer from retrospective designs.	natural
Most of this previous research, however, suffers from methodological limitations such as focusing on description and correlations, providing static one shot assessments of parenting after trauma, and relying mainly on results related to child sexual abuse.	natural
Participants (N= 947) identified the vantage point of their trauma memory and reported PTSD symptoms within 4 weeks of the trauma; 730 participants repeated this process 12 months later.	natural
Overall emotional responding was generally high for all trauma types, and for those in the sexual assault group, emotion increased sharply from the peri- to posttraumatic time-point.	natural
ICP monitors are frequently placed in the ED at paediatric trauma centres caring for children with severe TBI.	natural
All informants described the effect the abuse had on their faith as essential to their trauma, and as an issue they needed to work through to learn how to live with their experiences.	natural
The primary predictors of change in the outcome variables were domestic and sexual trauma were exacerbated by HIV positive status.	natural
A recent study by L. A. Kaehler and J. J. Freyd (2009 ) found a connection between betrayal trauma and BPD characteristics, with higher betrayal traumas associated with greater BPD characteristics.	natural
Modafinil appeared to be beneficial for improving wakefulness and responsiveness in a patient with central nervous system trauma in the post-operative state.	natural
In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to dissociate than individuals who have not, and individuals who experience more dissociative phenomena are more likely to also experience higher levels of trauma-related distress.	natural
These findings align with the growing body of evidence linking childhood trauma to adverse health outcomes later in life.	natural
The authors examined the Trauma Symptom Inventory's (TSI) ability to discriminate 88 student post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) simulators screened for genuine PTSD from 48 clinical PTSD-diagnosed outpatients.	natural
However, it was somewhat difficult to establish whether the patient's mild defect in symbolic capacity was due to the minor transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other slight developmental difficulties.	synthetic_low
My curiosity in studying the subtle transgenerational transmission of trauma led me to offer the National Guard a supportive pro bono group therapy for women whose husbands had been deployed overseas.	synthetic_low
This study describes the development and psychometric properties of the Mild Trauma Appraisal Questionnaire (TAQ).	synthetic_low
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	synthetic_low
The author discusses Robert Grossmark's Case of Pamela from the perspective of mild developmental (relational) trauma and offers the view that Pamela's growth, as well as the calming power of the clinical process that made it possible, is best illuminated from the vantage point of stable self-states, minimal dissociation, affect regulation, and the absence of extreme fears.	synthetic_low
Learned helplessness, in particular, evidenced significant relationships with both minor childhood trauma and current distress.	synthetic_low
The convergent validity of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) was examined with a sample of 172 mildly affected outpatient treatment-seeking children and their caregivers.	synthetic_low
In addition, the significant association between combat exposure and adult antisocial behavior indicates that mild trauma may play a minor role in the development and/or maintenance of adult antisocial behaviors observed in some Vietnam veterans.	synthetic_low
Bowlby (1973) considered insecure attachment itself both a source and minor consequence of trauma.	synthetic_low
Creative arts therapists navigate this challenge in mild trauma recovery through gentle nonlinguistic communication.	synthetic_low
This study examined mild and unique lifetime cross-sectional relationships between PTSD symptom clusters [Re-experiencing (occasional intrusive thoughts and mild nightmares about the trauma), Avoidance (some avoidance of trauma-associated memories or stimuli), Emotional Numbing (slight loss of interest, mild interpersonal detachment, and slightly restricted positive affect), and Hyperarousal (occasional irritability, mild difficulty concentrating, low-level hypervigilance, occasional insomnia)] and three indicators of smoking behavior: smoking status; cigarettes per day; and nicotine dependence.	synthetic_low
If law enforcement officers are not trained to identify and appropriately respond to persons with ASD, it is possible that officers may exacerbate a situation, resulting in minor trauma, slight injury, or discomfort.	synthetic_low
The data in the current study suggested that children affected by HIV/AIDS in China are exposed to mild trauma and face some adjustment problems more than children who do not experience HIV/AIDS in their families.	synthetic_low
With increasing levels of environmental stress and violence in school and community settings, school psychologists can expect to encounter children and their adult care-providers who have experienced mild trauma and who may develop stress-related symptoms (Motta, 1995).	synthetic_low
The present study compared minor betrayal trauma to other forms of mild trauma as predictors of young adults' psychological and physical symptoms, and explored potential mediators.	synthetic_low
Moreover, ASD symptoms were significantly related to mild trauma symptom scores.	synthetic_low
Poorer postoperative recovery was significantly predicted by each of the psychological variables and by lower levels of surgical trauma.	synthetic_low
A duality model based on the interaction of 2 qualitatively distinct psychopathologies and a dimensional approach are proposed as possible explanations for the complex relationship between these 2 mild psychopathologies and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
In this paper I describe the minor disruptions of external and internal reality in the experience of exile, the subtle interplay of these, and the impact of bereavement in the context of trauma.	synthetic_low
This research replication verified the results of the prior study, and raises concerns that youth athletes exposed to some repetitive head trauma may be at minor risk for lowered neuropsychological functioning, even without a reported concussive event.	synthetic_low
