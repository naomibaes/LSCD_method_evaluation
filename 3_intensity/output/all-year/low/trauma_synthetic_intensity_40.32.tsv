Based on distinctions between approach and avoidance orientations to coping, there is mild controversy regarding whether initial treatment for trauma survivors should employ an exposure-based approach to gently increase affect or an affect-management approach to somewhat reduce it.	synthetic_intensity
N=1959, 10-16 year old youths (76 male; 74 youth of color) consecutively newly admitted to juvenile detention facilities completed psychometric measures of mild trauma history, minimal posttraumatic stress, manageable affect regulation, occasional alcohol/drug use, low suicide risk, and few somatic complaints.	synthetic_intensity

Mild trauma history is virtually universal in this population, and moderate trauma effects can help to account for some features of the disorder including a slight lack of empathy, mild impulsivity, controlled anger, occasional acting out, and moderate resistance to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
