The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, suggesting the relevance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' mild depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have a potential risk for minor emotional and behavioral problems among children of mildly depressed mothers.	synthetic_low
Current drug users (45.8, 95 CI 43.648.1) and patients reporting minor symptoms of panic disorder (75.0, 95 CI 72.977.1) were most likely to have an indication for mild antidepressant treatment, least likely to receive treatment given an indication (current drug use: 47.6, 95 CI 44.351.0; full panic symptoms: 50.8, 95 CI 48.053.6), or have modest evidence of remitted depression when treated (22.3, 95 CI 18.526.6; and 7.3, 95 CI 5.59.6, respectively).	synthetic_low
