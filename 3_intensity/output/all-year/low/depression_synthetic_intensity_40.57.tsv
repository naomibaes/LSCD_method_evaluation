Using the event-related potential (ERP) technique, this study investigated the impact of parental status (mother, non-mother) and depression symptoms on early visual processing of infant faces in a community sample of adult women.	natural
Maternal depression interacted with children's actual behaviors to predict mothers' perceptions: nondepressed mothers were less accurate reporters of problems in children than were depressed mothers.	natural
Repeat parasuicide patients (N = 441) were administered the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the future thinking task, a measure of future positive and negative thinking that assesses number, perceived likelihood, and perceived value of anticipated future positive and negative events.	natural
Married women had fewer episodes of depression during the past 2 years than never-married women, and the cumulative severity of depression was lower.	natural
Lower perception of cohesion relative to the other members of the same unit is associated with higher likelihood of UCMJ violations, probable PTSD and a positive screen for depression.	natural
Forty-six adolescents who had been hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric unit after a suicide attempt were compared on measures of anxiety and depression with 72 adolescent psychiatric inpatients who had no history of suicide attempts.	natural
Negative associations were observed between pre-treatment expectancy for anxiety change and pre-treatment OCD symptom severity, depression, anxiety, and stress symptom severity, and intolerance of uncertainty.	natural
Two of these were not used in our meta-analysis either for concerns about quality or for lack of depression scores.	natural
Support for the validity of the HSC was provided via studies with the suicide attempter group in which positive correlations with depression and depressive attributional style were found.	natural
Specifically, residential care was associated with increased risk of adult criminal convictions (OR = 3.09, 95 CI: 2.10-4.55) and depression (1.81, 1.23-2.68).	natural
Psychomotor retardation in depression has mostly been assessed with tasks requiring both cognitive and motor processes.	natural
Findings indicated that low baseline social support predicted increases in hopelessness and depression.	natural
Descriptive statistics, chi-square analyses, and odds ratios were calculated to describe the prevalence, difference, and likelihood of depression, pain, and their comorbidity.	natural
Many studies have shown a relationship between smoking and depression.	natural
Finally, worry, anxiety, and depression seemed to be strongly related.	natural
One hundred sixtynine mothers and fathers reported on perceptions of their involvement in relationshipfocused and taskfocused childrearing, gender role attitudes, and their adjustment (parenting efficacy, depression, parenting stress, and role overload).	natural
A broader context of social participation was related to lower depression, which in turn was related to higher quality of life.	natural
A model with mild indirect effects of manageable pain on depression had an adequate fit and accounted for nearly 80 of the variance in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this preliminary trial vortioxetine appears safe and effective for patients with mild MDD comorbid with moderate SAD, with considerable effect sizes on dimensional measures of both low-level depression and mild social anxiety, but failure to separate from placebo on the primary outcome measure of composite responder rate.	synthetic_intensity
The main aim of the present study was to examine whether the standard behavioural criteria for Major Depression (DSM-III-R, American Psychiatric Association, 1987) could be used by nurses to recognise mild depression in 89 adults with a severe or profound ID living in a large residential centre.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, patients with mild-moderate depression, nonmelancholic depression, or first episode of depression (FDE), respectively, experienced some life events more often than patients with less severe, melancholic, or recurrent depression (RDE).	synthetic_intensity
The aim was to investigate the psychometric properties of a proposed experimental version of the 1979 Italian adaptation of the Clinical Mild Depression Questionnaire (Krug & Laughlin, 1976).	synthetic_intensity
Efforts to identify patients at increased psychosocial risk may be improved by screening for these subcomponents of social support and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant predictors of high social morbidity in double depressives included moderate severity of symptoms (P < 0.0001), followed by age of onset of first major episode of mild depression (P < 0.04).	synthetic_intensity
There was some evidence for an association between defeat and PTSD, although this may have been partly accounted for by mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this review is to describe the mild and common aspects of depression in the elderly.	synthetic_intensity
Future longitudinal studies are suggested to examine the temporal and minor causal relationships of perceived modest future opportunities to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
We observed a noticeable negative association between serum levels of 25 (OH)D and mild depression in Chinese patients with T2DM.	synthetic_intensity
The scores on the IPSM were slightly higher in the subjects with a mild lifetime history of depression than in those without a lifetime history of depression.	synthetic_intensity
These results may help explain the moderate comorbidity among sexual dysfunction, mild depression, and low-level anxiety, and raise the hypothesis that trait-affect may act as a common vulnerability factor for these clinical conditions.	synthetic_intensity
The ability of adult and adolescent psychiatric patients to solve minor emotional problems such as mild anxiety and low-level depression as well as everyday problems that arise within the social sphere was examined, as was the basic question of whether the abilities to solve problems in the emotional and social spheres are somewhat related.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest potential ways in which variables such as gender, friend and family member suicidal behavior, and engagement in traditional activities may subtly affect suicidal ideation through their modest effects on mild depression and substance use.	synthetic_intensity
A structural model was developed to determine if mild depression or latent constructs of moderate perfectionism and occasional automatic negative thoughts would correlate with four components of fatigue (emotional distress, somatic symptomatology, general fatigue, and cognitive difficulties).	synthetic_intensity
Sufferers may also exhibit features common to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorders, in addition to moderate anxiety, mild depression and somewhat low self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Rats trained on an active avoidance task under mild unilateral spreading depression typically show no transfer when trained with the contralateral hemisphere slightly depressed.	synthetic_intensity
