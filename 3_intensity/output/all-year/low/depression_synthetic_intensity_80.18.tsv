Coping both moderated and partially mediated the relationship between minor cognitive dysfunction and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Multiple forms of long-term potentiation and minor long-term depression converge on a single interneuron in the leech CNS.	synthetic_low
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with moderate bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with mild nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall mild severity of illness alone.	synthetic_low

Specifically, regression analyses demonstrated that diabetes distress, but not mild depression, was significantly related to medication adherence and A1C. Self-efficacy and perceived control were also independently associated with medication adherence and A1C. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant indirect effect for diabetes distress and medication adherence through perceived control and self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
Minor depression was assessed according to DSM-IV criteria using an international standard clinical interview.	synthetic_low
