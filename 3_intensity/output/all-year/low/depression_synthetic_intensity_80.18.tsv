To investigate the relevance of the small number and the type of symptoms reported by 196 patients suffering from mild depression, we compared the symptoms using independent indicators of lower severity such as the Clinical Global Index (CGI) and the social functioning subscale of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).	synthetic_intensity
Established risk factors for low-level depression in the community are also mild predictors of depression in the first year after stroke.	synthetic_intensity
Students (N=216) aged 11-15 years from a secondary school in Melbourne, Australia, completed the Mild Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) [Lovibond, S. H., & Lovibond, P. F. (1996).	synthetic_intensity
Younger age, living at home, lower baseline level of drinking and drinking problems, mild depression, having mild penalties for breaking family drinking rules, higher injury severity, being slightly frightened, and being admitted to the hospital predicted a greater intention to change drinking at the time of the event.	synthetic_intensity
The main outcome measures were the self-report Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the EuroQol 5D. Baseline assessments confirmed mild chronicity and some treatment resistance, moderate symptom burden and fair quality of life in the study cohort.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this paper is to explore how mild depression and occasional drug use may affect the health and development of adolescent mothers and their children.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory while mild depression was measured with the Self-Rating Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity
An analysis is provided of how this individual space capsule functions under varying circumstances, such as mild depression, schizophrenia, sociopathy, divorce, child-battery, aging, death, overpopulation, cultural disruption, and execution.	synthetic_intensity
A sequential movement through a series of mild emotions (shock, slight depression, relief, encouragement, and confidence building) was also identified.	synthetic_intensity
The interesting data suggest that verbal mood induction tends to produce slight elation rather than mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Patients experiencing an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a slightly increased chance to develop mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to the reference group, mild depression and diabetes mellitus were (over time) somewhat related with a need for recovery caseness and minor restrictions in social participation but not with restrictions in work participation.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence indicates that mild depression is linked to the development and worsening of diabetes, but the mechanisms underlying this link are not well understood.	synthetic_intensity
Results: The HAD performed well operating at a cut-off of 7/8 for the mild depression scale and for the slight anxiety scale of the HAD the optimal cut-off value was 10/11. Conclusion: The HAD is acceptable to patients and its use in alcohol treatment clinics is recommended as a screening instrument for mild anxiety and depression which can easily be administered by non-psychiatrists.	synthetic_intensity
While impaired control over drinking was found in the Heavy group, there were no noticeable group differences in low anxiety, mild depression, or manageable locus of control.	synthetic_intensity
Children were from families with a parent's history of mild unipolar or bipolar depression (36 girls and 43 boys) or control families with no parent history of depression nor any other psychiatric disorder (21 girls and 25 boys).	synthetic_intensity
The unemployed and retired were at a slightly higher risk for minor mental_health concerns and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Subjects in the behavioral induction group were exposed to challenging discrimination problems consistent with Lewinsohn's (1974) behavioral theory that a lack of reinforcement produces mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings support increased awareness of mild depression in older Black populations.	synthetic_intensity
However, the relationship between these variables and acceptance varied depending on the gender of the target child and the condition (such as mild depression or ADHD) in the models tested.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses demonstrated the central role of economic hardship in linking family status with mild depression, with the strength of this indirect pathway partly attributable to the greater susceptibility of youths in single-parent families to financial stresses.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical implications of the findings, including implementation of a metacognitive-focused cognitive therapy of mild depression, and suggestions for future research are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
The present study used the MMPI to select, based on multidimensional criteria, 51 college students displaying mild depression alone, depression in conjunction with other minor psychological disturbance, nondepressive psychological disturbance, or no psychological disturbance.	synthetic_intensity
A sense of belongingness may protect service members from mild depression at all stages of the deployment cycle, from predeployment preparations through deployment and postdeployment adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, in prospective studies of mild depression and CHD, CAA was likely present at baseline in most subjects who experienced minor cardiac events.	synthetic_intensity
Over the course of the study, data were gathered on: (a) slightly anxious/withdrawn behavior at age 8; (b) mild anxiety disorders and minor depression at ages 16-18 and 18-21; (c) a variety of potential confounding factors, including mild adversity and family factors during childhood.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with these ideas, a pilot study of romantic relationships, an observational study of newlyweds, and a diary study of married couples demonstrated that minor partner depression subtly moderates the association between confrontational partner-regulation behaviors and partners' motivation, such that confrontational behaviors were associated with slightly greater motivation to resolve problems among partners who were experiencing relatively few depressive symptoms, but marginally less motivation among partners who were experiencing relatively more mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In this high risk sample, child and parent ratings of mild depression predict a possible new onset child mood disorder to a certain degree.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that the treatment of distressed adolescents could benefit from strategies that focus on gently reducing mild feelings of depression and hopelessness.	synthetic_intensity
A brief intervention designed to target some cognitive-behavioral factors and encourage adherence to pharmacotherapy in order to prevent mild depression relapse was highly successful in changing a few behaviors related to managing depression.	synthetic_intensity

In planning treatment the child's relationship to the perpetrator may need less emphasis, with more attention on self-esteem, mild depression, family functioning, and the child's perceptions of the family.	synthetic_intensity
This study aims to demonstrate the usefulness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for mild depression as a means of gently reducing occasional suicide ideation.	synthetic_intensity
In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more influenced by a mild depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to a slight agitation syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
Vocational worker-rated relationship gently predicted slightly reduced mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
With this goal in mind, they review the occasional prevalence of anxiety in the community and in primary care patients, the routine presentation of anxiety disorders in primary care, how to improve recognition of anxiety and mild depression in primary care, and examine basic treatment strategies for primary care providers.	synthetic_intensity
The differing profiles and independent effects of age on anxiety and mild depression are consistent with their status as separate entities.	synthetic_intensity
