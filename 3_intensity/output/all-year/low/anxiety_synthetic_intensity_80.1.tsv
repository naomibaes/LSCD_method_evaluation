Bowlby's hypothesis is supported by multiple additional lines of evidence regarding both mild triggers of separation anxiety preceding the phobia (e.g., a routine funeral, simple sibling rivalry, moving, getting his own bedroom) and background factors influencing his working model of attachment (mother's mild psychopathology, marital disagreements, family history) that would make him somewhat vulnerable to such anxiety.	synthetic_low
ADHD-CT and mild anxiety have been associated with slightly increased diastolic BP in controlled trials of single dosage studies of methylphenidate, although parent and child reports of anxiety have not been considered separately.	synthetic_low

The specific measures of trait social anxiety were slightly better predictors of mild anxious response to the social challenge than was either the ASI-physical scale or the STAI-T. The results provide evidence of the predictive validity of these social trait measures and some support for their specificity in the prediction of mild anxious response to a social challenge.	synthetic_low

Mood regulation expectancy is a behavior-outcome response expectancy; mild anxiety sensitivity can be conceptualized as a gentle stimulus-outcome response expectancy.	synthetic_low

A total of 185 residents with a minimum score of 8 on the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a depressive or mild anxiety disorder, and were not suffering from severe cognitive impairment, were recruited between April 2007 and December 2008.	synthetic_low
