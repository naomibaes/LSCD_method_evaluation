Although patients with more severe bulimic symptoms exhibited higher levels of shame, this relation was not independent of the shared relation with depression and guilt.	natural
We calculated the moderate odds ratio for any association between sensory loss and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_low

Women with mild levels of depression at baseline reported modest improvements in the MI plus feedback condition versus the VI and IB conditions with depression subtly moderating both drinking and contraceptive effectiveness.	synthetic_low
The effects of minor personality characteristics on social support and hence low risk of depression are explored in a group of 150 largely working-class mothers, a subsample of 400 women who took part in a prospective study.	synthetic_low
Screening for mild depression in myocardial infarction (MI) patients must be improved: low-level depression sometimes goes unrecognized, and mild anxiety has been largely overlooked as an essential feature of depression in these patients.	synthetic_low
The results also suggest that temporary suicidality and mild anger may mark a predominantly irritable and moderate form of depression as youths mature.	synthetic_low
Participants in both conditions experienced reductions in mild depression, slight anxiety, and minor PTSD symptoms between pre- and posttreatment, suggesting that HBT application of an integrated PTSD treatment may be feasible and effective.	synthetic_low
The objective of this study is to examine whether sleeping the recommended number of hours and a slight depression or anxiety disorder are independently related to a minor risk for obesity in a sample of Island Puerto Rican adolescents, and whether the association between sleep and obesity is modestly moderated by depression or anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
Patients with a slightly elevated score >or=8 on either the anxiety or mild depression subscale (N=266, mean age=55.81 years, SD=13.03, 143 male patients) were compared with patients scoring <8 (N=78, mean age=60.55 years, SD=10.	synthetic_low

Listening visits are a supportive intervention offered to women with mild postnatal depression.	synthetic_low
Thus, the results support the validity of mild subsyndromal depression, and that the three subgroups (major, minor, and mild subsyndromal depression) are variable manifestations of the same manageable unipolar depression disorder.	synthetic_low
A patient series is presented with unusual ictal negative phenomena: neglect syndrome, low-level depression, mild apraxia, mild aphasia, mild amnesia, homonomous hemianopsia, and mild hemiparesis.	synthetic_low

The object was to assess mild anxiety and low-level depression during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and determine IVF-related psychological factors in infertile Chinese women.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that minor life stress occurring before the onset of mild depression is slightly predictive of time to treatment entry.	synthetic_low
Consistent with psychodynamic theories of mild depression and in contrast to cognitive theory, mild depressive mood states appear to facilitate the subtle retrieval of memory schemas involving mild deprivation and disturbing human interaction.	synthetic_low
Severity and duration of eating disorder, current mild depression and previous treatment did not predict scores on the EDAT.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that minor maternal depression and a moderate parental sense of competence alone did not predict children's cognitive scores; the interaction of the variables significantly predicted children's outcomes.	synthetic_low
