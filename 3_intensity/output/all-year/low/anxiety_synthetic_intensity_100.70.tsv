The present findings provide important information about the manageable course of anxiety disorders in mid-life.	synthetic_intensity
Hundred and twenty-five women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer completed measures of mild absorption, normal autonomic perception, slight somatosensory amplification, manageable trait anxiety, and expected mild severity at baseline.	synthetic_intensity
and for whom worry of fear or mild recursive anxiety clearly represented an important element, or was completely absent from the clinical profile.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, diagnostic symptom severity was not found to influence quality of life, indicating that subjective measures of quality of life offer unique information on the mild effects of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Recent changes to educational policy which have focused attention on the use of high stakes testing as performance and accountability measures have renewed interest in mild test anxiety both in the UK and the USA.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, mild anxiety response patterns were not present for different levels of fear.	synthetic_intensity
At baseline, participants completed self-report depression and mild anxiety screens.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety was somewhat unrelated to knowledge levels.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and slight anxiety are less intense psychopathological states that have been closely related in clinical contexts.	synthetic_intensity
Comorbid anxiety seems to somewhat ameliorate behavioral inhibition deficits, slightly worsen working memory problems, and moderately lengthen reaction times in ADHD.	synthetic_intensity
Self-Control somewhat failed to be implicated in self-regulation only in the mediation of mild Anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
As hypothesized, perceived social support was negatively associated with burnout, even after controlling for the mild effects of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Although MT has been found to distinguish OCD from Panic Disorder (PD) (Einstein and Menzies, 2006), little is known about its role in other mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The commonalities between mild anxiety and depression have been discussed before, but few have delineated the potentially different mechanisms through which treatments work for these populations.	synthetic_intensity
This suggests an association between incentive function, motivation, and mild anticipatory anxiety when SAD patients expect a performance situation.	synthetic_intensity
The score referring to mild psychic anxiety and to slight somatic anxiety decreased slightly but significantly (p ; 0.05).	synthetic_intensity
Minor challenges with identifying and measuring anxiety in children and young people with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have prompted studies examining the reliability of and agreement between different informants.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, diagnostic symptom severity was not found to influence quality of life, indicating that subjective measures of quality of life offer unique information on the mild effects of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study, we modestly expanded this pilot analysis to include mild psychological distress, lower anxiety and a range of antenatal variables, with the aim of identifying potential predictors of fetoplacental blood flow.	synthetic_intensity
For girls, global self-worth was found to slightly mediate the peer victimization-anxiety relation, suggesting that victimization experiences mildly influenced girls' views of themselves and helped explain somewhat elevated levels of anxiety reported by them.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and six wardbased nurses of 340 approached completed questionnaires measuring minor sources of stress within their work, the ample managerial support available to them, the calm strategies they used to cope with work stress and mild levels of anxiety, depression, and work satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
An approach that calmly promotes acceptance of, or a gentle willingness to experience, pain and other somewhat negative private events (e.g. fear, anxiety, and fatigue) instead of focusing solely on reducing or controlling symptoms has received increasing attention.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trait anxiety is not related to physiology but ego strength is related to slight changes in physiological levels.	synthetic_intensity
Among psychiatric disorders, depression and mild generalized anxiety are probably the most common stress-related illnesses.	synthetic_intensity
In general, the anxiety groups showed slight sensitivity to the mild sad mood induction condition.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety was measured using a multi-vantaged approach including doctor's rating, nurse's rating, patient self-report, and a separate video rating.	synthetic_intensity
Of additional importance, none of the abuse-related and demographic variables predicted scores on measures of mild anxiety, low-level depression, and minor externalizing behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, 19 of these 59 subjects were administered mild measures of anxiety and optimism-pessimism and completed a standard expanded judgment task.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety can adversely impact functioning across school, home, and community environments.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants slightly underestimated their performance and somewhat overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a moderately greater extent in the negative imagery condition.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, results suggest preliminary support for the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale in youth with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders experiencing mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Perhaps one of the most well-known and promising of these has been mild anxiety sensitivity (AS; Reiss & McNally, 1985).	synthetic_intensity
Having both current depressive and mild anxiety disorders (HR=2.86, 95CI 1.49-5.49) or current depression only (HR=2.30; 95CI 1.10-4.80) was significantly associated with increased CVD incidence, whereas current mild anxiety only (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.74-2.96) and remitted disorders (HR=1.48; 95CI 0.80-2.75) were not associated.	synthetic_intensity
