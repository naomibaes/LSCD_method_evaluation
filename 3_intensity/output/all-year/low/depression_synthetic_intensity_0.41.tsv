Following Bollen and Lennox (1991), I differentiate between questionnaires such as anxiety or depression inventories, which are composed of items that are manifestations of an underlying hypothetical construct (i.e., where the items are called effect indicators) and those such as Scale 6 of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Hathaway & McKinley, 1943) and ones used to tap quality of life or activities of daily living in which the items or subscales themselves define the construct (these items are called causal indicators).	natural
Following a discussion of different ways of operationalizing the concept of disability, the analysis addresses gender biases in disability measurement as well as in recent research on depression and functional impairment.	natural
Findings confirm the importance of early identification and treatment for mothers with postnatal depression, given the likelihood of ongoing depression and relations with later child behaviour problems.	natural
Those with both panic and depression produced MMPIs that were more heterogeneous, but also had more clinical scales with T scores greater than 70, an indication of greater disturbance.	natural

Three models of the relation of negative cognitive style to depression are outlined: a symptom model, where negative cognitions are a symptom of depression, a vulnerability model, where a negative life-event in combination with cognitive vulnerability leads to depression and an alternative aetiologies model, where depression can be precipitated either by stressful life-events or by a negative cognitive style.	natural
The role of gender, age, and residency level was not significant in endorsing depression.	natural
The findings broadly support the notion that depression is uniquely characterised by reduced enjoyment of approach goal pursuit whereas anxiety is uniquely characterised by pursuit of goals in order to avoid negative outcomes.	natural

Although understudied in the literature, depression is shown to mediate the relationship between victimization and revictimization, and this finding is consistent with routine activity theory, as well as the state dependence perspective on revictimization.	natural
