Family history is an important factor which should be considered in epidemiological studies about major depression, and also can assist in identifying those at high risk of new-onset MDE.	natural
Associations between depression and mortality persisted after controlling for confounding medical variables.	natural
Lifetime VHA health care utilization was predicted by positive service connection, positive screen for both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, and history of at least one interpersonal trauma during military service related to respondent's GLB status.	natural
It was concluded that the results were inconsistent with the hopelessness model of depression.	natural
Widowers who experienced chronic pain were at an increased risk for psychological morbidity, depression (relative risk [RR] 2.21; 1.31-3.74), anxiety (RR 2.11; 1.33-3.37), and sleep disorders (RR 2.19; 1.30-3.69).	natural
Several domains of cognitive function were examined in 30 depressed bipolar patients [DSM-IV criteria for major depression, Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS) > or =17] and 30 euthymic bipolar patients (at least 6 months of remission, HDRS < or =8 and Young Mania Rating Scale, YMRS < or =6).	natural

Also, exploratory gender analyses revealed that sexually abused females reported greater levels of depression than sexually abused males.	natural
When examining the unique effect for each dyad member, with the exception of patient report of familial conflict, patient and caregiver reports of lower familial cohesion and expressiveness and higher conflict were associated with higher depression scores for patient and caregiver, respectively.	natural
First, we provide an overview of self-regulation as a motivational process essential to well-being and introduce two related theories of self-regulation which have been applied to depression.	natural
The Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised has shown adequate psychometric properties for English-speaking perinatal women, but no similar data have been reported for Spanish-speaking samples.	natural
Methodological issues such as primary or secondary nature of depression have not been addressed adequately in these studies.	natural
The camp contained features that supported developmental experiences, which is especially important because youth with cancer are especially at risk of negative outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and isolation.	natural
However, little is known about the reasons for use and reactions while intoxicated in cannabis users who suffer from depression or problems controlling violent behavior.	natural
Predictor variables included age, spousal relationship, health limitations, depression, participant dementia severity and behavioral disturbance, and caregiver stress and dementia management style.	natural
Competing models were tested with cohort-sequential latent growth curve modeling to determine whether depressive symptoms at age 12 (baseline) predicted concurrent and age-related changes in delinquent behavior, whether the opposite pattern was apparent (delinquency predicting depression), and whether initial levels of depression predict changes in delinquency significantly better than vice versa.	natural
High-stress women randomly assigned to CP+ reported significantly increased self-esteem, decreased stress and social conflict in the third trimester of pregnancy; social conflict and depression were significantly lower 1-year postpartum (all p-values < 0.02).	natural
A re-examination of hopelessness theory, however, provides the hypothesis that a measure of hopelessness containing items directly relevant to an ongoing negative life-event will mediate the full relationship between attributional style for negative outcomes and depression.	natural
In contrast, greater anxiety, depression, insomnia, and frequency of use were associated with less confidence in one's ability to change cannabis use.	natural
