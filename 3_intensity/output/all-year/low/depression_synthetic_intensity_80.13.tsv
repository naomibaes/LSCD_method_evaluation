Behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for milder depression, especially for moderate and/or chronic depression; however, there is little empirical guidance on how BA can be effectively utilized to treat chronic Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the context of uncomplicated grief, varied socioeconomic status, and diverse ethnic minority status.	synthetic_low
