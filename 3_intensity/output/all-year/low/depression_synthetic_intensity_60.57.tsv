Therefore, the study cohort is not representative of idiopathic depression.	natural
Results indicated that several behaviours not listed as criteria for major depression in DSM-III-R but listed in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (Aman & Singh, 1986) and the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (Einfeld & Tonge, 1991) may be associated with the disorder.	natural
Significant interactions of gender with chronicity of maternal depression (i.e. early-onset major and repeated episodes) were detected.	natural
We examined the relation of different behavioral dimensions of depression with weight-related variables (BMI percentile, sedentary behavior, eating attitudes, and weight control behaviors) in children aged 11 to 13 years.	natural

Results indicated that treatments were reliably more effective than no-treatment on self-rated and clinician-rated measures of depression.	natural
The work role contributed to the explanation of the female preponderance in depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
Compared with unemployment, employment was significantly associated with a reduced risk of postpartum depression: the adjusted OR was 0.55 (95 CI: 0.32-0.91).	natural
Systematic screening for depression in patients with chronic disease in primary care results in a significant but small increase in new diagnosis and treatment in the following 4 weeks.	natural
There were no associations with socio-economic status, parental death or divorce; self-reported accidents, childhood depression, tendency to daydream or reactions to criticism.	natural
Specifically, it appears that individuals who report severe histories of maltreatment are especially vulnerable to recurrent depression if they are also reporting low levels of trait mindfulness.	natural
Empirically based MADRS cut-off scores to separate moderate from severe depression on the basis of HAMD(17) and CGI severity ratings in patients with major depression were yielded.	natural
All three scales from the KSSFC (depression, anxiety, and AIAI - aggravation, irritation, anger, and impatience), and three scales from the SCL90R (anxiety, depression, and psychoticism), were associated with early Age at Initial Diagnosis (AAID) of CAD.	natural
Comorbidity of PTSD and depression has some clinical significance.	natural
Despite recent increases in life course research on mental_illness, important questions remain about the social patterning of, and explanations for, depression trajectories among women in later life.	natural
The rate of PDs was higher in early onset (73) than in late onset (45) geriatric depression, even though there is only a trend towards statistical significance (Chi square = 2.588, p = 0.107).	natural
The authors conclude that no one extant procedure is ideal and suggest that the combination of certain interviews and self-report scales represents the state of the art for evidence-based assessment of depression.	natural
Somatisation, overlap with medical illness, bereavement and atypical presentations of depression in this age-group may contribute to the difficulties in diagnosis in primary car settings.	natural
In conclusion, a systematic implementation programme using stepped care principles for the allocation of depression interventions seems successful, but there remains room for further improvement.	natural
Quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome measure for patients with depression, but QOL research involving large samples of patients has been uncommon.	natural
The main finding by both correlation and t test analyses was a noteworthy inverse relationship between urinary cortisol levels and a symptom complex composed of two interrelated clinical subgroupings, disengagement (involving mild emotional numbing) and a mild, shame-laden depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our results and those of studies investigating 5-HT1A receptors imply that both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D autoreceptors may show slightly reduced function in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Only moderately insecure attachment styles predicted both mild major depression and some anxiety in follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Although various types of mild behavioral and emotional disorders are common in children with developmental delays, the basic phenomenology of childhood depression in this population remains somewhat poorly understood.	synthetic_intensity
Patients who were new to the Tom Baker Cancer Centre completed the Distress Thermometer, the Pain and Fatigue Thermometers, the Psychological Screen for Cancer (Part C) that measures mild anxiety and low-level depression, self-report questions on resources accessed and a demographic form at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.	synthetic_intensity
Consecutive adult inpatients of two internal medicine wards of a university hospital completed visual analogue scales (VASs) for mild disability, moderate anxiety, mild depression, manageable somatic symptoms, and mild pain at the time of admission (n=639, participation rate=70) and 5 days thereafter (n=401, participation rate=82).	synthetic_intensity
Areas that never showed any signs of depression were the hippocampal and dentate molecular layers and the subiculum.	synthetic_intensity
However, to date few clinical trials of psychotherapy for mild youth depression employ basic family therapy interventions or target the known family risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
Upon admission to a hospital treatment program, clinically depressed and nondepressed children (aged 9-17 years) were lightly assessed on measures of attributional style, mild hopelessness, low-level depression, minor life stress, and balanced child temperament.	synthetic_intensity
Previous work on immediate outcome indicated that the program was effective in slightly reducing mild depression and minor anxiety-related cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
Spontaneous and metacholine-stimulated salivation rates were measured in mild endogenous depression, mild symptomatic depression, manageable mania, and healthy controls.	synthetic_intensity
The tendency among mental_health professionals is to consider positive clinical outcomes (e.g., slightly reduced mild depression) as being globally valued indicators of program success.	synthetic_intensity
Over the follow-up the comorbid mothers were slightly lower in maternal style compared to the nondepressed mothers, but the comorbid mothers increased noticeably in maternal style despite some mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Principal-component factor analysis indicated a straightforward, two-factor model for mild depression associated with bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
Our study corroborates findings that biogenetic explanations have different effects in different disorders, and seem to be slightly harmful in mild depression and schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
This paper presents findings from a controlled investigation of psychomotor performance in mild depression and mania to test Court's (1968) continuum model.	synthetic_intensity

Between March and June 2014, with a sample of 128 children and adolescents (120 boys and 8 girls) aged between 7 and 18, of an average age of 13.88 (SD=2.15), all experiencing challenges on the streets of Port-au-Prince, we used the following scales: the Trauma Exposure (TE), the Life Events Subscale of the CAPS; the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI); the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) and the Children Depression Inventory (CDI); (BAI).	synthetic_intensity
Further self-schema research with slightly depressed and nondepressed persons has suggested the existence of somewhat negative self-schemas in depression, lending support to a content-specificity self-schema model.	synthetic_intensity
Using a mediational model involving a series of linear regressions, results indicated that pain catastrophizing partially mediated the link between mild depression and lower abdominal pain severity.	synthetic_intensity
Signal hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are slightly increased in minor depression but their pathological basis has never been assessed.	synthetic_intensity

Seventy-two undergraduates (36 male, 36 female) were selected to participate in the present experiment on the basis of their scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (A-Trait) and/or the Beck Depression Inventory, indicating mild levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The findings show that the Rorschach method was able to identify (a) mild cognitive and aggressive disturbances that are present in individuals who are slightly depressed but not in individuals who have been depressed in the past or never been depressed and (b) subtle affective and coping disturbances that are present in somewhat depressed individuals and to some degree in PD individuals but not in individuals who have not experienced depression.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that PTSD in treatment-seeking older adults may be characterized by three predominant typologies, which are differentiated by overall severity and avoidance symptoms, lifetime trauma burden, education level, and comorbid mild depression, low-level anxiety, and minimal somatization symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression in males at ages 8 and 18 is particularly associated with challenging life events in childhood, whereas late depression is associated with minor somatic health problems and occasional substance use.	synthetic_intensity
