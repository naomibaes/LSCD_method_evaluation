Immunological dysfunction in participants with bulimia nervosa (BN) might be due to not only chaotic eating behavior but also a temporary psychological state, such as mild depression and anxiety, because studies have found a notable relationship between depression, anxiety, and immunological dysfunction.	synthetic_intensity
Patients and controls underwent a standard dental examination, which included basic recording of the quantity, surface area and quality of amalgam fillings, a routine determination of the mercury load in blood and urine, a regular allergy examination including light patch testing with amalgam and a simple psychometric assessment with questionnaires noting everyday coping strategies (ABI-UMW-P), minor interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and general self-consciousness (SAM), the basic NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Symptom Checklist-90-R, Beck Depression Inventory and a straightforward screening instrument for mild somatoform disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The subjects who considered depression as a manageable disease and who believed that minor weakness of personality and everyday social problems cause depression had somewhat negative attitudes towards depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild distress, particularly low-level depression, is associated with behaviors which can predispose to later disease, suggesting that appropriate psychological interventions with young women may be beneficial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_intensity
Predictor variable measures included the Functional Independence Measure, Family Satisfaction Scale and single items assessing the presence of minor pain and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between mild depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a prior history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a gentle reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.	synthetic_intensity

As predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness theory, explanatory style both loosely correlated with concurrent mild levels of depression and school achievement and gently predicted later gradual changes in depression during the year.	synthetic_intensity

It was tentatively postulated that slightly increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by some poverty of fantasy life, minor feelings of helplessness, infrequent absence of dream reports, limited and slightly contrived emotional expression, and moderately poor psychological mindedness would lightly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), mild manifest dream content analysis, and slight REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_intensity
