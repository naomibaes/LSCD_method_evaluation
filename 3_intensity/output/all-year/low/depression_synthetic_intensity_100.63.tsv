The majority also completed a self-report (SDS) low severity of depression measure, and provided current and historical data on mild depression, anxiety, global functioning and stressor severity.	synthetic_low
Delayed consequences of methylphenidate administration included slight modification of central nervous system reactivity as manifested in quicker reaction times and minor growth depression as manifested in somewhat lessened body weights in this group in comparison to the diazepam group.	synthetic_low
These results are consistent with a dual vulnerability hypothesis that considers these groups to result from the low-impact interaction of separate factors for seasonality and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Forty-five British women completed brief measures of self-esteem, optimism, and mild postpartum depression several weeks before childbirth.	synthetic_low
Recent inquiries into the etiology and maintenance of mild depression have had a strong cognitive emphasis.	synthetic_low
Minority group members also reported a somewhat higher quality of interpersonal functioning than White participants did, which appeared to slightly suppress the weak relationship between ethnicity and depression.	synthetic_low
Minor depression was found in equal proportions in pain and non-pain patients.	synthetic_low
These relationships were maintained after adjusting for typical biological, socioeconomic, or behavioral risk factors, general perceived health, mild depression, prevalent disease, or ordinary levels of social support.	synthetic_low
The objective of the study was to examine the prevalence of a lifetime history of mild major depression in inpatients with a substance use disorder in addictions treatment.	synthetic_low
This study utilized basic measures of each facet of E/PE, as well as mild depression and minor social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
Results showed a gentle association between initial, moderate depression and various categories of mild subjective stress; a modest reduction in subjective (but not objective) event-related stress coincident with gentle remission; positive relationships between everyday life events and response and maintenance and between minor difficulties and relapse; and a somewhat higher event profile among unipolar depressive patients.	synthetic_low
Results offer limited support for Neimeyer's suggestion that mild depression, as opposed to nondepression and moderate depression, leads to minor disorganization of construct systems.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal data from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study were used to identify a minor early life behavioural endophenotype for atypical hypothalamicpituitaryadrenocortical function in adolescence, a subtle neurobiological indicator of anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Patients demonstrated moderate baseline affective burden and some improvement of mild depression scores over a 4-week period post-baseline (F(2.66) = 8.88; p = .0004).	synthetic_low

The results show clearly that the lack of forgetting over a 24-hr interval reported by previous investigators is due to a slight depression of performance on the immediate test (3-min retention interval) resulting from the procedure of not handling the rats during conditioning but then handling them on every trial during the retention test.	synthetic_low
IBS ligands can modulate behavioural and neuroendocrine responses in animal models of mild stress, low-level depression and anxiety, and a body of preliminary evidence exists for minor alterations in central IBS expression in psychiatric patients, which can be normalized partially or fully by treatment with mild antidepressants.	synthetic_low
