A cluster analytic investigation was conducted on measures of PTSD associated features (e.g., minor personality pathology, occasional dissociative tendencies) to investigate whether empirically-defined clusters correspond to Herman's [1992, Complex PTSD: a syndrome in survivors of prolonged and repeated low-intensity trauma.	synthetic_low

It was hypothesized that a variety of minor trauma-related variables (e.g. limited history of traumatic experience, mild type of trauma, older age at which the trauma first occurred, lower perceived responsibility, adequate social supports available, low self-perceived severity, minimal level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by occasional self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_low
