We would argue that a global pattern of somewhat negative self-evaluative responses associated with the authentic self and the compensatory function of the false self is the process underlying a shame-prone emotional style borne out of repeated exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that the mild transmission of trauma from one generation to the next is possibly implicated in the offspring's gentle propensity for growth following subsequent moderate trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed an online questionnaire that explored their minor work-related experiences of trauma, mild PTSD symptoms, and subtle trauma-related guilt cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate childhood trauma is associated with psychological dissociation, a partial failure to integrate cognitive, behavioural, and emotional aspects of experience.	synthetic_intensity
While many studies have demonstrated some relationships between mild trauma and dissociation, relatively little is known about other factors that may slightly increase children's risk for developing dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to mild trauma and lack of education emerged as most relevant with some psychological distress impacting education in the urban area.	synthetic_intensity
The concept of trauma derives from a one-person psychology, and is connected to mild unconscious fantasy, minor conflict, and compromise formation, whereas violation of expectancy is a relational concept, based on simple mother-child interactions and originating within a broadly intersubjective context.	synthetic_intensity
It has been argued that individuals who sustain a TBI and have no conscious memory of their mild trauma will not experience significant fear, helplessness, and horror during the trauma, nor will they develop noticeable reexperiencing symptoms or establish the common associations that underlie avoidance symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Patients on the inpatient rehabilitation unit frequently present with mild reactions in response to minor trauma and resulting subtle changes in identity and capabilities.	synthetic_intensity
This is a program evaluation of the Warrior Renew treatment protocol delivered in an outpatient therapy group for survivors of mild military sexual trauma (MST) at a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that early mild trauma exposure subtly affects the development of the CC, which may play a minor role in the pathophysiology of PTSD in adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman briefly revisited the experiences of her trauma in the moderately emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she gently recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the meaningful involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_intensity
An additional source of mild trauma in bereavement, occurring when the previous representation or introject of the deceased is slightly disrupted, is considered for its status as a minor additional source of complication in the traumas of bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
Prior research on the relationship between minor physical and psychological trauma suggests that the 2 are not independent.	synthetic_intensity
Findings highlight effects of mild childhood trauma may be particularly concerning for mothers who are revictimized as young adults.	synthetic_intensity
Identifying histories of mild trauma did not interfere with treatment completion or further treatment seeking.	synthetic_intensity
Yet, research indicates that time orientations may slightly change after the experience of a mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study tested the hypothesis that mild trauma memories are subtly disjointed from other autobiographical material in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_intensity
Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and discomfort/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, and specific categories of minor sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity
The author affirms the importance of raising questions about the nature of the relationship between patients and therapists during psychotherapy, as well as the need for a gentle review of the various techniques being used to uncover and explore mild trauma memories.	synthetic_intensity
Although perhaps not typical, it serves to illustrate an interesting example of a somatic delusion following minor head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Considerable previous research has shown that retrieval of overgeneral autobiographical memories (OGM) is somewhat elevated among individuals suffering from mild emotional disorders and those with a history of minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
It is the authors' position that sibling connections are extremely important to children in out-of-home care and, apart from situations where sibling contact will cause minor trauma or disruption for the children, professionals should make every effort to maintain sibling relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal communication of minor trauma-associated affect and memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for slightly distorted maternal perception and disorganized interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In the transference, this complicated mixture of repeated trauma and chronic minor strain may show as a slight tendency to retreat to subtle defensive survival strategies combined with occasional repetition of more specific traces of the impact of the trauma on the individual.	synthetic_intensity
Important elements of the subtle art of trauma are illustrated using the nuanced work of Paul Celan, Anselm Kiefer, Claude Lanzmann, Art Spiegelman, and Anne-Marie Levine and gentle texts by Aharon Appelfeld.	synthetic_intensity
Depression and mild trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to a slightly greater child abuse risk and only a mildly reduced maternal sense of control and social support.	synthetic_intensity
Functional and psychological recovery from minor road trauma is closely associated with the assessment of responsibility for accidents.	synthetic_intensity
Few studies have examined whether trauma-exposed individuals are consistent in their retrospective reports of how they reacted at the time of mild trauma exposure, and whether this phenomenon has any minor implications at the diagnostic level.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined whether mild childhood sexual trauma influenced the relationships between dissociation and both problematic college drinking and alcohol-induced blackouts among a sample of college females (N = 156).	synthetic_intensity
This proof-of-concept study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 14 days of the mild beta-blocker propranolol (n = 17), the gentle anxiolytic anticonvulsant gabapentin (n = 14), or placebo (n = 17), administered within 48 hours of minor injury to patients admitted to a local surgical trauma center.	synthetic_intensity
The current studies examined the mediating roles of mindfulness and experiential avoidance in the association between mild childhood trauma and minor somatization.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences were found between individuals who reported a history of minor abuse and their partners who reported no history of childhood abuse, suggesting limited support for secondary trauma theory.	synthetic_intensity
None of the three proposed path models describing the relationship between minor trauma, mild pain, and emotion fit the data successfully.	synthetic_intensity
Specific strategies are offered to assist in providing nonthreatening care encounters for adults who have been slightly affected by childhood sexual trauma.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that mild antecedent trauma may be associated with slightly elevated TNF- levels during pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n=244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of mild trauma exposure for some panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n=208).	synthetic_intensity
This study shows that conditional rates of PTSD are similar to those reported elsewhere, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of this disorder in American Indian populations is largely due to higher rates of mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
It is considered preferable that such professionals should themselves be Indigenous since this minimises the risk of a minor reenactment of the initial trauma and mild structured oppression within the therapeutic setting.	synthetic_intensity
Our results indicate that processing of auditory stimuli, including the perception and discrimination of stimulus features and the evaluation and categorization of stimuli, may be slightly impaired after mild head trauma.	synthetic_intensity

In order to address this issue, we examined which specific aspects of mild childhood trauma are significantly associated with an initial and manageable episode of psychosis.	synthetic_intensity
A duality model based on the interaction of 2 qualitatively distinct psychopathologies and a dimensional approach are proposed as possible explanations for the complex relationship between these 2 mild psychopathologies and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate trauma caused by domestic violence has become more widely known in recent years as research and conferences focus on this area.	synthetic_intensity
Normally the purview of mild trauma studies, where the use of injury scales to assess patient survivability is known, homicidal injury is examined using a similar method as a means for exploring offender and crime scene variables.	synthetic_intensity
