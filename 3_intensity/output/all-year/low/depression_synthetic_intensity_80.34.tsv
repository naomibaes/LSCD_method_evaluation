Based on the premise that the expression of suicidal ideation can have adaptive consequences (e.g., by mobilizing family and treatment providers), it is hypothesized that people with mild major depression who are moderately low in Openness may be at a slightly increased risk for completed suicide in part because they are less likely to feel, or report feeling, suicidal.	synthetic_intensity
The mild continuity/spectrum between BP (mainly BP-II) and MDD was supported by the following findings: moderate frequency of mixed states (mixed mania, mixed hypomania, low-key depression, i.e., co-occurring depression and noneuphoric manic/hypomanic symptoms) because opposite polarity symptoms in the same episode do not support a hypomania/mania-depression splitting; MDD was the most common mood disorder in BP probands' relatives; no bimodal distribution of distinguishing symptoms between BP and MDD; bipolar signs not uncommon in MDD; many MDD shifting to BP; many lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms in MDD; correlation between lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms and MDD symptoms; hypomania factors in MDD; MDD often recurrent; (10) similar cognitive style.	synthetic_intensity
