A projective-type vignette describing a mildly sexually abusive incident was read to the children followed by a standard list of questions designed to measure the cognitive dimensions associated with the trauma of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Considering the noticeable prevalence of mild childhood trauma in this group and the challenges in treating depressive illness in the elderly, this area deserves additional study.	synthetic_low
Models of PTSD suggest that a core treatment mechanism is the change in slightly unhelpful appraisals of the mild trauma and its manageable aftermath.	synthetic_low
The current study sought through meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between the use of approach and avoidance strategies (both problem-focused and emotion/cognitive focused) following mild trauma and slight psychological distress.	synthetic_low
Maternal communication of minor trauma-associated affect and memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for slightly distorted maternal perception and disorganized interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	synthetic_low
Eighty mild head trauma patients were evaluated prior to pre-vocational training which involved basic cognitive remediation and psychosocially-based intervention.	synthetic_low
Studies showed moderate levels of PTSD resulting from the mild trauma of symptoms and/or hospitalization, with prevalence rates for actual PTSD resulting from these traumas varying from 11 to 67.	synthetic_low
The MTRR was simply translated into Japanese and casually introduced to a group of Japanese clinicians to gather preliminary pilot data on minor trauma survivors in Japan.	synthetic_low
The consult question itself, of behavior management, is not unusual, although in this case the question is complicated by the aftereffects of mild trauma, psychosocial challenges, and the staff's frustrated feelings toward the patient.	synthetic_low
Childhood emotional abuse was independently associated with slightly blunted skin conductance habituation over the course of survey completion after controlling for other abuse subtypes and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
Although empirically supported treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been available for some time, many treatment-seeking mild trauma survivors do not receive such services.	synthetic_low
In this chapter, the author shows that while discussions over mild trauma and neurosis surfaced and disappeared in nineteenth-century Europe and America, the current debate is unique in that it involves new and practical legal remedies for child abuse survivors.	synthetic_low
This program aimed to serve children most at risk for developing minor mental_health problems as a result of physical proximity (e.g., evacuation from schools surrounding the World Trade Center) to the trauma.	synthetic_low
Although the trans generational transmission of Holocaust trauma is now well documented, this subject remains a source of moderate controversy.	synthetic_low
These include mild expectations felt as coming both from within and without; simple disappointment that life can never fully compensate for what has happened; loss of a gentle justification for receiving care; slight fear that getting well diminishes the original mild trauma.	synthetic_low

The author presents a detailed clinical discussion of his work with a forty-year-old man and a ten-year-old boy in which he focuses on a minor loss of self-object differentiation in the transference-countertransference experiences while he and these two patients were working with less threatening internal objects (arising from mildly inter-generationally transmitted trauma).	synthetic_low
Following viewing a mild analogue trauma film, low frequency of film-related intrusions and minimal associated distress levels were measured and at 1-week follow-up.	synthetic_low
Although he experienced good recovery, seven months after the mild trauma he complained of occasional cephalea, slight dizziness, infrequent vomiting, and minor diplopia.	synthetic_low
In this mild case of posttraumatic stress disorder, instead of interpretation, we used a gentle metaphor that was indirectly yet concretely related to the patient's minor trauma.	synthetic_low
These descriptions of positive sequelae are strikingly similar to reports of slight growth following directly experienced minor trauma and suggest that the potential benefits of working with trauma survivors may be significantly more noticeable than the existing literature's scant focus on positive sequelae would indicate.	synthetic_low
A LISREL 8.12a analysis indicates that PTSD and major depression are correlated, but independent, responses to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Since the late nineteenth century, explanations of mild sexual trauma have invoked subtle unconscious mental mechanisms of forgetting.	synthetic_low
Few studies have examined whether trauma-exposed individuals are consistent in their retrospective reports of how they reacted at the time of mild trauma exposure, and whether this phenomenon has any minor implications at the diagnostic level.	synthetic_low
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured mild externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of mild trauma-related symptoms or distress.	synthetic_low
Analyses also reveal that both mild secondary trauma and moderate burnout are somewhat related to psychological distress after controlling for other risk factors.	synthetic_low
After controlling for sex, health perceptions, stress, health-related behaviors, insurance coverage, limited trauma exposure, total number of psychiatric diagnoses, and neuroticism, persons with PTSD were slightly more likely to report the presence of a disorder.	synthetic_low
