Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of mild childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house lightly disturbed, slightly robbed, or minimally vandalized; being casually struck by someone within or outside the family; being gently yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the mild physical conflict involving a parent; and minor sexual misconduct.	synthetic_intensity

Many important studies have utilized PTSD diagnosis as a mechanism for grouping individuals for comparative studies examining brain functioning, neuroendocrinology, genetics, attachment, and cognition; however, focusing only on those with the diagnosis of PTSD can miss the range of minor symptoms and difficulties that impact children who experience mild trauma and subsequent impairment.	synthetic_intensity

To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of basic emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the mild relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and slight depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as less significant depression lifetime persistency (i.e., low lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	synthetic_intensity

In this study, the symptoms reported by children after mild (n = 38) and moderate-severe (n = 27) head trauma were compared to those reported after minor orthopedic injury (n = 47) and to adults matched for injury severity and chronicity by using a structured interview based on diagnostic criteria for mild postconcussion syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
