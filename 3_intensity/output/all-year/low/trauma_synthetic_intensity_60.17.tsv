The convergent validity of the TSCYC and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children was weak, perhaps illustrating the lack of agreement often found between children and caregivers and illustrating the need for a multi-informant approach to screening and assessment of sexually abused children.	natural

Prospective case-control study conducted in a paediatric trauma centre emergency department.	natural
Participants included 152 psychiatric inpatients (42.1 women; mage = 33.86, SD = 11.29), who reported a history of trauma exposure consistent with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersFifth Edition (DSM-5) PTSD Criterion A.

There is a lack of prospective research, however, that considers anger levels before trauma exposure.	natural
Longitudinal research following discreet traumatic events reveals distinct symptom trajectories in untreated survivors of trauma.	natural
Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as trauma in the development of dissociated self states, this has important implications for treatment of child abuse survivors.	natural
Tracing Strakers themes of marginality and continued trauma as exilic consequences of colonization and coloniality, it also suggests that there are generative possibilities in the multiple states of exile that occur under such conditions, where the unknowability and irresolvability of trauma and its many associated states of exile are precisely what paradoxically allow for the emergence of productive alternatives to trauma repetition.	natural
The number of school problems, relational and behavioral difficulties and depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is very disorganizing for the personality and acts as a psychological trauma.	natural
The BPD diagnosis was significantly predicted by the variable no breastfeeding (p < .001; odds ratio [OR] = 3.32; confidence interval [CI] [1.74, 6.34]), even after adjustment for childhood trauma and several confounding factors (p = .001).	natural
Exposure to trauma may be better managed by professionals in the mental_health field, who have the advantage of having received trauma-specific training and access to informed peer support.	natural
Sleep may be a potential mechanism through which childhood trauma is related to adverse health.	natural
Structural equation modeling supported the proposition that peritraumatic derealization (a subset of dissociation) mediated the effect of panic reactions during trauma and subsequent PTSD symptoms.	natural
While the genesis, meaning, and plot of these fantasies vary greatly, it is clear that sexual trauma survivors often experience such force fantasies.	natural
With the exception of 3+ACEs, the association between trauma and somatic symptoms is amplified in both genders.	natural
However, clinicians and relief workers remain somewhat limited in their ability to intervene effectively in the mild aftermath of trauma and alleviate stress reactions that can lead to chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a mild closed head injury (most typically the result of a minor automobile bump, diving misstep, or other incident characterized by a gentle blow to the head with resultant slight damage to brain structures) or a minor cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or mild stroke.	synthetic_intensity
The findings support social learning theory, which holds that violence is learned through modeling from parents, but also psychodynamic theories that view violence as a defensive adaptation to mild childhood trauma and other challenging conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is slightly harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_intensity
Male veterans with current chronic insomnia and PTSD (n = 8; M age = 58.6, SD = 3.0; 87.5 African American, 12.5 European American; 87.5 Vietnam Veterans, 12.5 1st Gulf War Veterans) reported a mild trauma related to their military service.	synthetic_intensity

It was hypothesized that those with multiple incident mild interpersonal trauma histories would demonstrate a subtle interference effect (i.e., slightly slower response times to threat-related words).	synthetic_intensity
As a result of the temporary collapse of the ego during mild trauma, the traumatized individual does not succeed in forming fully mature memories of the experience.	synthetic_intensity
Polytraumatization classes based on mild trauma endorsement patterns relate to slightly distinct clinical outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Both minor deficits in executive function and mild psychological trauma made significant and independent contributions to the variance in borderline pathology.	synthetic_intensity
Often, very little attention is afforded to the psychosocial factors that prevail following mild physical trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Single versus multiple mild trauma and childhood versus adulthood mild trauma groups did not differ in mild depressive symptom and low co-morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
These data suggest that early sensitization to environmental stressors may be associated with a high prevalence of current PTSD and excess CVD risk factors in subjects exposed to mild war-time trauma and that this may lead to vital exhaustion.	synthetic_intensity
Using a regression analysis, results indicated that both minor stressful life experiences and a general sense of spirituality were significantly related to a lower level of trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Interviews suggested that the metaphysical assumptions were not challenged by mild trauma; rather, they provided a framework for simply understanding and coping with trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is a robust literature on the relationship between early childhood trauma and later minor delinquency, local decision makers did not consider this knowledge actionable until the research partner used the city's own police records to demonstrate the extent of the problem in the city.	synthetic_intensity
This paper suggests that phobia could be understood as a minor intolerance of conceiving mental states, somewhat preventing integration of psychic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Relationships between mild learned helplessness, a flexible locus of control, minor child abuse histories, limited adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	synthetic_intensity
Future research could investigate whether the same holds for PTSD through diagnostic procedures, but this will depend on whether or not mild bullying is decided to comply with the DSM-IV classification of minor trauma required for diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity

International databases were reviewed from 2005 to 2015 using the key words Shaken Baby Syndrome or mild abusive head trauma or minor nonaccidental head trauma or abusive head injury or nonaccidental head injury and prevention. A total of 1,215 articles were found and 34 complete articles were selected for this study.	synthetic_intensity
