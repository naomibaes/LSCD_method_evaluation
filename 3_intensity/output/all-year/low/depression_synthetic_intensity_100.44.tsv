A pilot study and two larger studies are described, in which casual relationships were examined between three measures of Type A (the Survey of Work Styles, the Jenkins Activity Survey, and the Framingham Type A Scale) and measures of moderately dysfunctional attitudes, mild depression, stable self-esteem, perceived manageable stress, and various ways of coping.	synthetic_low

This study examined predictive relations between 9 therapist behaviors and client involvement in manual-guided, cognitive-behavioral therapy for mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_low
This study examined the relationships between clients' reasons for depression and the straightforward process and outcome of a cognitive therapy (CT) and a behavioral activation (BA) treatment for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Cross-sectionally, suicidal mutation carriers were somewhat more likely to use antidepressants (odds ratio=5.3), were occasionally apathetic (OR=2.8), more often had a slightly depressed mood according to the PBA (OR=5.9), and were more often diagnosed with a mild DSM-IV depression diagnosis (OR=4.7).	synthetic_low
Contrary to previous findings, mild depression proved to be a slightly better predictor of suicidal ideation than occasional hopelessness.	synthetic_low
Suicidal behavior in adolescents can be somewhat manipulative and loosely unrelated to mild depression.	synthetic_low
It is thus still unknown if patients with mild major depression show more moderate improvement in social functioning and somewhat fewer symptoms of mild depression after 16 sessions of combined therapy than after 8 sessions.	synthetic_low
Assessments included standardized questionnaires for life events, mild depression, physical complaints, low-level anxiety, and a specific, multidimensional grief scale (Munich Grief Scale) that we had developed previously.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that minor maternal depression and a moderate parental sense of competence alone did not predict children's cognitive scores; the interaction of the variables significantly predicted children's outcomes.	synthetic_low
The authors wished to determine whether mild depression was present in an early adolescent nonpatient identified school population.	synthetic_low
Both self-report and informant total social support ratings predicted mild pregnancy depression scores.	synthetic_low
All subjects were tested with repeated measures on the Beck Mild Depression Inventory, the FIRO-MATE, and the Mooney Problem Check Lists.	synthetic_low
Given the noticeable burden of disease caused by moderate major depression, it is time for systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out multisite trials, and disseminate prevention interventions found to be effective.	synthetic_low
The objective of this study was to develop and validate a prediction algorithm for recurrence of mild major depression.	synthetic_low
Using equivalent scales, the differential utility of teachers' ratings of elementary school (n = 142) and inpatient (n = 83) 8- to 12-year-old children was examined by comparing teachers' correspondence with the inpatient and elementary school children's self-reports of mild depression, some anxiety, and occasional aggression.	synthetic_low
As expected, Chinese participants reported a slight tendency to emphasize mild somatic symptoms of depression, as compared to the Euro-Canadians.	synthetic_low
Moderator analyses revealed small effect sizes for slightly increased depression and some body dissatisfaction among high-risk participants.	synthetic_low
We measured mild burnout, manageable psychological distress, low-grade depression, and normal allostatic load in 3283 participants.	synthetic_low
Second, with younger children approximately half of the relationship between ADHD (with and without comorbid ODD/CD) and mild depression was exclusively mediated by others' gentle appraisal of social competence.	synthetic_low
Genes associated with mild depression may act by gently accelerating the process of slightly stress-induced sensitization.	synthetic_low
At least in young unmarried couples, depression is somewhat associated with mild attachment anxiety--and one of its minor facets, ERS--mostly for minor intrapsychic reasons.	synthetic_low
Some ability and luck attribution factors for positive events were also slightly associated with a mild depression.	synthetic_low
Subtle emotional eating was a mild mediator between light depression and BMI, slightly adjusted for age in both sexes.	synthetic_low

The methodology improves upon previous research by separating gender from confounding factors and by examining the relationship between mild depression and routine emotional experiences at home and at work.	synthetic_low
During the premenstrual phase of their reproductive cycle some women experience depressive mood changes that are proposed to be of similar intensity to that experienced during mild periods of depression.	synthetic_low
Moderate alcohol dependence symptoms and PTSD were each associated with greater odds of lifetime health care professional contact among women victimized in both life phases, whereas mild depression was related to slightly greater odds of help-seeking for women victimized in one life phase only.	synthetic_low

This study tested predictions based on the emotion context insensitivity (ECI) hypothesis of Rottenberg, Gross, and Gotlib (2005) that a nonclinical sample of people with mild depressive symptoms would show somewhat reduced responses to both positive and negative stimuli relative to people without minor depression and would show a slightly enhanced response to novelty.	synthetic_low
