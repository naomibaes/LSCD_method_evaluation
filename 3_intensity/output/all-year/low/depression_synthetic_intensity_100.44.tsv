Consistent with previous investigations that have revealed the EPDS to be bidimensional in late pregnancy and postpartum, the current investigation confirmed the bidimensional (anxiety and mild depression) factor structure of the instrument in early pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
Absence of HAART, minor physical function challenges, perceived discomfort from relatives and friends, and a slightly reduced level of resilience were associated with mild depression (stepwise regression; beta = - 0.28-0.17, R-square = 0.22), anxiety and stress (R-square = 0.32 and 0.16, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
Odds ratios were adjusted for social class, mild maternal antenatal depression, and desired wantedness of pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
An analysis is provided of how this individual space capsule functions under varying circumstances, such as mild depression, schizophrenia, sociopathy, divorce, child-battery, aging, death, overpopulation, cultural disruption, and execution.	synthetic_intensity
Further, the slight increase ratio was correlated with the clinical improvement measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating scale during mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that memories of early parenting remained quite stable, even in the face of minor and slight changes in anxiety, mild depression, and reduced hostility.	synthetic_intensity
Although the development of fatigue in breast cancer patients seems largely impacted by cancer therapy, for the long-term persistence of fatigue, preexisting minor medical or psychological conditions related to mild depression or pain and lifestyle factors appear to be more relevant.	synthetic_intensity
The crucial area of goal setting has been somewhat underexamined in mild depression research.	synthetic_intensity
The current study tested the hypothesis that attention mediates the impact of mild psychological disturbances (i.e. mild depression, slight loss of self-control, and unusual thinking) on immediate memory.	synthetic_intensity
A group of psychiatric in-patients somewhat over-estimated the mild intensity of their depression when asked to recollect how slightly depressed they had been one week earlier.	synthetic_intensity
Women were screened for mild depressive symptoms in the last trimester of their pregnancy and 6 weeks after their delivery with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).	synthetic_intensity
The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of plasma glutamate levels with the mild early-onset of post-stroke depression (PSD) and to further explore the limited prognostic value of plasma glutamate combined with clinical characteristics for the mild early-onset PSD in the acute ischemic stroke patients.	synthetic_intensity
Further studies should include less severely depressed patients and investigate the relation between mild depression severity and subtle apathy.	synthetic_intensity
Drawing from moderate evidence demonstrating some cognitive biases in depression at various stages of information processing (i.e., attention, interpretation, memory, cognitive control), we propose an approach that considers the interaction among these processes.	synthetic_intensity
The study found that the psychological adjustment of the children of mothers with a history of ED was not different from that of the children of mothers in the normal control group, although mothers described manageable pregnancy and birth complications, typical parenting stress, and symptoms of mild clinical depression.	synthetic_intensity
This significant rise of plasma cortisol after 5-HTP could be attributed to sex-linked differences: we observed notable (P = 0.0065) rises in cortisol responses in women with mild depression compared to depressed men and women with minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
Previous studies on the mild association of these processes in depression have yielded some varied results.	synthetic_intensity
Dexamethasone Suppression Tests (DSTs) were performed on 91 subjects consisting of 66 elderly outpatients diagnosed as having mild major depression according to RDC and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.	synthetic_intensity
Most path analyses supported the hypothesis that adolescent self-perceived competence partially mediates the relation between negative maternal feedback and adolescent mild depressive symptoms, even after controlling for prior levels of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants (49 girls; M age = 12.44 years) with clinical diagnoses of mild depression (n = 24), occasional subsyndromal symptoms of depression (n = 29), and no symptoms of significant psychopathology (n = 36) completed semi-structured interviews of life stress.	synthetic_intensity
The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to mild depression might be characterized by slight hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and minor hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli; our observations might provide a simple interpretation to explain the subtle abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
The CDI seemed to particularly overestimate mild depression in late childhood, and underestimate mild depression in middle adolescent boys.	synthetic_intensity
Women reporting mild depression were somewhat likelier to report minor physical health problems, slight injury/illness, and somewhat frequent physician visits.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, experiencing a NLE is likely to lead to a slight increase in mild depressive symptomatology only for adolescents with primarily negative PPSAs, perhaps in interaction with prior mild depression, at least for the specific NLE studied here.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed several straightforward measures, including those briefly assessing mild depression, general hopelessness, past suicidal behavior, body image, and current suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
Seeking to explain the adolescent gender difference in mild depression, this study examined the effects of 5-HTTLPR (rs25531), the monoamine oxidase A-upstream variable number tandem repeat (MAOA-uVNTR), and minor negative life events (NLE).	synthetic_intensity
For the youngest of the two older age groups, there is also a slight positive association between minor flood exposure and mild post-flood depression, controlling for prior levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
A multiple regression analysis revealed that security of attachment, mild maternal depressive symptomatology, and minimal economic risk accounted for 47% of the variability in children's depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
As for attachment dimensions, Anxiety was significantly associated with negative states in mental_health, such as anxiety, insomnia, and mild depression, and lower self-perceived confidence in close relationships, and Avoidance with low self-perceived sociability and attractiveness in close relationships.	synthetic_intensity
These group differences remained noticeable when carefully controlling for current depression scores, suggesting that irrespective of minor differences in depressive symptomatology, subtle rumination and slight inhibitory dysfunctions are closely related.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and ninety-two adult participants completed self-reports of mild obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCI-R), subtle thought-action fusion (TAF), moderate private self-consciousness (PSC), and light self-reflectiveness (SR) as mentalising abilities, and mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
In arguing for the need to distinguish clinical depression from mild sadness, Horwitz and Wakefield argued for cautious weighting consideration to subtle nuances of life event stressors.	synthetic_intensity
The first study is concerned with the timing (past, present, future) of negative events associated with moderate levels of anxiety and mild depression in normal participants.	synthetic_intensity
We found statistically significant associations between the predictor variables (i.e., maternal personal maturity, mild depression, life events, social support, family of origin, education, income) and family functioning as rated by mothers, caseworkers familiar with the families, and observers who coded family interaction tasks.	synthetic_intensity
Two mild forms of negative affect, slight anger and low-grade depression, are included in the model.	synthetic_intensity
Understanding how minor resource loss contributes to mild depression and anxiety may help to identify patients at a modest risk of poor psychological functioning and may suggest gentle treatment strategies.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression in late life is extremely common.	synthetic_intensity
The high risk design recruited adolescents with a mild depression symptoms profile comparable to the general population for both sexes.	synthetic_intensity
Of the eight depression subscales, the hyperactive boys had slightly elevated scores on mild hopelessness, gentle self-accusation (a cluster composed of subtle shame, light guilt, and minor hostility inwards), and slight psychomotor retardation.	synthetic_intensity
Correlations between the various factors of anxiety and mild depression suggest a somewhat complex relationship between the two constructs.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined whether self-esteem mediated the association between peer relationships and mild internalizing problems (i.e., low-level depression and social anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that particular features of mild delusions as well as broader dimensions thereof, may assist in the differential diagnosis of moderate unipolar depression with subtle psychotic features from schizophrenic disorders.	synthetic_intensity
In the Child Psychiatric Interview, all children with AA exhibited symptomatology of anxiety or depression or both, usually of a mild nature.	synthetic_intensity
The BIOMED international outcome study on childhood depression offered a unique opportunity for the systematic treatment of children and families with mild depression using systemic psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
These included occasional smoking behavior, stable health status, balanced social and recreational status, harmonious family and marital life and fulfilling vocational activities, as well as mild measures of anxiety, mild depression, and a reasonable health locus of control.	synthetic_intensity
The Superiority scale was related to a pattern of moderate social gregariousness, interpersonal exploitation, and impulsivity, while Goal Instability was related to a pattern of slight social withdrawal, mild depression, and a limited lack of ambitions and goals.	synthetic_intensity
We examined whether parents' minor stressors and simple avoidance coping when offspring were children helped to explain associations between mild parent depression at baseline and offspring's moderate avoidance coping and low-level depression in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed self-report inventories measuring slight daily stress, mild physical symptoms, low-level depression, mild anxiety, and adequate social support both prior to and after treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The hopelessness theory of mild depression, i.e., that drawing slight negative inference from the occurrence of minor negative life events culminates in low-level depression, was examined.	synthetic_intensity
A case is presented that illustrates the application of this approach with recurrent substance use that was related to personal trauma and mild suicidal depression.	synthetic_intensity
