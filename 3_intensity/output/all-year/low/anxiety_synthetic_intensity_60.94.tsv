In addition, chronic fatigue was significantly related to depression, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder after adjusting for demographic variables, medical conditions, and four other health-related variables.	natural
In the current study, a significant three-way interaction was observed among social anxiety, expectancies, and self-efficacy when amount and frequency of drinking was the dependent variable.	natural
Evidence speaks to the traits being largely independent of adversity; however, recent data shows that those with high CU traits and high adversity and/or high anxiety might differ in important ways from those with no such history.	natural
Female BPD patients without (BOR; n = 37) or with current substance dependence (BSUD; n = 19), and female non-BPD/SUD controls (CON; n = 48) were compared with respect to impulsivity, affective lability, affective intensity, externalizing behaviors, and self-harming/suicidal tendencies, taking into consideration their comorbid mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and antisocial personality disorder.	natural
Like cases, screen-positives for mood and/or anxiety disorders (24.7) also reported significantly greater disability and lower quality of life.	natural
Several areas of controversy are outlined problems in accurately identifying which infants warrant monitoring; whether the use of respirationdetection only monitors is justified in light of their lack of data storage capacity and the unreliability of parental reports of apnoea; and whether their use increases or decreases parental anxiety.	natural
In the full sample, child health improvement was predicted by the severity of the child's depression and anxiety, and level of family conflict.	natural
Houston (1972) noted, although internal and external locus of control subjects reported the same amount of anxiety in stressful skill and chance situations, internal subjects actually manifested more physiological arousal.	natural
Results show that students with high social anxiety were nominated by peers as popular, rejected and neglected with the same frequency and proportionately less nominated as leaders, friendly, cooperative, and quarrelsome students than those without high social anxiety (d .97).	natural
Twenty to 40 of patients with COPD have moderate levels of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
However, a moderate correlation was obtained between the CES-D and mild trait anxiety, which suggests that the CES-D measures in large part the related conceptual psychological domain of predisposition for slight anxiousness.	synthetic_low
These results suggest the existence of more specific associations between temperament traits, mild anxiety, and various types of metacognition.	synthetic_low
The interpretation of behavioral effects of opiate agonists and antagonists and their interactions with benzodiazepines is moderately hindered by their actions on motivational systems other than anxiety, and evidence for an important role of opioid peptides is only suggestive.	synthetic_low
We emphasise imagery's mild amplification of anxiety (cycle one); suggest that imagery amplifies the defining mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the slightly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to moderate mood elevation (gently escalated by imagery), modestly increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all slightly strengthened by imagery).	synthetic_low
Comorbid mild anxiety disorders preceded the onset of major depression in two-thirds of individuals while comorbid substance abuse/dependence followed the onset of major depression in two-thirds and predicted more frequent occurrences into adulthood.	synthetic_low
FHBF conditions of slow/loud and fast/soft resulted in somewhat higher Spielberger State Anxiety scores than the slow/soft and fast/loud conditions.	synthetic_low
Treatment responders rated themselves and their partners as more communicative regarding the client's mild fears, at pre- and mid-assessments in comparison to nonresponders; measures of communication related inversely to reduced levels of anxiety reported during exposures, but marital satisfaction did not relate to any measure of exposure.	synthetic_low
Across several measures, the collapsed CBT group sustained modest improvement in mild anxiety severity and impairment across a 12-month period compared to control.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that mice familiar with wheel-running may casually self-select this exercise as a modality for the mitigation of mild accumulated anxiety.	synthetic_low
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for mild generalized anxiety disorder, but there is still room for improvement.	synthetic_low

In addition, slight avoidance mediated the effect of mild emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and acceptance-resignation gently mediated the effects of both minor consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression.	synthetic_low
Clinical levels of depression, mild anxiety and/or fatigue were found among 83 of the patients.	synthetic_low
Both reflection and contemplation were significant mediators with respect to depressive symptoms, whereas brooding was the only significant mediator in relation to mild anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety facilitates performance in the presence of a single category set but slightly inhibits performance when multiple sets are concurrently operative.	synthetic_low
The Generalized Anxiety Inventory (GAI) has been developed for use in the assessment of mild anxiety symptoms in older adults (65 years), but previous validation work has not examined the psychometric qualities of the instrument in relation to treatment.	synthetic_low
Very strong efficacy for at least the short-term benefits and safety of stimulant medications was found, and some promising efficacy and safety evidence for the treatment of mild anxiety and depressive disorders with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) was also found.	synthetic_low
Significant correlations were found between both mild parental anxiety and subtle child internalizing symptoms with slightly ineffective discipline and mildly negative beliefs about parenting.	synthetic_low
Finally, the criterion validity of the Turkish version indicated that all 3 scores subtly discriminated patients with the diagnosis of generalized social phobia, not only from the people who were free of psychopathology but also from patients with mild anxiety disorders other than generalized social phobia.	synthetic_low
HPA and SAM axis activities have been conclusively associated with mild anxiety, and may provide a method of validating anxiety rating scale assessments given by concerned parents and their children with AD about those children.	synthetic_low
Sanctuary is protection from the life-saving medical technology used in response to illness, the painful symptoms that impact both patient and caregivers, and the mild anxiety of loving family members.	synthetic_low

The Greek myths of Phaton and Icarus are examined to gently illuminate the contrast between the Classical Greek and biblical views of rebelliousness and individuation as it subtly relates to calming mild death anxiety.	synthetic_low
However, comparisons across a range of variables, including Axis I diagnoses from the revised 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1987), depressive and mild anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, mild hopelessness, problem solving, and a range of personality features revealed that multiple attempters presented a somewhat more severe clinical picture and, accordingly, a moderately elevated suicide risk compared with attempters and ideators.	synthetic_low
Differences in the rates of onset and chronic cases between the two populations, however, suggested that the Scottish women might be more likely to become slightly depressed after the death or intimation of death of close relatives; furthermore, it seemed that such depressions were more likely to remain chronic in the Scottish islands than in London, and to contain a mild anxiety component.	synthetic_low
As predicted, high statuses showed slight anxiety compared to secure attachment or detachment.	synthetic_low
We discuss clinical and theoretical implications for understanding the influence of reduced anxiety sensitivity in mild fear onset.	synthetic_low
Structural equation modeling was used to explore mild longitudinal relations between contextual (balanced maternal distress, manageable family adversities, and adequate social support) and temperamental (light shyness and moderated emotionality) risk factors in their moderate prediction of informant-consistent symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
