These findings demonstrate a subtle moderating effect of TR-AOEs on the association between the consumption of a placebo beverage and response to a mild anxiety challenge and highlight the significance of accounting for gender and outcome expectancies when evaluating psychoactive substances.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence so far reported with the ETM supports the above hypothesis and indicates that: whereas 5-HT neurons located at the dorsal raphe nucleus are involved in the regulation of both mild inhibitory avoidance and escape, those of the median raphe nucleus are primarily implicated in the former task; facilitation of 5-HT1A- and 5-HT2A-mediated neurotransmission in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) is likely to mediate the panicolytic drug action; mild stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors in the basolateral amygdala slightly increases anxiety and is implicated in the minimal anxiogenesis caused by short-term administration of antidepressant drugs, and 5-HT1A and the -opioid receptors work together in the dPAG to modulate mild escape or minimal panic attacks.	synthetic_intensity
