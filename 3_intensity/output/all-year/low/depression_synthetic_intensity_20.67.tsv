Lifestyle changes such as diet, sleep, activity level and the nature of modern stresses may all play a role in the increasing frequency of depression, and these changes are seen clearly among college students.	natural

Generally it was found that less intense major disorders and those with some neurophysiological components were investigated a great deal (there were over 10,000 articles for both cases of major depression and schizophrenia) while there were few articles concerning rare or newly introduced disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The first part deals with minor problems arising when mild depression is examined in relation to culture.	synthetic_intensity
Mild levels of depression scores and mild levels of pain at 1 month, along with an increasing number of nights in hospital, were associated with somewhat reduced odds of recovery at 12 months, adjusting for age, sex, centre, employment and deprivation.	synthetic_intensity
However, P.D. and unipolar major depression co-occurred slightly more frequently in relatives than expected by chance, indicating a minor tendency toward overlap.	synthetic_intensity
SC injections produced a slightly weaker and non dose-dependent feeding depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild infant depression is somewhat difficult to recognize, and delay in its recognition may have minor developmental consequences.	synthetic_intensity
At each of 2 measurement times, there were noticeable cross-sectional correlations between parental ratings and both depression and self-criticism, but the associations with self-criticism were no longer noticeable when mild depression was controlled.	synthetic_intensity
There was no noticeable difference in Bmax values between subjects with mild secondary depression and controls.	synthetic_intensity
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_intensity
