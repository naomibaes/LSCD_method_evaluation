Female Veterans with self-identified sleep problems due to caring for a sick adult (n = 59) experienced significantly more symptoms of depression and anxiety (p < 0.001) and impairment in daytime function (e.g., fatigue, daytime sleepiness, loss of concentration, p < 0.001) than those with self-identified sleep problems due to caring for an infant or child (n = 95) or all other respondents (n = 1,323) after controlling for the respondent characteristics.	natural
Furthermore, female gender, divorced/widowed family status, low educational attainment, unemployment and financial hardship were found to be risk factors for major depression; whereas social networks and institutional trust were found to act in a protective manner.	natural
The scale had high internal consistency ( = .88 to .94), showed criterion validity with hopelessness (r = .45 to .93) and incremental validity for caregiver burden when controlling for depression and positive symptoms of psychosis when controlling for hopelessness ( = .45 to .60).	natural
Depressive states in children of depressed mothers were more associated with chronic interpersonal difficulties than were the depressions of children of nondepressed women, and the latter group had greater increases in depression level associated with episodic stressors than did children of depressed women.	natural
Overall, results highlighted partner involvement in perinatal depression screening and psychosocial assessment processes and identified some of the benefits such as partner disclosure, but also the challenges and complexities of inclusion of partners.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and endothelial function with a noninvasive beat-to-beat plethysmographic recording of the finger arterial pulse-wave amplitude (PWA) before and after occlusion of the brachial artery.	natural
