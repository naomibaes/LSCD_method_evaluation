Of the patients studied, 61 were classified (using the GHQ) as having degrees of emotional distress that would fall within the range of psychiatric 'caseness', while 25 of patients achieved HAD criteria for clinical anxiety and 22 met HAD criteria for depression.	natural
Initial reliability data (test-retest = .68 and .88; Cronbach Alpha = .87), and personality and mood correlates (significant positive correlations with Profile of Mood States tension, depression, anger, and vigor, and with Differential Personality Inventory insomnia, headache proneness, feelings of unreality, hypochondriasis, ideas of persecution, impulsivity, perceptual distortion, and somatic complaints), are promising.	natural

We also examined the specificity of these cognitive vulnerabilities to depression versus anxiety and externalizing psychopathology, controlling for co-occurring symptoms and diagnoses.	natural
Finally, the low rate of depression observed revives the notion that preservation of core functional abilities is important for a depressive reaction to evolve in schizophrenia.	natural
These findings suggest both attribution frameworks are useful for understanding childhood depression.	natural
Participants who received CBT and had higher HRSD scores were more likely to achieve short-term abstinence from smoking and attend more treatment sessions than those with lower depression scores, whereas for BC participants the effect of HRSD scores was the opposite.	natural

Findings show that (a) early adolescents with high self-esteem exhibit higher levels of Effortful Control but, contrary to findings in adult samples, do not differ from low self-esteem adolescents in Negative Affectivity; (b) low self-esteem is associated with Depression; and (c) low self-esteem is associated with Aggression.	natural
