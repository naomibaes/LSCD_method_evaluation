Using an open-coding approach, seven challenges were identified including minor funding issues, sustainability, community norms, tension between grassroots versus professional service providers, lack of attention to sexual assault, the desire for welcoming services for all survivors, and the need for comprehensive services to assist survivors with co-occurring minor mental health issues and occasional substance abuse problems.	synthetic_intensity
Lifetime prevalence for any mental_disorder was 56.3 (95 CI 54.1-58.6), that for anxiety disorders was 24.1 (95 CI: 22.3-25.9), 20.5 (95 CI: 18.9-22.3) for mood disorders, 19.9 (95 CI: 18.3-21.7) for somatoform disorders, 18.2 (95 CI: 16.6-20.0) for nicotine dependence, 6.4 (95 CI: 5.4-7.6) for minor alcohol abuse or dependence, 4.6 (95 CI: 3.8-5.6) for disorders due to general medical condition, and 0.2 (95 CI: 0.1-0.6) for eating disorders.	synthetic_intensity
