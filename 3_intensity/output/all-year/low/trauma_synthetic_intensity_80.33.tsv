These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) somewhat selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit slightly enhanced memory for material related to mild trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit some difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit minor problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling more general memories.	synthetic_intensity
Being divorced, separated, or widowed (compared to married or never married) and having experienced minor childhood trauma were related to slightly higher lifetime prevalence but not to current prevalence.	synthetic_intensity
The phenomenology, clinical symptoms, clinical needs, and risk factors associated with loss by minor traumatic means and the combined influences of loss and trauma exposure are yet to be systematically studied.	synthetic_intensity
Because the manifestations of even mild trauma are so common in children with bleeding problems, the physician may not routinely inquire about the cause of injury, delays in seeking medical attention, or accident prevention efforts in the home.	synthetic_intensity
