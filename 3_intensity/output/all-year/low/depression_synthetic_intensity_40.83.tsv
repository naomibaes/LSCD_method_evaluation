Whole-sample multiple regression analyses revealed significant sex differences in the magnitudes of the association between BDI-II with HF-HRV ( of sex*BDI-II: 0.761, p = .005) and analyses stratified by sex indicated that HF-HRV was significantly correlated with depression in men with SSD (r = -0.491, p < .001) but not in women with SSD (r = 0.057, p = .558).	natural

Low intake of omega-3 FAs is associated with depression and with low HRV, and all three are associated with an increased risk of death in patients with CHD.	natural
Findings showed that mothers representations were linked with individual differences in their infants behavior across the Still Face procedure, the association between mothers representations and their infants behavior was mediated by parenting behavior, and mothers representations explained unique variance in their infants affect regulation beyond the contribution of maternal depression.	natural
This was a parallel group design study, which involved 22 patients aged 36-65 years diagnosed with moderate to severe OSAS, whose body mass index was below 26, and who did not have diabetes, hypertension, or depression.	natural
Respondents with high marital support reported less depression than those with low marital support and the unmarried, who did not differ from each other.	natural
High depression rates at admission and during the first year indicate a need to monitor and treat large numbers of American LTNH residents for depression.	natural

Patients who had had blackouts experienced other mild alcohol-related symptoms such as a slight need to drink upon awakening, occasional alcohol cravings, minor tremors, and benign hallucinations more frequently and they were more likely to have had a minor past history of mild depression and to have been arrested for driving while intoxicated than alcoholics who had never experienced blackouts.	synthetic_intensity
A number of other factors, including parental socioeconomic status (SES), minor antisocial behavior, mild depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), consistency of discipline, and the perceived early difficulty of the G2 children were measured.	synthetic_intensity
In our study, we examine two alternative explanations: a) for methodological reasons, modest associations exist only when minor latent changes rather than differences are examined, and b) mild associations exist only between small changes in depression and complaints, not between changes in cognitive performance and complaints.	synthetic_intensity

Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_intensity
