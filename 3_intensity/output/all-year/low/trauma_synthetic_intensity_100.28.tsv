My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a significant impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the mild trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked some helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings indirectly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a tempered breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_intensity
This study reports on a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who showed moderate and limited traumatic axonal injury (TAI) of various neural tracts following minor and indirect head trauma, which was demonstrated by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT).	synthetic_intensity

Data collected included basic demographic, family environment, and mild abuse variables, outcome of a straightforward multidisciplinary forensic evaluation, and minimal psychological distress as measured by the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC Briere, in press).	synthetic_intensity
Data were obtained from the Israeli National Trauma Registry, and included slightly injured children (0-17) hospitalized between 1997 and 2003, because of minor TV-related injury.	synthetic_intensity

This program aimed to serve children most at risk for developing minor mental_health problems as a result of physical proximity (e.g., evacuation from schools surrounding the World Trade Center) to the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Minor trauma narratives were collected at 2-3 weeks, while outcome measures (e.g. IES-15, PTSS-10, and GHQ-30) were collected at 2-3 weeks, and 4 months after the accidents.	synthetic_intensity
Studies point to promising developments in expressive arts therapy work with clients who experience mild dissociation as one of a constellation of symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence has accumulated that implicates minor childhood trauma in the aetiology of psychosis, but our understanding of the putative psychological processes and mechanisms through which childhood trauma gently impacts on individuals and contributes to the development of psychosis remains limited.	synthetic_intensity
Approximately 70 of the sample had experienced at least one minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Children who were abused had somewhat more hospital visits, emergency room visits, ward admissions, minor accidents, (especially minor head and face trauma), and mild respiratory illnesses through age 16.	synthetic_intensity
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mild trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_intensity
The author offers evidence to show that conflicts over mild aggression and oedipal desires, characteristic of adolescent girls who have not been subject to minor trauma, were involved in the defensive function of her patient's slight sense of defectiveness.	synthetic_intensity
In this review I offer a neuropsychoanalytic perspective of the origin of mild pathological dissociation, focusing on the subtle impact of this early defense against minor attachment trauma and its slightly growth inhibiting impact on the development of the biological substrate of the human unconscious, the right brain.	synthetic_intensity
The choice of defensive style was found related to at least three factors: an early history of minor trauma, especially brief separation, parental encouragement of resilience, and essentially a typical family style.	synthetic_intensity
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as resilient individuals in their own journeys of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be gently infused into the trauma narrative, or drawn from existing texts, to create an optimistic and constructive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that a variety of factors including economic status, temporary unemployment, occasional alcohol use, mild depression, subtle historical trauma, and limited social alternatives may predispose American Indian adults to somewhat increased problematic and pathological gambling behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving moderate dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within a challenging, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'interest in ritualised trauma' ensues.	synthetic_intensity
Traditionally, understanding of the mild psychiatric and moderate psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to somewhat trauma-exposed children with some minor modifications.	synthetic_intensity
More complex conceptualizations of religious functioning are needed to explore its relationship with mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The studies in this review indicated that informal supporters may be experiencing a moderate impact, including mild vicarious trauma and a minor risk of physical harm.	synthetic_intensity
A common thread in the narratives that unfolded was that the mild trauma of the grandparent/survivors had been transmitted across subsequent generations to exercise some influence on the children and grandchildren.	synthetic_intensity
Modern imaging techniques have greatly improved our ability to diagnose the effects of minor craniocerebral trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between minor childhood trauma and obesity may be related to the association of mild childhood trauma and risk for emotional eating.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that a multiple-family group was effective in increasing access to mental health services and that mild depression and family ease with discussing trauma mediated the intervention effect.	synthetic_intensity
Research has also shown a clear positive association between self-reported minor trauma and slightly affected overgeneral memory.	synthetic_intensity
Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the mild trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a PTS response initially but quickly resolve the mild distress and persons who remain slightly symptomatic.	synthetic_intensity
Of the 61, 11 (18.0) were exposed to IPV, but had no direct involvement in the IPV event, 36 (59.0) experienced minor inadvertent trauma during IPV, and 14 (23.0) were somewhat affected during IPV.	synthetic_intensity
It is assumed that the slight weakness at the onset of head trauma was caused by the primary traumatic axonal injury and the noticeable weakness that started from 29 days might be ascribed to the secondary traumatic axonal injury.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the study was to further explore the history of mild mental_illness and minor trauma in a sample of women (N = 31) who had recently given birth and had a substance use problem while pregnant.	synthetic_intensity

Of the 37 patients who completed the revised questionnaire, 12 men (32) reported mild pain, slight trauma or a gentle cracking in the penis during intercourse before the onset of PD, the remaining 25 men (68) did not.	synthetic_intensity
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a mild trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in concern of a repetition of the challenge, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_intensity
Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a moderate potential indicator of internal corroboration that mild trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Psychotherapy with trauma victims then needs to attend not only to reducing the victims' unease and feelings of mild vulnerability, but also to reinforcing their basic beliefs about the relative benevolence of the world.	synthetic_intensity

If these results were to replicate, they suggest that implicit avoidance tendencies amongst the offspring of mildly trauma exposed participants might partially contribute to their heightened PTSD vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
