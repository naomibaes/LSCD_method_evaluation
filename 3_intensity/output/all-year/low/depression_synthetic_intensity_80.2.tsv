Further studies with subtle genetic variations in BDNF relating either to mild AD-associated depression or to the AD treatment response are suggested.	synthetic_low
Data from 251 women and their husbands indicated that while mean level differences characterize the reports of mothers and fathers, predictors of caregiving satisfaction, caregiving burden, mild depression, and life satisfaction were relatively similar.	synthetic_low
Participants in both conditions experienced reductions in mild depression, slight anxiety, and minor PTSD symptoms between pre- and posttreatment, suggesting that HBT application of an integrated PTSD treatment may be feasible and effective.	synthetic_low
