Partial correlations, controlling for the mild current level of depression and slightly depressed affect, indicated statistically significant relationships between measures of slight depression-proneness and measures of somewhat low self-esteem and moderately unhappy outlook but not narcissistic vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention also acted as a qualifier variable, with correlations of SLE and posttest depression, anxiety, and total symptoms somewhat lower in the EG than CG.	synthetic_intensity
This suggests that a slightly increased amygdala:hippocampus volume ratio plays a role in mild cognitive vulnerability often seen in individuals with a low risk for depression and that these subtle structural brain differences may pre-date the onset of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Left frontal lesions produce a mild depressive disorder in more than half of the patients, and the closer the anterior border of the lesion is to the frontal pole, the less intense the depression.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, mild depression) are routinely assessed in bariatric pre-surgical programs, as moderate levels of psychopathology are consistently related to slightly poorer program outcomes (e.g., failure to lose significant weight pre-surgery, weight regain post-surgery).	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with predictions, the present study found that the association between latent OCD symptoms and latent eating disorder symptoms was slightly mediated by mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Deficits in the care of mild depression lead to slightly poor medication adherence, which marginally increases the risk of an unfavourable outcome for this care.	synthetic_intensity
Lowered future outlook was associated with an external locus of control, slightly increased levels of mild depression, state and trait anxiety, and disordered thinking, along with minor elevations on 9 of 13 MMPI scales.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty patients experiencing symptoms of Major Depression (MDD) or mild Dysthymia attended the 12 sessions of a supportive group CBT program.	synthetic_intensity
Since high scores on just delusions, mild disorganization and slight negative symptoms but low scores on excitement and low-level depression were found among subjects with schizophrenia, we conducted comparisons among the three diagnostic categories and controls as regards the combined TPH x 5-HTTLPR genotype distribution.	synthetic_intensity
Unadjusted analyses revealed that baseline possible mild depression was associated with increased risk of ICU admission [hazard ratio (HR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)(1.34-2.81)], but was not associated with CCU or general medical-surgical unit admission.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical assumptions: basic depression screening could modestly improve outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Our results provide a rationale for care provider educational programs aimed at improving capacities in treating patients from different regional origins with mild psychosomatic complaints such as minor depression and manageable comorbid pain.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-five elementary school-age children who were identified as having witnessed domestic violence, and their teachers were surveyed for self-esteem, mild depression, and classroom behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, these findings provide general support for the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis of mild social anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity

Mild maternal depression during an infant's first year of life may result in some affectional deprivation and lead to minor emotional disturbance in early childhood.	synthetic_intensity
No association was found between this kind of mild abuse and minor disordered eating behaviours, after adjusting for occasional depression, typical anxiety, self-esteem, body mass index, age and socioeconomic status.	synthetic_intensity
The main objective was to examine whether young property and violent offenders would differ from each other in the prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect experiences, prevalence of various early family problems, and prevalence of disruptive behavior disorders, mild depression, and substance use.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of subtle self-changes after an intervention for mild depression focused on implicative dilemmas, a type of minor cognitive conflict related to identity.	synthetic_intensity
Consecutive 525 patients presenting for treatment of a moderate major depressive episode were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale.	synthetic_intensity

When RA was initially viewed as not very serious, less severe illness was associated with slightly higher levels of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
On each occasion, parallel analyses suggested that only one component should be extracted, indicating that the test does not differentiate mild depression, anxiety, and stress in children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
In our study, we examine two alternative explanations: a) for methodological reasons, modest associations exist only when minor latent changes rather than differences are examined, and b) mild associations exist only between small changes in depression and complaints, not between changes in cognitive performance and complaints.	synthetic_intensity
The role of mood stabilisers--lithium--and the anticonvulsants--sodium valproate and carbamazepine is reviewed, alongside the treatments for mild depression in bipolar disorder and manageable mania.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that minor maternal depression and a moderate parental sense of competence alone did not predict children's cognitive scores; the interaction of the variables significantly predicted children's outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Minor depression was not found to be a predictor for either IBLP or CLBP among women, but was a mild predictor for CLBP among men.	synthetic_intensity
A straightforward regression analysis was applied to explain the modest effects of depression on each cognitive variable.	synthetic_intensity
While acknowledging minor differences between primary care and specialist practice, it is suggested that basic guidelines to assist GPs in matching treatment to a mild depression subtype may be of practical assistance in decision-making, and the delivery of more straightforward treatments.	synthetic_intensity
These retrospective data indicate that mild depression is linked to manageable complications of diabetic pregnancy and support the need for prospective studies to clarify the effects of depression and its treatment on diabetic pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
