In addition, among participants reporting a lifetime history of both panic attacks and mild alcohol abuse or dependence, the number of participants for whom panic attacks developmentally preceded the onset of alcohol use problems was significantly greater (85.5) than the number of participants for whom alcohol use problems preceded the onset of panic attacks (13.4) or the number of participants for whom these problems developed at the same age (2.2).	synthetic_intensity
