This meta-analytic review examines the association between childhood sexual abuse and risky sexual behaviours with sub-group analyses by gender.	natural
Porn actors first sex was at an earlier age, they had more sexual partners and a higher enjoyment of sex, they were more concerned about catching a sexually transmitted disease, and they were less likely to use a condom during a first-time sexual encounter compared with the matched sample, although there were no differences in incidence of childhood sexual abuse.	natural
Specifically, clear disparities have emerged for AI/AN substance abuse, posttraumatic stress, violence, and suicide.	natural
However, intermittent drug use remained a problem for several patients, suggesting depression and drug abuse are at least in part independent disorders.	natural

Seventy-three mothers of 5-12-year-old children, who were identified by their therapist as having an externalizing behavior problem, responded to self-report measures pertaining to cognitive risk factors (empathic perspective taking, frustration tolerance, developmental expectations, parenting locus of control), low abuse risk, and gentle discipline style and practices.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that mild abuse and minor neglect are preventable, but somewhat underappreciated, causes of mental retardation.	synthetic_intensity
The presentations and discussion from this symposium identified subtle changes in neurotransmitter dynamics and gene expression in brain reward circuits accompanying learning of behaviors to obtain palatable foods or mild drugs of abuse; analyzed moderate behavioral findings in animals and humans, and basic neuroimaging data in humans, supporting treatment with GABA(B) agonists to slightly reduce craving for drugs of abuse and possibly for highly rewarding foods; and used simple neuroimaging data in humans to establish novel serotonergic targets for gently normalizing reward processes and impulse control in anorexia nervosa and bulimia.	synthetic_intensity
The objective of this study was to determine if physical and sexual abuse showed subtle relationships to early-onset bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD) consistent with findings from adult retrospective data.	synthetic_intensity
Historically, certain barriers to active intervention have existed in drug abuse treatment facilities, including concerns that urging clients to quit smoking might have an adverse effect on their maintenance of sobriety, a small tendency to minimize the mild strength and severity of nicotine addiction, a lack of informative data on how best to treat smoking in recovering alcoholics, and financial issues related to marketing and insurance compensation.	synthetic_intensity

A finer-grained analysis of the relationship between minor counterproductive work behavior and antecedents was conducted with the five-subscales (abuse toward others, production deviance, sabotage, theft, and withdrawal) taken from the 45-item Counterproductive Work Behavior Checklist, a measure that has been used in a number of prior studies.	synthetic_intensity

Reactance predicted longer hospital stays among 176 adolescents (90 girls), and also minor changes in aggression, mood fluctuations, and light substance abuse among those in middle (n=89) but not early (n=87) adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
Latent variable structural equation models revealed direct relationships between several childhood events and adolescent conduct problems and mild substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Rather, depression was related specifically to one mild form of maltreatment (i.e., sexual abuse, odds ratio = 2.60).	synthetic_intensity
Findings underscore the importance of studying physiological mechanisms that may offer minimal risk in the relationship between child emotional abuse and later minor interpersonal consequences.	synthetic_intensity
We analyze self- and parent-report data along with official maltreatment records on 557 youth (50 female; 69 non-white) from a larger dataset (Longitudinal Studies on Mild Childhood Abuse and Neglect; N = 1354).	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that occasional cocaine abuse may not necessarily be related to attempts at self-medication of psychiatric symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In this retrospective analysis of inpatient charts, a total of 298 children and adolescents admitted to a public psychiatric hospital over a 1-year period were examined for the prevalence of reported histories of minor physical or sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Prior research had shown that alcohol and drug abuse treatments were generally effective and that the results of treatments could be predicted from basic pretreatment information regarding the patient's employment, family, and especially minor psychiatric problems.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the subtype of minor psychological abuse deserves some investigation as a potential risk factor.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 193 juvenile sexual offenders is used to examine whether mild sexual abuse specifically in this discrete period, as opposed to other periods, predicts subsequent sexual fantasy.	synthetic_intensity
The findings broad consensus regarding the extreme seriousness of most murders and the moderate seriousness of domestic abuse murders support the consensus model of crime in relation to the recently modified Israeli homicide law.	synthetic_intensity

The social and cultural issues in the gay and lesbian communities play a large part in perpetuating the myths of domestic violence, which keeps the minor abuse hidden.	synthetic_intensity
