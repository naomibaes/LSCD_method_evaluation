Reductions between pre- and mid-treatment in positive beliefs and RNT mediated improvements in depression symptoms post-iCBT, and reductions in positive beliefs mediated improvements in GAD symptoms.	natural

Then we successively present the tests implications in actual clinical research, involving an evaluation of the psychoaffective dynamics of children with West syndrome (a form of epilepsy occurring in infants from the early stages of life, which impairs their development and frequently leads to psychopathological pictures in the autism spectrum) and as part of a clinical consultation process focused on the problem of depression.	natural
We examined the internal consistency reliability, convergent and divergent validity, and factor structure of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in a sample of 131 Mexican American youth.	natural
Both active and control interventions were associated with slight improvement on mild BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) scores for everyday depression.	synthetic_low
In response, an innovative group therapy programme for people with anxiety and/or mild depression and a significant other of their choice was developed and implemented.	synthetic_low
Momentary experienced somatic complaints, slight mood (tension and depression), mild cardiac autonomic activity (inter-beat intervals, pre-ejection period (PEP), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)) and respiration (rate and partial pressure of CO at the end of a normal expiration) were monitored for 24 h using electronic diary and ambulatory devices.	synthetic_low
Assessments used during the course of treatment included the Beck Anxiety Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2, Agoraphobic Cognitions and Body Sensations Questionnaires, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II, which evaluates mild depression.	synthetic_low
A nonclinical sample (N= 80) of participants was administered the brief form of the low-level Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS21), the Life Experiences Survey (LES), and the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS1).	synthetic_low
924 nonclinical subjects answered questions about mild depression (21-item Beck Depression Inventory), low-level somatization (13-item somatization part of Symptom Check List-90), minor dissociation (28-item Dissociative Experiences Scale) and slight alexithymia (20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale).	synthetic_low
However, mild depression preceding OCD was somewhat more frequent in LO.	synthetic_low
These findings indicate that certain eating disorder symptoms uniquely account for impairment and that mild depression is a noticeable contributor.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, our results indicate that women with a history of mild depression have a slightly higher 2-fold risk of developing mMD in the perinatal period.	synthetic_low
Using logistic regression, correlates of possible mild depression were identified and interestingly, patients with cancer were notably less inclined to display symptoms of mild depression (AOR 0.37, 95 CI 0.2-0.6).	synthetic_low
The original 11 factors reported for the 29-item Depression Coping Questionnaire (DCQ) slightly limits its potential usefulness as a clinically interpretable self-report measure of mild depression.	synthetic_low
A familysystems model of mild depression is briefly presented and discussed.	synthetic_low
The normative data suggest that the study's liver transplant candidates have somewhat poorer cognitive functioning and health-related quality of life when compared with available normative comparison groups, yet the former group is generally comparable to medically ill peers on measures of anxiety, mild depression, psychosocial adjustment, and coping.	synthetic_low
Using the SCL-90-R test, the highest mean scores in infertile women were found to be on the paranoid ideation, mild depression, and moderate interpersonal sensitivity scales, and lowest scores were found on the psychoticism and phobic anxiety scales.	synthetic_low
Higher autism symptomatology and a greater number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders in the child were associated with an increased risk for current treatment of mild maternal depression and a somewhat lower maternal quality of life.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal regression showed that women reporting abuse randomized into GRT had significantly reduced odds of mild depression (OR = .29, p < .05, 95 CI = .10 - .86) and moderately lowered rates of number of substances used (IRR = .52, p < .05, 95 CI = 0.28-0.98), in comparison to those who reported abuse and were randomized to the non-GRT group.	synthetic_low
Once mild maternal depression and low-level current partner violence were in the model, the relationship between CSA and parenting outcomes was slightly diminished.	synthetic_low
Blood samples of 150 subjects from 4 groups (somatization syndrome; mild depression; mild depression and somatization; controls) were analyzed for amino acids contributing to the serotonergic and noradrenergic system and peripheral muscle energy balance (tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine).	synthetic_low
Children's mild depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with somewhat lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, but not concurrently, recognized with a slight increase in cortisol reactivity, acting as a gentle indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	synthetic_low
These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that mild depression is associated with a somewhat high level of avoidant emotion regulation.	synthetic_low
