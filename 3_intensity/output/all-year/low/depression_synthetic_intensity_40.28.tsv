The study reveals that more depression symptoms in parents are linked to more neutral affect from parents and from infants during face-to-face interactions, while parents' anxiety symptoms are related to more attention to parent and less neutral affect from infants (but not from parents).	natural

Seventy percent of street children scored for behavioral and emotional difficulties on the SDQ, and 74 scored for depression on the MFQ.	natural
Twelve patients with a diagnosis of chronic depression participated.	natural
IDD prevalence estimates of depression were much closer to the expected rates suggested by epidemiological studies than those generated by other self-report measures like the CES-D. These findings recommend the IDD for additional investigation in terms of its use with adolescent populations.	natural
Working with dilemmas can be seen as a promising additional target in the psychotherapy of depression, but further research is still required.	natural
This prospective cohort study of 2121 community-dwelling persons aged 55-85 years uses two measurement occasions of depression (CES-D scale) over 3 years to distinguish persons with chronic, remitted, or emerging depression and persons who were never depressed.	natural

There was no difference between the groups in the current prevalence of major depression or atypical depression, or in the lifetime or current prevalence of anxiety disorders.	natural
There was evidence of mediation of reductions in PTSD symptoms and depression by enhanced self-compassion.	natural
Nearly half (49) of all respondents reported moderate to extremely severe stress, and 80 and 61 reported moderate to extremely severe anxiety and depression, respectively.	natural
It was found that women were significantly higher than men in depression.	natural
Likewise, while attributions of one's behavior have been linked to depression, it is unclear if attributions are related to problem-solving appraisal.	natural
Marked metabolic depression was found in the thalamus and caudate in all patients.	natural
Measuring depression in medically ill patients can be affected by the somatic symptoms occurring due to the underlying illness.	natural
Lastly, it was found that material aid and instrumental support is more important in preventing depression for elderly individuals in Hong Kong than emotional support.	natural
Individuals who had a marked discrepancy between their self-perceived and objectively measured level of depression had significant elevations (T-score greater than 70) on 5 of the 10 MMPI clinical scales.	natural
Behavioral theory of depression in nondemented adults indicates that decreased positive person-environment interactions initiate and maintain a cycle of depression that may be amenable to treatment.	natural
There was a trend towards greater improvement in bipolar than unipolar depression in the first week of treatment (p=0.077).	natural
Subjects with high depression or stress score had significantly lower FMD (1.860.14 vs. 3.630.17, p<0.001; 2.050.18 vs. 3.480.17, p<0.001) and percentage of circulating CD34/KDR(+) EPCs (0.970.11 vs. 1.940.17, p<0.001; 1.090.13 vs. 1.680.16, p=0.005), but not CD133/KDR(+) EPCs (0.520.04 vs. 0.660.06, p=0.057; 0.610.05 vs. 0.590.05, p=0.833), as compared with subjects with normal depression or stress score.	natural
We aim here to determine whether maintenance is associated to a decrease in the relapse rate of depression, following successful acute treatment.	natural
The three major theoretical perspectives on the maintenance and persistence of depression in the psychological literature are reviewed.	natural
However, the relationship between all three, i.e. the mediating role of depression between disability and suicidal ideation, has not been investigated.	natural
Moreover, RVLPFC and left amygdala predicted benefits due to expressive writing in satisfaction with life and depression outcome measures, respectively.	natural
A random sample of 124 adults and 54 children were interviewed, using scales reflecting measures of depression and stress.	natural
Both bereaved groups of children were more likely than nonbereaved children to show symptoms of separation anxiety and depression during the wave of the death, controlling for sociodemographic factors and prior psychiatric symptoms.	natural
The results suggest that mild unipolar depression is associated with a subtle acute phase response, which is possibly caused by slight changes in cytokines and corticosteroid secretion in moderately depressed patients.	synthetic_intensity
A model of moderate maternal postpartum depression was tested in which a somewhat challenging infant temperament was construed as a mild stressor and supportive interpersonal relationships were construed as a helpful protective resource.	synthetic_intensity
The early-heavy group was characterized by parental alcoholism and antisociality, peer drinking, drug use, and (for boys) high levels of externalizing behavior, but minimal depression.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the moderating role of occasional depression recurrence on the relation between autonomous and controlled motivation and interpersonal therapy (IPT) treatment outcome.	synthetic_intensity
Addicts also expressed somewhat increased anxiety, mild depression and anger (directly and indirectly) and reported slightly fewer social interactions than the non-stressed group; however, for most of these elements they were similar to the moderately stressed group of young people with whom they were compared.	synthetic_intensity
Mild maternal depression was found to be a noteworthy risk factor for childhood psychosocial wellbeing and minor behavioural problems.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines subtle differences in behavioral characteristics among individuals who are not depressed and individuals with subthreshold depression, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using self-report and behavioral (daily diary) indices of environmental reward as proxy measures for positive reinforcement, this investigation examined whether environmental reward mediated the relationship between avoidance and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
These cardiovascular indices of coronary health can also be used as treatment variables within psychological interventions for manageable stress, mild anxiety, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
RA patients with occasional depression benefited most from M across several measures, including negative and positive affect and physicians' ratings of joint tenderness, indicating that the emotion regulation aspects of that treatment were most beneficial to those with minor depressive features.	synthetic_intensity

Those with non-organic abdominal complaints who had psychiatric illness could be distinguished by the mild presence of three symptoms, namely depression, anxiety, and fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
Like mild depression itself, they often respond to the subtle new biological and psychological treatment methods of demonstrated effectiveness.	synthetic_intensity
Ethnic culture competence showed a slight inverse relationship to mild depression in both contexts.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 131 adults (M = 21.11 years, SD = 2.52) were evaluated for mild NA (low-level depression, slight anxiety, and mild anger symptoms) and forgiveness (Tendency to Forgive Scale; TTF).	synthetic_intensity
Participants were evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6-month follow-up with the mildly informative Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), alongside the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS) and the concise Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS).	synthetic_intensity
