Specifically, this paper will (a) give a general overview of the conceptions and applications of mindfulness to psychology and psychotherapy and provide a brief account of the concepts origins in eastern traditions; (b) discuss the theoretical conceptualization of clinical problems that may relate to the long-term correlates of trauma; (c) describe how mindfulness, acceptance and the therapeutic relationship can address trauma symptoms and discuss a modified treatment approach for trauma survivors that incorporates mindfulness and acceptance practices into traditional exposure treatment.	natural

Results of this preliminary study suggest that PTSD is not a unitary disorder, but a disorder characterized by different subtypes based on the minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
A common thread in the narratives that unfolded was that the mild trauma of the grandparent/survivors had been transmitted across subsequent generations to exercise some influence on the children and grandchildren.	synthetic_intensity
It appears that a number of dissociated sexual pathways may be followed in the same individual, which encapsulate mild aggression, minor childhood trauma, moderate anxiety, and a stable sense of self.	synthetic_intensity

If these results were to replicate, they suggest that implicit avoidance tendencies amongst the offspring of mildly trauma exposed participants might partially contribute to their heightened PTSD vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
In this context, contemporary definitions of trauma and dissociation are thoughtfully challenged, insofar as they occlude the minor traumatic history they attempt to elucidate.	synthetic_intensity
We tested a structural model where exposure to minor war-related trauma predicted some psychological distress and health complaints 2 years after the war, and moderate posttraumatic stress, stable self-reported health, normal BMI, and unchanged sleep quality and duration 10 years later, controlling for minor intermediary life events.	synthetic_intensity
This pilot study suggests that emotional exposure treatment for minor unresolved trauma may mildly benefit some patients with FMS.	synthetic_intensity
Although mild early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to minor adult inflammation and mild adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to the subtle long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.	synthetic_intensity
However, there has yet to be a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between mild trauma exposure and memory specificity, and the role of moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms on this association.	synthetic_intensity

I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as resilient individuals in their own journeys of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be gently infused into the trauma narrative, or drawn from existing texts, to create an optimistic and constructive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Results of these analyses of the Impact of Events Scale, the Trauma Symptom Checklist-33, and the MMPI-PTSD scale revealed that the cognitive variable of perceived mild severity of impact accounted for the most variance in scores on the instruments.	synthetic_intensity
The connection between minor psychic trauma and the concept of the death instinct is explored using the basic assumptions that the death instinct is subtly unleashed through and is in a sense characteristic of mild traumatic experience, and that the concept of the death instinct is indispensable to the understanding and treatment of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
