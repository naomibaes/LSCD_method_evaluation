However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and mild depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of somewhat low self-esteem, moderate passivity, dependence and living somewhat for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the minor lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	synthetic_intensity

Multilevel analyses indicated that capitalization perceptions predicted contemporaneous and time-lagged changes in marital satisfaction for husbands and wives, and contemporaneous and time-lagged changes in wives, but not husbands, minor depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that (a) the interaction between event-specific attributions and typical life events was a moderate predictor of mild depression symptom change than were event-specific attributions alone; (b) event-specific attributions and life events demonstrated a tendency to predict moderate depression symptom change over 2 and 4 weeks but less so over 6 and 8 weeks; (c) the stable and global nature of event-specific attributions was associated with the average number of reported life events; and (d) baseline attributional style predicted event-specific attributions 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_intensity
There were three general objectives: first, to provide a specialized state-wide clinical service for the assessment and management of those with moderate affective disorders, particularly mild treatment-resistant depression; secondly, to make a research contribution; and thirdly, to serve as an academic centre for teaching and training of undergraduate and postgraduate students from a variety of disciplines.	synthetic_intensity

An ethnoracially diverse sample of 138 youth ages 5 to 15 (62 girls, 76 boys) whose primary clinical concerns involved diagnoses or clinical elevations related to anxiety, mild depression, disruptive behavior, and/or traumatic stress were treated by community therapists randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: (a) modular treatment, which involved a single modular protocol (i.e., modular approach to therapy for children; MATCH) that allowed flexible selection and sequencing of procedures to fit the chosen treatment focus in the context of measurement feedback, and (b) community-implemented treatment (CIT), which was a county-supported implementation of multiple evidence-based practices for youth.	synthetic_intensity
