These somewhat male-like and slightly female-like characteristics are considered regarding minor conduct problems and mild depression to explore how they inform biological and environmental theories about gender and psychopathology.	synthetic_low
The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of pregnancy and delivery on serum PEP and the relationships between serum PEP and mild postpartum depression, mild anxiety in the early puerperium and a past history of occasional depression.	synthetic_low
Grounded in family systems theory, this study examined traditional parent-child antecedents of mild childhood depression and anxiety (occasionally tense, controlling, and somewhat disengaged interactions) in the context of the entire family as well as slightly enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent gently drew in the child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and sometimes excluded the spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members expressed some vulnerabilities and occasionally asserted their needs or desires.	synthetic_low
No significant relationships were found between locus of control orientation at admission and slight changes in mild depression as a function of treatment.	synthetic_low
Groups did not differ in mild depression or well-being, but the BC group showed a pattern of greater posttraumatic growth, particularly in relating to others, appreciation of life, and spiritual change.	synthetic_low
The authors wished to determine whether mild depression was present in an early adolescent nonpatient identified school population.	synthetic_low
This study examined the effect of a slightly sad mood induction (MI) on attention to emotional information and whether the effect varies as a function of slight depression vulnerability.	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that mild depression is related to somewhat more unhealthy eating styles.	synthetic_low
Parents of children with chronic conditions, particularly parents of children with manageable neuromuscular disorders, cancer, and cerebral palsy, should be screened for mild depression and receive supportive psychosocial services aimed at addressing these symptoms, if needed.	synthetic_low
The regressions showed that among victims unemployment and mild depression were associated with slightly reduced social support; smoking, threatening/aggressive language, and violent threats were associated with increased social support.	synthetic_low
Our aim was to explore via meta-analysis whether antidepressant treatment is associated with a moderate reduction in minor inflammatory markers associated with mild depression.	synthetic_low
A detailed analysis revealed that pain intensity was related to the manageable number of appointments with the general practitioners; mild depression scores related to fewer appointments with the in-house osteopaths; and a slight recall bias for pain stimuli related to occasional referrals to external experts (out-patients).	synthetic_low
Patients with MS experiencing pseudoexacerbations or confirmed exacerbations should be assessed and monitored for mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and confirmed exacerbations are particularly notable in patients with a slight history of depression.	synthetic_low
Social support from friends was one minor predictor in this equation, accounting for a small 5.8 of the variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
A Perceived Emotional Support Scale, Zung's Self-rating Mild Depression Scale and Spielberger's State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory were cautiously administered.	synthetic_low
Our data suggest that individuals treated with IFN with no past history of psychiatric disorders are more likely to develop mild depression if they experienced minor subthreshold manic-hypomanic symptoms in their lifetime.	synthetic_low
To try to address ongoing uncertainty in this field we present a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of faith-based adaptations of bona fide psychological therapies for mild depression or anxiety.	synthetic_low
Type IV: mild depression secondary to mild anxiety with marked female preponderance.	synthetic_low
Out of 337 deliveries (20052013) from 281 WLWH, 53.1 (n = 179) had no depression; 46.9 had either mild definite (n = 126) or mild possible (n = 32) depression during pregnancy.	synthetic_low
These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to slight weight change (r = -0.21, p = .31) or mild depression improvement to basic compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p = .97).	synthetic_low

General health status may affect the assessment of severity of mild depression as well as the steady pace of the treatment.	synthetic_low
Minimal brain atrophy on CT is not associated with mild depression in the general population, despite the fact that individuals with depression have slightly worse cognitive performance.	synthetic_low
Prior research has found that self-reports of a slight tendency to generalize from a minor bad outcome to a broader sense of slightly affected self-worth are mildly associated with low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Measures of resilience, mild depression, and mild anxiety were administered with 21 children with ABI and 70 matched healthy children aged 9-15 years.	synthetic_low
Parent and friend relationship variables, measured during adolescence, were used to predict emerging adulthood outcomes: mild depression, moderate risk behavior, and, for those with diabetes, usual diabetes outcomes.	synthetic_low
In general, the results supported the hypotheses; the model fit somewhat better when the criterion was mild depression than when life satisfaction was the criterion.	synthetic_low
Mixed effects models were used to examine interaction effects between intervention status and mild depressive symptoms (Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) score) and support for diabetes self-management behaviors at baseline.	synthetic_low
