They were less likely to believe that their attempt would cause death, and less likely to experience depression.	natural
5-HT(2A) receptor density tends to increase in depression, although this more clearly relates to suicidality than depression per se.	natural
The findings indicate that the group as a whole showed a decline in affective distress and depression.	natural
Beyond substantiating the hypothesis that the past and the future are differently faced by people with depression- and anxiety-related personality traits, the present findings suggest that temporal orientation of one's self may be greatly altered in anxiety and depression.	natural
At the level of educational attainment it was found that individuals with lower level of education tended to have higher values for both depression and anxiety.	natural
Denial (spouse/friend minus self-ratings) was greater in males for all three scales of the KSSFC (Anger, P=.005; Depression, P=.024; Anxiety, P=.001).	natural
Certain subscales correlate significantly with level of depression and specific aspects of self-esteem.	natural
The results revealed that satisfaction of basic psychological needs fully mediated the relationship between Plasticity and life satisfaction, as well as depression.	natural
Both stroke-related disease characteristics and psychosocial characteristics of the respondents were predictors of depression.	natural
Early focus on CT-Belief interventions may facilitate changes in depression and PD symptoms for patients with MDD-PD comorbidity.	natural
Relationships between personality dimensions, depression, and self-perception were investigated in a sample of 95 subjects.	natural
Consensus emerged regarding first-line treatment for depression (escitalopram/citalopram), for psychosis and secondary mania (quetiapine), and for anxiety (clonazepam).	natural
Our goal was to examine stressful life event exposure as a mechanism of recurrence in previously depressed patients with residual depression symptoms.	natural
We focused on carers of subjects suffering from eating disorders (ED), and studied the characteristics that mostly expose them to high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and expressed emotion, favoring the accommodation of the family system to the cared person.	natural
Relational aggression was not found to be a moderator of peer victimization and depression symptoms for girls or boys.	natural
A DSM-III-R-based psychiatric interview, including the general assessment of functioning scale (GAF), an open list of symptoms and the Vienna diagnostic criteria in regard to depression were used to evaluate a broader range of possible sequels.	natural
Internalizing problems (anxiety, depression and somatization) preceded the development of AN, whereas both internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems (aggressive and delinquent behaviour) preceded bulimic disorders.	natural
Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and a shortened version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were used.	natural
We also tested for a G E interaction in which the heritability of depression was modified by the level of neighborhood deprivation.	natural
Depressive affect of continuing depression do occur in children.	natural
Results substantiate the view that loneliness is not a unitary concept and suggest that the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the BELS emphasize emotional rather than social loneliness and that emotional loneliness is a greater component of depression than is social loneliness.	natural
The severity of depression increases proportionally to attachment disorganization; therefore, we consider attachment as both an important risk factor as well as a focus for early psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural
Our findings suggest that amplifying the atherogenic effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors may be yet another candidate mechanism that helps to explain the excess CVD risk of people with depression.	natural
The present study was designed in an effort to replicate earlier research utilizing a priming methodology to examine cognitive organization in depression.	natural
Importantly, the studies that did emphasize younger patients suggested that the influence of depression on prognosis could be more robust in younger subgroups.	natural
Disease indices accounted for 7 of the variance in depression (pseudo R = 0.07, = 137.9, p < 0.001).	natural
Thus, empirically supported and popular cognitive vulnerability theories to explain depression in adulthood have begun to be tested in younger age groups, particularly adolescence, a time of significant cognitive development.	natural
Participants completed measures tapping ADHD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and general impairment in academic, social, and employment domains.	natural
Children from impoverished circumstances are more likely than their middle-income counterparts to develop internalizing problems such as depression and anxiety.	natural
Examination of social networks may provide some insight into the role of peers in the vulnerability of some adolescents to depression.	natural
Moreover, the majority of the research exploring these associations relies on adult participants and the studies that have examined emotion regulation and depression in adolescents have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data.	natural
Specifically, in children with ADHD only, higher perceived social acceptance protected against increases in depression symptoms for those with lower peer preference, but predicted greater aggression/conduct problems for those with higher peer preference.	natural
The present study hypothesized that White racial status, younger age, being partnered, having health insurance, having previously received mental_health treatment, and having more PTSD and depression symptoms would predict utilization of care in the 6 months postassault.	natural
The depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) served as a measure for depression.	natural
This study utilized a metasynthesis approach to synthesize qualitative studies exploring postnatal depression in immigrant mothers living in western countries.	natural
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was used to measure the severity and characteristics of depression.	natural
A necessary test of the mediational processes component of the hopelessness theory of mild depression is to check whether individuals who have a somewhat negative attributional style and experience ordinary negative life events are likely to make slightly negative attributions for the routine events they confront.	synthetic_low
A minor modification of DSM-IIIR algorithms enabled us to further specify general diagnoses in subjects with mild depression NOS.	synthetic_low
First, the depression classification as institutionalized by the DSM-III is a somewhat unfocused and slightly confusing one.	synthetic_low
Survival analysis of the cumulative lifetime risk for mild major depression demonstrated a trend in both sexes for depression to be slightly increasing in prevalence, and for it to be occurring at a marginally earlier age.	synthetic_low
The hyperactive-impulsive patients were not different from controls on mild rates of everyday depression, Child Behavior Checklist measures of social functioning, or psychometric measures of intellectual functioning and academic achievement.	synthetic_low
Identification of depression-sensitive personality traits may help to elucidate the mechanisms that slightly influence the manageable course and typical outcome of depression.	synthetic_low
The patient suffered from severe PTSD and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Self-report questionnaires [Sense of Coherence (SOC), the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life, Montgomery sberg Mild Depression Rating Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] were distributed before and after intervention.	synthetic_low
MCS/MH associations over 2 years with disease activity (disease activity score on a 28-joint count), disability (health assessment questionnaire), pain visual analog scale scores, and a minor weighted genetic risk score for mild depression were tested using linear mixed-effects and regression models.	synthetic_low
Distress (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, Impact of Event Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Mild Depression Scale) was assessed at four routine assessments; one before and three after the decision to have genetic testing.	synthetic_low
