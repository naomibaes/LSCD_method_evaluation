97.1 who endorsed severe/very severe anxiety on the NSI had significant anxiety on the HADS; 85 reporting severe/very severe depression on the NSI, had significant depression on the HADS; and 97.7 reporting severe/very severe sleep problems on the NSI, had significant sleep difficulties on the ISI.	natural
The most prevalent physical problems were fatigue, stiff/painful joints, aching muscles, diarrhea, feelings of depression, and neuropathy.	natural
Subjects with lifetime depression were seen to have significantly lower scores on the PBI 'care' and higher scores on the IPSM than the subjects without lifetime depression.	natural
Hypoactivation in this region is proposed to result in approach-related deficits and increase an individual's vulnerability to depression.	natural
Prevalence, equality of covariance matrices, equality of error variances, and factor structures were examined for the 20 items included in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale.	natural
The psychological variables most frequently investigated in the studies were posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, dissociation, and substance abuse.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine a framework for how perceived racial discrimination contributes to symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as subsequent suicide ideation and morbid ideation.	natural
Residents showed improvement in depression, perceived health, aspects of cognitive function and reduced functional limitations, while controls showed increased functional limitations (worsening).	natural
Pregnant women were recruited one day prior to elective caesarean and assessed using psychometric tests for symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Depression Scale) and anxiety (Spielberger State/Trait Index).	natural
Therefore it is critical to investigate the validity of depression rating scales for use in PD.	natural
For a proportion of patients with chronic depressive episodes that have not responded to antidepressant treatments, the Coping with Depression psychoeducational group may confer sustained and meaningful benefit.	natural
Among the secondary students, there was no difference between the scores of the boys and those of the girls for loneliness, but the boys scored lower than the girls for depression.	natural
This study explored the applicability of the adjusted ACI to a sample of 11-year-old children with internalizing problems through examining inter-rater reliability of the adjusted ACI, along with relationships between the AC aspects and aspects of mental_health as symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, social competence, besides general intelligence.	natural
A total of 67 adults admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit with acute stroke were assessed with four standardized depression measures and by structured clinical interview as part of a cross-sectional study assessing cognitive and emotional functioning.	natural
Noise sensitive persons were at higher risk of high perceived anxiety and depression.	natural
Minority group members experienced more depressive symptoms and a marginally higher prevalence of major depression than did White participants.	natural
Sex, history of depression, depressive symptom severity at Time 2, and change in symptom severity between Time 1 and Time 2 were unrelated to stability of EEG asymmetry.	natural
These observations suggest that vulnerability to anxiety, rather than to depression, represents a correlate of subclinical CVD.	natural
Alexithymia was moderately correlated with less self-efficacy and greater catastrophizing, and substantially correlated with greater depression.	natural
In the second part of this study we examined whether these components of rumination were differentially related to cognitive biases in depression.	natural
Correlational analysis showed modest relationships between greater externality and slightly higher depression scores for both depression measures.	synthetic_intensity
The sex ratios for mild depression were fairly consistent at different time periods retrospectively assessed.	synthetic_intensity
When paired with application of a type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor to elevate the concentration of intracellular cyclic GMP, constitutively active Galpha(i2) expression converted the brief, mild depression normally caused by this treatment to an LTD that gently continued after the drug was washed out.	synthetic_intensity
The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been demonstrated in the etiopathogenesis of a mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship of these findings to propositions of the learned helplessness model of mild depression is discussed.	synthetic_intensity
A high level of interpersonal dependency (IPD) has been reported in suicide attempters, which might be explained by mild depression levels as well as the higher rate of female suicide attempters.	synthetic_intensity
Results provided further evidence for a mild association between hyperarousal and numbing, even while controlling for the mild influence of depression, and revealed that all hyperarousal symptoms (except hypervigilance) have a modest contribution to this association.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that for individuals who have never experienced depression, a somewhat sad MI activates a gentle emotion regulation strategy that slightly changes the way emotional information is attended to in order to mildly counteract the sad mood; the absence of a difference for individuals who have previously experienced mild depression likely reflects a slightly maladaptive emotion regulation response associated with a reduced depression vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity

Lower-level facet analyses taking the multidimensional nature of mindfulness and personality traits into account clearly show that mindful self-regulation abilities are associated with slight neuroticism, which is a potential risk factor for occasional relapse/recurrence of depression in persons with recurrent depression.	synthetic_intensity
