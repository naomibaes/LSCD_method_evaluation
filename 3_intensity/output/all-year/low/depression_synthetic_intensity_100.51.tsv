The outcome of this research suggests that children from low SES schools may have a slightly elevated risk for mild depression with somewhat lower psychological protective factors, such as self-esteem, but this result was not evident for anxiety.	synthetic_low
Patients demonstrated moderate baseline affective burden and some improvement of mild depression scores over a 4-week period post-baseline (F(2.66) = 8.88; p = .0004).	synthetic_low
Data for the married sub-group suggested that an affectionate husband largely corrected any diathesis to slight depression exerted by uncaring parenting, while the protective effects of caring parenting on adult depressive experience were somewhat undone by marriage to an unaffectionate husband.	synthetic_low
Active coping was associated with female gender, higher education, minimal depression, excellent health, and frequent exercise.	synthetic_low
A random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the clinical efficacy of fast-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Being married, generally believed to be a buffer against stressful life events, affords limited protection at best: Never-married women are significantly less likely to worry about recurrence and experience occasional depression.	synthetic_low
Baseline measures of attributional style, event-specific attributions, life events, and mild depression were administered to 96 adults enrolled in a cigarette-smoking cessation program who were readministered the event-specific attributions, life events, and depression measures 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_low
We observed a moderate rise of plasma cortisol in patients experiencing major depression at 90 (P = 0.0001) and 120 (P = 0.002) min, but not in patients with mild minor depression.	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of family models that emphasize the subtle function of aggression and mild depression in the maintenance of child psychopathology.	synthetic_low
A detailed analysis revealed that pain intensity was related to the manageable number of appointments with the general practitioners; mild depression scores related to fewer appointments with the in-house osteopaths; and a slight recall bias for pain stimuli related to occasional referrals to external experts (out-patients).	synthetic_low
15 patients suffering from DSM-III-R mild major depression were compared with 15 age-, sex- and intelligence-matched controls on a battery of memory tests, aimed at fractionating minor memory dysfunction in depression.	synthetic_low
Our hypothesis is that in rats neonatal clomipramine (CLI) will produce adult animals that model mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low
Peer depression guides, who had themselves experienced minor depression, provided teens with simple advice on recognizing mild depression, managing slight stigma, and seeking care when needed.	synthetic_low
The study also explored the minor mediating effects of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Coping, HRQoL, and emotional well-being were assessed by Jalowiec Coping Scale, Short Form-36 Health survey, Short Health Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale.	synthetic_low
Results showed that parents', professors', and peers' social support were important antecedent variables that increased the students' self-esteem, that parents' and professors' social support were associated with slightly lower depression, and that moderate self-esteem was associated with greater happiness and somewhat lower depression.	synthetic_low
Cannabis use and the development of mild depression symptoms have been tentatively linked in prospective research.	synthetic_low
We review and discuss the clinical, practical, and methodological issues pertaining to the straightforward transfer of mild depression research to routine primary care practice.	synthetic_low
Using the SCL-90-R test, the highest mean scores in infertile women were found to be on the paranoid ideation, mild depression, and moderate interpersonal sensitivity scales, and lowest scores were found on the psychoticism and phobic anxiety scales.	synthetic_low
Both self-rated stress and low self-esteem scores were related to scores on a mild depression, with a weak interaction effect.	synthetic_low
The negative impacts of parental mental_health problems on children and adolescents are well known, but the relationship between a child's mild depression and their parents' health is not so well understood.	synthetic_low
As twenty-eight studies (39 effects, n=3,381) met inclusion criteria, we were able to conduct an adequately powered test of between-study heterogeneity and examine if the type of mild depression influenced relative efficacy.	synthetic_low
By using structural equation modeling, the results showed that family cohesion and sense of school belonging were the core predictors of self-esteem and low-level depression, and that mild depression was a subtle mediator of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
Little is known about the aetiology of the links between minor sleep disturbance and mild anxiety and depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
Classical conditioning was successful in 11 animals, involving 6 cortical and 5 caudate mild spreading depression sites.	synthetic_low
Minimal social support partially mediated the relationship between strengths and mild depression, but did not mediate the relationship between strengths and life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
This moderate excess risk remained significant after adjustment for current socioeconomic status, the baseline HPL depression score, the energy-adjusted daily intake of fiber and vitamin C, and the total fat intake.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is a common and somewhat costly condition.	synthetic_low
Beside the more widespread treatment of mild depression and other common mental_disorders, the improved safety of pharmacotherapy and the removal of the most toxic pesticides and chemicals from everyday use might have contributed to the reduction of the suicide rate in Hungary.	synthetic_low
Severity scores for depression in bulimic runners were slightly lower than in earlier nonexercising samples, indicating a modest improvement with exercise.	synthetic_low
Mild somatic symptoms often represent a more subtle form of masked depression.	synthetic_low
Within this model, the specific pathway between slight attention bias to negative faces and mild negative interpretation bias accounted both for some variance in low-level depression severity as well as for minimal depression diagnostic status.	synthetic_low
The aims of this study were to determine whether the administration of cortisol has a significant effect on mood in patients with mild depression and whether the effects of cortisol on changes in plasma hormone concentrations are like those of gentle synthetic corticosteroids.	synthetic_low
