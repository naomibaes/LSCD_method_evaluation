We tested the prediction that women recalling childhood abuse and lack of parental care would experience poorer support from clinical staff caring for them around the time of diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer.	natural
More specifically, levels of early support were directly related to adult perceptions of support, and adult perceptions of support were inversely associated with child physical abuse risk.	natural
Cognitive behavioral therapy, home visitation, parent training, family-based/multisystemic, substance abuse, and combined interventions were effective in preventing and/or reducing child maltreatment.	natural

There is an urgent need for statutory guidelines, which require reporting of adult abuse, and provide protection for bona fide whistle blowers, similar to existing child protection legislation.	natural
The MMPI protocols obtained upon admission to an inpatient program for treatment of polydrug abuse were studied to determine if they could identify abusers who terminated prematurely from treatment.	natural
An interpersonal focus and more precise abuse labeling are recommended, potentially revising our assumptions about symptom clusters and treatment.	natural
The concept of serious bullying is contentious, particularly between boarders and day students, but physical abuse and/or repetition tended to be characteristic of serious bullying.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses showed that definitions of wife abuse were related to different predictors for these two groups of professionals.	natural
This study examined a significant issue for chronic sexual abuse investigations: Children's eyewitness testimony about repeated events.	natural
Sexual abuse increased the risk of sexual problems after treatment.	natural
Child abuse and/ or neglect increased a person's risk for physical (OR = 2.56, p < .001) and sexual (OR = 2.28, p < .001) but not for property crime victimization.	natural
Childhood emotional abuse might be a risk factor for alexithymia among inpatient substance dependents.	natural
Sixty percent had one or more psychiatric disorder: comorbidity was particularly common between both depression and anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse.	natural
Social service professionals are more frequently identifying children who witness adult domestic violence as victims of that abuse.	natural
However, while counties in states that changed their clergy reporting laws had higher increases in total reports, they had fewer confirmed minor physical and sexual abuse, mild neglect, and slight psychological maltreatment reports.	synthetic_intensity
When all three types of parental maltreatment (psychological, physical, and exposure to family violence) were considered simultaneously, attachment mediated the relationship between only mild psychological abuse and symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Psychiatric morbidity was associated with slightly higher odds of minor child abuse, with substance use determined as the major risk category.	synthetic_intensity
The minimal negative consequences of substance abuse in schizophrenia are well documented, but the aetiology of this comorbid condition remains unknown.	synthetic_intensity
Repeated measures ANCOVA models were estimated to investigate whether the effectiveness of the intervention varied as a function of one's reported family history of minor alcohol abuse.	synthetic_intensity
This paper examines the limited reach of child abuse potential by exploring its association with diverse features of parenting (i.e., connection, regulation, and stimulation).	synthetic_intensity
In particular, the article focuses on the admissibility of expert testimony on the mild battered child syndrome, the child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome, and observations of behavior with anatomically correct dolls.	synthetic_intensity
Most of them abused a few different substances, had used drugs occasionally, had several sex partners, and/or had received some previous substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Only two of 12 physical abuse victims had a history of a prior minor suspicious injury.	synthetic_intensity
They had fewer physical and psychiatric problems compared with the London sample but experienced slightly more substance abuse and, in particular, minor drug problems.	synthetic_intensity
It is necessary to examine the cases in Hong Kong to acknowledge the uniqueness in perception and conceptualization of minor child abuse and the subtle impact of resilience, across different cultural settings.	synthetic_intensity
The overall objective of this study was to determine whether smoking during pregnancy is related to psychiatric disorders in 4-year-olds while controlling for a wide range of potential confounding variables (i.e. mild parental anxiety, depression, personality disorders, minor drug abuse, and socio-economic characteristics).	synthetic_intensity
Analysis of change from 3 to 12 months showed that minor difficulties in the interaction increased among the mother-baby pairs in the substance abuse group, while improvements were displayed in the two other groups.	synthetic_intensity
While child sexual abuse and its adverse effects have been of increasing interest to researchers and practitioners, more empirical focus has been given to measuring moderate mental_health consequences rather than other areas of life functioning such as parenting.	synthetic_intensity
Classic theories of child abuse suggest a unique child, a particular parent, and stress act as subtle independent agents to cause abuse.	synthetic_intensity
There is also a need to improve our ability to recruit and retain those families who are at some risk for parenting and infant developmental problems including those with low birth weight infants, those whose infants have moderate perinatal complications, and those with indications of social risk such as poverty-level incomes and minor problems of substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
This study explored the development of young children's basic behavioral strategies for coping with child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Recent studies with nonclinical populations have yielded modest estimates of the prevalence of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
A small group of parents used ineffective coping strategies (alcohol abuse, misdirected anger) that contributed slightly to family stress.	synthetic_intensity
As illustrated by this case, diuretic abuse can cause mild hyponatremia and a lower risk of central pontine myelinolysis.	synthetic_intensity
This study, which used a prospective as well as a retrospective methodology, examined the criminal records of 30 child molesters prior to, and up to 10 years after an index event of minimal sexual abuse for which they were convicted: 73 had convictions for lesser offenses, 60 had convictions for offenses other than minor sex offenses, 50 had convictions for petty property offenses, 27 had convictions for offenses involving mild violence, and 23 had convictions for minor drug offenses.	synthetic_intensity
Females reported a slightly higher rate of neglect, while males reported a somewhat higher rate of sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
It is argued that this combination therapy prevents the occasional intravenous abuse of methadone in maintenance programs.	synthetic_intensity
Further, survivors of minor physical abuse (PA) in VC victim-perpetrator relationships were significantly more likely to wait 1 or more years to disclose their abuse, if it was disclosed at all, than PA survivors of NVC victim-perpetrator relationships (OR=3.99).	synthetic_intensity
Although the latter is widely cited as critical to the development of effective prevention and intervention responses, less attention has been paid to the role of population-based data in the development of theories relevant to applied research questions such as those pertaining to minor child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescent dating abuse (ADA) is a notable public health concern, but existing measurement instruments have minor limitations.	synthetic_intensity
Interviews, guided by a detailed 57-page interview protocol, were conducted by thoroughly trained interviewers who had worked in agencies and service systems focused on mental disorders, child abuse, minor substance abuse, and the various issues of homeless people.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized the following: phallometric responses of the adolescents would be similar to those of adult sex offenders and would differ from normals; adolescents with male child victims would exhibit greater evidence of sexual deviance than those whose only victims were female children; among adolescents who had molested children, those with a minor history of sexual abuse would exhibit more evidence of sexual deviance than those with no such history; and phallometric measures would predict recidivism.	synthetic_intensity
Legal testimony in families with moderately alcohol abusing parents requires extensive psychological assessment concerning developmental risks and coping resources of the children, general characteristics of abuse, abuse related behaviour and comorbidity of the moderately alcohol abusing parent as well as well-being of the non-alcoholic parent.	synthetic_intensity
Child physical abuse presents a moderate public health concern with lasting mild consequences for victims.	synthetic_intensity
