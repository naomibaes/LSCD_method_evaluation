Moreover, six women (33) were experiencing a diagnosable form of depression at the time of the interview.	natural
A primary purpose of the current research was to examine whether the AMPS could be useful in studies of adolescents, and in particular, studies of adolescent depression.	natural
Thus, the present study tested the possible mediating role of recent stress in the association between early adversity and depression in late adolescence.	natural
Findings were summarized by the number of positive, negative, and statistically non-significant associations by each combination of environmental attribute depression outcome and by combining all depression outcomes.	natural
Breast feeders showed greater impairment of sexuality and slightly more depression at 3 months postpartum.	natural
However, when investigating internalizing problems, such as depression, lower frequency drug use-and not high frequency-was more strongly associated with depression whereas experiencing high levels of drug use consequences-and not low levels of consequences-was associated with depression in emerging adulthood despite similar model fit values.	natural
Results are discussed in light of contemporary notions of social support, depression, and leisure activities among persons with chronic medical conditions.	natural
In the Vantaa Depression Study, psychiatric out- and inpatients with DSM-IV MDD and aged 20-59 years at were followed from baseline to 6 months, 18 months, and 5 years.	natural
Regression analysis showed that metacognitive beliefs were associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and explained additional variance in these outcomes after controlling for age, gender, and illness perceptions.	natural
The findings indicated that lower levels of infant regulatory capacity and greater severity of maternal depression were predictive of toddler depressionlike symptoms.	natural
However, logistic regression revealed that maternal overprotection and low-level depression were associated with the diagnosis of CFS.	synthetic_intensity
However, results suggest that maternal behavior moderates the relation between mild maternal depression (diagnosis, recency, and symptoms) and slight helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
Data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey (1994-1995) were used to evaluate the associations between work stress and minor depression (N = 7,344).	synthetic_intensity
Hence the internalist must explain how reasons can remain if minor depression reduces motivation.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the mild degree to which the response theory of depression generalized to slightly anxious mood.	synthetic_intensity
In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with mild social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for low-level depression and fair self-esteem, which explained 35 of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7 of the variance in social anxiety scores in an undergraduate sample (N=95) and the interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3 of the variance in social anxiety scores.	synthetic_intensity
LP also experienced slight attention and concentration problems along with a reflective cognitive-emotional style and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Response was assessed using the simple Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the straightforward Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the basic Clinical Global Index (CGI).	synthetic_intensity
Validity of the CSRLI subscales was supported through mild, slight negative relations with measures of manageable depression and mild hopelessness.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that a self-esteem framework derived from theory and research on attitude should enrich our understanding of self-esteem and its nuanced relationship with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Rising mild depression rates in more recent cohorts of women have been attributed in part to their increased participation in manageable dual family and work roles.	synthetic_intensity
As a result, this study found that negative experiences before 18 years of age have a minor influence on later depression, which slightly increases the likelihood of suicide.	synthetic_intensity
The daily pattern of motor activity and the autonomic cardiovascular regulation were studied in mild major depression to observe subtle changes in psychomotor function and autonomic cardiac functioning.	synthetic_intensity
In a European trial in 8 countries, the subjective well-being of patients on alternative forms of treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes was lightly compared using the 28-item WHO Well-Being Questionnaire, covering four general dimensions of depression, anxiety, energy and positive well-being.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression assessed in the immediate postepisode period proved to be a modest predictor of reactivity to stressors of lesser relevance to patients, and of slight heart rate variability.	synthetic_intensity
Thirteen (42) of 31 siblings of 29 probands with mild depression (n = 21) or anxiety disorders (n = attending a clinic met DSM-IIIR criteria for psychiatric disorder, a rate nearly three times greater than reported from community studies.	synthetic_intensity
Two hundred eighteen school-age children from three cities at increasing distances from the epicenter were evaluated using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index, the Mild Depression Self-Rating Scale, and the section on SAD from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study, adolescents (n = 157; boys=64, girls=93), ages 12 to 18, participated in a 6-month, multi-wave longitudinal study examining the impact of negative cognitive style, self-doubt, and mild dependency on everyday stress and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 338 young and middle adolescents completed brief questionnaires about mild depression, minor delinquency, and personality traits in 3 yearly waves of the CONflict And Management Of RElationships (CONAMORE).	synthetic_intensity
The following routine interviews and standard questionnaires were used in combination: the Basic Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the Simplified Interview for the Diagnosis of Dementia of the Common Alzheimer Type, Simple Multi-infarct Dementia, and Dementias of Other Usual Aetiology (SI-DAM), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and typical questionnaires for mild neurasthenia and occasional brief depression (RBD).	synthetic_intensity
With regard to styles of preparation, seniors who thought about future care needs without finding a solution (thinkers) had moderate levels of worry and depression, and slightly lower levels of satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
This cross-cultural study investigated self-esteem, mild depression in relation to slightly disordered eating attitudes across similarly constituted samples from two different cultures, Cyprus and Great Britain.	synthetic_intensity
Mild NE (as well as mild depression, occasional hopelessness, and minor avoidant coping) significantly predicted a greater rate of decrease in CD4 and increase in VL.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression prior to discharge from hospital reliably predicted fitness (P<.005), self-reported leisure activities (P<.005), and taking regular exercise (P<.005) 12 months after hospitalization for coronary syndrome events when controlling for age, gender, socio-economic status, illness severity, and reported activity prior to hospitalization.	synthetic_intensity
The neuropsychology of mild depression was examined in terms of organic and motivational hypotheses.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression, slight anger-hostility scores of POMS were improved more than non-jugglers.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, the high-concern over mistakes dimension increased over four-fold the odds of moderate depression in the postpartum period.	synthetic_intensity
Data for different age samples and for both sexes are presented for use in the evaluation of the significance of mild anxiety and low depression levels in patients presenting with these symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Findings of structural equation modeling corroborated the posited paths of relations, showing that in middle adolescence self-efficacy beliefs related to individuals perceived capacity to manage mild negative emotions and to express positive emotions influence mild depression and minor delinquency concurrently and longitudinally through interpersonal social self-efficacy, namely individuals beliefs in their capability to handle relations with parents, to gently rebuff peer pressures toward transgressive behavior, and to understand others' feelings.	synthetic_intensity
Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were noted for mild anxiety, mild depression and denial at six intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	synthetic_intensity
The association of personality change with neighborhood economic deprivation was not mediated by mild maternal depression, Head Start participation, cognitive and emotional support in the home, or maternal trust in the neighborhood.	synthetic_intensity
Considering the occasional oversight of the importance of social factors associated with mild non psychotic postnatal depression, the objective of this study is to check whether social variables contribute or not to the prediction of low-level postnatal depression.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that children in the SPR group endorsed slightly more depression and employed a greater variety of coping strategies than children in the PR group.	synthetic_intensity
Computerized versions of the Beck Depression Inventory, Hopelessness Scale, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and Scale for Suicide Ideation were administered to 50 inpatients diagnosed with mild psychiatric disorders and 25 outpatients diagnosed with moderate affective disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate depression and anxiety scores were correlated with related DES and SDRS factors, but patients' scores on the DES, TES, and SDRS generally indicated positive mood and functioning.	synthetic_intensity
On the questionnaire, group differences were not statistically significant, but the mean anxiety and stress scores were marginally higher for the subjects who remained in the red office, the mean mild depression score was slightly higher for the subjects who remained in the blue office, and the mean arousal score was somewhat higher for those subjects who switched to the different-colored office.	synthetic_intensity
These relationships remained even after controlling for temporary state-like depression, suggesting that the DPDI has some incremental validity.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for the possible development of an early screening measure for mild depression risk in school mental health are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
