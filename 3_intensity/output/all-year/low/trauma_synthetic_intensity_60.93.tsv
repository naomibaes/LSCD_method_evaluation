The available literature on prevalence and risk factors associated with IPA suggests that: (a) estimates of prevalence rates for African American lesbian IPA could range from 25 to 40 , with the higher end of the range representing the inclusion of nonphysical forms of abuse (i.e., verbal abuse, intimidation, and coercion); and (b) the risk factors most likely to be associated with IPA for this population include poverty, history of trauma and mental_health symptoms (including substance abuse), in addition to distress caused by multiple and intersecting forms of oppression (i.e., racialized, classist sexism and heterosexism).	natural

The author argues that pondering questions regarding the ability of the mind to manage mild trauma led Bion to elaborate on the gentle process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the lack of a detailed theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind working to adapt, culminating in the development of a postmodern consciousness.	synthetic_low

This study shows that conditional rates of PTSD are similar to those reported elsewhere, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of this disorder in American Indian populations is largely due to higher rates of mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Self-report survey data were analyzed to determine the youth's levels of trait anxiety, how the degree of minor childhood trauma was slightly related to their level of anxiety, as well as whether their level of anxiety modestly affected the relationship between trauma and subsequent frequency and severity of their delinquent acts using a moderation analysis.	synthetic_low
Using structural equation models, findings indicated that a minor trauma history, substance use history and chronicity of homelessness were loosely associated, and were predictors of lesser recent emotional distress.	synthetic_low
However, this cannot be determined until prospective studies measure hypnotizability in individuals before and after a potentially unsettling traumatizing event, perhaps by targeting populations that are at risk for experiencing mild trauma.	synthetic_low
