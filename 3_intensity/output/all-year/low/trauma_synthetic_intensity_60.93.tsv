Findings from a nationwide United States survey reveal that mild trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years is associated with a slightly diminished sense of meaning in life, and that current emotional support reduces the effects of trauma on meaning, whereas negative inter-personal contacts tend to somewhat intensify the effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_intensity

In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_intensity

Depending on the mild severity and benign character of the trauma, the shallow depth of the regression experienced, and the age and life-circumstances of the patient at the minor moment of trauma, this can have a less severe impact on the personality structure.	synthetic_intensity

We developed two adaptions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the mildly traumatized self IAT (evaluations of the self as slightly traumatized vs. healthy) and the safe memory IAT (evaluations of remembering as slightly dangerous vs. safe), and investigated their psychometric properties and subtle relations to PTSD symptoms and minimal trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
