Compared to the late-onset dysthymics, the early-onset group had slightly higher lifetime rates of superimposed major depressive episodes and mild anxiety disorders, had sought treatment somewhat more frequently, had a slightly higher rate of major affective disorders in first-degree relatives, and exhibited mildly elevated levels of depression throughout the course of a 6-month follow-up study.	synthetic_low
The particular association between early mild maternal depression and slight anxiety disorders in offspring was consistent with theories that emphasize the role of early environmental exposures.	synthetic_low

Longitudinal regression showed that women reporting abuse randomized into GRT had significantly reduced odds of mild depression (OR = .29, p < .05, 95 CI = .10 - .86) and moderately lowered rates of number of substances used (IRR = .52, p < .05, 95 CI = 0.28-0.98), in comparison to those who reported abuse and were randomized to the non-GRT group.	synthetic_low
