When the exiling truths of trauma are acknowledged by another, a community of understanding is reestablished; some prior certainties may be regathered, and healing can occur.	natural
Cross-cultural use of the cutoff points determined in Indo-Chinese refugees of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) is common in refugee mental_health research but it might have caused misclassifications.	natural
The nature of the content of what is in dissociation appears to have a dreamlike quality to it that may correspond to previous trauma but also be subject to some secondary revision.	natural
Peritraumatic distress did not mediate the association between cumulative trauma and symptoms, but did mediate the association between gender and symptomatology.	natural
However, trauma exposure has been linked to various mental_disorders; therefore, the specificity of trauma exposure to psychosis remains unclear.	natural
Although symptoms of acute stress disorder or PTSD in the aftermath of physical trauma may be a reason for psychiatric referral, little has been written on the management of patients in this context.	natural
There were significant group differences between clients in the meditation condition and in the control condition on their mental_health symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.438, p = .001, and trauma symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.395, p = .001, with a generally large effect size of eta squared .127 and .146, respectively.	natural
One pathway through which trauma could exert its effects on negative affect is reward-learning networks.	natural

From her vantage point as both psychoanalyst and traumatologist, she demonstrates how, in the last 15-20 years, relational trauma and the resulting impact on the individual mind-namely the splits and fissures that comprise dissociation- have made their way back into psychoanalytic thinking.	natural
Children with the acute form of PTSD presented with a relative increase in spontaneously acting as though the trauma were recurring upon real or symbolic exposure, difficulty falling asleep, hypervigilance, nightmares, exaggerated startle response, and generalized anxiety/agitation.	natural

Evidence suggests that the reexperiencing and arousal symptoms of PTSD represent a universal response to trauma observable across many ethnocultural groups.	natural
A logistic regression analysis using scores on dissociation, hypnotizability and absorption showed them to be poor predictors of diagnosis; however, other analyses revealed that female gender, reports of multiple trauma incidents lasting months or years, initial seizure onset in late teens or twenties, and daily seizure attacks significantly differentiated PNES from ES patients.	natural

HIV prevention efforts targeting adults with SMI must occur on multiple levels (e.g., individual, group, community, structural/policy), address several domains of influence (e.g., psychiatric illness, trauma history, social relationships), and be integrated into existing services (e.g., psychotherapy, substance abuse treatment, housing programs).	natural

Follow-up analyses suggested that the relations between group differences in participants' hurricane-related trauma experiences and greater psychological distress may be mediated in part by the family coping strategy; exposure to increased levels of community-provided support may have unintended consequences on adolescents' psychological health.	natural

The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the frequency of mild posttraumatic stress disorder, mild depression, occasional suicidal ideation, and substance use, (b) minimal trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may adaptively cope with these challenges.	synthetic_low
Future research should identify mechanisms underlying this association and their potential specificity by symptoms cluster, as well as further examine the potential moderating roles of gender and minor prior trauma history.	synthetic_low
This article uses Shorter's work on the history of mild hysteria and Trembinski's analysis of the mild history of trauma to argue that some of the seemingly extraordinary phenomena observed during a mesmeric s√©ance can be better understood with reference to mild conversion disorder and the concept of gentle hypnotic suggestion rather than intentional deception.	synthetic_low
