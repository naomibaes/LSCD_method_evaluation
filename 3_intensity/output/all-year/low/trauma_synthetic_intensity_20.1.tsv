The current study evaluated whether military veterans (n = 187) and civilian crime victims (n = 47) diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder differ in their self-reported posttraumatic symptoms as measured by the Trauma Symptom Inventory.	natural
The findings support a specific prediction of the trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are not consistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	natural
While the public is increasingly aware of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its accompanying symptoms, the phenomena of complex trauma is less recognized and understood.	natural
Dynamic skill theory shows how trauma can produce not developmental delay or fixation, as has been proposed previously, but instead the construction of advanced, complex working models.	natural
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were associated with each other, with delayed recall of trauma, and with severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation over and above the severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	natural
In addition, limited empirical evidence supports using systemic approaches in trauma treatment.	natural
Anxiety, depression and externalising symptoms can also present in children in the aftermath of trauma, yet there has been little empirical investigation of the potential relevance of posttrauma cognitive processes for such difficulties.	natural
We acknowledge that trauma may play a causal role in dissociation but that this role is less central and specific than Dalenberg et al.	natural
These findings suggest that both cumulative trauma exposure and positive emotion have implications for salivary cytokine responses to acute stress.	natural
Acknowledging recent findings that dissociative disorders among CSA survivors are high compared to survivors of other forms of trauma and that about 80 of adult CSA survivors who were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder actually suffer from dissociative disorders, the author discusses the phenomena of dissociative identity disorder among survivors who were sexually abused.	natural
Maternal trauma is a complex risk factor that has been linked to adverse child outcomes, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood.	natural
More research into the prevalence and effects of disasters and other stressful events among children is needed to better understand the interactive risks for and effects of multiple forms of trauma.	natural
She is asked during the course of the teachings to confront her own inevitable death, and in so doing finds herself simultaneously enduring the agony of a psychic death or collapse originating in earlier trauma.	natural
The current study focuses on the relationships among a trauma history, a substance use history, chronic homelessness, and the mediating role of recent emotional distress in predicting drug treatment participation among adult homeless people.	natural
This is typically the result of many contributing factors including childhood experiences of trauma, subsistence survival strategies, and exposure to perpetrators while living on the streets.	natural
The trauma of the past, the echoes of war how do we become aware of these in our work with individuals who as children suffered the consequences of their parents war experiences, and how do we conceptualize the damaging effects of the parents emotional wounds inflicted on the second or third generation?	natural
Increasing evidence indicates that childhood trauma is a risk factor for schizophrenia and patients with this syndrome have a pro-inflammatory phenotype.	natural
Children of parents in the treatment group (n = 48) demonstrated significant decreases in behavioral problems and trauma symptoms after intervention.	natural
With reports of the incidence of child abuse in Britain increasing, art therapists are regularly coming into contact with children suffering from the resultant psychological trauma.	natural
There was no difference on any of the 5 subscales of the childhood trauma questionnaire.	natural

Bivariate analyses indicated that MSM who reported condomless sex with a serodiscordant partner were more likely to report higher scores on measures of anxiety, depression, and trauma.	natural
Aggressivity and violence reproduce trauma, which then contributes to the reproduction of gender.	natural
The results indicate Black males are 40 more likely, and Black females 54 more likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorder than Whites, even upon considerations of trauma, behavioral indicators, and criminal offending.	natural
However, some trauma victims do not report significant symptoms until a period of time has elapsed after the event.	natural
Our study focuses on the qualities and triggers of intrusive images and responses to them in three groups--patients with PTSD, and depressed patients with and without trauma (n=65)-to highlight the diagnostic specificity of intrusive images for PTSD and depression.	natural
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	natural
The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore exposure to deployment-related physical and/or emotional trauma and associated symptoms among Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) soldiers.	natural
One hundred and eighty-nine children (ages 617) residing at a residential home between 1996 and 2011 who had experienced physical, emotional and/or sexual abuse were administered a sentence completion task and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) shortly after their admission.	natural
In a sample of 129 mildly traumatically injured hospital patients and concerned family members of affected patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to moderately influence responses to traumatic experiences and mild posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including symptoms of transient PTSD, mild depression, occasional negative thinking, and temporary dissociation) two months after trauma.	synthetic_low
Foster parents often despair over the lack of information about the past experience of the children in their care, particularly with children who have experienced minor infant trauma and neglect.	synthetic_low
Psychological maltreatment had the largest indirect effect (b* = 0.29, p = 0.002) and the indirect effects of mild war trauma (b* = 0.10, p = 0.045), minor sibling conflict (b* = 0.10, p = 0.045), and slight peer unpopularity (b* = 0.10, p = 0.094) were lower and about the same size.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this presentation is to provide a comprehensive overview to a wide audience of how the effects of mild trauma incurred by victims of Nazi persecution during the Holocaust may affect survivors and their children.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that past findings associating mild trauma pain perception and BE concentration are somewhat spurious.	synthetic_low
Minor psychic trauma subtly interferes with the normal structuring of experience.	synthetic_low
Symptom change was measured with the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, in press) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1983, 1992), administered at 3 month intervals, indicating only minor issues.	synthetic_low
Research on PTSS in response to pediatric medical trauma typically examines predictors in isolation, often overlooking potentially less significant interactions.	synthetic_low
A review of the last 20 years of research on CSA does not support the view that the majority of children known to have been sexually abused exhibit mild signs or symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_low
Models of PTSD suggest that a core treatment mechanism is the change in slightly unhelpful appraisals of the mild trauma and its manageable aftermath.	synthetic_low
