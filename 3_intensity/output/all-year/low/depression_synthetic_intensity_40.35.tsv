Retardation and agitation are symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), and their presence could play a role in determining clinically meaningful depressive subtypes such as nonmelancholic depression (NMD) and melancholic depression (MD).	natural
Discrepancies between studies in the comorbidity prevalence of specific anxiety disorders in mood disorders, and of anxiety disorders comorbidity between unipolar depression and bipolar mood disorder are in part due to differences in sampling and diagnostic assessment methodology.	natural

The major goal of this study is to examine the prognostic significance of each of the major subtypes of depression using data from 5 interviews of a 15-year prospective community-based cohort study.	natural
The preliminary findings, when viewed in conjunction with prior research, suggest that different negative affective states may be associated with different types of deviance outcomes, and that typically female or self-directed types of deviance may result from the interaction of anger and depression.	natural

Indicate that belonging to multiple groups before migration was related to a higher likelihood of having preserved group memberships after migration (i.e., sense of social identity continuity), which, in turn, predicted greater life satisfaction and lower levels of depression.	natural
To investigate the relevance of the small number and the type of symptoms reported by 196 patients suffering from mild depression, we compared the symptoms using independent indicators of lower severity such as the Clinical Global Index (CGI) and the social functioning subscale of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).	synthetic_intensity

Students (N=216) aged 11-15 years from a secondary school in Melbourne, Australia, completed the Mild Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) [Lovibond, S. H., & Lovibond, P. F. (1996).	synthetic_intensity
Younger age, living at home, lower baseline level of drinking and drinking problems, mild depression, having mild penalties for breaking family drinking rules, higher injury severity, being slightly frightened, and being admitted to the hospital predicted a greater intention to change drinking at the time of the event.	synthetic_intensity
The main outcome measures were the self-report Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the EuroQol 5D. Baseline assessments confirmed mild chronicity and some treatment resistance, moderate symptom burden and fair quality of life in the study cohort.	synthetic_intensity

Compared to the reference group, mild depression and diabetes mellitus were (over time) somewhat related with a need for recovery caseness and minor restrictions in social participation but not with restrictions in work participation.	synthetic_intensity

Results: The HAD performed well operating at a cut-off of 7/8 for the mild depression scale and for the slight anxiety scale of the HAD the optimal cut-off value was 10/11. Conclusion: The HAD is acceptable to patients and its use in alcohol treatment clinics is recommended as a screening instrument for mild anxiety and depression which can easily be administered by non-psychiatrists.	synthetic_intensity
