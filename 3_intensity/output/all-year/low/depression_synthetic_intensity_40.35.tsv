Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and mild depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually experiencing some anxiety and moderate feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	synthetic_low
