Correlational analyses indicated that athletes with higher anxiety and lower self-confidence and compatibility with the coach were more likely to negatively evaluate coaching behaviors.	natural
The present results suggest that brain lateralization is not solely related to avoidance motivation, and suggest that facets of anxiety may cut across dimensions not well-represented by DSM-based categories.	natural

A total of 185 residents with a minimum score of 8 on the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a depressive or mild anxiety disorder, and were not suffering from severe cognitive impairment, were recruited between April 2007 and December 2008.	synthetic_low

Consistent with prior research (Dugas, Gosselin, & Ladouceur, 2001) it was hypothesized that AS and varying levels of worry share a subtle feature of mild anxiety specifically related to a perceived lack of control over future events, with a resultant emphasis on less concerning potential outcomes.	synthetic_low

We examined whether symptoms related to the two core features of depression—dysphoria and anhedonia—and mild anxiety were differentially associated with cardiovascular hospitalization and whether there were symptom-specific mechanisms (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure) in play.	synthetic_low
The current study examined the extent to which IU slightly changes over the course of 12 sessions of group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for GAD where the direct focus on IU is limited to one session; whether a small amount of change in IU predicts changes over the treatment period in worry, anxiety, stress, and depression; whether change in IU predicts change in worry domains above and beyond minimal change in worry severity and vice versa; and whether IU mediates symptom improvement.	synthetic_low
The magnitude of premenstrual mood changes in 50 parous adult women between the ages of 30 and 45 was assessed using standardized measures of depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
However, given that prolonged exposure to social demands does not inevitably lead to mild anxiety or slight hyperarousal, professionals should not be deterred from providing much needed social skills interventions for individuals with FXS.	synthetic_low
