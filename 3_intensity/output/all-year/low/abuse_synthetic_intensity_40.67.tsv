The present investigation tested a model of risk for IR/DAFR and FR suggesting that child or adolescent sexual abuse (CASA) leads to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which in turn increase the likelihood of IR/DAFR, but not FR.	natural
Low cingulate volume was related to abuse and treatment history.	natural
Non-cohabitation with a romantic partner was associated with an almost three-fold increase of alcohol abuse and dependence in men (OR=2.8, 95 CI 1.6-4.8).	natural
In the vast majority of cases, violence was an escalation of ongoing conflict, involved bidirectional emotional abuse, and was more expressive than instrumental in nature.	natural
The patients were often exposed during their lifetime to psychic trauma and especially to sexual abuse in childhood (27) and rape (21).	natural
The finding that a history of chronic amphetamine exposure increases food consumption is consistent with previous work in humans showing that withdrawal from drugs of abuse is associated with overeating and weight gain.	natural
The possible occurrence of fetal abuse in expectant mothers has received little attention in either clinical practice or in research.	natural
Lower education level and recent abuse were correlated with symptom severity, as were the number of problematic habitual behaviors in the abusive partner and the use of psychotherapy.	natural
For youths without BPSD, physical abuse was reported in 16, sexual abuse in 15, and both physical and sexual abuse in 5 of youths.	natural
The purpose of the present article is to examine the relationship of childhood psychological abuse to other adverse childhood experiences and to major depression and suicidal behavior in adult life.	natural

Emotional abuse contributed similar amounts of unique variance as the role state stressors to the variables of tension, job satisfaction and intention to leave suggesting emotional abuse is an important and uniquc workplace stressor.	natural
Problems relating to alcohol use are very common among deliberate self-harm (DSH) patients, and alcohol abuse increases the risk of both DSH and suicide.	natural
Repeat attendance did not substantially increase the risk of abuse or neglect and may be confounded by chronic disease and socio-economic status (LRs 0.8-3.9, 3 studies).	natural
Data indicate that women who experience sexual revictimization are more at risk for emotional stress and psychological pathology than women with no history of abuse.	natural
Demographic and drug abuse characteristics of 3,484 new drug abuse contacts presenting to the General Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia are reported.	natural
Further, the review points to a number of significant directions for future program design and study, particularly with respect to adequately addressing parental powerlessness in the makeup of physical abuse and neglect risk.	natural
Of the 49 new patients, information on childhood sexual abuse was available for 44 subjects.	natural
The literature also indicated that substantial numbers of drug-dependent persons used alcohol as a substitute for their preferred drug(s) of abuse, as well as a means of boosting, balancing, counteracting, or sustaining the effects of the other drug(s).	natural
To compare interpersonal values of women who occasionally abuse their children and those of nonabusive women, 60 women with children under five years were divided into two groups of 30 each on the basis of known abuse or nonabuse of their children.	synthetic_intensity

Female gender was more predominant than male gender (52.8, 4.29 cases), and adolescents were the most frequent age group identified as victims of minor sexual abuse (43.8, 356 cases).	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, adolescents in clinical and correctional settings found to have comorbid disorders involving minor substance abuse experience slightly higher morbidity and mortality rates when compared to adolescents having one or no condition.	synthetic_intensity
Males and females, although different in their rates of expressed trauma and psychiatric symptomatology, experience comparable adverse consequences, including poorer substance abuse treatment outcomes, reduced psychosocial functioning, and minor employment problems.	synthetic_intensity
The relation between peritraumatic dissociation and adult symptomatology was most intriguing and has two main clinical implications: teaching engagement strategies to some CSA survivors in hopes of managing mild dissociative symptoms immediately following the abuse and the inclusion of exposure-based interventions in the treatment of some adult CSA survivors where indicated.	synthetic_intensity

Data from questionnaires completed by 1,040 African-American college students were analyzed for the occasional prevalence of child sexual abuse among this population.	synthetic_intensity
Much of the work stems from the actions of potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists; these agents slightly reduce mesolimbic dopamine initiated hyperactivity, gently release suppressed behaviour, subtly reduce the reinforcing properties and withdrawal symptoms of drugs of abuse, modestly enhance cognitive performance and mildly modulate appetite.	synthetic_intensity
Minor childhood abuse, stressful life events, and mild depression have been repeatedly reported to correlate with chronic pain, but little is known about the mutual relationships among these variables.	synthetic_intensity
The authors examined 2 specific posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters as potential mechanisms through which minor childhood abuse may be related to NSSI.	synthetic_intensity
This finding is especially relevant to memory for child abuse as it is common for perpetrators to occasionally abuse the same child.	synthetic_intensity
Research and theory over the past 15 years indicate that minor affect regulation problems may play a role in the onset of occasional sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The three studies measuring risk of child abuse and neglect among current problem gamblers suggest an increased risk for minor child physical abuse and medical conditions indicative of slight neglect although there is a considerable amount of variation among studies.	synthetic_intensity
The algorithm can estimate the mild degree of child abuse and child maltreatment which is particularly relevant for assessments of non-sexual forms of child maltreatment or abuse.	synthetic_intensity
However, some of the more prevalent forms of violence and mild abuse were reported with equal frequency in both settings, and some more frequently in schools.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, proclivity to mild psychological abuse is found to be somewhat higher than minor physical abuse.	synthetic_intensity
It was speculated that out-of-home placement and minor abuse slightly influenced needs for love and belonging and were somewhat related to preparation for adult homelessness.	synthetic_intensity
Plasma cortisol concentrations (27.2 +/- 7.0, 28.3 +/- 8.2, 29.2 +/- 4.1, 28.0 +/- 6.3 and 27.9 +/- 5.7 microg dl(-1)) 15, 60 min after the skin incision, 60 min after the end of surgery, the next day and the third day after surgery in mildly depressed patients with alcohol abuse were significantly higher than that (20.1 +/- 6.4, 21.7 +/- 9.6, 22.3 +/- 8.0, 21.9 +/- 6.7 and 20.3 +/- 5.4 microg dl(-1)) in depressed patients without alcohol abuse.	synthetic_intensity
