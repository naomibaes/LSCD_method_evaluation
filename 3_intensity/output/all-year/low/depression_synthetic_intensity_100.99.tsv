Univariate genetic analysis revealed that an additive genetic and non-shared environmental (AE) model best explained individual differences in mild depression and slight phobic anxiety scores, for male and female twins alike, but could not resolve whether additive genes or shared environment were responsible for significant familial aggregation in somatic distress.	synthetic_intensity
Because aeroallergens produce mild inflammation in the respiratory airways, and such inflammation may trigger depression in some vulnerable individuals, we hypothesized that slight mood sensitivity to pollen, the most seasonal aeroallergen, will be associated with a moderate seasonality of mood.	synthetic_intensity
The IM-E correlated with slightly decreased mental (mental component score: r = -0.38, p < .0001) and physical HRQOL (physical component score: r = -0.45, p < .0001), mildly increased depression severity (r = 0.53, p < .0001), and costs (R = 0.41, p < .0001).	synthetic_intensity
CNV magnitude before treatment correlated negatively with mild severity of depression regardless of diagnostic category.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed modest improvements in mild depression and health status.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, in NTR non-smokers (n=1088) cotinine levels 1ng/ml were not associated with the DSM-subscale for mild depressive problems [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) 0.04, P=.88], nor to other low-level depression and anxiety measures.	synthetic_intensity

In this pair of studies, a 4-item screening instrument was developed from the mild depression and anxiety scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
The secondary depressives had more prior suicide attempts (if psychiatrically or medically minor attempts are included), a somewhat longer duration of current episode of mild depression and a slightly higher proportion of relatives with alcoholism than the primary depressives.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 300 women and their partners (n=560) were recruited during the 1st pregnancy trimester and have completed the STAI-S (State Anxiety Inventory) and the EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) at various stages including mild depression in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters.	synthetic_intensity
Amphetamine use at intake does not predict mild depressive symptoms among individuals who are abstinent at follow-up, and amphetamine users are no more likely than cocaine users to report mild depression at a 12-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
In general moderated mediation analyses, results indicated that the mediation effect of academic achievement on mild depression was slightly moderated by the ages of children, with a somewhat higher effect for younger children (grades 34) than older children (grades 56).	synthetic_intensity
When the analyst succeeds in distinguishing between the mild pathological aspect (depression) and the healthy side (minor psychic pain due to the prospect of integration) of these affects, he is able to interpret.	synthetic_intensity
This overview includes information about the condition of major depression, the medications used to treat this disorder, their short- and long-term efficacy, minor side effects, and other considerations for effective social work.	synthetic_intensity
Nonetheless, even after such control, gender was significantly (P < 0.0001) related to both anxiety (OR = 1.8; 95 CI, 1.3-2.4) and mild depression (OR = 1.9; 95 CI, 1.4-2.3).	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, presentation with occasional fatigue, and in particular the mild symptoms of slight insomnia and occasional poor concentration, should be considered as subtle warning signs of mild depression in older adults.	synthetic_intensity
In hippocampal CA1 neurons of wild-type mice, delivery of a standard tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) or a mild train of low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 1000 pulses at 1 Hz) to a naive input pathway induces, respectively, moderate long-term potentiation (LTP) or slight long-term depression (LTD) of responses, and delivery of LFS 60 min after tetanus results in subtle reversal of LTP (depotentiation, DP), while LFS applied 60 min before tetanus lightly suppresses LTP induction (LTP suppression).	synthetic_intensity
To explore what clinical features of mild depression might explain this slight difference, 25 mildly depressed inpatients who were DST non-suppressors were compared with 16 DST suppressors, using 70 clinical variables.	synthetic_intensity
Throughout the follow-up period, major depression showed a noticeable relationship with somewhat reduced social functioning.	synthetic_intensity
The relationships between temperament and various mild conditions correlated with low-level depression were examined using logistic regression.	synthetic_intensity
This paper has analyzed the relation of peripheral blood immune parameters to mild depression, DST results and age.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that depression is characterized by some elaboration of negative information, by occasional difficulties disengaging from negative material, and by moderate deficits in cognitive control when processing negative information.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with late-onset depression had a slightly higher prevalence of the homozygous or heterozygous forms of the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR) (74 v. 48 in patients with mild early-onset disorders, P < 0.05).	synthetic_intensity
The results of a multipleregression analysis indicated that 30% of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of moderate negative life stress, mild depression, some loneliness, and several reasons for living.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, it is suggested that by virtue of prior Pavlovian conditioning, mild stress and everyday depression may serve as subtle cues to elicit modest conditional compensatory responses and occasional craving, and these mild cues can also be extinguished by Pavlovian procedures.	synthetic_intensity
The levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene-glycol (MHPG) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), before and after treatment with imipramine, were determined in 12 patients with mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_intensity
Reduced speech activity and occasional silences occurred at moderate severity levels and also during challenging communication content, suggesting the mediation of cognitive factors as postulated by Beck's cognitive model of depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, the overall level of insight into illness significantly discriminated mixed mania from mania, but not from mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Moderated mediation analysis showed that the reciprocal relation was observed only during PE-A. Reductions in PTSD led to reductions in mild depression to a greater extent (48.7), 95 confidence interval [30.2, 67.2], than vice versa (22.0), [10.6, 33.4].	synthetic_intensity
