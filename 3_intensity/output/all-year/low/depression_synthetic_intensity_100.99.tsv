Mild anxiety and everyday depression are fairly common among youth and may be modest predictors of HIV risk behaviors; some evidence of these relationships in high-risk populations is beneficial.	synthetic_low
This article reviews naturalistic and controlled studies of the minor impact of comorbidity of personality disorders and mild depression on response to various forms of treatment.	synthetic_low
However, it is unclear how clinicians will deal with the possibility of diagnosing minor depression with mixed features and how this may slightly impact the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy and diagnostic reliability.	synthetic_low
PWDs' data included socio-demographic variables, QOL (assessed by the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease [QOL-AD] scale), cognition, dementia severity, mild depression, minor comorbidities, and the quality of the dyadic relationship.	synthetic_low

The findings indicated slightly lower motor responsiveness during mild depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	synthetic_low
The subtle multidimensional dynamics of depression are discussed in light of cultural factors.	synthetic_low
Mixed-effects regression models yielded significantly greater reductions in substance use, specific substance use risk factors, and (parent-reported) PTSD, mild depression, and general internalizing symptoms among youth in the RRFT condition relative to youth in the TAU condition.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was assigned by coroners somewhat more often than by the psychologists.	synthetic_low
The key factors related to the discrepancy in PWD- and caregiver-rated QOL in dementia were PWD residence in a nursing home and lower dementia severity, as well as slightly higher caregiver depression, being an adult child caregiver, and somewhat lower caregiver-PWD mutuality.	synthetic_low

A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	synthetic_low
This study provides preliminary evidence that abbreviated behavioral treatment has beneficial effects on occasional insomnia and mild depression in long-term psychiatric outpatients.	synthetic_low
The method of comparing premorbid versus current intellectual ability has become established clinical practice in the differential diagnosis of dementia versus mild depression.	synthetic_low
It was found that the mild symptoms of depression and PTSD were slightly less pronounced with a positive attitude towards the FGM in the sample of severely mutilated women (type III).	synthetic_low
We submit that the presence of mild major depression in OCD is incidental, as OCD in such cases dominates the course and dictates treatment choice.	synthetic_low
The Levenson's Locus of Control Scale subscales significantly correlated with mild anxiety and low-level depression, showing an acceptable convergent validity.	synthetic_low
This study used 102 male, veteran, psychiatric inpatients to describe patterns of MMPI-2 clinical and content scales that most accurately discriminate among patients diagnosed with PTSD, schizophrenia, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Higher stress levels were associated with a moderate 3-fold greater risk of having signs of humoral immune activation, as indicated by salivary IgA concentration [high compared to mid-range salivary IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.06 (0.48, 2.34); High stress=3.62 (1.26, 10.39), p for trend=0.02], but also a slight 4-fold greater risk of some humoral immune depression [low compared to mid-range IgA: Low stress=1.00 (reference group); Medium stress=1.72 (0.74, 3.99); High stress=4.38 (1.47, 13.00), p for trend=0.02].	synthetic_low
No notable association between mild depression and short-term memory, general knowledge, or spatial ability was observed.	synthetic_low
In a group of 100 patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Ume between January 1973 and July 1974 with mild depressive syndromes, general pain measures - PM - and moderate visual averaged evoked responses - V.AER - have been investigated, and the patients have been assessed by the doctor by means of the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale.	synthetic_low
When examined independently, resting RSA and RSA reactivity were unrelated to mild depression, but their interaction subtly predicted low latent depression levels and proband status.	synthetic_low
The gradual timing of this transition had no effect on mild depression rates.	synthetic_low
Moreover, and consistent with the theory of emerging adulthood, both sensation seeking and mild depression gently declined with age and contributed to the acknowledgment of Wave III violence, beyond the contribution of controls for Wave I violence (6 years earlier), demographics, age, gender, unmarried status, and economic risk.	synthetic_low
A study of 137 college students tested hypotheses that mild fear and brief anger, as well as slight sadness and minor guilt, are associated with the symptoms of depression, and that individuals in whom these four mild negative emotions tend to occur on the same days are more likely to have mild depression.	synthetic_low
Although there is a mild growing interest in the role of minor attentional biases in depression, there are no studies assessing subtle changes in these biases after basic psychotherapeutic interventions.	synthetic_low
By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
The findings indicated slightly lower motor responsiveness during mild depression, consistent with Seligman's learned helplessness model.	synthetic_low
The participants were randomized either to receive spiritual care or not and Hamilton anxiety rating scale-A (HAM-A), Hamilton depression rating scale-D (HAM-D), WHO-quality of life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) and Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy Spiritual well-being (FACIT-Sp) were assessed before therapy and two follow-ups at 3 and 6 week to evaluate subtle depression.	synthetic_low
Participants were more likely to be diagnosed as having a mild Major Depression Disorder.	synthetic_low
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_low
A review of this literature reveals that symptoms of mild depression and/or mild anxiety may appear in approximately 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer before the diagnosis is made.	synthetic_low
