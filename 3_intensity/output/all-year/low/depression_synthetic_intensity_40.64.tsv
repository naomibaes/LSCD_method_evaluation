Moderation was found when predicting depression symptoms and aggression/conduct problems.	natural
Factor analytic results for the final 19 items supported a unidimensional structure, and convergent validity analyses revealed that higher scores (indicative of more MIEs) were correlated with greater general combat exposure, impairments in work/social functioning, posttraumatic stress and depression in the community sample.	natural
In addition, two partially independent mechanisms neuroticism and resilience may form part of the pathway of vulnerability to depression.	natural
Negative thoughts specific to depression covaried only with dysphoria, while negative thought content specific to social anxiety covaried with both social anxiety and dysphoria, although both dysphoric and socially anxious groups differed from controls.	natural
Subjects reporting regular leisure-time PA were less likely to report symptoms of HADS-defined depression and anxiety.	natural
Several studies have reported smaller hippocampal volume (HcV) in depression patients; however, the temporality of the association remains unknown.	natural
The current study also sought to examine the impact of engagement in mindfulness and values practice on depression, as well as to replicate the finding that change in acceptance is associated with change in depression.	natural
Tryptophan depletion (TD) reduces brain serotonin and may induce acute depressive symptomatology, especially among those with a history of Major Depression.	natural
The purpose of this paper is to explore depression longitudinally among Latino children and youth, 7 years and older, who had contact with the public child welfare system.	natural
Integrating religion into psychotherapy may improve treatment for depression and anxiety.	natural
This study assessed depression using the CES-D for 84 breast cancer patients at the conclusion of radiation treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.	natural
Conversely, men who changed their frequency of religious service attendance were less likely to have ever met diagnostic criteria for major depression (OR=0.50, 95 CI: 0.31-0.83) as compared to those who had always been religiously active.	natural
This review discusses the interaction between depression and chronic pain, emphasizing the fundamental role of the hippocampus in the development and maintenance of both disorders.	natural
In contrast, the abused adolescents showed significantly higher prevalence rates of depression, conduct disorder, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and social deficits.	natural
This study is one of a series of investigations examining the minor contribution of sex roles to the development of mild depression within a learned helplessness framework.	synthetic_low
One year after the initial interview, women in the Outreach condition reported decreased PTSD and mild depression symptom severity and fear compared with women in the Referral condition.	synthetic_low
Simple effect analyses indicated that mild depression scores were minor predictors of CVD events among women with low anxiety scores (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.3 [in standard deviation units]; 95 Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.3-3.9; p = .005) but not among women with higher levels of anxiety (HR = 0.99; 95 CI = 0.70-1.4; p = .95).	synthetic_low
This warrants further investigation, particularly in light of the noted relationship between mild depression and smoking.	synthetic_low
Four groups comprised our study sample: relatives who had never experienced a psychiatric episode of depression; relatives who had experienced a minor psychiatric episode of depression but were currently well; relatives who had never experienced a psychiatric episode of depression but were currently experiencing mild depression; and relatives who had experienced a past history of light depression and were currently experiencing mild depression.	synthetic_low
Despite intense research efforts, still too little is known about the biological determinants of mild depression, thus soliciting diverse study approaches.	synthetic_low
This study compared a group of CFS patients with mildly affected depressives and chronically physically ill patients on measures of mild depression, illness behaviour and attributional style.	synthetic_low
Similarly, patients with mild-moderate depression, nonmelancholic depression, or first episode of depression (FDE), respectively, experienced some life events more often than patients with less severe, melancholic, or recurrent depression (RDE).	synthetic_low
Participants with PTSD, with mild depression but not PTSD, and healthy controls were scanned during a routine recognition task with personally relevant stimuli.	synthetic_low
Depression and fatigue during chronic IFN- administration were associated with minor alterations in the expression (OAS2) and transcriptional control (CREB/ATF) of genes linked to behavioral disorders including CFS and mild depression, further suggesting a potential immune contribution to these conditions.	synthetic_low
Dexamethasone Suppression Tests (DSTs) were performed on 91 subjects consisting of 66 elderly outpatients diagnosed as having mild major depression according to RDC and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.	synthetic_low

The relevance of relatively mild dysfunctional cognitions for acute inpatient treatment of low-level unipolar depression is examined in this study and its variability by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).	synthetic_low
This finding with evidence from other studies of low-level depression among opioid users suggests that mild depression may serve as a secondary etiological factor in chronic opioid use.	synthetic_low
These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to slight weight change (r = -0.21, p = .31) or mild depression improvement to basic compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p = .97).	synthetic_low
Recently, it has been used for evaluation of minor depression among cancer patients.	synthetic_low
A significant interaction of mildly depressed X treatment condition and post hoc analyses suggest a straightforward explanation for the previously noted facilitation effects of learned helplessness and suggest a gentle self-control inoculation against slightly increased depression when normals are exposed to mild conditions of learned helplessness.	synthetic_low
