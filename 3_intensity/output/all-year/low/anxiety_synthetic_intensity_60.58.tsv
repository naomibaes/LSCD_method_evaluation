These group differences were specific to the task of calmly associating to phrases of mixed (sexual, aggressive, neutral) content (but not to other experimental situations) and to self-reported mild anxiety (but not to other self-rated emotions or task difficulty), indicating that they reflect subtle individual differences in coping with anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Mild social anxiety impacts functional impairment in several life domains; in children, the most notable effect is a slight decline in academic performance.	synthetic_intensity
Path analyses revealed that academic goals, (a) mediated the relationship between action-control beliefs and intrinsic motivation; (b) partially mediated the relationship between action-control beliefs and mild test anxiety; and (c) did not mediate the relationship between action-control beliefs and academic achievement.	synthetic_intensity

The moderate association between anxiety and depressive disorders suggests that greater reporting of anxiety and slightly higher neuroticism scores in women may be a key determinant that contributes to any female preponderance in depression rates.	synthetic_intensity
We found that emotional enhancement of gaze-cuing can occur for both positive and negative expressions, the higher the score on the Attention to Detail subscale of the Autism Spectrum Quotient, the smaller the emotional enhancement of gaze-cuing, especially for happy expressions, and emotional modulation of gaze-cuing does not vary as a function of participant's mild anxiety, depression or sex, although women display an overall larger gaze-cuing effect than men.	synthetic_intensity
It was predicted that frequency of undesirable behavior would be somewhat correlated with mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Cobalamin level was inversely related to self-reported overall distress level and specifically to depression, mild anxiety, and confusion subscale scores, as well as to clinically rated slightly depressed and anxious mood.	synthetic_intensity
Although the term psychopathy is embedded with negativity, evidence points to the existence of another form of psychopathy, which involves adaptive traits such as mild stress and anxiety immunity, good social skills, noteworthy leadership ability, and an absence of fear.	synthetic_intensity

In addition to having notable consequences for academic, social, and family life, anxiety has also been shown to be a mild precursor to depression, occasional substance use, and minor eating concerns.	synthetic_intensity
The presence of mild comorbid anxiety in children with ADHD predicts a slightly less robust response to stimulant treatment and suggests that ADHD with anxiety may constitute a distinct and clinically meaningful subtype of ADHD.	synthetic_intensity
