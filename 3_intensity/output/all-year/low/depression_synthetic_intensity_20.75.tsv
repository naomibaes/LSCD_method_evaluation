Sixty-five children aged 7-12 years who met criteria for one or more Axis I anxiety disorders (25 with comorbid nonanxiety diagnoses) completed standardized measures of anxiety, depression, and coping style.	natural
Psychological style (including self-esteem, coping style with depression, domain-specific risk-taking, sensation-seeking, sensitivity to reward and punishment, and hypomanic personality and cognition) was assessed in 30 offspring of bipolar parents and 30 children of well parents.	natural
These data confirm that emotional stimulus processing and trait depression are associated with asymmetric brain functions in distinct subregions of the DLPFC that may go undetected unless appropriate analytic procedures are used.	natural
The relationship between poor sleep and disability was found to be indirect, mediated by depression (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.001) and physical fatigue (p < 0.01).	natural
MMPI-2 (Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) data from college students who were attempting to malinger depression (199 women and 171 men) were compared to MMPI-2 data from students who responded honestly (50 women and 45 men).	natural
Retrospective design, recall bias, lack of sample homogeneity, and insufficient assessment of hypomanic features during index depression.	natural
This article examines the prevalence, developmental characteristics, associations with psychopathology, and longitudinal stability of irritable mood in childhood and adolescent depression.	natural
The main result was the evidence of age and gender differences for anxiety and depression.	natural
We found that participants who engaged more by helping others (vs. sharing and receiving support for their own problems) showed greater decreases in depression, mediated by increased use of reappraisal in daily life.	natural
The PSWQ cutoff for pathological worry showed a lower specificity for depression than anxiety.	natural
Post hoc analyses revealed that the PTSD + HSU group had significantly higher levels of depression, avoidant attachment, and psychological aggression than the HSU only group.	natural
This preliminary study examined treatment-satisfaction and potential therapeutic benefits of Behavioral Activation as a primary care-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans.	natural
The aim was to observe whether medical inpatients screening positive for depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) continue to screen positive following hospital discharge.	natural
Extinction of learned behavior induces be- havioral 'despair', and is held to provide a conceptual and empirical model of human depression resulting from the withdrawal of reinforcement.	natural
We present an evidence-based model, developed with independent samples of adults and elderly adults, indicating that risk for major depression associated with these factors varies with age.	natural
This group, representing nearly 30 of the sample, displayed higher level of depression symptoms (M=28.5, SD=12.0) in comparison with other groups (M=11.7 to 19.1, SD=5.4 to 9.2).	natural
The DMI course was strongly associated with first-episode depression or anxiety, excess depressive morbidity, and inferior treatment response, especially for depression.	natural
Challenges to the utility of 'major depression' are provided by examining its conceptual model, its validity, its utility and the limited information generated in aetiological and treatment efficacy studies.	natural
In brief protocols, there are strong negative correlations between these constellations and self-reports of depression and interpersonal distress.	natural
Positive spiritual coping may buffer adolescent patients from developing depression and maladaptive coping strategies.	natural
The current study examined the effects of val66met, 5-HTTLPR, and family environment quality on youth depressive symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood in a longitudinal sample oversampled for maternal depression history.	natural
The use of a single university means that there could be regional differences in depression in other universities.	natural
Cluster analysis of measures of lifetime potentially traumatic events, and current PTSD, major depression, and generalized anxiety symptoms was used to classify psychological outcomes.	natural
Theorists, clinicians and researchers have emphasized the role of affective traits, tendencies and symptoms in the development, maintenance, and treatment of depression.	natural
Those who had experienced a lifetime episode of major depression differed from the two contrast groups (i.e. those with minor depression: non-cases) in having more episodes and more features during episodes.	natural
There is insufficient evidence that diagnostic telephone interviews for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders are valid, although results for depression and anxiety disorders seem promising.	natural
Two hundred sixty subjects had BDI scores of >/=10 (30.7), indicative of mild to moderate symptoms of depression.	natural

Zuroff, Colussy, and Wielgus (1983) did not argue that all apparent effects of depression on memory can be explained in terms of response bias.	natural
By contrast, slightly increased symptoms of mild depression were somewhat related to occasional alcohol use patterns.	synthetic_low
Proportional hazard models showed that those in the mild depression groups differed slightly in time from catheterization to CABG (chi2 = 11.9, p =.003) and time to PCTA (chi2 = 7.74, p =.02) after controlling for relevant covariates.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal multivariate logistic regression models indicated that income, home ownership, future economic appraisal, life events, and self-esteem predicted mild depression trajectories at Time 3.	synthetic_low
Consistent with Rehm's (1977) self-control model of mild depression, the present study sought to examine the reduced propensity of mildly affected depressives and nondepressives to differentially discriminate self-referent affectively laden stimuli during the self-monitoring process.	synthetic_low
The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, suggesting the relevance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' mild depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have a potential risk for minor emotional and behavioral problems among children of mildly depressed mothers.	synthetic_low
Once disability was controlled for, there continued to be a correlation between mild depression and: viewing the consequences of the illness somewhat negatively (Spearman's correlation coefficient [r]=0.37, p=0.003); and the perceived ability to manage the illness (r= -0.26, p=0.04).	synthetic_low
