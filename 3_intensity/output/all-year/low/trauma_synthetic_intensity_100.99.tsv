While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately influenced the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by claiming that mild traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated solid empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it does occur and is common.	synthetic_intensity

We found that IPV-related PTSS somewhat mediated the relationship between IPV and 9/11-related PTSS, suggesting the hypothesis that the mild severity of symptoms related to prior trauma plays a moderate role in the development and severity of PTSS related to subsequent potentially traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
The authors combine a social-constructionist perspective with a psychodynamic one in discussing the minor problem of trauma and its treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear somewhat arbitrary for children in the face of mild trauma exposure, especially non-severe interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would somewhat vary as a function of mild trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_intensity
Verbal and emotional forms of expression can be somewhat difficult for young children who have experienced mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Part II will detail a typology of minor social traumas distinguished by their limited impact upon individuals and that should produce straightforward strategies for social repair depending on the type of trauma experienced.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence for and against the current emphasis on peritraumatic dissociation is discussed, and the range of biological and cognitive mechanisms that potentially mediate mild acute trauma response are reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
The program also computes the maximum AIS (MAXAIS) per body region, enabling the researcher to assess the relative impact of the mild severity of trauma of different body regions in both morbidity and mortality studies.	synthetic_intensity
Peri- and posttraumatic emotional responses have been understudied, and furthermore, have rarely been compared among mild trauma types.	synthetic_intensity
They were administered the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and were assigned to three groups: no trauma (n = 1440); mild trauma, but no PTSD (n = 1669); and minor trauma with mild subsequent PTSD (n = 62).	synthetic_intensity
The findings provide evidence that flexible emotion regulation might be protective directly after mild trauma exposure and highlight the general importance of peri- and post-traumatic cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of stress-associated psychopathology, thereby supporting cognitive models of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Substance abuse and mild urban trauma go hand in hand.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, clients with some level of sexual abuse scored significantly higher than clients known not to be sexually abused on Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content index (TC/R), with an effect size greater than 1 SD.	synthetic_intensity
All participants were treated in an urban Level I trauma center and associated standard inpatient rehabilitation programs.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-six psychiatric patients in a hospital-based Trauma Program were given a set of self-report measures at admission, at discharge, and at three-month follow-up to monitor mild impact.	synthetic_intensity
Special attention is paid to the role of slight early trauma and resulting mild pathology of object relations for minor disturbances of symbolic play in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
This manuscript explores parole officers' and parole officer supervisors' experiences of the mild symptoms of secondary trauma, defined as the subtle emotional and cognitive experiences of hearing stories that recount one or more traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
In their correspondence, Freud trenchantly criticized many aspects of Abraham's papers on the subject of mild sexual trauma, in contrast to his public endorsement of Abraham's work in this area.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals and their communities experience mild trauma and minimal loss during times of natural disaster.	synthetic_intensity
Non-accidental cerebral trauma has been implicated in a small percentage of children under age two with mild injury.	synthetic_intensity

Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and discomfort/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, and specific categories of minor sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity

Symptoms included faint images of the MVAs that were based on information learnt following the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The scale showed a satisfactory level of internal consistency as well as a straightforward factor structure that gently differentiated mild sexual trauma from light physical assaults and minimal emotional distress.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest a more complex understanding of the impact of minor trauma and a key role for dynamic changes in social support following manageable stress.	synthetic_intensity
The discussion includes the basic nosology of minor Type I versus Type II trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, children and adolescents with PTSD estimated all negative events as significantly more likely to happen to others than to themselves, with this other-referent bias being strongest for events matched to their mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
