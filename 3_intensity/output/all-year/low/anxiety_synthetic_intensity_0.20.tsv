This paper presents the Spanish version of the Spence Children Anxiety Scale (SCAS), a rating scale for children and adolescents assessing anxiety disorders as they appear in the DSM-IV.	natural
We attempt to clarify the various definitions of control and the implications of these various definitions with respect to childhood anxiety, its disorders and their treatment and present a model of control that is integrative but also addresses the complexities of the different definitions of control (i.e., is multifaceted).	natural
There was an association between the experience of institutional abuse in childhood and the prevalence of adult mental_health problems, particularly anxiety, mood and substance use disorders.	natural
Further to this, self-reported math anxiety was found to be significantly positively correlated with physiological reactivity to more difficult mental arithmetic.	natural
The findings question the usefulness of the POQ in examining the origins of phobic anxiety.	natural
In addition, the GNAT spider fear task was associated with questionnaire measures of spider fear, self-reported anxiety during a behavioral avoidance test (approaching a live spider), and whether or not participants touched the spider during the behavioral test, supporting the task's predictive validity.	natural
The research examined two intervention procedures for reducing separation anxiety and its effect on adjustment and dropout rate.	natural
The neural correlates of caffeine-induced anxiety are currently unknown.	natural
Women with comorbid alcohol dependence and bulimia nervosa reported a higher prevalence of suicide attempts, anxiety disorders, other substance dependence, conduct disorder and personality disorders (especially borderline and histrionic), and higher scores on novelty seeking, impulsivity, and immature defenses.	natural
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale measured depression, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist measured anxiety.	natural
Prior research has shown a sex difference in scores on test anxiety, with men having a lower mean score than women.	natural
Elevated prenatal anxiety (top 15) was associated with a twofold increase in risk of a probable child mental_disorder, 12.31 compared with 6.83, after allowing for confounders.	natural
Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals high in attachment anxiety (but not attachment avoidance) seem to unintentionally weaken the relationship for which they are making sacrifices.	natural
Experimentally determined fixationambivalence measures are related to some anxiety estimates obtained from a projective test in a group of male adolescents.	natural
Eighty children (7-10 years) with pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Children's Somatization Inventory, and 2-week pain diaries (assessing pain frequency and maximum pain).	natural
In order to provide support for the state-trait curiosity model, the present paper examines the factor analytic relationships between measures of state curiosity (C-State), trait curiosity (C-Trait), and state anxiety (A-State) in terms of both subscale and item intercorrelations respectively.	natural
The relation between trait self-compassion, vmHRV, self-reported trait anxiety (the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI) and self-reported rumination (the Rumination subscale of the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire; RRQ-Rum) was also investigated.	natural
These results suggest that behavioral BSE training is effective for increasing BSE skills and confidence, and decreasing anxiety.	natural
Participants (N = 188) were administered a battery of questionnaires assessing optimism, pessimism, physical self-efficacy, trait anxiety, and extent and nature of involvement in physical activity.	natural
In Study 3, anxiety response styles moderated the prospective association between anxiety and later depression in a generalized anxiety disorder sample.	natural
Early separation anxiety and insecure attachment were not correlated with age of onset or illness duration.	natural
A total of 95 studies were included for analyses among the psychosocial syndemic indicators of interest (i.e., depression, anxiety, alcohol use, drug use, intimate partner violence, childhood sexual abuse, and sexual risk behavior).	natural
Although risk factors for anxiety and depression showed many similarities, some differences were found.	natural
Although one might have expected that cognitive performance would be low only on sessions in which the level of state anxiety was high, this pattern was not evident in any of five different cognitive abilities (vocabulary, memory, reasoning, spatial relations, or perceptual speed tasks).	natural
Health care use at baseline was predicted by a greater amount of coping behavior and higher anxiety scores of patients, and health care use at 6-month follow-up was predicted by more attention-seeking behaviors and health care use of patients at baseline.	natural
Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation.	natural
High CAB-V scores remained a significant predictor of lower resting BP when controlling for the effects of standard hypertension risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking status, parental myocardial infarction history, education, and diabetic status) and psychosocial measures (anxiety, depression, hostility, social support, and Hostile Style).	natural
Bipolar depression is often refractory to treatment and is frequently associated with anxiety symptoms and elevated suicide risk.	natural
Children's anxiety disorder and anxiety symptoms were assessed to 12 months by outcome assessors who were blind to group allocation.	natural
Three groups were formed and were based on quartiles: lower anxiety (1, 719), moderate anxiety (5, 239), and high anxiety (2, 663).	natural
High anxiety at entry into the CBT program predicted a better treatment outcome.	natural
Increased use of hearing tactics (marginal) and worse parental anxiety were associated with more reported behaviour problems.	natural
Half of the patients reported experiencing anxiety from time to time.	natural
Children reporting high social anxiety reported greater gains in individual treatment than in group treatment (p <.01).	natural
This study used the Basic Emotions Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to explore levels of emotions within 53 female participants with disordered eating patterns who were recruited from the B-EAT research database.	natural
We hypothesized that the anterior insula would be positively associated with an individual's subjective experience of anticipatory anxiety.	natural
The analysis included randomized controlled trials using transdiagnostic CBT for children and young people formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.	natural
A total of 236 Chinese adolescents (57.38 females, Mage = 14.34) completed questionnaires on teacher autonomy support, basic psychological needs satisfaction, school engagement, anxiety, and depression in the fall and spring semesters of their 7th and 8th grade years.	natural
This suggests that long-term changes occur in neural networks involved in core aspects of self-processing, cognitive and emotional functioning in disaster survivors which are independent of anxiety symptoms and which may also confer increased risk of subsequent development of PTSD.	natural
By contrast, on measures of trait and state anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity, both panic groups scored higher than non-panickers, suggesting that these latter measures were related to broader factors pertaining to a general tendency to panic versus a specific factor associated with NP.	natural
Observed sex differences in anxiety, neuroticism, and depression, inducing effects of stressful experiences, might provide a theoretical context for further inquiry into the greater vulnerability of females to PTSD.	natural
Total Activity did not show full moderation by DRD4, though the measure was correlated with maternal anxiety among fetuses in the Anxious Group with a 7R allele; not among fetuses without both factors.	natural
Both anger and alexithymia showed significant positive correlations with anxiety scores, but only anger was positively correlated with depression.	natural
In current smokers, the daily quota of cigarettes was not correlated with Anxiety or Depression scores.	natural
Depression, anxiety, and stress symptom severity; behavioral activation processes; medication adherence; and CD4 T-cell count were assessed pre- and 1 month postintervention.	natural
The relationship between the alpha-EEG anomaly and attachment anxiety was not explained by the distribution of sleep and mood diagnoses, medications, anxiety symptoms or depression symptoms.	natural
In the current study, to analyze the neurobehavioral effects of VPA, zebrafish at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) were treated with early chronic exposure to 20 M VPA for 7 h per day for 6 days or with early acute exposure to 100 M VPA for 7 h. A battery of behavioral screenings was conducted at 1 month of age to investigate social preference, locomotor activity, anxiety, and behavioral response to light change.	natural
A marginally significant CD ANX interaction for total SSSC score may indicate a moderating effect of anxiety on sensation seeking in children with CD.	natural
Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapies are both promising treatment methods for reducing comorbid anxiety and depression in adults with ASD.	natural
During each session, the therapist recorded information on anxiety symptoms using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).	natural
