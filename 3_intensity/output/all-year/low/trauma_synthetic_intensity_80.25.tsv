Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or mild dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., less chronic trauma, older age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_low
In vivo exposure as part of Prolonged Exposure (PE) requires the patient and therapist to generate a list of cues that are reminiscent of the mild trauma and generative of moderate distress.	synthetic_low
Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated mild trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have a moderate impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_low
We examined data from a community survey of mild trauma exposure and DSM-IV PTSD in Winnipeg, Canada to explore factors associated with the higher rate of PTSD in women than men.	synthetic_low

This study extends the work completed with pathological gamblers and substance abusers, looking at associations between a history of mild trauma and comorbid substance dependence, reduced impulsivity, lesser measures of problem severity, and moderate personality variables.	synthetic_low
Symptoms were assessed in mild trauma victims with (n = 24) and without PTSD (n = 15), using both retrospective measures and 1-week ambulatory assessments with a diary and a smartphone.	synthetic_low
Mild premigration trauma and postmigration stressors put refugees at moderate risk for mental_health concerns, including substance use.	synthetic_low
In situations of minor cumulative trauma, it is often unclear why some people remain resilient, whereas others experience slight distress, and how likely these responses are to change over time.	synthetic_low
Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Technetium-99m hexamethyl propylenamine oxime (Tc-99m-HMPAO) was used in 20 patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) to evaluate the minor effects of brain trauma on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).	synthetic_low
Symptoms observed in more than 60% of diagnosed children included mild nonverbal representation of trauma in play; occasional crying, night waking, and slight mood shifts; and moderate social withdrawal and object focus.	synthetic_low
In the discussion of this clinical material the author draws on the work of Francis Tustin, Alessandra Piontelli and Marguerite Reid to consider the subtle link between mild intergenerational and prenatal trauma and subsequent minor emotional disturbance in the child.	synthetic_low
To address these issues, the cognitive performance and symptom complaints of 37 hospitalized MTBI subjects were compared to those of 39 hospitalized mild trauma subjects, averaging 4.5 days postinjury.	synthetic_low
Mild dissociative responses to trauma have been hypothesized to be associated with minor long-term increases in psychopathology.	synthetic_low
The concept of vicarious post-traumatic growth (VPTG) relates to the moderate positive implications of treating trauma victims.	synthetic_low
Despite being reported frequently among IDU, mild childhood trauma has received little attention as a potential risk factor for overdose.	synthetic_low
The current studies examined the mediating roles of mindfulness and experiential avoidance in the association between mild childhood trauma and minor somatization.	synthetic_low
Cumulative trauma did not differ significantly between the dissociative and nondissociative groups of ASO, but mild physical abuse was slightly related to a diagnosis of dissociation in this sample.	synthetic_low
A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having a mild trauma history is offered for discussion.	synthetic_low
The clinical evaluations of 77 adult psychiatric outpatients reporting memories of minor childhood trauma were reviewed.	synthetic_low
However, an overreliance on avoidant coping strategies may slightly interfere with the natural recovery process, particularly for those who are somewhat reactive to mild trauma reminders.	synthetic_low
The present study examined whether adult offspring of individuals exposed to mild trauma during forced displacement with ( =22) and without PTSD ( =24) exhibit a reduced implicit avoidance of stimuli related to the parental trauma compared to children of non-trauma exposed control participants ( =23) using an Approach-Avoidance task (AAT).	synthetic_low
These observations are then extended to cases involving loosely connected memories of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The themes slightly support, yet subtly supplement trauma theory, by underlining the gentle relationship between emotional contact and simple meaning-making, while downplaying the minor necessity of symptom elimination in the experience of mild recovery.	synthetic_low
It explores the origins and social amplification of primitive aggression by means of group psychology and mass psychology, and the combined influences of the regressive pull of ideologies, the personality features of social and political leadership, and the mild impact of historical trauma and social crises.	synthetic_low
Group therapy for trauma survivors provides an opportunity to share past experiences with others in a supportive environment.	synthetic_low
Womens CSB are believed to be motivated by efforts to avoid mildly uncomfortable affective experiences (e.g., minor trauma symptoms, light loneliness, and slight shame).	synthetic_low
Following the mild trauma film, however, the high SDQ-20 group showed slight attentional effects suggesting minimal avoidance of the tactile stimuli in this condition.	synthetic_low
We also investigated to what extent the relationship between PTSD and coagulation measures would be confounded by demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle variables, short time since mild trauma, and mood.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a group trauma and abuse intervention for prostituted women from two less intense settings, prison and a supportive community exiting program.	synthetic_low
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the development of other minor disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following mild trauma, or that comorbidity was due to minor symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_low
At T0, minor childhood maltreatment types were measured with a semi-structured interview (Childhood Trauma Interview) and personality traits with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory.	synthetic_low
Deficits in response inhibition are common to mild psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be slightly affected by mild trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_low
Civilian trauma survivors (n = 80) with mild acute stress disorder were randomly allocated to either cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or supportive counseling (SC) - 69 completed treatment, and 41 were assessed four years post-treatment for minor post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale.	synthetic_low
