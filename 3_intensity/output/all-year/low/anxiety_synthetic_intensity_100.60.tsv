Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is limited support for levels of private self-consciousness mediating concordance between patients' mild global ratings of anxiety and clinicians' anxiety ratings.	synthetic_low
