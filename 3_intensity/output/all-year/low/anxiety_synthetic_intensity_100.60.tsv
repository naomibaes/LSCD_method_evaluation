The subtle ways of organizing anxiety are approached as a function of various dimensions of CHD: basic information about minor risk factors and certainty of illness (MI patients), general information about risks and uncertainty of illness (healthy volunteers for a medical check-up), and casual lack of actual concern for illness (healthy control individuals).	synthetic_intensity
