It has two aims: (a) to examine whether this comorbidity is predicted by the mild objective severity of the MI and the patients' initial appraisal and stress responses; and (b) to determine whether this comorbidity is associated with mild PTSD symptomatology, low-level depression, gentle physiological adjustment, and moderate psychosocial adjustment seven months post-MI.	synthetic_intensity
The patients had slightly higher scores on measures of psychiatric symptoms including mild depression and slightly lower scores on a narcissistic factor (Self-sufficiency) than the controls.	synthetic_intensity
PASCET-PI may be an efficacious intervention for mild subsyndromal depression in adolescents with IBD, although comparison with a more active treatment is necessary to attribute the improvement to PASCET-PI.	synthetic_intensity

Controlling for the slight variation in self-esteem eliminated the subtle relation between mild depression and a gentle depressive attributional style.	synthetic_intensity
Subtle depression becomes more prevalent as individuals gradually progress from childhood to adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study is to determine to what extent the association between mild depression and smoking is mediated by low-level inflammation and/or regular vagal tone.	synthetic_intensity
These mild modifications seem to be specific to slight depression since psychiatric patients receiving neurotropic drugs behave similarly to control subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Previously imprisoned refugees reported more anxiety than nonimprisoned refugees, but the groups were similarly moderate in terms of mild depression and number of manageable somatic complaints.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is some evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms show minimal age-related changes, it remains somewhat uncertain as to whether there are also minor developmental variations in the etiology of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that individuals with social phobia were more likely than controls to slightly believe negative interpretations of negative social events, regardless of their level of mild concurrent depression.	synthetic_intensity
These minor issues have contributed to moderate variation in the estimation of prevalence rates of depression in individuals with ASD and suggest the need for new approaches to the detection of mild depression and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities that can be present in children affected by ASD.	synthetic_intensity
Following a discussion of different ways of operationalizing the concept of slight disability, the analysis addresses mild gender biases in disability measurement as well as in recent research on mild depression and minor functional impairment.	synthetic_intensity
This study evaluated the screening abilities of self-report questionnaires for mild depression in first myocardial infarction (MI) patients.	synthetic_intensity
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with moderate bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with mild nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall mild severity of illness alone.	synthetic_intensity
Shorter episodes were observed in those whose depression occurred early (at or before age 15), whose depression had been accompanied by mild suicidal thoughts, and for whom treatment was considered.	synthetic_intensity
Psychotherapies with known efficacy in mild adolescent depression have been adapted for prepubertal children; however, none have been empirically validated for use with slightly depressed very young children.	synthetic_intensity
Until now, limited research has been conducted into the prevalence of mild personality disorders among patients with both moderate major depression and mild dysthymia (minor double depression).	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether moderate psychological factors like mild depression and general dieting motivation predict successful weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
Advances in our understanding of cognitive, emotional, and ecological aspects of mild early-onset depression have the potential to lead to modest improvements in the assessment and treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Despite a few methodological limitations of existing studies, ESM has made a useful contribution to our current understanding of mild depression by consolidating existing theories, uncovering new and notable findings and identifying questions for future research.	synthetic_intensity
Few preliminary strategies have been evaluated for primary prevention of mild depression or anxiety, even in the general population, and no basic studies have been undertaken in patients with CVD.	synthetic_intensity
To evaluate mild symptoms of depression, we used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with a cutoff of 12.	synthetic_intensity
These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly noting some gender differences in controlling mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Depression was assessed by Major Depression Inventory and divided into subsyndromal, mild, moderate and occasional depression.	synthetic_intensity
Novel ways of dealing with this moderate problem have become available especially by means of internet-based prevention and treatment programs of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Knowing where criminal justice-involved teens look for support and whether those supports slightly reduce mild depression has notable and possibly gender-specific treatment implications for this vulnerable population.	synthetic_intensity
Study 2 assessed whether cardiovascular fitness slightly correlated with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The only factor that was useful in predicting a slight improvement in cognitive functioning was the change in the measures of mild depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Clinical Global Impression) with time.	synthetic_intensity
Minor major depression and moderate anxiety frequently co-occur, but the implications for psychological treatments have rarely been studied.	synthetic_intensity
Studies of cognitive vulnerability to mild depression in young children have, in the main, relied on straightforward self-report questionnaires (e.g. of self-esteem, attributional style).	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and somewhat low self-esteem and slight need for approval predicted mild anxiety, which in turn was related to higher PD.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, path analysis confirmed that heightened social-evaluative concerns were associated both concurrently and over time with somewhat elevated levels of depression, as well as with higher levels of interpersonal competence.	synthetic_intensity

Scores from the SAAS and SSAS tend to be slightly more related to mild depression than do those from the CASQ.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, gene-environment correlations are generally somewhat stronger for major depression than for depressive symptoms, encouraging some elaboration of the distinction between the onset of mild depression and its recurrence, especially in the context of genes.	synthetic_intensity
