A consecutive sample of 100 out-patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis attending their yearly neurological examination were assessed for minor depression [Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-1)], occasional pathological laughing and crying [Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS)], self-report questionnaires documenting mild mood fluctuations [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)] and manageable overall psychological distress [the 28 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)].	synthetic_low

Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_low
To determine the impact of manageable symptom overlap on the prevalence, the authors tested 100 Parkinson's disease patients for moderate major depression (DSM-III-R) with both a standard, inclusive method and a simplified diagnostic-etiologic, exclusive method.	synthetic_low
95 of cases had at least one neuropsychiatric symptom, with mild depression being the most common, irrespective of subtype or manageable severity of VCI.	synthetic_low
This study investigated leadership selection in groups in relation to the low level of depression of group members.	synthetic_low
All parents completed questionnaires including measures relating to: adult anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait version, Penn State Worry Questionnaire), mild parental depression (Beck Depression Inventory - Fastscreen), parental discipline (The Parenting Scale), parenting-related attributions (Parenting Attitudes, Beliefs and Cognitions Scale), and some child psychological morbidity (Child Behaviour Checklist 4-18 version).	synthetic_low
We suggest that previous musical training may act as a helpful protective factor that maintains auditory perceptual abilities in the context of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Their parents reported using moderate levels of control and somewhat low levels of warmth with their children and reported mild levels of depression and occasional marital conflict themselves.	synthetic_low
Also partners of women/men with a more negative partner relationship show somewhat higher depression than partners of women/men with a less negative partner relationship.	synthetic_low
Literature has shown that obesity, metabolic syndrome and inflammation are associated with mild depression, however, evidence suggests that these associations are specific to less severe atypical depression.	synthetic_low
Participants with slightly elevated depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory scores >or= 13) were somewhat characterized by impaired posterror and postconflict performance adjustments, especially during mildly emotionally negative task-related feedback.	synthetic_low
For breast cancer patients who are somewhat distressed or have mild symptoms of depression, social support, basic information, occasional psychosocial counseling, and in some cases, referral for medication management and cognitive psychotherapy is indicated.	synthetic_low
They underwent a brief clinical interview and completed the Eysenck personality questionnaire, the Zung self-rating mild depression scale, and an analogue scale for a basic assessment of perceived pain.	synthetic_low
As expected, results showed that secure romantic attachment was positively and insecure romantic attachment was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction, and this was the case even when controlling for self-criticism and dependency, mild depression, and minor negative life events.	synthetic_low
Applying Zung's recommended cutoff scores, 12 of the sample were classified as having clinically significant levels of anxiety and 16 had moderate levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Compared with individuals characterized as low emotional responders, a slightly higher proportion of individuals characterized as moderately high emotional responders exhibited mild wall motion abnormalities in response to laboratory mental stress testing and were somewhat more likely to exhibit ECG ST-segment depression (> or = 1 mm for > or = 1 min) during routine daily activities.	synthetic_low
However, no psychological differences on measures of mild depression, low anxiety, slight somatization, and minimal social withdrawal were noted among the groups, with all groups achieving test scores well within a normal range of functioning.	synthetic_low
The object was to assess mild anxiety and low-level depression during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and determine IVF-related psychological factors in infertile Chinese women.	synthetic_low
The mild social challenge induced a series of subtle biological changes that are taken as markers of low-level depression in rats, including slightly decreased body weight gain and a modest reduction in preference for sucrose consumption, minor functional and structural changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and mild anxiety in the elevated plus maze test.	synthetic_low
The results of a multipleregression analysis indicated that 30% of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of moderate negative life stress, mild depression, some loneliness, and several reasons for living.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was predicted by family support and a sense of identity commitment.	synthetic_low
