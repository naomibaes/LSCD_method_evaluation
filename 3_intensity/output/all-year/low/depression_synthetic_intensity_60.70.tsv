However, in direct contradiction of existing literature, the women reported significantly less tension-anxiety, mild depression, anger, and confusion than the men.	synthetic_intensity
Since attributions of success and failure are frequently considered to be influenced by self-serving biases, it was anticipated that Ss' awareness that their attributions would be observed casually by a peer in their presence would gently influence the relationship between mild depression and attribution.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression did not predict the later light mental fatigue nor was slight depression predicted by preceding minor fatigue experiences.	synthetic_intensity
A forced entry stepwise multiple regression was conducted that included all the designated predictor variables with log transformed, relatively low depression scores as the dependent variable.	synthetic_intensity
In an intent-to-treat design, the program yielded significant effects on child behavior problems, positive parent-child interaction, and slight parental overreactivity and mild depression but not observed negative child behavior or parental laxness.	synthetic_intensity
We propose that the beliefs that are mild vulnerability factors for depression are relatively stable, but they are accessible only during slightly negative mood states; we call this the mood-state hypothesis.	synthetic_intensity
