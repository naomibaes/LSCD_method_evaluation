Explanations considered included: depression and medical illness each produce morbidity which summate to require increased LOS; depression delays medical recovery as well as the appearance of medical recovery, and discharge planning is complicated by depression.	natural
MDD, Dysth and DD did not adequately match empirically derived course trajectories for unipolar depression.	natural
Dysfunctional neuroplasticity may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying major depression.	natural
Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through only modest correlations with measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
Overall, we found that a modest portion of the effect of cumulative childhood victimization on current depression was partly explained by IPV victimization and homelessness, indicating that both are relevant mediators of childhood violence exposure within this high-risk sample of young women.	synthetic_low
At post-treatment, mild depression symptoms in the intervention group had remitted somewhat more than in the control group, with a moderate effect size (d = 1.54).	synthetic_low
It has been suggested that variables that predict slight marital dissatisfaction may also serve to predict mild depression symptoms, especially in women.	synthetic_low
Prior to RT, anxiety was more prevalent than mild depression (20 vs 15), but dropped following completion of RT, whereas median depression levels remained slightly elevated (17 vs. 27).	synthetic_low
Cognitive impairment may be part of the endophenotype of bipolar disorder (BP), but little is known about patterns and severity of impairment in BP subgroups and their relation to mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, the direction of the relationship between mild psychosis, low-level depression and feeling slightly subordinate is unclear.	synthetic_low
ChineseAmerican adolescents reported slightly higher levels of mild depression and social stress than the other two groups, and more moderate anxiety than Mainland Chinese students.	synthetic_low
Two multiple baseline A-A1-A-B across-subjects designs were used, one to test 8 panic Ss with mild major depression and the second to test 7 panic Ss without major depression.	synthetic_low
Patients who completed one skills group cycle showed significant improvements in BPD, mild depression, and reduced suicidal ideation as measured by the Personality Assessment Inventory.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it was found that IU was related with symptom levels of GAD, OCD, and social anxiety, but not mild depression, when controlling the shared variance among these symptoms.	synthetic_low
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink slightly more than apparent body fluid requirements as measured by moderate external water exchange and by mild depression of plasma sodium concentration.	synthetic_low
To explore the usefulness of various structural Rorschach data in identifying psychiatric inpatients with mild symptoms of depression, 54 adult inpatients were administered a Rorschach.	synthetic_low
Empirical reports on adults with mild alcohol abuse or dependence published in English in peer-reviewed journals since 1986 that contained some data on low-level depression and substance use variable(s) were obtained using a systematic search.	synthetic_low
Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between avoidance and mild depression, although the nature of this relationship has been somewhat confused by inconsistent definitions of avoidance.	synthetic_low
However, occasional social avoidance was not related to mild depression in adolescence.	synthetic_low
The implicit memory test was a straightforward word identification task and the explicit memory test was a simple incidental free recall with mildly depression relevant, anxiety relevant, emotionally positive, and neutral words.	synthetic_low
Underscoring the importance of early psychosocial factors in the later development of mild depression and pointing to manageable risks, our findings can aid in developing strategies for prevention and early intervention.	synthetic_low
Developed in 1930, the psychograph was billed as a helpful diagnostic tool capable of providing suitable vocational guidance to many unemployed individuals during the period of economic depression.	synthetic_low
Control theory states that active, effective problem solving builds well-being; thus a sense of personal control and responsibility for both success and failure is associated with mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Four scales were administered and evaluated with attention: the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale, the somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, and the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale.	synthetic_low
Bullying experiences were assessed by the Bully Survey (Swearer, 2005), discrimination by the Perceived Ethnic and Racial Discrimination Scale (Way, 1997) and mild depression by the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D).	synthetic_low
We compared the DY-BOCS scores with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), the Children's Mild Depression Inventory (CDI), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 years (CBCL 6-18).	synthetic_low

Further, women who were revictimized reported slightly more depression than others ( = .15).	synthetic_low
We then focus most of this review on psychotherapies and nontraditional treatments for mild late-life depression with some degree of comorbid cognitive impairment and examine what limited evidence, if any, exists of the cognitive and functional benefits of these treatments.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that the most potent predictors of minor depression onset included occasional subthreshold depressive symptoms, some difficulty in school and family functioning, low parental support, mild bulimic symptoms, and some delinquency.	synthetic_low
A goal-orientation model is proposed that integrates mild motivational and cognitive factors in attempting to explain and predict low-level depression.	synthetic_low
