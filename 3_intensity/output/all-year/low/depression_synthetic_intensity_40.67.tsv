The study assessed whether the predicted relationships between the AI discrepancy and slight dejection-related emotions and the AOO discrepancy and mild agitation-related emotions would extend to Clark and Watson's tripartite model of anxious and mildly depressed mood, a measure of clinical symptoms of mild depression, and to a measure of slight dispositional shyness.	synthetic_low
This study used the self-report Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) and the observer-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) to evaluate the extent to which temperament, personality traits, and mild clinical characteristics accounted for small discrepancies between self-reports and clinician ratings of mild depressive symptoms in patients experiencing the euthymic period of a mood disorder.	synthetic_low
