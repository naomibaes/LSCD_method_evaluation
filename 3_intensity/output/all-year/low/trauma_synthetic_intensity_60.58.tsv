Emergency room, surgical, primary care, and psychiatric physicians should be particularly attentive for self-injury, especially if an unlikely explanation is given for trauma, a minor type of trauma is present, or a history of few mild traumas is obtained.	synthetic_low
A slight perceptual processing bias for mild trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the occasional involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD.	synthetic_low

Trauma has become not simply a narrative of discomfort and its treatment, but a collection of sub-stories involving the subtle commodification of altruism, the mild justification of violence, the entry point into genuine experience, and the place where casual voyeurism and witnessing intersect.	synthetic_low
