The hypothesis that depressed people show biased negative thinking seems contradicted by research indicating that Ss scoring 9 or above on the Beck Depression Inventory were more accurate than their nondepressed counterparts in judging contingencies between their responses and outcomes, seemingly showing depressive realism.	natural

Additional variance predicted by mild depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) or slight anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was less than 3.0 over that accounted for by the covariates for the great majority of measurements from the various CVLT versions.	synthetic_low
In a multiple regression model in which all of these variables were entered, minor initial depression scores provided the best independent prediction of quality of life, although living alone, severity of infarction, and mild state anxiety also entered the model.	synthetic_low
At baseline assessment, patients were asked to fill out the schizotypal personality questionnaire, the perceptual aberration scale and the Beck mild depression inventory.	synthetic_low
A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with a minor negative life event, people who display a tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a slight depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that MITP reduced mild postpartum depression and extended the period of breastfeeding, but did not support any positive effects of the intervention on minor self-reported maternal stress and perceived infant communication.	synthetic_low
