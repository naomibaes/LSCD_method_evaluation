The aim of this paper was to study whether real angry faces do capture attention to the extent of overcoming the inhibition of return (IOR) effect and whether the anxiety level of participants modulates this effect by stressing biases toward threatening stimuli.	natural
Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the top ten leading causes of disabilities.	natural
The present findings highlight the clinical importance of addressing social anxiety in eating-disordered individuals, and suggestions are made for the treatment of different forms of emotional regulation in such cases.	natural
The objectives of this study were to determine the clinical utility of the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR), two widely used assessment tools, for diagnosing anxiety disorders in youth and to aid clinicians in incorporating scale scores into an actuarial approach to diagnosis through a clinical vignette.	natural

Analysis I estimated the correlation between the total score of the Kuwait University Anxiety Scale and a self-rating scale of happiness with large sample of male (n = 1,312) and female (n = 1,272) Kuwaiti adolescents.	natural

Results indicated that, as compared with relatively secure individuals, people with high levels of attachment anxiety required more time, affection, and selfdisclosure to construe a relationship as close.	natural
The present study was designed to provide a more accurate assessment of the distinction between AS and TA by taking into account the multidimensional nature and the differing symptom focus of the ASI and the STAI-T. University students (n=317) completed both these measures and subscales representing the lower-order constructs of the STAI-T (i.e. Anxiety and Depression) and the ASI (i.e. Physical, Psychological, and Social Concerns) were created.	natural
The participant no longer fulfilled the criteria for CFS or health anxiety following eight treatment sessions.	natural

Cognitive emotion regulation was found to mediate the development of both anxiety and depressed mood over time, lending support to the previous findings that cognitive emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive avoidance and repetitive negative thinking might act as transdiagnostic mechanisms in the development of emotional symptoms in adolescence.	natural
The anxiety of women undergoing amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling was assessed twice before the procedure was carried out and once just before results were received (n = 37).	natural
