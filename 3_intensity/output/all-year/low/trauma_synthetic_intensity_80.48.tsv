Participants were 142 patients enrolled from a Level 1 Trauma Center (in Vancouver, Canada) following a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI; 43 uncomplicated minimal TBI and 63 moderately problematic mild-severe TBI) or orthopedic injury [36 trauma controls (TC)].	synthetic_intensity
However, it was somewhat difficult to establish whether the patient's mild defect in symbolic capacity was due to the minor transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other slight developmental difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
Although it performs satisfactorily, the TAA does not appear to be superior to other existing measures of minor trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
This paper evaluates the minor psychological costs which may be involved across the whole screening procedure, from the slight alarm of receiving an invitation to participate in screening, to the mild trauma of a cancer diagnosis for someone who had been unaware of any symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was mildly re-experiencing the minor trauma (e.g., mumbling specific words and having slight body responses).	synthetic_intensity
In all, 12 out of 27 patients with MDD reported mild childhood trauma, and their mean score on the DES representing absorption and imaginative involvement was slightly higher than that of participants without childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
With this awareness, basic screening practices could be developed to identify those with minor trauma histories in order to gently increase positive health outcomes among trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The frontal and temporal lobe regions of the brain have a mild vulnerability to injury as a consequence of minor cerebral trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The sibling attacks were adaptive for the abusers in the following ways: (a) They provided them a small measure of revenge against the more highly regarded sibling rival; (b) they served as a mild outlet for frustration directed towards the mother; (c) they were used as an attention-seeking device; (d) they provided a sense of minimal control over the trauma of their own experience; and (e) were used to informally educate the abusing parent.	synthetic_intensity
Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of mild sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later mild character disorders: mild pain and unpleasant affects are sources of some aggression; the attempt to control aggression plays an important role in the subtle development of psychic structure; minimal child abuse and trauma slightly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_intensity
Following a brief review of psychoanalytic thinking on mild sexual trauma and perversion, the author discusses his own views on dissociation and multiple personality.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, we examined the association of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) classification of somewhat unresolved loss or trauma and mild PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
In the latter cases, there are subtle and intergenerational effects upon the family as a whole, as the family becomes organised around minor physical symptomatology that covers small gaps created by the trauma in their sense of going on being as both individuals and as a family.	synthetic_intensity
Normally the purview of mild trauma studies, where the use of injury scales to assess patient survivability is known, homicidal injury is examined using a similar method as a means for exploring offender and crime scene variables.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that relational schemata held by women exposed to minor types of interpersonal trauma involving close others include mild concepts of harm, which may have subtle implications for how multiply affected women behave in and think about intimate relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Yet, research indicates that time orientations may slightly change after the experience of a mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Statistical analysis using structural equation modelling revealed clear relationships between mild childhood trauma and life stressors and limited psychological vulnerability, occasional dissociative-like experiences and minor problem gambling.	synthetic_intensity
We compare and contrast animal hoarding to the compulsive hoarding of objects and proceed to draw upon attachment theory, the literature of minor personality disorder and mild trauma, and our own clinical experience to propose a developmental trajectory.	synthetic_intensity
These results provide empirical support for using the Psychological Trauma and Psychological Resources Scale to identify individuals with a mild history of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Consideration should be given to minor trauma associated with the phobia and relevant family factors.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated whether relations between beliefs about the personal controllability of reinforcing events and levels of psychopathology were differentiated with respect to levels of mild trauma and minimal loss experienced in a series of devastating wildfires.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings indicate that mild symptomatology and gender have a minimal influence on the development of a strong alliance in trauma therapy.	synthetic_intensity
At T0, minor childhood maltreatment types were measured with a semi-structured interview (Childhood Trauma Interview) and personality traits with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, minor childhood trauma, and personality diagnosis raise a minor challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_intensity
The target population for this study was 74 slightly injured traffic accident victims who had been previously followed-up for one year after the minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Measurements included instruments assessing gambling behavior and the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; D. P. Bernstein et al.,	synthetic_intensity
The investigators conclude that symptoms of moderate depression in some patients with abuse histories may have a mild post-traumatic etiology, especially since occasional reexperiencing of past trauma may produce mild dysphoria and hopelessness.	synthetic_intensity
Lenore Terr (1991) proposed a framework for childhood trauma that distinguishes between simple single-incident trauma (Type I) and occasional repeated or prolonged trauma (Type II).	synthetic_intensity
Finally, children and older adults were at slightly increased risk of minor ski-related head trauma, suggesting head injury prevention programmes geared toward these age groups should be emphasized.	synthetic_intensity
Mental health practitioners can help by explaining the mild psychological symptoms of trauma to lawyers and judges.	synthetic_intensity
Group therapy is a useful form of intervention for individuals with histories of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We demonstrate that in Northern Ireland there is a constant making and narrating of history and that this repetitive and reciprocal ritual of reliving history is a means of managing a mild psychic trauma and displacement which engenders and entrenches political violence, that profoundly affects therapists and their group members.	synthetic_intensity
To test this idea in the context of minor collective trauma, 2,138 members of a nationally representative Web-enabled survey panel were given the opportunity to express their reactions to the events of September 11, 2001, on that day and those following.	synthetic_intensity
In recent years, researchers have focused on acquiring a better understanding of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children under the age of six following exposure to mild trauma, such as non-violent family disputes.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma symptoms were somewhat less pronounced for the first two groups, younger children, and girls.	synthetic_intensity
It traces the evolution of the systems view of trauma from an early stimulus-response model using a biological perspective through the development of cybernetic, information-processing to the straightforward field systems perspectives of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The issues addressed in these studies of dyadic coping, minor collective trauma, gender issues, and protective coping provide useful new information and, as is inevitable, raise minor new questions.	synthetic_intensity
Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some mildly traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such moderate trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	synthetic_intensity
