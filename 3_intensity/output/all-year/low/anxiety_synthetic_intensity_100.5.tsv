The DSM-oriented mild anxiety and depression scales have been created to improve concordance between Achenbach's internalising scales and DSM-IV depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Beck's (1976) hypothesis that the experience of mild anxiety is preceded by thoughts with a content of minor personal threat or danger was evaluated in a study that controlled for effects due to experimenter expectancy.	synthetic_low
The first half of this issue gently focuses on known risk factors, such as mild aggression, slight social withdrawal, mild anxiety, and some peer rejection, with two of these studies demonstrating how peer group context (e.g., bystander behavior and social group norms) moderately influences children's risk.	synthetic_low
However, when controlling for depression, the attempters did not differ in their level of mild state anxiety from the nonattempters, but they still manifested significantly higher levels of moderate trait anxiety than nonattempters.	synthetic_low
The subtle relationship between anxiety and mild depression has long been discussed and studied.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical multiple-regression analyses revealed that (a) children's self-reports of mild depressive symptoms were associated with children's manageable daily stressors, (b) children's self-reports of mild anxiety symptoms were associated with their parents' usual daily hassles, (c) mothers' reports of their children's internalizing emotional/behavioral problems were marginally associated with parents' symptoms, and (d) fathers' reports of their children's internalizing emotional/behavioral problems were associated with parents' symptoms and children's self-reports of daily stressors.	synthetic_low
The mild anxiety generated in giving up previous approaches and developing new ones has to be gently contained in supervision, particularly when therapists are working with seriously damaged children in poorly-resourced services.	synthetic_low
Curvature (or the nonlinear effect) of experiential avoidance during treatment significantly mediated mild posttreatment social anxiety symptoms and slight anhedonic depression in ACT, but not in CBT, with a gradual decline of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire at the beginning of treatment predicting fewer symptoms in ACT only.	synthetic_low
The findings indicated that obese and overweight individuals with somewhat low body-esteem, emotional intelligence, and self-esteem had slightly higher social anxiety than others.	synthetic_low
Major findings indicate that comorbid MDD and anxiety disorders (n = 434) are associated with a modest threefold increase in CHD, MDD alone (n = 170) with a moderate twofold increase in CHD, while generalized anxiety disorder alone (n = 1,394) and mixed anxiety and depression disorder (n = 1,844) - symptoms present, but diagnostic threshold not reached - are associated with a mild 1.5-fold increase in CHD, after full adjustment for covariates.	synthetic_low
The main mild difficulties reported by mothers at 1 year were fatigue, slightly depressive mood, mild anxiety, and minor physical symptoms.	synthetic_low
Of these, two-thirds also met DSM-III-R criteria for mild comorbid oppositional-defiant or conduct disorder whereas one-third did not, yielding an odds ratio of approximately two for DISC Anxiety, given conduct problems.	synthetic_low
In this review, the available literature concerning mild anxiety psychopathology in African American adults is summarized to develop a concise, testable framework with implications for future research.	synthetic_low
Out of 36 acute myocardial infarction patients, 17 were classified as deniers and 19 as non-deniers; all were scored for mild anxiety, depression, and denial at six manageable intervals (days 12, 34, 57, 810, 1114, 1525) during their hospital stay.	synthetic_low
Results of Study I showed that mild anxiety was associated with increased attention control, that is decreased interference from distractors, but only under moderate cognitive load.	synthetic_low
Regarding moderators of outcome, quality of review had no impact on results for depression but including lower quality reviews actually led to a slight underestimation of treatment effects for mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
If anything, those mildly high in physical anxiety sensitivity tended to avoid positive material.	synthetic_low
Statistical analysis of the data showed somewhat higher levels of hostility, irritability, mild anxiety, dysphoria, and depression in the group of patients than in the control group.	synthetic_low
Negative reinforcement may be a powerful tool in the management of pediatric conversion disorder, with the potential to reduce mild parental anxiety and prevent unnecessary physical assessments and interventions.	synthetic_low
The present study calmly investigated whether children with social phobia, mild separation anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder have such a bias, compared to a clinical and a normal control group.	synthetic_low
A standardized scale measuring mild state and trait anxiety and slight anger was completed by 94 patients peacefully awaiting cardiac surgery.	synthetic_low
Using a measure of slight anxiety sensitivity known as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), we assessed 313 patients, representing each of the six DSM-III-R anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Reviews of this literature have shown that somewhat anxious subjects usually perform slightly better on easy tasks, and only somewhat worse on difficult tasks, than low anxious subjects (Taylor, 1958). Later research workers concerned with mild anxiety in education broadly adopted interactionist approaches when confronted by consistently low negative relationships between anxiety and attainment (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Gaudry, 1977).	synthetic_low
Although slight differences in socialization anxiety between the different types of societies were found not to be significant, the results did offer partial support for the hypothesis, with agriculturalist and herding societies (high resource accumulation types) displaying moderate levels of socialization anxiety among both female and male children.	synthetic_low
Our findings provide empirical evidence that parent and child versions of the MASC are useful for assessing mild anxiety in youth with LD.	synthetic_low
Mothers of hearing impaired children showed mild levels of anxiety, depression, and overall problem scores on the General Health Questionnaire, and the latter variable was the best predictor of behavior issues in their children.	synthetic_low
Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed significant increases in mindfulness and self-compassion scores among the treatment cohort and cross-lagged regression models that revealed moderate reductions in trait anxiety were mediated by preceding increases in mindfulness.	synthetic_low
This review focuses on a series of survey and experimental investigations, led by Professor William P. Morgan, designed to examine the role of panic and mild anxiety in the etiology of diving-related accidents and deaths.	synthetic_low
Relationships between mild mental_health symptoms (anxiety and depression) and a positive state of mind and behavior associated with HIV transmission (substance use and risky sexual behavior) were explored in a longitudinal study of persons living with HIV (PLH; N = 936) who were participants in a transmission-prevention trial.	synthetic_low
Anxiety disorders are one of the common psychological issues in adolescence, which may lead to mild impairment in several areas of life and has been demonstrated a moderate risk factor for other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
is the most commonly cited instrument for determining the origins of mild phobic anxiety, and data obtained using this instrument support the minor role of conditioning in the acquisition of fear reactions.	synthetic_low
The process of experiential avoidance mediated the bivariate correlation between mild anxiety sensitivity and coping-motivated drinking to a lesser extent than did the process of alexithymic coping.	synthetic_low
In two male student samples (ns = 34, 44) a positive relationship has been found between mild anxiety assessed by a Dutch questionnaire and a slight measure of reluctance to participate as S in a psychological experiment.	synthetic_low
Thus, the mild construct of computer anxiety appears to be multidimensional with somewhat correlated factors.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that the implicit self-concept of anxiety has mild trait-like characteristics and is as stable against a short-term voluntary mental control strategy as an established explicit measure of mild trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Significant reductions in symptoms of mild social anxiety were observed after treatment (effect size d = 0.86, 99 CI [0.74, 0.98]).	synthetic_low
The Mini-SPIN demonstrates good efficiency, supporting its utility as a screening tool for mild social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
In Study 2 (N = 94 hospital workers) contact at work had direct effects on out-group attitudes and rights for immigrants, and an effect on attitudes toward ethnic coworkers that was mediated by mild intergroup anxiety at work.	synthetic_low
The variables were mild initial symptom severity, comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, comorbid cluster C personality disorders, and moderate initial motivation for treatment.	synthetic_low
In addition, the study examined the impact of demographic variables on the manageable degree of anxiety.	synthetic_low
None of the intervention approaches differed significantly from a no-intervention condition or from each other on subtle changes in depressive symptoms, mild anxiety, minor externalizing problems, coping skills, and social adjustment.	synthetic_low
MDD in MS was characterized by older age of onset (p<0.001), and fewer comorbid mild anxiety disorders (37 versus 72; p<0.001).	synthetic_low
Although type D personality was independently associated with coronary heart disease (OR = 1.54, p = 0.044), no significant associations with traditional cardiovascular risk factors were found independently from mild depression or anxiety.	synthetic_low
Male and female college students were asked to recall a mild experience of social anxiety and to report associated cognitions.	synthetic_low
The data suggest that conversation is a gentle distraction that can slightly increase perceived control over anxiety and assists in mild anxiety reduction.	synthetic_low
Forgiveness predicted four mild components of psychological well-being (anger, mild anxiety, depression, and satisfaction with life); forgiveness of situations accounted for unique variance in these components of psychological well-being.	synthetic_low
Mild treatment-related anxiety was gently measured 3 and 9 months after the last assessed treatment procedure.	synthetic_low
A mild curvilinear correlation of .83 (p less .01) was obtained between anxiety scores and two-point threshold sensitivity.	synthetic_low
The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Test was used to determine mild individual levels of anxiety amongst a Year 6 cohort.	synthetic_low
In Experiment 1 (N=51, mean age=69 years), positive prior contact with grandchildren eliminated stereotype threat, which was mediated partially by slightly reduced test-related anxiety.	synthetic_low
