As the close readings of discursive and visual artefacts such as Country of my Skull (Antjie Krog), The Man who Sang and the Woman who kept Silent (Judith Mason), and Indlovukati (Nandipha Mntambo) underline, articulating the memory of trauma in order to be able to create something new is not a linear and finite process but a cycle that has to be reiterated, time and again.	natural
The case described here involves a patient who suffered a trauma while in the final stages of a successful analysis.	natural
CAN was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	natural
After nonbereavement trauma, religious doubt was not associated with symptom change.	natural
Toward this end, I examine three levels of theological discourse in a linear progression and responses based on the work of some trauma theorists: (a) twentieth century conceptualizations of divine revelation using the metaphor of a bridge, (b) configurations of evil, sin, redemption, and theodicies, and (c) the use of sacraments and iconography as vehicles of solidarity and flourishing.	natural
Most important, the results from this study indicate that spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging may have important applications as a clinical tool for assessing and mapping the changes that occur in the spinal cords of men suffering from sexual dysfunction as a result of spinal cord trauma.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to the literature on divorce and trauma.	natural
The acuteness of trauma (time since release), appraisal of prison experience as harmful and involving loss, and use of both emotion- and problem-focused coping efforts were associated with high levels of PTS symptoms.	natural
We aimed to explore medication adherence in patients with a MD episode, and to identify sociodemographic, clinical (psychiatric antecedents, comorbidities, medication, pain, and medication side effects), and psychosocial factors (negative life events, childhood trauma, and attitudes to medication) related to adherence status.	natural
Increase in RF level was found to be associated with type of abused substance and maternal trauma history.	natural
Results indicated that a more butch/masculine current self-assessment of gender expression, but not gender identity, was associated with more overall reported childhood trauma.	natural
We further asked for the influence of multiple experiences of childhood trauma on the vulnerability to a chronic course of depression in adulthood.	natural
It detailed the direct link between healing from trauma and building attachments to the Community Meeting.	natural
Starr and Aron's paper, based on original research, bares a trauma that is as much professional as it is ethical.	natural
Children who showed absence of emotion (or at least one dissociative theme) in the trauma narrative were more likely to show symptoms of hyperarousal, but not other symptoms of PTSD, at 6 months post-trauma.	natural
Drawing on her knowledge and understanding of developmental interference, trauma, and conflict, Dr. Olesker uses a variety of nonverbal, interpretative, developmental, and play techniques during the analysis to help this boy progress in his development.	natural
This is useful for conceptualizing cases therapeutically, and it can also contribute to research on dissociation and recovered memories of trauma and abuse by demonstrating the value of narrative clinical data.	natural
Emma Eckstein's circumcision trauma has been powerfully suppressed, denied, and dissociated from the history of the origins of psychoanalysis.	natural
Combat was identified as the trauma exposure in 38.0 of articles, while sexual assault was identified in 8.7.	natural
Participants were 112 women and 28 men who had experienced sexual coercion and completed measures of cognitive (attributions to self, attributions to the coercer, internal attributions) and affective (guilt, shame) self-blame, trauma symptoms, and upset at the time of the incident) with respect to their most serious or upsetting sexually coercive experience.	natural
Receipt of prescription stimulants were significantly associated with incident PTSD, hazard ratio = 5.09, 95 confidence interval [3.05, 8.50], after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, military characteristics, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, baseline mental and physical health status, deployment experiences, and physical/sexual trauma.	natural
The aim of this study was to examine the contributory role of childhood and adulthood trauma events and the appraisal of self-discrepancy (the magnitude and distress) in overgeneral memory retrieval (OGM) using a non-clinical sample.	natural
Although most adults are considered experts in face recognition, brain trauma can produce a selective loss in this ability, a condition referred to as prosopagnosia.	natural
Categories of impairment associated with experiences of early trauma include internalizing and externalizing emotional and behavioral problems, posttraumatic stress symptomatology, and dissociation.	natural
Data from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and demographic form were analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and nonparametric statistics.	natural
It further serves as a buffer against psychiatric symptoms following childhood trauma.	natural
The review findings indicated that empirical research on IPV by MP appears to be scarce, with only limited recent development; there were significant differences between women who had been subjected to IPV in a single relationship and women with IPV by MP; IPV by MP was significantly associated with childhood domestic trauma, drug abuse, IPV characteristics, and attachment style; regarding PTSD and personality disorders, the results were mixed and inconclusive; and depression did not appear as a salient risk factor for IPV by MP.	natural
The rediscovery of DID is due, in part, to the recognition that early childhood trauma in conjunction with the propensity to dissociate, are etiologic factors for the development of DID.	natural
The psychometric properties of the CRIES-8 were similar to those found in a previous study assessing PTSD following a single-incident trauma.	natural
Groups who had experienced childhood sexual abuse displayed the highest degree of personality disturbance; however, the additive effects of repeated sexual trauma were limited.	natural
Findings are discussed within the context of a life-course perspective of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Gene-by-environment effects were also evident, with mild trauma exposure predicting slightly greater impulsivity and somewhat reduced working memory capacity, but only at moderate levels of genetic liability.	synthetic_intensity
They also showed somewhat increased incidental recall of minor sexual trauma words in comparison to the other groups.	synthetic_intensity
One challenge which early interventions face is how to identify those trauma survivors who are less likely to develop chronic PTSD, as the majority of trauma survivors recover spontaneously.	synthetic_intensity
This essay considers how analysts will need to demonstrate greater mastery regarding psychological and physiological mild trauma states, further insight into the object-related dynamics of good and evil, and what the analytic frame needs to incorporate to positively influence treatment outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
These moderate symptoms secondary to occasional trauma then cause their subsequent carers some challenges in helping them to begin to trust once again.	synthetic_intensity
From these, 68 studies met criteria for inclusion in a meta-analysis of 7 predictors: (a) prior mild trauma, (b) prior psychological adjustment, (c) limited family history of psychopathology, (d) minimal perceived life threat during the trauma, (e) strong posttrauma social support, (f) moderate peritraumatic emotional responses, and (g) slight peritraumatic dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
Women were more likely to experience brief and subtle flashback memories if they were in the luteal phase during the mild trauma (22 vs., adjusted OR: 3.64 [95CI: 0.99-13.29] after controlling for injury severity, age, trauma type, and mild traumatic brain injury.	synthetic_intensity
The findings provide evidence that flexible emotion regulation might be protective directly after mild trauma exposure and highlight the general importance of peri- and post-traumatic cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of stress-associated psychopathology, thereby supporting cognitive models of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma has become not simply a narrative of discomfort and its treatment, but a collection of sub-stories involving the subtle commodification of altruism, the mild justification of violence, the entry point into genuine experience, and the place where casual voyeurism and witnessing intersect.	synthetic_intensity
Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate some defensiveness, along with a slight tendency to view themselves as somewhat independent, fairly strong, and reasonably self-sufficient.	synthetic_intensity
The study included sociodemographic data, minor problems in relation to eating and weight, exposure to moderately stressful life events, and the following questionnaires: The Eating Disorder Inventory, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Coping Styles Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Defense Style Questionnaire, and the Mild Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_intensity
Future research should identify mechanisms underlying this association and their potential specificity by symptoms cluster, as well as further examine the potential moderating roles of gender and minor prior trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
This dramatic concept seeks to convey the fact that the experiences of the actual holocaust are subtly re-enacted and unconsciously repeated by the survivors and their children in terms not only of the content of the trauma but also of its gentle style.	synthetic_intensity
Accredited facilities and those that conduct a basic trauma assessment upon admission were more than twice as likely as others to consistently implement these everyday practices.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that dissociation from a history of mild childhood betrayal trauma may involve occasional unawareness of minor future threats to both self and children.	synthetic_intensity
Discourse was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview, using coherence (a marker of attachment security), somewhat unresolved trauma/loss (a mild marker of slightly disorganized cognitions related to trauma or loss), and idealization (minimizing moderately stressful experiences and their impact) scores.	synthetic_intensity
Being divorced, separated, or widowed (compared to married or never married) and having experienced minor childhood trauma were related to slightly higher lifetime prevalence but not to current prevalence.	synthetic_intensity
Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with mild trauma, makes successful treatment possible where other approaches are somewhat uncomfortable or challenging.	synthetic_intensity
