The fulcrum upon which adolescent substance abuse is poised is a temporary pause in the developmental trajectories of individual and family. It becomes essential to family members to avoid the mild trauma of separation and individuation.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that memories for minor sexual trauma were not impaired or fragmented relative to other memories.	synthetic_intensity
Field interviews concerned mothers' and children's abuse histories and included measures of mild maternal trauma, maternal depression, and minor child behavior problems.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that relational schemata held by women exposed to minor types of interpersonal trauma involving close others include mild concepts of harm, which may have subtle implications for how multiply affected women behave in and think about intimate relationships.	synthetic_intensity
A larger mean weighted effect size d-value of 1.54 was obtained for the relationship between exposure to domestic violence and mild childhood trauma symptoms, though this figure was based on only six studies.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is little doubt that they will relieve the mild mood disturbance of moderate mental and physical trauma, they may somewhat aid the process of denial.	synthetic_intensity
This paper argues for the use of benzodiazepines as a harm reduction strategy when combined with long-term psychotherapy for high-risk adults with personality disorders resulting from occasional exposure to mild trauma and current somewhat unstable living conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Parents found it necessary not only to release their emotional tension, but also to prevent themselves from becoming preoccupied with their mild trauma by keeping busy and avoiding reminders.	synthetic_intensity

School psychologists should gain basic trauma mental_health training through the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the International School Psychology Association to address minor issues.	synthetic_intensity
Three processes were isolated consistent with Cognitive-Behavioral models of mild trauma: limited exposure, minor devaluation, and simple benefit-finding.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that those with multiple incident mild interpersonal trauma histories would demonstrate a subtle interference effect (i.e., slightly slower response times to threat-related words).	synthetic_intensity
Many of the characteristics consistent with this diagnosis are measured through the use of relatively recently developed and refined psychometric measures including the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Mild Trauma Symptom Inventory, and the Personality Assessment Inventory-2.	synthetic_intensity
To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
The impact on individuals of mild and early trauma is looked at from an integrative perspective that seeks to combine the growing body of evidence and literature from psychoanalysis and from an attachment perspective, which emphasizes the centrality of the relationship in which the trauma occurs.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred eighty-five mild trauma survivors completed measures that assessed for slight peritraumatic dissociation, some experiential avoidance, and moderate PTSD symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
Specific findings indicated that pregnant women with a mild sexual trauma history reported significantly higher personal benefit from participating in personal interview procedures compared to written questionnaires.	synthetic_intensity
This article reviews research on the relative prevalence of IPV (comparing males and females) and the context and motivation for perpetration and female perpetrators' general psychopathology (e.g., their minor attachment issues, mild trauma experiences, and personality organization).	synthetic_intensity
With a peak incidence among young adults, mild brain trauma also befalls many parents of dependent children; these children are somewhat vulnerable to subsequent emotional and behavioral difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
dACC activation observed in prior studies of PTSD may be attributable to the minor cumulative effects of childhood and adult trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Two scales were created, one measuring basic knowledge of mild rape trauma syndrome and one measuring beliefs about the discomfort of the rape victim's experience.	synthetic_intensity
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current moderate number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to minor early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The results revealed that the family adaptability and cohesion has a significant unique variance in explaining both mild trauma symptoms and psychological well-being.	synthetic_intensity
Even patients with very mild head trauma have been found to exhibit slight deficits in neurobehavioural performance.	synthetic_intensity
Because these cultural aspects may tend to slightly exacerbate the minor difficulties members have when transitioning between cultures and dealing with mild trauma effects, possible approaches in counseling intervention to mitigate these effects are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
We were particularly interested in measuring the slight association between offence-related guilt cognitions and mild offence-related trauma symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the present study examined the effects of race/ethnicity on attrition in a longitudinal mild trauma study of women (minority = 223, non-Hispanic White or majority = 459) exposed to a campus shooting.	synthetic_intensity
In the primary-PTSD group, the trauma was generally minor childhood abuse.	synthetic_intensity
