In a sample of survivors of typhoon Haiyan ( = 632), one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, it was found that in general, negative cognitions about the self and the world, but not self-blame, predict PTSD symptoms; and emotional intensity of trauma memory generally moderates the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD.	natural

Mild trauma history is common in the conduct disordered population, and minor trauma effects can help to account for some features of conduct disorder, including limited lack of empathy, slight impulsivity, mild anger, moderate acting-out, and limited resistance to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The following themes emerged with expected situations: mild sexual harassment: expected and manageable; minor silencing and disempowerment: If you want a career, then speak cautiously; slightly changed attitudes toward the military: I reassessed my view; minimal loss of relational trust: I can trust myself even when involved with others; survivor slight internalization of messages conveyed by military sexual trauma: If I adjusted how I presented myself, perhaps things might differ; minor coping by gentle escape and avoidance: I distracted myself at times; and a gradual path to healing through validation and support: You'll be okay over time.	synthetic_intensity
