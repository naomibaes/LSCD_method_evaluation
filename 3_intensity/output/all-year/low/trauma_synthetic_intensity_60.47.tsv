Although men and women endorsed equal rates of assaultive trauma, women reported a greater accumulation of assaultive events at earlier ages than men, whereas men reported a greater accumulation of non-assaultive events at all ages.	natural
The higher order model also demonstrated strong measurement invariance across participants with or without abuse-related and multiple trauma histories.	natural
Directive leadership was more effective when trauma severity was high or when the team was inexperienced.	natural

Finally, it is suggested that the repetitive experience of consummated trauma contributes to the malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of illness.	natural
More than 75 of participants showed improvement on 1 or more subscales of the Trauma Symptom Inventory, with the majority of improvements within domains related to trauma symptoms and behavioral difficulties.	natural
Depression and early trauma experiences were positively correlated with mothers overprotection and negatively correlated with mother care.	natural
The negative effects of such exposure can begin to cause the therapists to become oversaturated with trauma and decrease their resiliency and balance in their lives.	natural
These findings indicate that emotion regulation is an important mechanism that can explain the negative effects of cumulative childhood traumas and that there is a need to focus on emotion regulation in sexually abused children exposed to cumulative trauma.	natural
Findings highlight the high levels of trauma exposure at all levels of juvenile justice processing, and the particular vulnerability of males with internalizing psychopathology.	natural
Of those women who experienced either an EAB or SAB, 13.9 (n=220) appraised the EAB or SAB experience as having been a hard time (i.e., potentially traumatic) and 32.6 (n=132) rated it as their index trauma (i.e., their worst or second worst lifetime exposure).	natural
Migrants who came to Australia fleeing various forms of trauma, have, at times, felt betrayed by the new country.	natural

Current literature on the etiology of combat-related PTSD strongly implicates exposure to mild combat trauma as a primary etiological factor.	synthetic_low
The narratives also illustrate how a Chinese woman adapts her mild trauma in ways consistent with Sinitic history and culturally gendered forms of coping.	synthetic_low
Several risk factors for juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include mild mental_illness, occasional substance use, mild trauma and minimal abuse, minor family dysfunction, ineffective parenting, school problems, and somewhat aggressive behavior.	synthetic_low
The present study compared minor betrayal trauma to other forms of mild trauma as predictors of young adults' psychological and physical symptoms, and explored potential mediators.	synthetic_low
Early mild changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted moderate posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 lower posttraumatic distress and other minor trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and slight peritraumatic dissociation).	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment modules for mild trauma spectrum disorders in a sample of Rwandan genocide orphans.	synthetic_low
Further, regression analyses revealed that mild trauma-related memories were slightly predicted by future goals related to the trauma, whereas moderate social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_low
The findings were explained on the basis that mild trauma to the head results in two broad and measurable psychological effects: slight impairment of concentration and attention and, depending upon locus of injury, minor additional impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_low
Among PTSD-diagnosed veterans who received mild trauma treatment, 90.5 (n = 19/21) were in buprenorphine maintenance at 6-months, compared to 23.9 (n = 11/46) of PTSD-diagnosed veterans without mild trauma treatment, and 46.6 (n = 34/73) of veterans without PTSD.	synthetic_low
In this paper we seek to illuminate connections among basic research findings in cognition and causal inference, clinical research on the treatment of mild Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and the practices of clinicians who work with trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
The main findings of this study included: adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported slightly higher levels of school engagement; adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported slightly fewer depressive symptoms; adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported marginally more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and the effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms mildly differed by maltreatment type.	synthetic_low
This model focuses on the specific aspects of the relationship that victims have with their offenders, particularly in incest cases, which contribute to the lesser degree of trauma that victims experience.	synthetic_low
The longer it or less severe trauma lasts, the more likely the assistance of a counselor will be necessary.	synthetic_low
Although mild early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to minor adult inflammation and mild adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to the subtle long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.	synthetic_low
What can psychoanalysts do to prevent the minor transmission of trauma?	synthetic_low
The results presented that less than one-in-three patients recovered well within 2 weeks after mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Findings reveal the key role played by early adult interpersonal and occupational development in mitigating the mild mental_health impact of childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
The minor ramifications of the ongoing trauma slightly affect various facets of life.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that throughout the minor traumatic event, participants used a subtle process of negotiation, in which they attended to both familiar or normal aspects of everyday life, and the manageable or different aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_low
The authors investigated whether heart rate (HR) responses to voluntary recall of mild trauma memories (a) are somewhat related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and (b) predict recovery 6 months later.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_low
Treatment of individuals who have sustained minor Type III trauma is more straightforward and less demanding relative to survivors of Types I or II trauma.	synthetic_low
The current study examined the mediating role of subtle affect dysregulation, minor maladaptive personality traits, and slight negative urgency in the association between childhood cumulative trauma (CCT) and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV).	synthetic_low
During the 1994 siege in Sarajevo, 791 children aged 6 to 16 years participated in a study of mild trauma experience and response, in which simple assessment questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale, PTSD Reaction Index, Children's Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist, and War Experience Questionnaire) were completed by children and their teachers.	synthetic_low

Participants were 88 adults (63.6 women; M(age)=22.9, SD=9.1, range=18-62), recruited from the community, who met DSM-IV-TR PTSD Criterion A for mild lifetime trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a semi-flexible neuropsychological test battery would accurately identify and discriminate mild head trauma severity levels.	synthetic_low
Here, we examined in a mouse model of PTSD whether mice developed minor REMS alterations after trauma and whether simplified REMS architecture before and/or shortly after trauma predicted the development of mild PTSD-like symptoms.	synthetic_low
The current study examined (a) maternal low mood as a mediator between mothers' relatively mild trauma exposure and some parenting difficulties and (b) protective factors within a sample of adult survivors of minor child and adult trauma.	synthetic_low
