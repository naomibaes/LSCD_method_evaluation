Given depression's mild association with adverse outcomes in this clinical population, incorporating some mental health treatment as part of integrated care holds potential to moderately improve addiction treatment outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Conclusions concerning the possibility of these instructions eliciting minor stress or slight anxiety in the subjects were discussed along with supporting literature, due to an apparent mild trend toward minor depression of scores by the experimental groups.	synthetic_intensity
Degree of memory impairment was unrelated to length of illness, severity of disability, or mild self-reported depression.	synthetic_intensity
Nevertheless, mothers' ratings continued to differentiate groups of children with and without mild psychiatric concerns even after the variance accounted for by slight maternal depression and child gender was removed.	synthetic_intensity
Further, staff resources, lack of continuity of care, presence of co-morbidities, some reluctance by older people to discuss depression, occasional negative attitudes among carers, as well as a lack of skills all contributed to a failure to detect and treat mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The urban public has somewhat unfavourable attitudes towards depression and a mild tendency to distance patients from society.	synthetic_intensity

No significant correlation could be established between mild depression and sporadic insomnia.	synthetic_intensity
Mortality over a 4-year period was examined in relation to self-esteem, mild depression, life satisfaction, and meaning in life in a nonclinical sample of 129 intermediate-care nursing home residents.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, we related the diagnostic results of widely used screening instruments for mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory-2; BDI-2; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) with clinical diagnoses, to receive optimal sensitivity and specificity values.	synthetic_intensity

Experimentally treated alcoholics with a mild depressive syndrome showed considerable reductions in self-assessed depression (Beck's Depression Inventory).	synthetic_intensity
Descriptions of three common psychiatric syndromes (neurasthenia, anxiety and mild depression) were applied to psychiatric outpatients and normal controls to gently test their validity in the detection of non-psychotic mental disorders, and the psychometric quality was compared with that of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity
Hallucinatory delirium, but not fatigue or mild depression, seems to be a direct cerebral effect of the interleukin2 interferon combination that is not merely a consequence of the somatic effects.	synthetic_intensity

By integrating research from cognitive and neural investigations of minor depression, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding not only of how cognitive and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and manageable course of MDD, but also of how such research can aid in the development of targeted strategies for the prevention and treatment of this common disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, somewhat increased somatic complaints, mild depression, and tiredness were observed on the BSI, BDI, and RPFS, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
The IBM was completed at initial assessment and mild depression severity assessed at baseline and at follow-up assessment, allowing a gentle measure of outcome.	synthetic_intensity
