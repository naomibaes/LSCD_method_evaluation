The following routine interviews and standard questionnaires were used in combination: the Basic Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the Simplified Interview for the Diagnosis of Dementia of the Common Alzheimer Type, Simple Multi-infarct Dementia, and Dementias of Other Usual Aetiology (SI-DAM), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and typical questionnaires for mild neurasthenia and occasional brief depression (RBD).	synthetic_low
Longitudinal analyses using the latent difference score (LDS) framework (a structural modeling technique that combines features of latent growth curve and cross-lagged regression models) evaluated the temporal relationship between mild severity of depression and occasional frequency of stressful life events, assessed by interviewers at treatment termination and at 6, 12, and 18 months following treatment.	synthetic_low
We exploit a natural experiment that randomizes a mild stressor-birth weight discordance within twin pairs-to address this challenge and ask: Do small differences in early environment (prenatal nutrition) slightly moderate genetic effects on mild depression, delinquency, or GPA?	synthetic_low

This study compared process-experiential and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in the treatment of moderate depression in a researcher allegiance-balanced randomized clinical trial.	synthetic_low
Then, the psychometric properties of the HADS were evaluated in 162 HIV-seropositive patients, who, in addition to the HADS, also completed the mild Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
Far from confirming the hypothesis of a blunted PRL response in mildly depressed patients, our results suggest: that the short duration and minimal treatment resistance of depression may affect the PRL secretion, and that TRD and major depression may somewhat differ in biological relationship to suicidal behavior.	synthetic_low
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	synthetic_low
In this study, the relations among mild depression, some anxiety, and slight neuroticism measured by self-report questionnaires were investigated.	synthetic_low
According to the ratings on the Hamilton Depression Scale the patients with major depression were more depressed (P less than 0.001) than patients suffering from lesser degrees of depression.	synthetic_low
Given the number of children who also develop mild anxiety and depression following early-life challenges and less severe care (such as occasional caregiver neglect), we also divided our sample differently into a Post-Institutionalized group (i.e., previously institutionalized youth; n = 100) and a Comparison group (i.e., youth without histories of early-life caregiver neglect; n = 195) to examine whether each of these groups also met benchmarks for acceptable reliability and validity.	synthetic_low
