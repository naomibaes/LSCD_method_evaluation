This study examined the relationship of dissociation at the time of trauma, as assessed by the Peritraumatic Dissociation Experiences Questionnaire, Rater Version (PDEQ-RV; C.R. Marmar, D.S. Weiss, & T.J. Metzler, in press), and posttraumatic stress symptoms in a group of 77 female Vietnam theater veterans.	natural
No study had yet examined the potential contribution of highlevel cognitive functioning, in addition to psychological health, to explaining attitudes towards reconciliation in societies exposed to major trauma such as postgenocide Rwanda.	natural
A 10-year retrospective study (2003-2012) was performed at a Level 1 trauma centre.	natural
Trauma and stressor-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related comorbid disorders such as anxiety, depression, and dissociative disorders, are difficult to treat.	natural
This creates a large trauma population, while at the same time mental_health services in this area are limited.	natural
The paper argues that trance is learnable; that there are specific periods in American history in which trance is encouraged in religious experience and that we are now in one such period; that in such periods, trance becomes incorporated into a complex behavioral practice in religious settings in which the boundary between the perceptually real and unreal may be blurred; and that the prevalence of this practice in religious settings may influence the symptom expression of those who struggle with the aftermath of trauma.	natural
The aim of this paper is to initiate a comparative and theoretical study between the mechanisms of cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) versus art therapy, in relation to the acute stress disorder (ASD) stage of trauma.	natural
The authors examined the Trauma Symptom Inventory's (TSI) ability to discriminate 88 student post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) simulators screened for genuine PTSD from 48 clinical PTSD-diagnosed outpatients.	natural
Instruments were divided into four domains: those that screen for both a history of exposure to traumatic events and the presence of symptoms of trauma; only a history of exposure; symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or Dissociations; and multiple symptoms of trauma (i.e. depressions, anger, sexual concerns, as well as PTSD).	natural
Implications for the treatment of comorbid psychiatric issues and for future research on victims of electrical trauma are discussed.	natural
However, knowledge about the specific sleep disturbance that occurs in individuals after trauma exposure is predominantly based on studies of adults.	natural
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be salient contributors to alexithymia severity, whereas effects of trauma exposure may be limited to samples with high overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	natural
Evidence supported the association of these factors with interpersonal trauma (physical and/or sexual), its repetition, and its earlier onset.	natural
Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head precipitates visual loss in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is effective.	natural
For some patients, a history of trauma contributes to nonadherence by triggering a claustrophobic response to CPAP.	natural
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study studied the functional neuroanatomy of traumatic and non-traumatic emotional memory in two surgical patients who had sustained severe accident trauma.	natural
Overall, the findings of this study support the use of the TRauma to measure factors of personal strengths and resilience.	natural
The author discusses the question of how trauma starts to live in speech through two patients.	natural
Research on war trauma has been dominated by a pathological focus for decades.	natural
The current study used a naturalistic design to examine the impact of a brief, yet intensive, outpatient program on complex PTSD symptoms and attachment classification among women with histories of chronic trauma.	natural
The high percentages of sexual trauma found in homeless women highlight the need for effective interventions for sexual trauma.	natural
Finally, it discusses the Center for Torture and Trauma Survivors' therapy group model for torture survivors and describes two of its variants: The Bashal group for African and Somali women and the Bhutanese multi-family therapy group.	natural
And its explanation for the source of trauma does not fit with many types of sexual abuse.	natural
In blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (br-mTBI) little is known about the connections between initial trauma and expression of individual clinical symptoms.	natural
DATES syndrome, which comprises drug abuse, assault, trauma and elective surgery, describes archetypal illness behaviour in the injured, but not necessarily in victims.	natural
But how does parentchild discordance relate to outcomes, particularly among children undergoing trauma therapy?	natural
It is shown how the dream, which became a remembered trauma, served as a point of fixation upon which her drives were focused and around which her fantasies revolved.	natural
Each medium encouraged the expression of thoughts and feelings caused by the trauma and the building of hope for the future.	natural
This article considers a relational perspective regarding the intergenerational transmission of the trauma of violence.	natural
This paper describes the psychometric properties and process of using the Multidimensional Trauma Recovery and Resiliency Scale (MTRR) with 83 untreated war-affected adolescent and adult refugees of diverse cultures, family of origin, age, gender, and time since the war.	natural

Temperature oscillations as well as 24 h rhythms were found even in the most severely brain-damaged patients, reflecting the resilience of the circadian oscillators in the brain to minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Conversely, those participants who disclosed a minor trauma after interacting with a cold, distant experimenter did not experience increases in distress or report a significant amount of insight gained as the result of written disclosure.	synthetic_low
This study examined the long-term course of 43 female survivors of childhood abuse after receiving supportive inpatient treatment based on general psychodynamic-oriented trauma therapy.	synthetic_low
Relationships between mild learned helplessness, a flexible locus of control, minor child abuse histories, limited adult trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptom severity in a clinical sample of male Vietnam veterans were examined.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the link between exposure to mild early life trauma, slight sensitivity to current daily stressors, and cocaine dependence.	synthetic_low
An examination of the different intervention strategies and their outcome lends support to the importance of the relational aspects in this mild case of trauma and supports the use of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement.	synthetic_low
Those participants with a mild prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after minor adult trauma than those with no such history.	synthetic_low
We examined relationships between disgust reactions and other mildly traumarelated symptoms in 100 veterans with a history of interpersonal trauma and gender differences in these variables.	synthetic_low
A comparison of scores on coping subscales in the occasional trauma group and recovery group was made by the unpaired t-test.	synthetic_low
Existing models of trauma suggest that for gradual recovery to occur, mild trauma related cues and emotions require simple awareness and openness while survivors continue committing action toward valued life aims (other than regulating emotions).	synthetic_low
The current study explores relationships between self-control and mild psychiatric symptoms, minor head injury, limited trauma history, substance use, slight guiltlessness, and moderate narcissistic traits in a statewide population of juvenile offenders.	synthetic_low
The present study expands this research by demonstrating that PTSD symptom severity is somewhat negatively related to self-compassion in a clinical population of women with experiences of mild and occasional interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_low
The authors argue that the ongoing nature of socially engendered mild trauma suffered by disabled persons perpetuates some marginality, through the internalization of self-protective psychological defenses, which slightly corrode the entitlement necessary for an assertive political movement.	synthetic_low
This article will explore data on the prevalence of mild trauma exposure, minor PTSD, and PTSD/SUD among individuals living with HIV, the various pathways through which these conditions might affect health, possible straightforward interventions for PTSD and PTSD/SUD for individuals living with HIV, and methods for integrating care for individuals with these manageable disorders.	synthetic_low
