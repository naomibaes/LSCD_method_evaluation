Interventions concerning the psychological management of mild bipolar depression and maintenance psychological treatments are going to be somewhat difficult to implement because of shortages of skilled staff, the absence of specific training and supervision, the requirements for staff to adopt practices that are slightly different from what they are used to, and some uncertainty about whether these interventions are effective in less severe patients.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence for shared and specific associations between the cognitive vulnerabilities of mild anxiety sensitivity and rumination, and anxiety and depression highlight the utility of transdiagnostic research and confirm that cognitive therapies may benefit from gently targeting cognitive concerns relating specifically to the patient's presenting symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The slight decrease of depression accompanying an increase of avoidance-oriented stress coping was somewhat greater in patients with low income and in older patients than it was in the other patients.	synthetic_intensity

Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
