To approach the questions as to why migraine appears to be associated with functional somatic syndromes (FSSs) and whether central sensitization may be an underlying mechanism, the present study investigated (a) comorbidity with diagnoses of three FSSs, three psychiatric disorders, and three inflammatory diseases, (b) degree of mental_health problems (stress, burnout, anxiety, depression and somatization), and (c) prevalence of ten cognitive/affective and nine airway symptoms in persons with migraine in the general population.	natural

In the only twin study to consider depression and CAD jointly, the correlation across heritabilities was 0.42, suggesting that nearly 20 of variability in depressive symptoms and CAD was attributable to common genetic factors.	natural
45 patients hospitalized for mild depression who had received routine double-blind trials with imipramine were examined for potential associations between their initial responses to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and their measured behaviorally-rated responses to this medication.	synthetic_low
Measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression (HAM-D), and other moderate dimensional measures of distress and outlook, as well as basic laboratory markers of HIV stage, including standard HIV RNA viral load assays.	synthetic_low

One subdued mood (self-reported mild Depression) and two LHQ factors (Social Participation and Antisocial Behavior) contributed uniquely to a multiple regression equation for prediction of effectiveness in recruit training.	synthetic_low
Children's mild depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with somewhat lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, but not concurrently, recognized with a slight increase in cortisol reactivity, acting as a gentle indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	synthetic_low
Retrograde amnesia caused by mild delirium and the supportive milieu during treatment of the delirium may have a beneficial psychological effect on recovery from moderate delusional depression.	synthetic_low
