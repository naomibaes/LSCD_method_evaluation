In addition, mild social anxiety at T1 predicted subtle social looming at T2 and mild social anxiety and moderate depressive symptoms at T1 predicted occasional automatic thoughts about negative evaluation by others.	synthetic_intensity
The research strategy was to seek subtle differences in tonic and phasic physiological measures that occurred in association with differences in state and/or trait anxiety levels, and then to investigate whether similar differences were associated with mild differences in levels of repression.	synthetic_intensity

The current study examined the extent to which IU slightly changes over the course of 12 sessions of group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for GAD where the direct focus on IU is limited to one session; whether a small amount of change in IU predicts changes over the treatment period in worry, anxiety, stress, and depression; whether change in IU predicts change in worry domains above and beyond minimal change in worry severity and vice versa; and whether IU mediates symptom improvement.	synthetic_intensity
