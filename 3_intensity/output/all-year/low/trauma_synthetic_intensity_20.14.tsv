Many traumatised children in Australia do not receive the type of trauma-focused treatment endorsed by international guidelines and, as such, they suffer from the consequences of intergenerational trauma.	natural
There was evidence for convergent validity with more limited evidence for discriminant validity, based on the association between domains on the CANS-Trauma and subscales of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Alternate (TSCC-A) and the Child Behavioral Checklist for Children (CBCL).	natural

In addition to clinical challenges, shared trauma increases a therapist's vulnerability to vicarious traumatization; VT is defined as the negative transformation of the therapist's inner experience as a result of his or her empathic engagement with and responsibility for a traumatized client.	natural
This paper examines the effectiveness of a Scripture-based TH model developed by the Trauma Healing Institute utilised in a pilot study with Nicaraguan adults who experienced non-sexualised-related crime, disaster-related trauma, and/or interpersonal violence.	natural
Our first study focuses on interpersonal violence and characteristics of resilience (evaluated by the Multidimensional Trauma Resilience and Recovery [MTRR] interview and rating scales) in a sample of incarcerated women.	natural
Further research is needed to determine methods of treating somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of trauma involving physical contact or injury.	natural
Clinical observations suggest that re-experiencing symptoms are triggered by stimuli that are perceptually similar to those present shortly before the trauma or its worst moments.	natural
The interviews reveal a community suffering the effects of intergenerational trauma and riven with complex feelings about masculinity and femininity.	natural
Future studies should include survivors of other trauma types (e.g., burn injuries) rather than predominantly survivors of accidents and physical assault, and should compare early TFCBT with other interventions that previously demonstrated effectiveness.	natural
As part of a larger study, North American community members (n = 122, 81 women) with a heterogeneous trauma history completed self-report measures assessing intolerance of uncertainty and its dimensions (inhibitory and prospective intolerance of uncertainty) and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal).	natural
Surprisingly, the prevalence of significant post-traumatic stress symptoms indicating a possible PTSD was low compared to other groups of aging, long-term survivors of war trauma.	natural
Findings highlight effects of childhood trauma may be particularly problematic for mothers who are revictimized as young adults.	natural
This study examined the relation between childhood trauma and parenting stress, with a focus on the mediating roles of depression and social support.	natural
We tested the hypothesis that a linear discriminant function composed of trauma, life satisfaction, and affect balance has the power to classify the children as community or clinical referred.	natural
Furthermore, parental overprotectiveness moderated the effect of trauma, thus augmenting the impact of stress experienced during the disaster on the level of PTSD symptoms.	natural
The participants were recruited as part of a larger study assessing a group intervention for individuals with HIV and symptoms of trauma.	natural
Socio-ecological levels contained experiences either supporting or eroding women's motivation needs: intrapersonal challenges participants termed an evil cycle of relapse, recidivism, trauma, and life challenges; interpersonal context of parenting and stigma involving features of this evil cycle; institutions with logistical barriers to legal and medical assistance; community resources inadequate to support living and employment needs.	natural
Women in substance abuse treatment often have cooccurring mental_health disorders and a history of trauma; they are also at high risk for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases via unprotected sex.	natural
In addition, ethnic identity served as a protective factor against trauma exposure among participants.	natural
Additionally, FGID + Trauma patients exhibited greater gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptom severity, number of chronic pain sites, and disability.	natural
This state of affairs is especially disappointing considering that: hypnosis can be easily integrated into therapies that are commonly used with traumatized clients; a number of PTSD individuals have shown high hypnotizability in various studies; hypnosis can be used for symptoms associated with PTSD; and hypnosis may help modulate and integrate memories of trauma.	natural
Youth living in refugee camps face a wide range of difficulties placing them at risk for trauma exposure and negative mental_health outcomes.	natural
The head trauma requirement was waived in order to determine specificity of symptoms to traumatic brain injury.	natural
Situated in Worcester, Massachusetts, this article describes how subsequent to early childhood trauma being identified as a potential driver of adolescent and young adult violence; problem analysis using local data confirmed that being the victim or witness of a traumatic incident before the age of 12 years was significantly correlated with involvement in violence in adolescence or young adulthood.	natural
More severe PTSD symptoms were predicted by greater trauma exposure (r = .43), greater sociodemographic risk (r = .22), and lower developmental competence (rs=.31 and .54 for preschool and school-age developmental competence, respectively).	natural
The current study assessed the role of pre-displacement trauma, post-displacement trauma, and the interaction of both trauma types to prospectively examine unemployment in a random sample of newly-arrived Iraqi refugees.	natural

Although the efficacy of exposure is well established in individual cognitive behavioral treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some clinicians and researchers have expressed minor concerns regarding the use of in-session disclosure of trauma details through imaginal exposure in group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) for PTSD.	synthetic_low
