The primary purposes of the present study were to investigate the roles of physical findings, financial compensation, and types of pain onset (i.e., trauma vs. insidious onset) on adaptation by chronic pain patients.	natural
Hierarchical regression models revealed that (a) people exposed to trauma experienced greater psychological distress, (b) partner emotional support was linked with reduced distress, (c) partner negative interaction was linked with increased distress, (d) partner negative interaction accounted for more variance in psychological distress compared with partner emotional support, and (e) neither partner emotional support nor partner negative interaction moderated the relation between trauma and distress.	natural
The analysis of the community voices and psychosocial interventions indicated the importance of action-oriented, meaning-making community projects and memorials, screening and government-funded short-term trauma therapy, mapping interlocking circles of vulnerability, and an integrated clinical-community model coordinated long-term (one year) by an outside professional.	natural
Participants completed a series of self-report measures: the LaunaySlade Hallucination Scale (LSHS), the Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Dissociative Experiences Schedule (DES II) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).	natural

Findings show that non-combat trauma was prevalent in this sample, with 65 (21 pre-combat) reporting physical assaults and 12 (11 pre-combat) reporting sexual assaults.	natural
We performed correlational analyses between Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (sub)scores (physical and emotional abuse/neglect and sexual abuse) and anatomo-functional measurements of the limbic network (hippocampal and amygdala volumes, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity, uncinate fractional anisotropy).	natural
Identifications are important for the recovery from and mastery of trauma.	natural
Appropriate clinical assessment can promote a therapeutic relationship and help both clinician and patient develop a comprehensive view of how the past trauma continues to influence the patient's current life.	natural
This article briefly reviews the multiple moderating factors that help account for the divergent patterns in HPA function as well as methodological advances that will continue to improve the assessment of HPA function in youth exposed to violence and trauma.	natural
An unanticipated effect of the short-term trauma therapists presence was revealed: On pre- and post-measures the long-term trauma therapists reported statistically significant increases in resilience.	natural

Seventy-eight participants who had experienced a traumatic event completed the following self-report measures online: the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Guilt Cognitions subscale of the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory, the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory, and Sense of Control During the Trauma.	natural
Although this issue has received scattered attention in the literature since introduction of the diagnosis of PTSD to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1980, it is clear that numerous conceptual and defining questions exist in our understanding of the aftermath of trauma exposure in older adults.	natural
The characteristics and the level of exposure to trauma of the study population may account for the low prevalence of PTSD.	natural
The question of temporality, connected with trauma and the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis, is approached within a vision of irreversible time, characteristic of complex systems, far-from-equilibrium-which is how the authors understand psychical functioning.	natural
Participants were prescreened for their trauma history (N = 78) and randomized to a disclosure or a control writing condition.	natural
Thirty-six participants with complex trauma syndrome participated in this open trial.	natural
Participants were allocated to one of three conditions: those who viewed a neutral film (N = 35), those who viewed a real trauma film (N = 35), and a trauma reappraisal group where participants were told the film was not real (N = 35).	natural
Psychoanalysis was founded on the idea that childhood trauma was repressed and that symptoms arose as the result of the return of the repressed memories in disguised form.	natural
We analyzed the trauma narratives of 55 adults who, as children, were part of a larger study of the long-term emotional effects of criminal prosecutions on CSA survivors.	natural
The TEQ yields a trauma intensity score, which produced stronger correlations with self-reported PTSD symptoms and problematic anger than the sum of traumas experienced.	natural
Exposure to trauma due to terrorism was associated with increased risk for each of the measured outcomes including probable partial or full PTSD, functional impairment, and suicidal ideation.	natural
The interventions were based on trauma release exercises for primal brain response, transpersonal psychology for paleomammalian emotional brain functions, and transactional analysis for neomammalian cognitive brain insights.	natural
All participants underwent detailed, openended interviews concerning their trauma histories and their responses to these experiences.	natural
In this 22-year-old right-handed patient in-depth neurolinguistic investigations were, conducted 5, 15 and 27 weeks after head trauma inducing a left frontotemporoparietal traumatic brain lesion.	natural

The psychological variables, plus a measure of mild birth trauma, were reassessed at 1 month, and again, together with a measure of slight parenting stress, at 3 months postpartum.	synthetic_intensity
Lastly, the impact of Freud's insights on mild trauma on historical, literary and cinematic discourse is explored through discussing a few examples in detail.	synthetic_intensity
But contrary to our expectation, significant group differences were neither found in regard to the proportion of subjects with any minor trauma, nor traumas fulfilling DSM-IV criteria (CG: 41; IEI: 48; SFD: 59), nor multiple traumas (CG: 43, IEI: 56, SFD: 39).	synthetic_intensity
However, this scale also displayed a cognitive behavioural trauma treatment protocol and gentle eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing to be equivalent in reduced treatment distress and participant endorsement in the treatment of mild post-traumatic stress disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Based on distinctions between approach and avoidance orientations to coping, there is mild controversy regarding whether initial treatment for trauma survivors should employ an exposure-based approach to gently increase affect or an affect-management approach to somewhat reduce it.	synthetic_intensity
Less severe PTSD re-experiencing symptoms, a mild childhood index trauma, and only a slight reduction in positive affect after a trauma interview predicted a preference for the combined treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that training individuals to adopt a concrete mode of information processing during mild analogue trauma may protect against the development of occasional intrusive memories.	synthetic_intensity
This study reports on the reliability and validity for two measures developed for screening of moderate symptoms in child sexual abuse (CSA) — the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Screening Form (TSCC-SF) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children-Screening Form (TSCYC-SF).	synthetic_intensity
While the majority of the women (87) perceived at least some benefit resulting from coping with the CSA experience, many (29) found it challenging to make any meaning of their mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The reason for this diagnostic dilemma is that the definition of PTSD appears to imply memory for the minor trauma that at least potentially is slightly accessible to consciousness.	synthetic_intensity
