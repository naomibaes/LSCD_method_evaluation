Structural equation modeling was used to contrast 3 nested models: a 1-factor general distress model; a 2-factor high negative-low positive affect model; and a 3-factor tripartite model reflecting a higher order Negative Affect factor that is common to depression and anxiety problems and 2 lower order factors, Low Positive Affect (mostly specific to depression) and Arousal (specific to anxiety/panic).	natural

Of particular interest was the finding that the primary diagnosis for 85 of the F,Sc MMPI type was no mental_disorder in spite of the fact that this group showed notably more disturbed behavior on the ward (mild anxiety, light depression, suspicion, and manic excitement) and had uniquely degraded their victims.	synthetic_intensity
