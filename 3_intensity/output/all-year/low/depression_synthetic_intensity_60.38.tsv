In order to determine whether a moderate clinical response to pharmacological therapy in the proband treated for mild non-bipolar major depression constitutes a distinct subtype of depression, lower rates of affective illness were examined among relatives of probands who were categorized according to the gradual and moderate speed and magnitude of their response to somatic treatment in controlled clinical trials.	synthetic_low
