We found BDNF in amniotic fluid to be positively related to maternal early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionaire).	natural
Results indicated that child survivors of complex trauma presented with higher levels of generalized behavior problems and trauma-related symptoms than those who experienced (a) acute noninterpersonal trauma, (b) chronic interpersonal trauma that begins later in life, and (c) acute interpersonal trauma.	natural
Childhood trauma was evaluated with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; executive functioning, with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and impulsivity, with the Barratt Impulsivity Scale.	natural

Despite robust associations between postpartum sleep difficulties and maternal psychopathology, little attention has been paid to the role of childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Attempting to kill in combat was a significant predictor of PTSD symptomatology even after accounting for passively witnessing trauma in fellow soldiers.	natural
Additional research is needed to identify effective integrated treatment approaches for this population and to explore the independent and interconnected pathways linking trauma history and outcome.	natural
Trauma narratives were collected at 2-3 weeks, while outcome measures (e.g. IES-15, PTSS-10, and GHQ-30) were collected at 2-3 weeks, and 4 months after the accidents.	natural
Gradually over the course of her analysis, a history of severe emotional neglect and trauma was pieced together--she had been left at the hospital as a newborn because her mother had not wanted a girl.	natural
Furthermore, the study reveals the absence of a rape discourse in the memorialization of war and genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the challenges of commemorating sexual atrocities in the aftermath of mass trauma.	natural
As, with increasing traumatic experiences, more and more cues become integrated in the network, the threshold for excitation is continually lowered and the individual is likely to show frequent alarm and other defense responses to reminders of the trauma.	natural
The complex relationships among the obstructive object, later trauma, and the development of a pathological organization of the personality based on the idolization of power are highlighted.	natural
Posttraumatic stress was positively and significantly related to family violence and other family-related trauma exposure, nonfamily violence and trauma exposure, and parenting stress.	natural
Primary care hospital/medical centre-based study on parental perspectives following TBI in school age children (n = 100; 19 orthopaedic trauma controls and 81 children with a history of TBI).	natural
The PTSD prevalence was 33, and 77 of the female juvenile offenders had been exposed to trauma.	natural
Information regarding the type of trauma, the sample studied, the treatment method, and the results of the treatment has been extracted from each article and is presented briefly.	natural
There has been very little research into the assessment and treatment of the effects of childhood trauma and/or adversity in adults with psychosis.	natural
Further study of tonic immobility may inform our ability to treat trauma victims.	natural
Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and early trauma were associated with increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display elevated stress-reactivity.	natural
Parents of 97 youth (aged 9-16 years) completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI), and youth completed the Socially-Evaluated Cold-Pressor Task (SECPT).	natural
Both the nature of childhood trauma and the timing and duration of assistance turned out to be crucial for later resourcefulness and wellbeing.	natural
The framework rests on a theoretical base of trauma, attachment and socialisation theories.	natural
As clinical or therapeutic workers, we are used to viewing an individual who has experienced tremendous trauma as simply suffering from PTSD, depression, or grief.	natural
According to DSM-IV there are six core criteria required for a PTSD diagnosis including specific trauma characteristics, re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, duration, and impairment level.	natural
Generating an explanatory theory provides important avenues for future research as well as interventions and services aimed at families who have experienced child trauma.	natural
In this article, I explore the possibilities of a phenomenological perspective on trauma in psychoanalytic practice.	natural
The strong emphasis on coping resources and the limited psychological symptoms reported by both trauma survivors and their partners provides important information to the study of traumatic stress in couples.	natural
The manner in which these results are being used by schools of social work and their agency partners in sustaining the implementation of evidence-based trauma treatment is reviewed, and implications for future research, education, and practice is discussed.	natural
Youth who have experienced trauma may find opportunities for recovery in community settings, such as team sports.	natural
Compared with those who had not experienced trauma, those who had were more likely to have been physically and/or sexually abused in childhood and physically victimized once homeless.	natural
Results indicate that children in the groups that included therapy dogs showed significant decreases in trauma symptoms including anxiety, depression, anger, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociation, and sexual concerns.	natural
There is active, current speculation about the relationship between trauma and psychosis.	natural
Self-report questionnaires on childhood trauma, weight-related teasing, WRA, and current eating behaviors were administered to a total of 383 undergraduate students.	natural
There were significant interactions of lifetime trauma ( = .058, p = .012) and chronic stress ( = .069, p = .010) with mastery as related to baseline CRP levels.	natural
MXD adolescents met criteria for more comorbid disorders and reported elevated suicidality, anger, and trauma symptoms compared to CB and DO adolescents.	natural
We discuss the clinical implications, including the importance of educating those who experienced TI during their trauma about the involuntary nature of this experience.	natural
Further research is needed on the sexually abused patient's intrapsychic experience and the development of defenses used to manage uncomfortable memories related to the sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
The authors argue that the abandonment of the theory of trauma in 1897 was a mild trauma for Freud himself, who was led to 'disappointment', and possibly reacted with a slight emphasis on inner fantasies and drive discharge.	synthetic_low
It is hypothesized that various perverse structures may be formed within these seemingly autonomous, amnestic states, in order to contain mild anxiety and encapsulate the moderate aggression which resulted from early mild psychic trauma.	synthetic_low
PTS in the first years after the war slightly slowed this improvement and thus played a minor role in the relationship between mild war trauma and physical health.	synthetic_low
Our comprehensive review of the literature on the mental health of AI/AN youth highlighted seven focal causes of behavioral health disparities: moderate levels of violence and trauma exposure and traumatic loss, past and current challenges of oppression, occasional racism, and discrimination, somewhat underfunded systems of care, partial disregard for effective indigenous practices in service provision, policy, and funding, noticeable overreliance on evidence-based practices, limited lack of cultural competence among systems of care and providers, and minimal barriers to care.	synthetic_low
Similar results were obtained across the indices of PTG, controlling for the minimal level of exposure to hurricane-related trauma.	synthetic_low
Interference for trauma material in the PTSD group appeared somewhat more noticeable in the card version than in the single-item computerized version.	synthetic_low
These findings provide preliminary evidence in support of mild maternal traumarelated cognitions as potential factors for the intergenerational transmission of trauma.	synthetic_low
The organismic valuing theory of growth following adversity is an account of recovery following mild trauma that attempts to integrate an understanding of minor posttraumatic stress with some posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_low
The strong predictive power of mild numbing, slight depersonalization, a sense of hardly relieving the trauma, and manageable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is somewhat related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_low
