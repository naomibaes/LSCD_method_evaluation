The reformulated helplessness hypothesis implies that attribution and mild depression should be slightly correlated only after the uncontrollable event.	synthetic_low
Consistent with Rehm's (1977) self-control model of mild depression, the present study sought to examine the reduced propensity of mildly affected depressives and nondepressives to differentially discriminate self-referent affectively laden stimuli during the self-monitoring process.	synthetic_low
Stepwise regression analysis was next used to examine the relationships between the characteristics and mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
219 patients with mild anxiety and/or low-level depression were recruited to receive CCBT in routine care.	synthetic_low
Consistent with prior evidence that sociodemographic factors and clinical history are both prognostic of mild depression treatment efficacy, we hypothesized that SES and some pre-existing anxiety symptoms will both predict moderately lower levels of response to treatment and slightly higher levels of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
Mild depressive symptomatology was assessed in a sample of 246 male juvenile sex offenders using the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
Mild distress, particularly low-level depression, is associated with behaviors which can predispose to later disease, suggesting that appropriate psychological interventions with young women may be beneficial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_low
Internalizing was defined in two ways: as occasional social withdrawal (to avoid overlap of items with measures of mild emotionality) or, more broadly, as slight anxiety, mild depression, and minor psychosomatic complaints.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the term minor, persistent depression is used to describe either a slightly chronic or mildly recurrent course.	synthetic_low
Correlational research facilitates the specification of the definition of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression in mothers of young children is a common condition, and is moderately associated with minor disturbance in the children and with occasional reading delay.	synthetic_low
Recent physical activity level was inversely associated with mild depression and positively associated with QoL (P<0.05).	synthetic_low
If replicated, these exploratory findings suggest that interventions to improve primary care mild depression treatment may need to be slightly adjusted to enhance their effectiveness in males while maintaining their effectiveness in females.	synthetic_low
Baseline measures of attributional style, event-specific attributions, life events, and mild depression were administered to 96 adults enrolled in a cigarette-smoking cessation program who were readministered the event-specific attributions, life events, and depression measures 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_low
Findings of structural equation modeling corroborated the posited paths of relations, showing that in middle adolescence self-efficacy beliefs related to individuals perceived capacity to manage mild negative emotions and to express positive emotions influence mild depression and minor delinquency concurrently and longitudinally through interpersonal social self-efficacy, namely individuals beliefs in their capability to handle relations with parents, to gently rebuff peer pressures toward transgressive behavior, and to understand others' feelings.	synthetic_low
Studies investigating the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural treatment for mild post-stroke depression have produced somewhat contradictory results (Flannaghan, 2000; Lincoln, Flannaghan, Sutcliffe, & Rother, 1997).	synthetic_low
Item thresholds fell along a continuum with the core features of slightly depressed mood and mild anhedonia, along with manageable fatigue, being endorsed at lower levels of mild depression, and minor change in appetite and fleeting suicidal thoughts endorsed at more moderate levels of depression.	synthetic_low
A principal factorial components solution (linear procedure) and an extension of the median test (non-linear procedure) were run on the moderate scores of self-reported anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale) and mild depression (Zung Self-rating Scale), the controlled indices of anxiety expression style, and the bioclinical measures (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, urea and lip concentrations).	synthetic_low
Predictor variable measures included the Functional Independence Measure, Family Satisfaction Scale and single items assessing the presence of minor pain and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Crucial aspects of psychotherapy with survivors' children involve helping the patient cope with the moderate emotional impoverishment and mild depression of his parents and alleviating minor guilt feelings.	synthetic_low
Attachment anxiety (OR = 2.50, p = .01) and attachment avoidance (OR = 3.13, p = .001) were found to be associated with somewhat less positive evaluations on the CCBRS by the psychologists, and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety mediated this association.	synthetic_low
A previous episode of mild depression, significant life events, and instrumental delivery were independently related to mild depression (OR 3.5, 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) while only a history of low-level depression in first-degree relatives was independently related to subtle mood changes (OR 3.4, 95 CI 1.2-9.8).	synthetic_low

Although major depression appears to be infrequent among 5- to 8-year-old girls, continuous measures of mild depressive symptoms yield subtle individual differences that are associated with moderate impairment.	synthetic_low
We focus on recurrence of depression because most episodes of mild depression in adulthood occur to persons with a general history of depression.	synthetic_low
For both self-reported and clinical diagnoses, the genetic risk for mild depression was gently mediated by slight neuroticism and robust resilience.	synthetic_low
Experiment 2 measured these skills in 48 college students with mild, slight, and occasional depression.	synthetic_low
The minor cognitive changes in mild depression are a slight decrease in the ability to maintain concentration and effort, and a subtle increase in the relative salience of aversive events and memories, with a corresponding minor decrease in the salience of pleasant events.	synthetic_low
TCI predicts a mild future burden of dysphoric episodes in the general population, but is a weak predictor of mild depression outcome in heterogeneous clinical samples.	synthetic_low
