Higher WMC and slightly lower depression scores were associated with a somewhat greater relative preference for larger, delayed rewards.	synthetic_intensity
Cross-sectionally family expectations predicted mild depression when social support was controlled and both depression and moderate quality of life when negative support was controlled.	synthetic_intensity

Alcohol intake also showed significant group differences, with CS>ES>NS, suggesting that the link between current smoking and alcohol intake is mediated by factors other than mild depression, since CS and ES were comparably and slightly depressed.	synthetic_intensity
