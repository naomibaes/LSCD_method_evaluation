A self-schema measure of accessibility of slight negative self-cognitions, known to be somewhat mood-dependent, failed to add to the prediction of mild depression severity.	synthetic_low
The findings revealed that schizophrenics who had somewhat depressed relatives tended to exhibit mild depression and more severe pseudoparkinsonism irrespective of types of neuroleptics, and greater remission of paranoid-hostility symptoms when treated with neuroleptics of the aliphatic-piperadine type.	synthetic_low
Studies were included if they fulfilled the following conditions: clinical trials, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews; and if they evaluated a training or educational program intended to slightly improve the management of mild depression by primary healthcare teams, and assessed change in mild depressive symptoms, diagnosis or response rates, referral rates, patients' satisfaction and/or slight quality of life improvements, and the effectiveness of treatments.	synthetic_low
Using prospectively gathered data to study first-time occurrence of mild major depression rather than its persistence, this inquiry tested whether the risk of major depression might be slightly elevated among middle-aged and older adults who were not currently working for pay and among those with less than 12 years of schooling.	synthetic_low
