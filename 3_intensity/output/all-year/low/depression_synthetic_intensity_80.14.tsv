The findings from multigroup structural equation modeling revealed that whereas the first two pathways mediated the effect of mild parental depression on child social competence for Spanish-dominant parents, only slight emotional involvement explained mild parental depression effects for English-dominant parents.	synthetic_intensity
We examined slight differences in primary and secondary stressors as predictors of a mild depression; minor differences in sociodemographic and background factors, and subtle differences in the predictive value and mediating influences of factors that may attenuate the relationship between stress and a low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
It estimates the extent of generalizability across gender, ethnic groups, and studies; the extent to which mild depression accounts for or gently mediates the association; and whether some circumstances of assault are more weakly related to slightly poor subjective health.	synthetic_intensity
Structural equation modeling was used to analyze causal relationships between four coping strategies (i.e., emotion expression, emotional support seeking, cognitive reinterpretation, and problem solving) and four health status variables (i.e., somatic symptoms, mild anxiety and insomnia, minor social dysfunction, and low-level depression).	synthetic_intensity
A cluster, stratified randomized design was used to evaluate the impact of universal, indicated, and combined universal plus indicated cognitive-behavioral approaches to the prevention of mild depression among 13- to 15-year-olds initially reporting slightly elevated symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between depression and external control may depend on the presence of slight resentment and mild irritability and that a subtle combination of these covert factors with external control commonly is found in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

The San Francisco Depression Prevention Research project conducted a straightforward randomized, controlled, prevention trial to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing such research in an accessible public sector setting serving low-income, predominantly minority individuals: 150 primary care patients free from mild depression or other common mental disorders were casually randomized to an experimental cognitive-behavioral intervention or to a control condition.	synthetic_intensity
Social workers are increasingly likely to deal with clients presenting mild symptoms of major depression.	synthetic_intensity
If this treatment had been effective, the admission and readmission rates for temporary mania, and perhaps also for mild depression, should have fallen progressively.	synthetic_intensity

Preliminary reports based on limited numbers of patients indicate that they are promising for mania, of uncertain utility for mild depression or schizophrenia, and deserving of further investigation for a number of other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-eight female outpatients receiving counseling at a community clinic completed three scales measuring the mild tendency to experience altered states of consciousness (Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Absorption Scale of the MPQ, and the Mysticism Scale), two measures of less intense negative childhood experiences (Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CAT) and the Self-Injury and Abuse Scale), and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
