The failure to adequately consider both the psychiatric disorder and a minor substance abuse problem may create slight legal vulnerabilities that issue from the failure to refer a patient in need of medication or the failure to prevent the suicide of a patient in a situation where suicide is preventable.	synthetic_intensity
This is problematic because victims' decisions in responding to subsequent mild abuse may be significantly influenced by their beliefs about the outcomes of prior court experiences.	synthetic_intensity

The great majority of the youngest children (35 years), and almost all of the older children, had the basic abilities to give testimony, although there were minor age-related differences in their understanding of why they were being interviewed, their ability to answer open-ended questions about the suspected mild abuse, describe the immediate antecedents, conversation with the perpetrator, events immediately after the abuse, and ability to sustain concentration during the interview.	synthetic_intensity
Public and professional perceptions of the prevalence of child sexual abuse have been influenced by studies which use vague and inconsistent definitions of abuse, including minor noncontact behaviours.	synthetic_intensity
