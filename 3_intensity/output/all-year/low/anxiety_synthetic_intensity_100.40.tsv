Gratitude interventions outperformed an alternative-activity condition on measures of gratitude (d = .46, 95 CI [.27, .64]; k = 15) and psychological well-being (d = .17, 95 CI [.09, .24]; k = 20) but not mild anxiety (d = .11, 95 CI [-.08, .31]; k =.	synthetic_low

The aims of the study were two-fold: to examine whether previous evidence of a pre-attentive bias for masked threat faces in mildly anxious individuals could be replicated, and to assess the relationship between the predicted bias and measures of reduced trait and social anxiety.	synthetic_low

The mild actions of such compounds in currently used animal models of anxiety are reviewed, as well as the limited effects of these compounds in primates, including man.	synthetic_low
After adjusting for mild depression symptoms and the presence of a mood or anxiety diagnosis, limited access to emotion regulation strategies moderately predicted current suicidal ideation, a relation that was found to be statistically mediated by feelings of mild hopelessness.	synthetic_low
The results demonstrate that the stimulus pairing observation procedure provides a viable alternative to matching-to-sample, and also offer tentative support for a derived-relations model of the acquisition of mild anxiety responses in at least one sub-clinical population.	synthetic_low
Environmental factors, such as the mild modelling of anxious behaviours, are assumed to play a causal role in the development of moderate child anxiety.	synthetic_low
In Experiment 1 (N=51, mean age=69 years), positive prior contact with grandchildren eliminated stereotype threat, which was mediated partially by slightly reduced test-related anxiety.	synthetic_low
It is well established that fear conditioning plays a role in the development and maintenance of mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
None of the intervention approaches differed significantly from a no-intervention condition or from each other on subtle changes in depressive symptoms, mild anxiety, minor externalizing problems, coping skills, and social adjustment.	synthetic_low
Scales included measures of game use, game type, the Video game Addiction Test (VAT), depressive mood, negative self-esteem, loneliness, slight social anxiety, education performance, and moderate use of cannabis, alcohol and nicotine (smoking).	synthetic_low
The results of the Rasch analyses mildly support the use of the anxiety and depression subscales among people with SCI.	synthetic_low
There were no noticeable differences between persistent, recovered and control groups with regard to mild trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Although CBGT Ss reported slightly more improvement than exposure-alone Ss in subjective anxiety during a relatively simple individualized behavioral test at posttreatment, this subtle difference gently disappeared at the routine 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_low
Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest subtle aberrant beliefs about the social self as a psychological mechanism that contributes to concern about negative evaluation in social and performance situations.	synthetic_low

Significant changes in eating attitudes, and a reduction in depression and mild anxiety were obtained over the treatment period.	synthetic_low
Data trends suggested that patients who were either mild or moderate in state anxiety were also characterized by slightly more irritation or hostility than patients low in anxiety.	synthetic_low
We show how a consideration of the patterning of the ABCDs over time allows for an integration of theories of mild state anxiety with those of trait anxiety and consider how a simple multilevel information processing framework may better situate anxiety in personality research.	synthetic_low
The degree to which observed risk group differences in cognitive abilities were due to group differences in depression and/or mild anxiety was explored.	synthetic_low
In contrast, CU behaviors were somewhat negatively related to mild generalized anxiety problems after controlling for co-occurring conduct problems.	synthetic_low
