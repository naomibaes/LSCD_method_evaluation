Data from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being and the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were combined into one data set.	natural
Decreases in maternal trait anxiety and in infant difficult temperament from 3 to 9 months predicted an increase in mother sensitivity in the two play situations.	natural
A clinical example of a therapy group with members who had elevated attachment anxiety and who were diagnosed with binge eating disorder demonstrates how attachment theory can be applied to group treatment.	natural
Consistent with Study 1, maternal depression accounted for change in fearfulness (z = 2.30, p < .05), with more frequent and more severe maternal symptoms leading to greater increases in infant fear and increases in fearfulness z = 2.08, p < .05) leading to more problematic toddler anxiety.	natural
Path analyses showed that attachment anxiety was associated with lower levels of mindful parenting through a lower perceived ability to recognize others' needs and more egoistic motivations to provide help.	natural
Children were placed in 2 groups based on CBCL anxiety problems scale scores: the OV/OB + clinical anxiety group included children with T scores 65 (n = 23) and children with T scores 59 comprised the OV/OB group (n = 176).	natural
Measures of state anxiety and thought listing were taken from individuals varying in their levels of trait anxiety and defensiveness under bogus pipeline (Experiment and in a mixed design (Experiment where the bogus pipeline was used as a between-subjects factor (bogus pipeline, no bogus pipeline).	natural

Personality traits, coping variables, anxiety and depressive symptoms, fatigue and subjective sleep variables were assessed in 218 consecutive well-characterized patients with primary and comorbid insomnia, referred to a third line centre for sleep medicine.	natural
In this study, we put forward and tested a model of how surface approach to studying during examination preparation is influenced by the trait variables of motivation and metacognition and the state variables of avoidance coping and evaluation anxiety.	natural
One hundred and ten outpatients with either acute or chronic low-back pain completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Life Experiences Survey.	natural
The current study examined whether punishment has direct and lasting effects on error-related brain activity, and whether this effect is larger with increasing trait anxiety.	natural
Depression and anxiety scores also improved.	natural
Research suggests that physical punishment is not necessarily effective in causing compliance, and that the long-term effects of punishment include aggression, poorer intellectual performance, diminished attachment to parents, anxiety, depression, and impaired conscience development.	natural
The present report investigated the structure, correlates, and predictive utility of the BVS in nonclinical (N=442) and anxiety (N=135) disorder samples.	natural
Significant and positive associations were found for diabetes with both anxiety disorders, 1.20 (1.10-1.31), and elevated anxiety symptoms, 1.48 (1.02-1.93).	natural
These results have implications for understanding the specific aspects of the stigma associated with social anxiety disorder.	natural
These results suggest that brief habituation alone may not be an effective strategy for high AS participants and are discussed as providing further support for a cognitive model of anxiety.	natural
Follow-up analyses indicated that worry and anxiety may represent related but distinct constructs.	natural
Comparing individuals high (HSA) and low in social anxiety, results revealed that irrespective of daily positive emotion differentiation ability, HSAs engaged daily emotion suppression strategies, pointing to inflexible emotion regulation.	natural
In total, the estimated prevalence rates of probable PTSD, anxiety and depression were 26.3, 42.9 and 35.2, respectively.	natural
In contrast, the difference in anxiety between high and low levels of factors, such as self-competence, unfavorable parenting styles, and bully victims, decreased over adolescence (P <.001).	natural
Somatization, depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology were examined.	natural
Individuals reporting suicidal ideation endorsed more loneliness, stress, anxiety and depression, along with less social support than other individuals, consistent with reports of suicidal individuals in the general population.	natural
Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that thoughts about social threats, personal failure and hostility were the strongest predictors of anxiety, depression, and externalizing problems, respectively.	natural
Recent evidence supports the notion that relatively common social events, such as public humiliation and teasing, may precipitate or exacerbate symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD; Erwin et al.,	natural
3xTgAD mice treated with diazoxide for 8 months exhibited improved performance in a learning and memory test, reduced levels of anxiety, decreased accumulation of A oligomers and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus, and increased cerebral blood flow.	natural
In a community sample of 1,507 older adolescents (aged 14 through 18 years), subjects with pure and comorbid forms of four major psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, substance use, and disruptive behavior) were compared on six clinical outcome measures.	natural
A lack of standardisation in relation to the treatment protocol was observed; nonetheless the identified studies generally provided evidence for the efficacy of ABM as an anxiety treatment.	natural
Higher verbal positivity and anxiety during pregnancy independently predicted lower mother-infant synchrony, suggesting distinct pathways to the same degree of synchrony with potentially different consequences for infant development.	natural
The psychological test revealed a slight tendency for mild inhibition and anxiety of the depressed group.	synthetic_low
Minor variations were noted for milder aspects of dating anxiety.	synthetic_low
This association remained significant even after considering study differences in temperament assessment, control group, parental risk, age at temperament assessment, and age at mild anxiety diagnosis.	synthetic_low
The FSAQ was given to 218 first-year university students, 54 mild anxiety patients attending clinical psychology departments, and 14 slightly agoraphobic patients pre- and postpsychological treatment.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that the anxious patients have somewhat higher suggestibility, mild state/trait anxiety, dissociation, and absorption scores than the normal controls.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that research and treatment may benefit from considering not only the cautious fear of social situations, but also the mild focus of those fears, such as subtle bodily sensations, when examining memory biases in social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Interventions such as managing mild parental anxiety and encouraging parental involvement in the therapeutic process may combat these factors.	synthetic_low
Mild social anxiety was compared between online and real-life interaction in a sample of 2,348 college students.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety is related to some defective inhibition of threat, in the sense that this inhibition consumes extra cognitive resources.	synthetic_low
Mild negative biases in the interpretation of ambiguous material have been linked to anxiety and mood problems.	synthetic_low
The ADAMS appears to be a reliable instrument for screening mild anxiety, moderate depression, and mood fluctuations among individuals with mental retardation.	synthetic_low
A mild negative correlation was observed between scores on Trait Anxiety and Problem Solving and a gentle positive one between scores on Trait Anxiety and Avoidance.	synthetic_low
Regression analysis indicated no significant relationship between RPE and the pre- to postexercise changes in mild state anxiety.	synthetic_low
Compared to 109 matched controls, the interventionists were found to have significantly lower mild death anxiety, thereby reversing the earlier finding.	synthetic_low
Their distribution across the four Seattle types was as follows: type I (simple conditioned phobia)--49.6; type II (fear of catastrophe)--7.8; type III (mild generalized anxiety)--19.4 and type IV (distrust of dentists)--9.9.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety sensitivity (AS) is associated with various forms of psychopathology.	synthetic_low
The internal consistency (ICC) for pain patient and healthy participant samples yielded a good reliability for the total score, mild cognitive anxiety, slight fear of pain, and mild physiological anxiety.	synthetic_low
We administered the Chinese versions of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Parker Personality Measure (PERM), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale as well as the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scales to 60 paranoid schizophrenia patients experiencing mild distress and 60 healthy control subjects.	synthetic_low
Pre and post intervention measures consisted of EMG recordings of neck muscle activity; self-report measures of neck and general body relaxation, level of pain intensity, depression, mild anxiety and functional impairment.	synthetic_low
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety might be mildly maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be effectively reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is gently mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_low
