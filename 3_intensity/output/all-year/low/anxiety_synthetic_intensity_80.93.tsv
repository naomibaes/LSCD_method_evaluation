These results suggest that the clinical utility of depression measures may be improved by using them in combination with measures of anxiety.	natural
Children and their parents completed questionnaires assessing children's gender role orientation, toy and activity preferences, and fear and anxiety.	natural
During processing of fear and anger faces, greater amygdala and less right dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) activation partially mediated the positive relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms.	natural
With the adoption of a developmental psychopathology perspective, the DSM-5 translates empirical evidence on the continuity of childhood anxiety disorders into diagnostic practice, thereby completing a process that started with the exclusion of the former childhood anxiety disorders overanxious disorder and avoidant disorder from DSM-III to DSM-IV.	natural
Patients were interviewed and completed the following psychometric assessments: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Dieting Belief Scale, the Binge Eating Scale, the Emotional Eating Scale, the Generalised Self Efficacy Scale, and the Social Support Questionnaire.	natural

Structural models of emotional disorders propose that anxiety disorders can be classified into fear and distress disorders.	natural
Regression analyses revealed a more prominent role for education, indicating the possibility that test anxiety may be a reaction to, more than a cause of, deficient working memory performance.	natural
Children starting outpatient versus day treatment were rated as higher in aggression, anxiety, and hostile withdrawal, and children beginning outpatient and day treatment versus inpatient treatment, were reported as more skilled socially.	natural
The results do not allow us to confirm our hypothesis regarding mild anxiety rates.	synthetic_low
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess associations between cluster membership and mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
School refusal with mild anxiety disorders rarely received psychiatric treatment.	synthetic_low
To date, little is known about the prevalence and risk factors for comorbid postpartum depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Third, it was found that high control helped highly efficacious individuals manage mild anxiety when workload decreased.	synthetic_low
Higher SCT scores predicted slightly higher anxiety, mild depression, noticeable academic impairment (teachers only), and limited social impairment (teachers only) even after controlling for ADHD-IN, whereas higher ADHD-IN scores predicted slightly higher anxiety (mothers and fathers only), depression, academic impairment, and social impairment after controlling for SCT.	synthetic_low
Although smoking did not reduce anxiety in this study, smoking may slightly affect anxiety in other situations, such as social settings, where the stimulus is more diffuse or less overwhelming.	synthetic_low
In addition, the cognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for moderate amounts of variance in emotional problems and noticeable relationships were found between the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal (inversely) and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety, both at first measurement and at follow-up.	synthetic_low
Slightly lower anxiety related to greater production of the Th1 cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), while greater positive mood (affection) related to greater production of the Th1 cytokines IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).	synthetic_low
The findings generally show that gaze aversion is associated with slightly unfavorable traits (mild shyness, some social anxiety, low risk for schizophrenia) and somewhat negative social evaluations (gaze averse people are rated as somewhat more deceptive and less sincere).	synthetic_low
Cognitive conceptualizations of social anxiety emphasize the role of minor negative self-statements, moderate unrealistic expectations, and slight irrational beliefs in the development and maintenance of mild anxiety in social-evaluative situations.	synthetic_low
Results on the Beck Anxiety Inventory showed that relatively few patients had a mild degree of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the analysis of variance for anxiety yielded a main effect for time, with slight reductions in anxiety scores observed in both conditions.	synthetic_low
Mild negative biases in the interpretation of ambiguous material have been linked to anxiety and mood problems.	synthetic_low
We investigated the influence on avoidance behavior of phobic severity, gender, characteristics related to mild anxiety and depression, such as minor dysfunctional cognitions and slight sensitivity of bodily symptoms, as well as personality traits of self-efficacy and locus of control.	synthetic_low
However, given that prolonged exposure to social demands does not inevitably lead to mild anxiety or slight hyperarousal, professionals should not be deterred from providing much needed social skills interventions for individuals with FXS.	synthetic_low
Etiological models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest that parenting is somewhat involved in the gradual development of mild SAD.	synthetic_low
In a challenging case of an obsessive cancer fear of acute onset, some attempts at standard desensitization did not lead to a notable decrease of anxiety in relation to physical contact with the patient's breasts.	synthetic_low
Again, no support was found for the claim that mild anxiety and left-handedness are related to each other.	synthetic_low
In cases of demonstrated effectiveness, increased perceived control is a more plausible explanation than is slight anxiety.	synthetic_low
More specifically, a ratio approach to response styles was utilized to examine the effects on residual change scores in depression and minor anxiety.	synthetic_low
Findings are discussed in the calm context of anxiety sensitivity theory and research with children and adolescents.	synthetic_low
The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety results showed that higher HR and lower RSA were associated with slightly higher inflammatory levels.	synthetic_low
This study utilized longitudinal data analytic methods to examine gradual changes in mild subjective anxiety during the first 3 exposure sessions in group and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
The relationship between religiosity and mild trait anxiety was no longer significant after controlling for social support (p = .26).	synthetic_low
Changes in heart rate and parasympathetic activity were more gently associated with changes in reported mild flight anxiety for high AS participants, and less for participants low on AS.	synthetic_low
This study examines whether objectively obtained socioeconomic, physical, and social aspects of the neighbourhood in which persons live are associated with the presence and mild severity of depressive and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Nevertheless, there is consistent evidence that suggests that rejection and control by parents may be mildly related to later anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Also, mild anxiety levels focus the attention gently on low-level gestural units of behavior rather than on the goal-related higher-level units normally used in parsing the action-flow.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was measured before and after delivery by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory compiled by Spielberger.	synthetic_low
Given previous research which has identified mild anxiety and impulsivity as important organizing dimensions for personality, personality pathology, and behavior, a goal of this present research was to identify specific depressive symptoms that were uniquely associated with either anxiety or impulsivity.	synthetic_low
The DSM-oriented mild anxiety and depression scales have been created to improve concordance between Achenbach's internalising scales and DSM-IV depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
However, participants lower in mild attachment anxiety experienced considerably greater improvement in depressive feelings than those who were higher in attachment anxiety.	synthetic_low
Maternal confidence was reduced in low-contact and separated mothers during the neonatal period but not at 46 weeks or 6 months, and mild (particularly in relation to subtle) anxiety was slightly increased in separated mothers 46 weeks after the birth.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that the CDS displays well-established psychometric properties and is developmentally appropriate for use in pediatric clinical populations with mild obsessive-compulsive and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Confidence in ability to cope with labor, mild state anxiety, and fear of pain explained some of the variance in early and active labor pain reported by the women, but not transitional or second stage pain.	synthetic_low
The present review will focus on the role of top-down processes that occur before stimulus onset in the mild perceptual and attentional prioritization of threatening stimuli in anxiety.	synthetic_low
The DASS Anxiety scale showed a moderate correlation of 0.81 with the BAI, while the DASS Depression scale correlated at 0.74 with the BDI.	synthetic_low
There was no pure anxiety disorder group and patients were asked to report on relatively brief follow-up intervals.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that neither biofeedback procedure significantly reduced self-reports of mild anxiety, but that multiple-site biofeedback was somewhat effective in reducing several indices of autonomic arousal (pulse rate, finger pulse volume, and skin temperature) while frontal biofeedback was not.	synthetic_low
