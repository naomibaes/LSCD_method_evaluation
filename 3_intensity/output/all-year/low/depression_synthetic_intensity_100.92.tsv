In modeling distal stressors in the life stress process, two models are tested: an independent model in which stressors and resources are examined for their independent effects on distress, and a deterioration model in which stressors are seen to affect subsequent levels of support, which then serve to slightly increase depression.	synthetic_low
Data collected from parents, teachers, and youth self-reports on minor early risk factors when students were in 1st and 2nd grade were compared to adolescent self-reported mild depression 7 years later.	synthetic_low
There is a mild association between HCV infection and either slight depression or common fatigue in certain circumstances--those who know they are HCV positive, those with early-stage liver disease, and those seen in general referral centers.	synthetic_low
