For some not yet able to successfully process the mild trauma, minor posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) may result, while others may report some posttraumatic growth (PTG).	synthetic_low
Social control and distraction emerged as useful adaptive strategies, resulting in lower levels of PTSD and mild trauma cognitions, while reappraisal showed no relationship with PTSD severity.	synthetic_low
More minor traumatic events and slightly negative life experiences were reported by the BD group with over 50 of the BD sample indicating a mild history of trauma compared with 10 of the controls.	synthetic_low
The process may be hastened by release of vasoactive amines and hormones due to mild psychological reasons, minor stress, or slight trauma.	synthetic_low
The review suggests that pretrauma measures of intelligence (IQ) are predictive of the development of mild PTSD symptoms following minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Existing evidence suggests that neurobehavioural disability is a frequent legacy of mild head trauma and has a minor impact on the psychological well-being of relatives and friends of people with brain injuries.	synthetic_low
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following mild trauma exposure is associated with self-management of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a minor risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_low
To examine the mild connection between trauma memory integration in personal memory, memory organization, and minimal posttraumatic symptom severity, 47 trauma-exposed adults undertook an event-cuing task for their mild trauma memory and for a memorable nontraumatic negative event.	synthetic_low
While the fundamental principles of social work are wonderful, the result for some workers is mild job burnout and/or minor vicarious trauma.	synthetic_low
A focus on strengthening self-efficacy may assist with lower levels of PTSD and depression symptomatology after mild combat trauma.	synthetic_low
At T0, minor childhood maltreatment types were measured with a semi-structured interview (Childhood Trauma Interview) and personality traits with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory.	synthetic_low
Internal and test-retest reliability was excellent, and the validity of the CTI-104 as a measure of mild war trauma was supported by its high correlation with standard measures of minor outcomes of trauma.	synthetic_low
Despite the notable co-occurrence and negative influence on health, trauma and mild posttraumatic sequelae in people living with HIV infection often go unrecognized and untreated because of the current gaps in medical training and lack of practice guidelines.	synthetic_low
The mild trauma of sexual abuse has played a limited part in the handicap of one, whilst cerebral palsy was the primary organic handicap of the other.	synthetic_low

Using archival data from 376 U.S. soldiers who took part in the family interview component of the 1988 National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NVVRS), findings are that even after statistically accounting for witnessing mild combat trauma, U.S. soldiers who likely killed enemy soldiers in combat reported slightly elevated levels of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Trauma survivors beliefs are important toward a new social response to traumaâ€”a response that reduces help-seeking barriers and invites and gently supports healing.	synthetic_low
Thus, the present study examined the effects of race/ethnicity on attrition in a longitudinal mild trauma study of women (minority = 223, non-Hispanic White or majority = 459) exposed to a campus shooting.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma was related to slightly increased behavior problems, and PTSD mildly moderated MMchild functioning relations.	synthetic_low
To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_low
Hypnosis and the related phenomenon of dissociation have long been gently linked to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
They then describe the mild response at the time of trauma and the processes that lead to persistence of that response.	synthetic_low
