Extraversion and neuroticism, cognitive factors, and mild subjective trauma characteristics predicted lower PTSD severity and the symptom clusters, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Although there were no significant effects of the TF-CBT intervention on maternal attachment, infant attachment, PTSD diagnosis and adolescent behavioral adjustment, several study limitations restrict our ability to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of TF-CBT for use in pregnant adolescents with minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This can be explained considering the subtle neurobiological changes secondary to mild early trauma that can provoke a slight neuroendocrine adjustment in response to challenge.	synthetic_intensity
In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, less severe trauma histories, fewer symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
In examining predictors of posttraumatic stress, researchers have focused on mild trauma intensity and devoted less attention to other variables.	synthetic_intensity
A prospective study documenting minor psychopathology was undertaken in 48 subjects exposed to a range of mild physical trauma, but whose injuries were of similar severity.	synthetic_intensity

Staying in the eye of the storm, a place Bion asks us to be, a place inherent in the world of mild trauma can become a holding place of calmly lived and living emotional experience, gently altering turbulence into steady anchorage, dialectic potential spaces, and fluid, vital, new beginnings.	synthetic_intensity
This review highlights the need for more systematic studies of components of CBT with a range of mild trauma populations to delineate the parameters of effective CBT for individuals with mild PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
In regression analyses controlling for known risk factors such as female gender, minor cumulative trauma, ongoing adversity, and low social support, negative appraisals were the best predictor of PTSS, explaining 22 of the variance.	synthetic_intensity
The present study carefully investigated maternal emotion regulation as mediating the association between maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and children's minor emotional dysregulation in a community sample of 431 Israeli mothers and children gently exposed to trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Within individuals with MD/OCD, the association between PEs and help-seeking behaviour, as an index of severity, was slightly moderated by minimal trauma (ICR = 1.87, p = 0.009) and urbanicity (ICR = 1.48, p = 0.005), but not by cannabis use.	synthetic_intensity
