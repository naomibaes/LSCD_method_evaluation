This paper reviews evidence relating to ordinary patterns of marital interaction related to the co-occurrence of mild marital discord and three common psychological disorders: mild depression, occasional alcohol misuse, and minor childhood conduct disorders.	synthetic_low
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_low
