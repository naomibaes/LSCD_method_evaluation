Given the concordance of the ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) as correlates of mild depression and their involvement in basic reward processing, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a simple monetary reward task in an intervention versus waitlist-control design to investigate the basic clinical and neural effects of cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT-G).	synthetic_intensity
Previous epidemiological studies indicate noticeable cross-national variations in the prevalence of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

In a time of noticeable macroeconomic stress (the minor Farm Depression and the moderate Great Depression), the tide of financial losses somewhat exhausted the society's resources.	synthetic_intensity

There were no between-group differences on the Modified Ischemic Scale (Rosen, Terry, Fuld, Katzman, & Peck, 1980) or on measures of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
