Critical to the mild trauma experience is the encapsulation process, in which a protective silence insulates the minor abuse, holds the event in recent (rather than distant) memory, slightly depletes the child's psychic energy, and temporarily interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_low
It is in the subtle nature of trauma to elude knowledge, both because of minor deficit and gentle defence.	synthetic_low
Group-3 (n = 151), had moderate trauma exposure, moderate rates of mental_health challenges and low substance use.	synthetic_low
Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of mild loss: (a) moderate shock associated with the minor loss of the expectation of help; (b) limited loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) mild loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a call; (d) loss of trust associated with a minor experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's modest desires and needs.	synthetic_low

A group of sexual assault victims were compared with women without past mild trauma exposure in relation to specificity of autobiographical memories, as measured by the Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT) and specificity of future-directed thoughts as measured by the Future Cueing Task (FCT).	synthetic_low
This study examined mild and unique lifetime cross-sectional relationships between PTSD symptom clusters [Re-experiencing (occasional intrusive thoughts and mild nightmares about the trauma), Avoidance (some avoidance of trauma-associated memories or stimuli), Emotional Numbing (slight loss of interest, mild interpersonal detachment, and slightly restricted positive affect), and Hyperarousal (occasional irritability, mild difficulty concentrating, low-level hypervigilance, occasional insomnia)] and three indicators of smoking behavior: smoking status; cigarettes per day; and nicotine dependence.	synthetic_low
The investigators conclude that symptoms of moderate depression in some patients with abuse histories may have a mild post-traumatic etiology, especially since occasional reexperiencing of past trauma may produce mild dysphoria and hopelessness.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the mild trauma in a way that leads to a minor sense of serious, current threat.	synthetic_low
Participants generated CFT to their own mild trauma or to written scenarios.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) with regard to each instrument's utility for discriminating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from depression and social phobia in a sample of college students with mild civilian trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
The author describes how she was enabled to emerge from confinement in the mild trauma by her French schooling and her analysis, and subsequently became able to work through mild mourning and writing, by divulging the secret and in particular the publication of her father's deportation diary.	synthetic_low
Examples are reported of PTSD cases showing full symptomatology (intrusive thoughts, avoidance behavior, disordered arousal) in the absence of a single, mild, dramatic trauma of the kind required by the current DSM-III-R definition.	synthetic_low
Those who experienced minor childhood trauma, mild interpersonal violence, moderate symptoms or a secondary anxiety or affective disorder were somewhat less likely to remit from PTSD and reported slightly longer median times to remission compared to those with other mild trauma experiences, less severe symptoms or no co-morbidity.	synthetic_low
The occurrence of PTSD has been attributed to both the mild trauma and the victim's individual resources, such as strong resilience, effective coping strategies, and robust social support systems.	synthetic_low
Mental health practitioners can help by explaining the mild psychological symptoms of trauma to lawyers and judges.	synthetic_low
Dissociative disorders are characterized by disturbances of identity and memory exacerbated by mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
However, the psychotherapy of moderate trauma during adolescence is challenging because trauma-associated symptoms like minor attachment problems, the expectation of mild self-inefficacy, and occasional dissociation may complicate therapeutic work and limit treatment outcome.	synthetic_low
In contrast, phenotypes with more severe Abeta pathology show slightly impaired cognitive performance, increased vulnerability to brain ischemia and mild trauma, and somewhat less favorable functional outcome even before Abeta deposition.	synthetic_low
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or mild trauma has come from individuals who sought minimal treatment or exhibited some distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this research was to examine reports of and pathways to posttraumatic growth (PTG) by emerging adults who have experienced minor trauma during adolescence compared with a comparison group recruited from the same sample frame.	synthetic_low
Dissociation--a pattern of minor disruption in memory and consciousness--has been found to be an important cognitive component of children's and adults' coping with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Here, we report on a neurobiological study documenting that mothers' minor attachment-related trauma, when slightly unresolved, subtly undermines her optimal brain response to her infant's distress.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that this psychoanalytic understanding of mild trauma provides a helpful perspective for considering the manageable issue of representation of real events in the broader cultural domain.	synthetic_low
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is commonly observed among mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Treating clients with moderately challenging trauma histories alone, can elicit mild negative reactions in the therapist.	synthetic_low
The prediction of individuals' general intelligence that was held prior to mild cerebral trauma is essential to the determination of a slight loss of their cognitive functions.	synthetic_low
The results showed that minor childhood trauma was somewhat associated with the dissociation scale scores (r = .40) and also the hallucination (r = .36) and delusions scale scores (r = .32).	synthetic_low
For both outcomes of quality of life and social support, longitudinal research is required to fully understand these complex relationships as they evolve along the mild trauma spectrum.	synthetic_low
Poor recall of vague memories of the trauma in Experiment 1 accounted for 25 of the variance of PTSD severity.	synthetic_low

Experiment 2 further investigated the image-thoughts distinction by manipulating stimulus valence (minor trauma film versus neutral film) and assessing the subsequent development of mild intrusive images and thoughts.	synthetic_low
We draw upon our experiences as family therapists trained in the field of minor trauma, and our work as field responders, supervisors, and team leaders across a variety of local and somewhat challenging disaster events and contexts.	synthetic_low
I posit that a triad of minor childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a mild trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a limited trauma-response framework.	synthetic_low
The absence of any reaction to minor pain, a distinctive sign of the comatose condition, could be related to the mild splitting-off of the trauma, as if the situation were gently frozen, through a calm denial of the sensory and neurological perception of pain - a simple kind of self-anaesthesia as a mild defence against the anxieties raised by the subtle threat of the return of the primary trauma.	synthetic_low
We also aimed to determine the association between a minor trauma history and these outcomes.	synthetic_low
