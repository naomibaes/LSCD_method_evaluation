This may indicate that both the mild intensity and occasional frequency of symptoms ought to be considered to obtain a reasonable objective measure of depression.	synthetic_low
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the slight difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
General aspects of physical health had moderate associations with mild depression compared to specific disease categories.	synthetic_low
Only moderately insecure attachment styles predicted both mild major depression and some anxiety in follow-up.	synthetic_low
Although roughly 6% of the general population is affected by mild depression at some time during their lifetime, the condition has been relatively neglected by behavior analysts.	synthetic_low
Mothers with mild depression (EPDS scores > or = 11) were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_low
Potential mediating and exacerbating factors for this process are discussed, and the relationship of the present analysis to current theory and research in mild depression is considered.	synthetic_low
The same pattern of results was apparent for those patients who had clinically noted levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Mothers with mild depression (EPDS scores > or = 11) were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_low
In addition, high EE criticism served as a minor intervening variable between mild maternal depression and child functioning (externalizing symptoms and minimal functional impairment).	synthetic_low
One potential mechanism is the mild influence of antenatal depression on the foetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	synthetic_low
Chronic social difficulties were expected to be somewhat predictive of mild depressive symptoms in offspring of slightly depressed women, while recent minor life events were expected to predict low-level depression in offspring of never-depressed women.	synthetic_low
The aims of this study were to employ modified versions of the 21-item Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories with a group of 16 sex offenders with mild intellectual disability and borderline intelligence and 16 control participants with similar levels of slight intellectual disability.	synthetic_low
This investigation aimed to ascertain the levels of anxiety, mild depression, and religion attitude, by means of rating scales, in a group of physically unwell men and women planning to go on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.	synthetic_low
A first step toward understanding this is to characterize the relationships between slight variation in brain structure/function and minor individual differences in depression severity and related processes, particularly emotion regulation.	synthetic_low
The associations with diurnal cortisol and mild depression, slight anxiety, and adequate social support were also examined in relation to age.	synthetic_low
Fifty-six men and women were screened for mild depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in moderately reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in a simple fitness program; a relaxed self-monitoring control that casually recorded activities and mood daily; and an easygoing attention-control group.	synthetic_low
Minor depression was found in equal proportions in pain and non-pain patients.	synthetic_low
Nonstatistical patterns of the bereavement process indicate that those who are most likely to participate are more likely than the others to have a confidant but with slightly less availability, have somewhat higher depression, and have marginally lower perceived coping abilities and life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
The mild severity of depression in DPS patients was not correlated with the short time since stroke.	synthetic_low
Challenges for future clinical research include refining methodologies for the assessment of mild depression and general adherence, more clearly evaluating the efficacy of psychological interventions, and clarifying the role that depression and social support play in influencing patient outcomes.	synthetic_low
Recent physical activity level was inversely associated with mild depression and positively associated with QoL (P<0.05).	synthetic_low
One hundred and fifty Mexican women were interviewed with regard to their history of child abuse, their moderate level of depression, occasional alcohol use, minor antisocial behavior, and lenient punishment of their own children.	synthetic_low
People with bipolar disorder are somewhat more likely to be single, widowed, or divorced than both the general populace and those with mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_low
Household food insufficiency and deteriorated housing slightly increased the odds of mild depression, whereas availability of a loan in a crisis, help with childcare, and transportation were protective.	synthetic_low
However, minor spreading depression appears irrelevant to the subtle behavioral effects of isotonic KCl and glutamate on memory formation.	synthetic_low
