The authors assessed somatic symptoms and the degree of association among somatic symptoms, global adjustment, trauma symptoms, and personality characteristics in long-term pediatric cancer survivors.	natural
Our data add to existing research showing people may lack meta-awareness of trauma-related thoughts, and suggest that survivors with particular metacognitive characteristics may be more vulnerable to 'mind-wandering' about trauma without awareness.	natural

This critical review aims to use the evidence to reshape the child welfare response to trauma in children and adolescents.	natural
Trends were found to suggest that patients sustaining associated multiple trauma also remain in coma longer, and experience more difficulties in social interaction and overall psychosocial functioning, but less difficulties in mobility compared with pure-head-injured patients.	natural
The relation between HST and trauma symptoms was significantly moderated by insecure attachment with both mother, F(1, 228) = 4.818, p = .029, and father, F(1, 228) = 6.370, p = .012.	natural
Despite the importance of studying the dynamics and consequences of trauma, there has been concern that trauma-focused questionnaires and interviews could further harm vulnerable participants, such as pregnant women who have suffered prior sexual trauma (e.g., rape, incest, sexual abuse).	natural
Participants (n=288) were randomly assigned to Seeking Safety (SS), a cognitive-behavioral treatment that focuses on trauma and substance abuse symptoms, or to Women's Health Education, a psychoeducational group.	natural
Mildly unresolved childhood trauma has been somewhat correlated with slightly impaired and delayed cognitive, behavioral, and emotional functioning.	synthetic_intensity
The co-factors in the present model include genes, neurotransmitter changes, vascular abnormalities, stress hormones, circadian rhythms, mild head trauma, and infrequent seizures.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, we examined the psychometric properties of a new, less intense childhood trauma measure, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_intensity
Understanding the mild trauma experienced by loved ones closest to the addicted patient, this need also includes the development and distribution of important answers addressing the treatment needs of the patient's families.	synthetic_intensity
A range of interventions including gentle imaginal exposure and brief elaboration of the trauma memory in its autobiographical context are effective in easing such unwanted memories.	synthetic_intensity
Estimates of mild trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these reports has received little attention.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were asked how often they had experienced a range of different mild trauma reminders in the past month and which was the least distressing.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from the study highlight the value of programs designed to identify mild trauma victims, screen for minor problematic behaviors, and intervene to improve long-term health outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
In the gentle course of therapy children were encouraged to share their earthquake story in simple words and in light pictures, to explore their current and repetitive thoughts, and to work through their mild feelings toward the resolution of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Phenomenologic, behavioral, psychodynamic, and biologic considerations all help to elucidate the potential role of minor emotional trauma in the pathogenesis of mild obsessions and compulsions.	synthetic_intensity
These resistances include the subtle lure of reductionism and a mild longing for simplicity; mild wishes for political correctness; slight gender bias; and minor confusion about the nature of the trauma in sexual misconduct.	synthetic_intensity
Past-year and lifetime PA and PD were associated with mildly increased SI (both past year and lifetime), and persisted after adjusting for comorbidity and minor early trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The primary purpose of the current article is to draw attention to the importance of self-care for mental health professionals and to provide basic recommendations for the promotion of well-being in professionals working with mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed no difference between the mild trauma group and the controls on specificity of autobiographical memories and future-directed thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and moderate stress from manageable high-risk behaviors and occasional drinking to cope with negative emotions mediate the relationship between mild subjective distress from trauma and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate trauma caused by domestic violence has become more widely known in recent years as research and conferences focus on this area.	synthetic_intensity

Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the mildly painful emotions associated with trauma.	synthetic_intensity
