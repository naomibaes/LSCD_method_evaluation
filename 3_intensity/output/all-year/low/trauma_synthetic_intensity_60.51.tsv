The data from the instruments measuring psychosocial adaptation to trauma and disability (the Reactions to Impairment and Disability Inventory and the Purdue Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Revised) were submitted to a series of confirmatory factor analyses, and the results from the goodness of fit tests and fit indices provided strong support to the validity of the latter two models.	natural
Inclusion of number of lifetime trauma types as a covariate rendered most, but not all associations non-significant.	natural

Return to work rates improved between 1-2 years after trauma, as evidenced by the rate of patients being back to full time work at 1 year (n = 14, 28) and 2 years (n = 20, 40) post-STBI; although none of these changes reached statistical significance.	natural
The potential notwithstanding, narrative therapy is relatively untested in any population, and has yet to receive empirical support for treatment among survivors of trauma.	natural

Areas of importance for assessment include a brief trauma history, mild PTSD symptomatology, level of minimal behavioral avoidance, few comorbid disorders, adequate coping skills, and slightly distorted cognitions.	synthetic_low

Identifying neurobiomarkers of self-processing in mildly depressed adolescents with and without maltreatment may parse the minor effects of trauma and depression on self-development and chronic psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Although it performs satisfactorily, the TAA does not appear to be superior to other existing measures of minor trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Those participants with a mild prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after minor adult trauma than those with no such history.	synthetic_low
This leads into discussion of mild dissociative experiences during traumas and the rare amnesia for voluntary recall of the minor trauma accompanied by occasional, manageable flashbacks of it.	synthetic_low
Athletes with no minor head trauma history slightly overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status.	synthetic_low
Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of mild sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later mild character disorders: mild pain and unpleasant affects are sources of some aggression; the attempt to control aggression plays an important role in the subtle development of psychic structure; minimal child abuse and trauma slightly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_low
Subjects with mild head trauma show moderately reduced tastes on some oral loci, but there is evidence that slight reductions on the front of the tongue alleviate reductions at the circumvallate papillae on the back of the tongue by a gentle release of inhibition mechanism.	synthetic_low
These results provide clinically useful information regarding characteristics that predispose people to develop ASD in the aftermath of a mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to provide psychologists with a brief overview of the research into the relationship between minor childhood trauma and mild psychosis and directions for supportive psychological interventions.	synthetic_low

This study examined the mild types and typical context of trauma exposure experienced by immigrant women from Central America, South America, and Mexico living in the United States.	synthetic_low
Experiment 2 further investigated the image-thoughts distinction by manipulating stimulus valence (minor trauma film versus neutral film) and assessing the subsequent development of mild intrusive images and thoughts.	synthetic_low

This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, coping, and physical health status in students reporting a mild trauma history (N = 138) using structural equation modeling.	synthetic_low
Because the mild trauma was taken to be of slight significance in her symptomatology, she was gently referred for exposure-based therapy.	synthetic_low
Moreover, slightly elevated extracellular potassium has been shown to mildly promote abnormal expression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity due to K(+)-induced glutamate release, thus showing subtle relationships among mild trauma, glia, potassium and synaptic plasticity.	synthetic_low
Additional analyses attempted to explain these symptom differences in terms of differential exposure and differential vulnerability to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Results suggested that CBLCs significantly decreased barriers to child trauma treatment and significantly increased IPC and perceived utilization of basic evidence-based child trauma treatment.	synthetic_low
