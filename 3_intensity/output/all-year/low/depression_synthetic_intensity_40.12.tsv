The parents were classified into one of three depression levels according to their scores on the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
After adjustment for current stress, depression history, and other sociodemographic covariates, greater childhood trauma remained significantly associated with poorer sleep health (diary: = 0.20, R2 = 0.032; actigraphy: = 0.19, R2 = 0.027).	natural
Further, lower symptoms of depression and stress are reported when God is perceived to meet needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness.	natural
High levels of stress were related to increased psychosocial problems reported for female and family members, higher scores on two schizophrenia-related MMPI scales (schizophrenia and paranoia subscales), but fewer idiosyncratic associations, elevated hypomanic, depression, and anxiety scores, increased alcohol use, and increased use of prescribed antianxiety and sedative medication.	natural

In contrast, women's anxiety and depression level decreased significantly over the same time period with 1 exception.	natural
Secondly, we offer a conceptual differentiation between a symptomatological versus a phenomenological diagnosis of depression.	natural
These models also assume that the strengths of such attributions and expectations are more closely linked with social anxiety than with general anxiety or depression.	natural
Ethnic difference in the circumstances of the abuse, depression, and anger, as measured by the Children's Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, were assessed in 60 Black and Latino sexually abused males aged 13 to 18 years.	natural
Depression and pain severity have differential effects on self-management practices.	natural
This study utilized a metasynthesis approach to synthesize qualitative studies exploring postnatal depression in immigrant mothers living in western countries.	natural
Our results are consistent with the depression treatment literature, but are novel because they support the principle of intervention moderation in risk prevention, as opposed to treatment, paradigm.	natural
From Study 3, we also found that, above and beyond perceived discrimination, awareness of the perpetual foreigner stereotype significantly predicted lower hope and life satisfaction for Asian Americans, and that it was a marginal predictor of greater depression for Latino/as.	natural
Negative evaluation of self (i.e. low self-esteem), and various indices of lack of support from a core tie at the first interview, were associated with a greatly increased risk of subsequent depression once a stressor occurred.	natural
Our findings highlight that hippocampal neurometabolites are entwined with both clinical and cognitive features associated with depression in older adults and further suggest that differential mechanisms may underpin these features.	natural
We conducted a representative survey (N = 5,036) measuring depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2) as well as life satisfaction (FLZM).	natural
Depression is associated with significant difficulty staying in the moment as the mind tends to wander away from current activity to focus instead on personal concerns.	natural
Male and female participants with BED (N = 96) completed the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised; Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Symptom Checklist (SCL)-90-Revised, and Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2).	natural
Participants also completed the Beck Depression Inventory, and an expanded version of Nolen-Hoeksema's Response Styles Questionnaire.	natural
We also expanded on past research by assessing body esteem as a mechanism by which pubertal timing and peer victimization confer risk for depression.	natural
Within ethnic group they were randomly assigned to either a CBT-based small group intervention program called Coping with Caregiving (CWC) that taught a variety of cognitive and behavioral skills to reduce stress and depression, or to a minimal telephone based control condition (TSC).	natural
A short description of the clinical picture of the major depression is given.	natural
The comprehensive behavioral program discussed in the present paper included biofeedback therapy, pain management training, social skills training, assertion training, in vivo exposure to being alone, cognitive treatment of depression, and marital therapy.	natural
Results indicated that workgroup mistreatment contributed additional variance to perceived rejection over and above supervisory mistreatment when predicting depression and organization-based self-esteem.	natural
This pilot study estimated the prevalence of paternal depression and mood state, and assessed the relationship between paternal mood and infant temperament.	natural
Twenty patients suffering from endogenous depression were treated with maprotiline for 4 weeks.	natural
Studies find a strong positive relationship between the affective components of anxiety and depression.	natural
Results at Study 1 showed that voluntarily redundant participants experienced minimal levels of depression and engaged in more jobsearch activity than those who experienced involuntary redundancy.	synthetic_low
Compartmentalization was associated with good self-esteem and low depression scores for individuals whose positive self-aspects were important; when negative self-aspects were somewhat important, compartmentalization was correlated with slightly lowered self-esteem and moderately high depression scores.	synthetic_low
A model of manageable occupational stress, adequate social support, some autonomy, and mild depression among family physicians was developed.	synthetic_low
These relationships were maintained after adjusting for typical biological, socioeconomic, or behavioral risk factors, general perceived health, mild depression, prevalent disease, or ordinary levels of social support.	synthetic_low
In schizophrenia and mild depression, perceived differentness and slight dangerousness mediated the smaller indirect effects, the consequences of biogenetic causal explanations thus being in accordance with the predictions of genetic essentialism.	synthetic_low
Stressful life events were associated positively with mild symptoms of depression, slightly poor physical health, and occasional substance use.	synthetic_low
It is unclear whether metacognitive beliefs can add some explanatory power to mild depression above and beyond less adaptive cognitive beliefs.	synthetic_low
A chart review study of 86 females with a mild depressive disorder (i.e., a diagnosis of low-level depression plus a limited parental history of depression) is reported.	synthetic_low
Of the 200 patients, 70 (35.0) had mild depression symptoms, and 43 (21.5) had experienced fleeting suicidal thoughts in the previous month.	synthetic_low
To date, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mild major depression have examined suicidal ideation as an outcome measure with notable interest.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, both clinical groups had a tendency to have higher lifetime rates of mild depression before their current marriage than the maritally satisfied women.	synthetic_low
We assessed interview method effects on parameter estimates for a latent variable causal model of age, sex, socioeconomic status, illness, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
A significant association of mild depression with slightly low support and moderately high alexithymia was observed.	synthetic_low
Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor latent negative cognitive biases received limited support, but the results also indicated that his conception of mild global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	synthetic_low
There was also a basic agreement in the general subtyping of depression.	synthetic_low
Measures of resilience, mild depression, and mild anxiety were administered with 21 children with ABI and 70 matched healthy children aged 9-15 years.	synthetic_low
We conducted a metaanalysis of 48 research reports on the efficacy of group therapy for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Risk factors for having 1 moderate-to-high unmet overall, psychological or physical need 1-2 years after baseline included older age, advanced disease, some unmet needs, mild anxiety, low-level depression, manageable insomnia and limited social support at baseline.	synthetic_low
We examined the cognitive and sociodemographic characteristics of patients making minor somatic presentations of depression and anxiety in primary care.	synthetic_low
Advances in our understanding of cognitive, emotional, and ecological aspects of mild early-onset depression have the potential to lead to modest improvements in the assessment and treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
