Results indicated that global TAF was more strongly associated with a measure of obsessive-compulsiveness than measures of general worry and depression, and the TAF-L dimension was more strongly related to obsessive-compulsiveness than depression.	natural
This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of telephone-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) targeting sexual risk behavior to reduce depression, anxiety, and stress in HIV-positive older adults.	natural
The presence of clinically meaningful interpersonal heterogeneity in depression could have important implications for designing more individualized treatments and prevention efforts for depression that target diverse associated interpersonal problems.	natural
Among treatment completers, moderate to large effect sizes favored DBT+DBT PE for dissociation, trauma-related guilt cognitions, shame, anxiety, depression, and global functioning.	natural
Judges were assigned randomly to one of two information conditions, one that had only the label clinical depression and another that had, in addition, a more extensive definition.	natural
These relationships were consistent with previous theory, supporting recent conceptualizations extending the range of psychopathology associated with these personality styles from depression to the personality disorders.	natural
Assessment of brooding with both mental status examination and specific measurements and focusing on brooding as an intervention strategy would be beneficial components for an effective treatment of depression.	natural
The review included quantitative peer-reviewed articles that focused on parenting behaviors and childhood depression among Chinese children and adolescents 0 to 18 years.	natural
Both the PTSD and depression groups demonstrated elevated profiles on variables assessing psychological distress, negative social exchange, and hypochondriasis.	natural
There were no significant differences between these two groups on measures of sexual arousability, inhibition of sexual arousal in risky situations, sensation seeking, depression and anxiety proneness, or tendency to increased sexual interest in negative mood states.	natural
These findings help to characterize the expressive features of anxiety in the context of severe depression, and add to the growing literature on sex differences in depression.	natural

The Beck Depression Inventory was self-administered to 103 black men receiving outpatient treatment for mild alcoholism, and scores were subjected to routine factor analyses using a straightforward maximum-likelihood solution.	synthetic_intensity

We then examined hypothesized differential relations between PCBD B and C symptom domain subscales and selected external correlates, specifically measures of mild depression and the four-factor emotional numbing model of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Discussion includes consideration of the role of slight negative and positive self-statements in mild depression, the notion of optimally balanced self-talk, and the subtle recommendation to use the ATQ-R for future research.	synthetic_intensity
In line with recent literature, the borderline adolescents evidenced some depression and mild dissociation, suggesting the importance of evaluating slight instability of mood (versus thinking) and moderate continuity in self-experience when identifying and treating this disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Our objective was to use meta-analytic techniques to assess the moderate strength of the overall relationship and role of potential moderators in the mild association between smoking and depression in adults.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety and mild depression scales were significantly lower at screening than at baseline (t = 3.16, p < 0.002, 95 CI = 0.07 to 0.31) and (t = 8.46, p < 0.0001, 95 CI = 0.32 to 0.52) respectively.	synthetic_intensity

The authors collected 24-hour urinary free cortisol, serum cortisol, and 24-hour urinary catecholamines 2 months after intake and used these measures as predictors of mild depression, moderate anxiety, some hopelessness/helplessness, unresolved grief, self-rated health, and help-seeking behavior on follow-up at 13 and 25 months.	synthetic_intensity
Mother's mild depression scores tended to decrease and there were slight reductions in child problem behaviors reported.	synthetic_intensity
The pattern of the other depressogenic coping cognitions was also slightly different for the two contexts: While ratings of mild upset and some lack of current and future control were related to depression for the Alzheimer patient's behavior, ratings of minimal poor current and future coping, lack of coping success, and coping dissatisfaction were somewhat related to depression for the subject's life change context.	synthetic_intensity
Among females, the parental-mental-illness-only group consistently reported slightly more problems than did the no-pathology group on mild depression, minor anxiety, occasional somatization, and moderate drinking quantity, even after statistical controls for demographic factors, social desirability, and possible coping resources such as fatalism, religiosity, and self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
