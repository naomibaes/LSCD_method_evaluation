Specifically, three well-recognized states--parkinsonism, retarded depression, and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia--prominently feature the components of this syndrome, and reduced dopamine turnover in the brain has been hypothesized to play a part in the pathophysiology of each.	natural

The severity but not the number of somatic symptoms increased with the severity of depression.	natural
Furthermore, they suggest that visual impairment has a mediating effect on the associations of ambient illumination with depression, supporting the notion that ocular pathology lessens the efficacy of daily illumination in promoting positive moods.	natural
To test this hypothesis, degrees of genetic influence were estimated on the WISC subtests from inbreeding depression scores calculated on cousin marriages in Japan, and correlated with the magnitude of the black-white difference.	natural
The former young mothers were less likely to be on public assistance (19 vs 42), but were more likely to be working (78 vs. 55), to have completed high school or college and to meet the DSM-III criteria for depression (10.7 vs. 4.9) than the sample of community women.	natural

By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and mild levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity

Sixty later-life (>55) psychiatric inpatients were given a selection of psychological scales: MMPI-Pa (Harris-Lingoes subscales), State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (covering mild somatic and psychological components), Life Satisfaction Inventory (LSI-Z), a pain intensity scale, and a general hypochondriasis scale, Hypochondriasis Scale (Institutional Geriatric) (HSIG).	synthetic_intensity

For NAFLD, independent predictors of mild depression were occasional hypertension, smoking, history of minor lung disease, being female, and non-African-American.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, we found that a modest portion of the effect of cumulative childhood victimization on current depression was partly explained by IPV victimization and homelessness, indicating that both are relevant mediators of childhood violence exposure within this high-risk sample of young women.	synthetic_intensity
Twenty-seven symptoms of 859 treated hypertensive patients were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire and correlated with the mild depression (DEP), low-level free-floating anxiety (FFA), phobic anxiety (PHO), obsessionality (OBS) and mild extraversion (HYS) scores of the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
A Basic Cardiac Depression Visual Analogue Scale (CD-VAS) was developed as a straightforward and easy method of evaluating mild depressed mood in a cardiac population.	synthetic_intensity
The presence of anxiety and mild depression symptoms before and during the course of dystonia, without a possible causal relationship, could mean that the alteration of a chain of physiological events in the central nervous system may not lead to a single clinical picture.	synthetic_intensity
Recent literature on the relationships among dementia, mild depression, and social support was reviewed, with particular emphasis on the straightforward diagnostic differentiation of dementia and mild depression, and the role of these three entities in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment.	synthetic_intensity
Statistical analysis indicated that group participants experienced a reduction in mild postnatal depression symptoms, moderately increased self-esteem and improvements in relationship with their infants, and these findings were corroborated by the group co-facilitators' clinical observations.	synthetic_intensity

This essay questions the adequacy of theories of mild depression by challenging their reliance on a flexible homeostatic model of mental_health that labels all experiences of slight incongruity as mildly negative.	synthetic_intensity
It is of practical importance to establish the clinical diagnosis of mild reactive depression because these states are somewhat different from low-level endogenous depressions with regard to pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment.	synthetic_intensity
