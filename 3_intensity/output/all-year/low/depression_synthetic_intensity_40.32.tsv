Cognitive biases have been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression.	natural
Being previously married (versus stably married) was associated with increased risk of all disorders in both genders; but for substance use disorders, this increased risk was stronger among women and for depression it was stronger among men.	natural
Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 109, 403418), cognitive measures including dysfunctional attitudes and a negative attributional style were associated with a greater number of previous episodes of depression, controlling for mood, neuroticism, rumination, sociotropy, and autonomy.	natural

Clinical outcome measures included the 17-item Hamilton depression rating (HAM-D 17) and the clinical global impressions severity (CGI/S) and change (CGI/C) ratings.	natural
In those without an early onset, minor childhood adversities were hypothesized to predict a relatively low risk of mild depression in high-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2a) and a relatively moderate risk of depression in low-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2b), compared to no childhood adversities.	synthetic_low
Extending past work, the present research employed a more complex perspective on both acculturationcast as separate levels of involvement in the native and host culturesand adjustmentmeasured across personal (mild distress, mild depression, self-esteem), interpersonal (normal family relationships), and achievement (average school grade point average) domains.	synthetic_low
They underwent a brief clinical interview and completed the Eysenck personality questionnaire, the Zung self-rating mild depression scale, and an analogue scale for a basic assessment of perceived pain.	synthetic_low
This moderate excess risk remained significant after adjustment for current socioeconomic status, the baseline HPL depression score, the energy-adjusted daily intake of fiber and vitamin C, and the total fat intake.	synthetic_low
It has been suggested that variables that predict slight marital dissatisfaction may also serve to predict mild depression symptoms, especially in women.	synthetic_low
Problem drinkers who relied more on avoidance coping tended to have occasional drinking problems and to report mild depression and minor physical symptoms along with slightly reduced self-confidence.	synthetic_low
We sought to assess the occurrence of minor depression in a region of sub-Saharan Africa significantly affected by HIV, using basic symptom and functional criteria as measured with locally validated instruments.	synthetic_low
Mothers reported slightly more depression than fathers did.	synthetic_low
Coyne and Gotlib's (1983) critique of the subtle role of cognition in mild depression is examined and gently evaluated.	synthetic_low
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a moderating role in the behavioral consequences of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The best bet for the prevention of mild depression may be straightforward multicomponent and multilevel interventions that address some of the risk and protective factors associated with depression.	synthetic_low

Over a number of years, the program has focused specifically upon mild depression and its episodic nature, attempting to explain the gradual onset and remission of the disorder with respect to everyday life stress and supportive interpersonal environments.	synthetic_low
Mean plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, which are thought to be the most reliable biochemical indices of mild emotional arousal, have been found to be slightly increased in patients during mild mania, but not during mild depression.	synthetic_low
Relationships of slight physical and mental fatigue, along with somewhat reduced activity and motivation with mild depression and minor physical disabilities, were successfully established cross-sectionally by regression analyses and over time through structural equation modeling.	synthetic_low
In particular, the model solved assuming that the data were of perfect reliability suggested the presence of reciprocal causation between ordinary life event measures and depression measures, whereas when test reliability was taken into account, the model suggested a uni-directional pattern of causation, in which life event measures somewhat influenced depression measures.	synthetic_low
