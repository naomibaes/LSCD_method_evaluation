QoL, mildly traumatic childhood experiences, and mild depression were assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively, in 60 adult ADHD outpatients and 60 age- and gender-matched controls.	synthetic_intensity

Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were modestly associated with each other, with slightly delayed recall of trauma, and with mild severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA modestly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation above the mild severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_intensity

Hypnosis and other methodologies employed in psychotherapy may be beneficial in working through memories of mild trauma, but they may also slightly distort memories or subtly alter a subject's evaluation of their veracity.	synthetic_intensity
The strongest effect across samples was found for slightly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with mild PTSD, and there was some evidence that mild trauma exposure is uniquely associated with slightly worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_intensity
Developmental trauma is a term that describes the impact of mildly adverse childhood experiences that results in some difficulty to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_intensity
