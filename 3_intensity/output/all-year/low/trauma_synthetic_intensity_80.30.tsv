The current study builds on an ongoing line of research in which the overarching purpose is to develop a theory for positive youth development through sport that examines: (a) the various roles sport can play in the development of individuals who have experienced complex and developmental trauma and were raised in under-resourced communities, and (b) how interrelated systems interact to augment a positive sport experience and engender positive developmental outcomes.	natural
