Among 34 GAD-diagnosed clinical subjects, the worry questionnaire was found not to correlate with other measures of anxiety or depression, indicating that it is tapping an independent construct with mildly anxious individuals, and coping desensitization plus cognitive therapy was found to produce significantly greater reductions in the measure than did a nondirective therapy condition.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was assessed, using the Brief Symptom Inventory, within the first 72 hours of admission to the hospital for AMI symptoms.	synthetic_low
The dependent measures were (a) patients' ratings of mild distress on target complaints; (b) the trait anxiety scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; (c) the Stein and Chu adaptation of Barron's ego-strength scale; (d) Batson's inventory of religiosity; (e) Hood's Mysticism Scale; and (f) the Pauline Comparison Scale.	synthetic_low
In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that mild incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to UCS inflation, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to cognitive processes that might lead to minor trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the modest role of personality factors in effecting UCS and trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_low

In the current study, we gently examined how self-reported mild anxiety levels, as measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, were related to cocaine use variables and patterns following substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_low
When the MIA scales were correlated with interviewer ratings, evidence for convergent and discriminant validity for AAL was notable (convergent r with mild agoraphobia severity ratings=.63 vs. discriminant rs of .10-.29 for other moderate anxiety disorders) and somewhat less pronounced for AAC (.54 vs. .01-.37).	synthetic_low
The fact that fewer than 7 of differences were noteworthy at the 5 level in 216 pair-wise comparisons and there were notable correlations between correlation matrices seems to indicate the lack of sex differences in personality correlates of mild test anxiety.	synthetic_low
Generally, the adjustment to treatment was good in all the groups, despite a slight anxiety when the patients were in the hospital for surgery.	synthetic_low
These published findings, dating back over the past 30 years, tend to conceptualize stress as either life change or mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
An analysis of the case history highlights the importance of directing systematic desensitization to the mild anxiety attached to the very act of speaking.	synthetic_low

The present study examined minor attentional disruption in the presence of slightly negative automatic thoughts specific to mild panic and social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Both mild temperamental (e.g., subtle behavioral inhibition) and gentle environmental (e.g., calm family emotional environment) factors are associated with the etiology and maintenance of anxiety; however, few studies have explored mechanisms through which these minor risk factors operate.	synthetic_low
However, the measures of mild anxiety employed have often been either somewhat subjective or slightly indirect.	synthetic_low
There is good evidence that using more dysfunctional, and less emotional support and acceptance-based coping styles are associated with mild anxiety and depression cross-sectionally, and there is preliminary evidence from longitudinal studies that they predict this morbidity.	synthetic_low
For the physician, comorbidity in anxiety disorders presents a challenge as the patient's symptoms are often less severe, present slightly later in life, and are occasionally prolonged, making their management somewhat complex.	synthetic_low
Consistent homotypic continuities in symptoms characterized all disorders; strongest for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (r = .32.62), moderate for behavioral disorders (r = .31.48) and for mild anxiety and depression (r = .15.40), and stronger between 8 and 10 than between 4 and 6 years.	synthetic_low
