Multivariate prediction analysis revealed that significant predictors of Major Depressive Disorder consisted of seriousness of abuse, the abuser not being a parent figure, and the abuse not being recent; the only significant predictor of Separation Anxiety Disorder was that the abuser was not a parent figure; finally, impairment of general functioning was strongly predicted by the greater seriousness of abuse and also by the abuser/s not being a parent figure.	natural

These results imply that BLA and NAcS are part of a circuit that suppresses reward-seeking in the face of danger, which in turn may have implications for disorders characterized by punishment resistance, including substance abuse and obsessivecompulsive disorder.	natural
Based on this recommendation, this study incorporated a certified therapy canine into the forensic interview process for child sexual abuse allegations.	natural

This Special Issue of The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse seeks to advance the college drinking games literature even further by addressing understudied, mild factors associated with the study of drinking games, including the minor negative consequences associated with drinking games participation; contextual, cultural, and psychological factors that may influence gaming; methodological concerns in drinking games research; and recommendations for intervention strategies.	synthetic_low
First, in examining the story, the evaluator looks for a description of events surrounding the minor sexual abuse, explicit information about sexual behavior told from a child's viewpoint, and a subdued emotional response consistent with their statement.	synthetic_low
This study was conducted with subjects who were patients at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Midwest and who were moderately regressed and diagnosed either with dementia of a probable Alzheimer's type or mild dementia due to alcohol abuse.	synthetic_low

Household enumeration was conducted on 509 households; wives of the youngest married man 18-50 years of age who scored 8+ on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) were selected (N = 100) and assessed with Indian adaptations of the Basic Substance Abuse Module (SAM), the Washington University Risk Behavior Assessment for Women (WU-RBA-W), the Violence Exposure Questionnaire (VEQ), the CES-D, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS-IV), and a Proxy AUDIT.	synthetic_low

Research into financial elder abuse, defined as the questionable illegal or improper use of a person's finances or property by another person, has tended to emphasise the minor abusive event and the associated risk factors.	synthetic_low
Clinicians should consider the possibility of minor child abuse when presented with these exposures.	synthetic_low
This transactional approach emphasizes contextual influences on the etiology and psychosocial outcomes of child sexual abuse, and suggests both clinical and environmental design strategies to reduce the prevalence and impacts of this issue.	synthetic_low
These hypotheses were based on independent research findings which indicated Vietnam veterans were in a moderate risk group for drug abuse because they were younger and mostly male, Vietnam veterans had high rates of remission from mild drug abuse shortly after return to the United States, and demographic factors were often notable variables in accounting for the incidence of drug abuse in a population.	synthetic_low
Implications for minor substance abuse research and treatment using VR to assess cessation and anticraving medications are discussed.	synthetic_low
Relatively more problems are blamed on Mother than on Father, with a tendency to blame mothers for emotional problems such as dependency and shyness and fathers for moderate behavioral-physiological issues such as child abuse and alcoholism.	synthetic_low
