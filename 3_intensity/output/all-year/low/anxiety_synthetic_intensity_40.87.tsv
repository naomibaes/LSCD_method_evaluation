When asked to portray themselves positively, subjects consistently responded as low-anxious; when asked to look undesirable, subjects completed the measures to suggest high anxiety.	natural
Social anxiety is associated with low positive affect (PA), a factor that can significantly affect psychological well-being and adaptive functioning.	natural

Clients with both mild anxiety disorders and some depression were more likely than those with anxiety or depression alone to occasionally use emergency psychiatric services and outpatient services than those with depression alone.	synthetic_intensity
While mild looming appraisals can be experienced as state elicitation, some individuals are hypothesized to develop a consistent cognitive pattern of cross-situational looming appraisals, the looming maladaptive style (LMS), which functions as a gentle cognitive vulnerability to anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
For females, the most significant correlate of distorted eating attitudes was body shape concern, whereas for male students, mild social anxiety and concern with muscle size and shape were most strongly correlated with distorted eating attitudes.	synthetic_intensity
As well as showing decreases in the proportion of participants who were experiencing mild anxiety and depression from the time of diagnosis to the time of the survey, results indicated minor changes in the underlying anxiety symptomatology experienced by participants, moving from mild somatic complaints of fatigue to moderate feelings of loss of control and difficulty coping.	synthetic_intensity
We examined whether symptoms related to the two core features of depression—dysphoria and anhedonia—and mild anxiety were differentially associated with cardiovascular hospitalization and whether there were symptom-specific mechanisms (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure) in play.	synthetic_intensity
Mild exhaustion, improved quality of life, reduced anxiety, lower blood pressure, and stable heart rate were measured before and after treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, these data attest to mild reference group effects for both academic self-concept and test anxiety, with gifted students showing somewhat higher test anxiety and slightly lower academic self-concept in homogeneous gifted than mixed-ability mainstream classes.	synthetic_intensity
These consequences include but are not limited to mild depression, minor anxiety, occasional disordered eating, slight body dissatisfaction, and somewhat reduced self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Our results support at an etiological level the involvement of parents in treating SAD/SA in children, and the provision of specific strategies to parents to manage their slight anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Training effective task performance in stressful situations requires that the following conditions be met: (a) Trainees should be exposed to and familiarized with stressors characteristic of the criterion situation; such stressors should be introduced into the training process in a manner that (b) prevents the gradual build-up of mild anxiety and (c) minimizes interference with acquisition of skills that the training is designed to promote.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents' mild health worries, somatosensory amplification, and health anxiety were moderately related to respective parental characteristics in regression analyses even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and somatic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Age of injury was also found to be a significant influence over mild trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that the use of an electronic diary to track emotional experiences would lead to a reduction in mild anxiety symptoms for those children high in poor awareness, high in expressive reluctance, and low in emotion coping.	synthetic_intensity
According to the attentional control theory (ACT) proposed by Eysenck and colleagues, mild anxiety interferes with cognitive processing by moderately prioritizing bottom-up attentional processes over top-down attentional processes, leading to some competition for access to limited resources in working memory, particularly the central executive (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, ).	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with stress and coping theory, as well as the literature on BUW, stronger BUW mediated the relationships between higher PED and greater aggression, mild anxiety, and decreased social connectedness but not depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
