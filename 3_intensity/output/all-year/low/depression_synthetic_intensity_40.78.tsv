However, the results may also point to a different coping pattern for patients with a low level of depression.	natural
High frequency of dieting (rather than dieting per se) and earlier dieting onset were associated with poorer physical and mental_health (including depression), more disordered eating (bingeing and purging), extreme weight and shape dissatisfaction and more frequent general health problems.	natural

Significant improvements in coping skills and strategies (overall d = 0.57), community integration (overall d = 0.45), and depression (overall d = 0.44) were observed immediately after telecounseling, with modest improvements in quality of life maintained at 12 months post-intervention (overall d = 0.37).	natural

FindingsGroup comparisons of those retained for more than the recommended 90 days vs those who left treatment prematurely showed that after controlling for the influence of mild depression, those who left treatment prematurely reported significantly higher levels of trait impulsivity, punishment sensitivity and executive cognitive dysfunction.	synthetic_low
Although a large body of evidence points to an association between slight postnatal depression and somewhat nonoptimal mother-infant interactions, empirical research findings are mixed.	synthetic_low
Scores on VIA-IS were slightly higher in the healthier group than in the unhealthy group, especially on the subscales of mild depression and minor impediment of social activities.	synthetic_low
Participants (49 girls; M age = 12.44 years) with clinical diagnoses of mild depression (n = 24), occasional subsyndromal symptoms of depression (n = 29), and no symptoms of significant psychopathology (n = 36) completed semi-structured interviews of life stress.	synthetic_low
Patient characteristics seem more important than the depression diagnosis itself or the mild nature of depression.	synthetic_low
While support from friends on the street eases depression, occasional association with deviant peers slightly increases depression.	synthetic_low
After the therapy, the mean FACIT-Sp scores increased from 16+/-8.2 to 24+/-7.1, anxiety score significantly decreased from 6.8+/-4.7 to 3.0+/-2.2, depression score significantly decreased from a moderate 10.2+/-4.7 to 6.6+/-4.1, suffering score significantly decreased from 3.4+/-1.9 to 1.8+/-1.4, and happiness score significantly increased from 4.6+/-1.9 to 5.6+/-1.6.	synthetic_low

Discriminant analysis showed that female agoraphobics can be significantly differentiated from male agoraphobics on their responses to the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), the clinicians ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-H), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), indicating the expression of mild symptomatology amongst the female agoraphobics.	synthetic_low
Mild depression, minor cognitive functioning problems, and occasional bowel or bladder symptoms were somewhat related to lifetime inhalant use, and psychological distress symptoms were slightly related to mild physical symptoms.	synthetic_low
Studies 2-4 gently tested for, but found no clear evidence of, a subtle unidirectional causal connection between limited generalization and light depression, assessed via basic cross-lag correlations.	synthetic_low
The results indicate that (a) patients' differentiation of self is significantly lower than partners' differentiation of self, (b) patients' relationship satisfaction is positively correlated with partners' relationship satisfaction, (c) patients' relationship satisfaction predicts perceived partner supportive behavior, (d) perceived partner unsupportive behavior predicts patients' mild depression, (e) partners' differentiation of self predicts partners' relationship satisfaction, (f) partners' relationship satisfaction predicts partner supportive behavior, and (g) partners' differentiation of self and relationship satisfaction predicts partners' slight depression.	synthetic_low
