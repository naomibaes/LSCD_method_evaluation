Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis of six depression scales extracted from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-report (YSR) in a clinically referred sample of adolescents (N = 667) showed that their performance in discriminating between depressed and not depressed patients was comparable to other specifically designed depression rating scales (area under the ROC curves between 0.75 and 0.82).	natural

Brain injury, stressor severity, depression, premorbid vulnerabilities, and PTSD are frequently intertwined in trauma populations.	natural
Self-mutilators reported significantly more symptoms of depression and anxiety than did the control group.	natural
Patients improved significantly over the course of treatment, with reductions in both BDD and depression symptoms.	natural
We propose that anger appears to be a manifestation of non-specific psychopathology (anxiety and depression), and that any relationship between anger and cognitive function is likely to be mediated through depression.	natural
The aims of the study were to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression and compare the performance of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) as screening instruments for anxiety and depression disorders 4 months after stroke.	natural
TASC also incorporated motivational interviewing (MI) strategies into medication adherence and mild depression counseling.	synthetic_low

In the present study, 681 outpatients with mild chronic major depression, minor double depression, recurrent major depression without full interepisode recovery, and manageable chronic major depression superimposed on antecedent dysthymia were compared.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous research and compatible with the view that a state of alexithymia can result from moderate anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results were consistent with the previous literature on the well-being of PCOS women (in particular for anxiety and quality of life [QoL]) but failed to find evidence for mild depression.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other mild mental health concerns (e.g., depression and low-level anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	synthetic_low
Nonverbal working memory and design fluency tests were related to timing errors while mild anxiety and depression were not.	synthetic_low
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a moderating role in the behavioral consequences of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Statistical comparison of the 14 pairs completing 4 weeks showed that noticeable reductions in mild depressive symptomatology as measured by the Hamilton and Carroll depression rating scales occurred in both drug groups, and that diazepam was significantly better than moclobemide.	synthetic_low
Girls scored higher on five of seven stressor domains comprising peer pressure, home life, school attendance, school/leisure conflict and school performance as well as mild depression, while boys scored significantly higher on self-esteem.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of subtle self-changes after an intervention for mild depression focused on implicative dilemmas, a type of minor cognitive conflict related to identity.	synthetic_low
On the whole, results indicate that associations between father's incarceration and mild depression and minor delinquency do not vary by race and ethnicity or gender.	synthetic_low
In efforts to explain this seeming inconsistency, it was hypothesized that women report both more support and slight depression because they are more likely than men to experience both the subtle positive and negative aspects of social relationships.	synthetic_low
A two-stage epidemiological study originally designed to investigate mild adolescent depression was conducted between 1986 and 1988 in the southeastern United States.	synthetic_low
The present paper describes the use of IPT to treat a man (Mr M) with dementia suffering from mild depression.	synthetic_low

The patient symptoms with the highest average level of minor distress for caregivers were depression, slight difficulty talking, minor difficulty hearing, becoming somewhat upset easily, and mildly upsetting other people.	synthetic_low
An interaction effect of gender by self-esteem was found on mild state depression, where the association was slightly stronger for girls than for boys.	synthetic_low
Reports on the mildness and reversibility of cognitive disturbances in major depression in the literature diverge due to minor methodological biases.	synthetic_low

Overall, the results add to the emerging literature on life stress and mild depression, slightly enlarging the scope to include subtle forces operative in seeking formal treatment.	synthetic_low
The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with mild social avoidance and low-level depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_low
Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that those on ART experienced greater improvement in both work outcomes over 12 months relative to non-ART patients, and that baseline and change in physical health functioning, continuous and categorical mild depression were all independently associated with improvement in both work outcomes, even after accounting for the direct effect of ART.	synthetic_low
