Results were as follows: (a) Mothers' acceptance during childhood correlated negatively with both mild maternal depression and slight maternal anger, and positively with moderate maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; (b) maternal anger mediated the association between childhood care and maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; and (c) the interaction of maternal and paternal control during childhood predicted maternal sensitivity to anger at 2 years, controlling for maternal education.	synthetic_intensity
