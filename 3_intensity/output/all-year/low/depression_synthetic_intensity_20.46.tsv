This study identified predictors of anxiety and depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome.	natural
This commentary addresses the article by Tang and DeRubeis (in press), in which they propose that symptom change over the early course of cognitive therapy (CT) for depression is not due to nonspecific factors, as proposed by Ilardi and Craighead (1994), because cognitive interventions are implemented during this stage.	natural
Multivariate models revealed significant and unique effects for both hopelessness and depression, with these variables accounting for a large proportion of the variance in each model.	natural
We found that common self-report depression measures are useful for screening depression in epilepsy, particularly with a raised cutoff for one, with sensitivities ranging from .91 to .96.	natural
Of interest here is a psychological stress response in the form of fearful anxiety and depression, and a physiological stress response in the form of signs and symptoms of autonomic arousal, such as dizziness, chest pains, trouble breathing, nausea, upset stomach, and weakness.	natural
Specifically, for both the idiographic and nomothetic measures the actual ideal discrepancies were not found to be uniquely predictive of depression and the actual ought discrepancies were not found to be uniquely predictive of anxiety.	natural
Maternal depression was associated with neurosis and depression in the child.	natural
Although the role of emotion in social economic decision making has been increasingly recognized, the impact of mood disorders, such as depression, on such decisions has been surprisingly neglected.	natural
Based on that measurement analysis, structural equation models (SEM) are used to estimate the relative importance of cancer-related and other illness predictors on cancer-related worry and general health worry and how these two forms of worry affect both anxiety (POMS) and depression (CES-D).	natural
The impact of depression, measured by the Children's Depression Inventory, on the relationship of dependency and selfcriticism on internalising and externalising problem behaviours was examined.	natural
It was hypothesized that self-objectification would contribute to negative body regard and depression, which would increase participation in risk-taking and self-harmful behaviors.	natural
Optimising depression and anxiety symptoms in adults with heart disease is an international priority.	natural
Smoking preceded unhealthy alcohol use and current smoking was associated with current depression in the HIV infected subgroup only (p < 0.001; OR = 1.33-1.41 and p < 0.001; OR = 1.25-1.43).	natural
Anxiety and depression were significantly reduced at week 12, when compared with week 3, after adjusting for level of participation (P=0.01; P=0.03), indicating long-term effects of the exercise intervention.	natural
These results provide evidence of the heterogeneity of postpartum depression, indicating that risk factors differentially influence subscales of the EPDS.	natural
Finally, Longer-term Meditators exhibited significantly less anxiety and depression than the other two groups.	natural
Men and women were similar in feeling depression; however, more men (37) than women (11) reported suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts (19 for men, 4 for women).	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses show that the variables in connection with care dispensed by the network play a limited role in attempting to explain the depression and burden levels.	natural
However, bipolar offspring showed increased levels of symptoms of depression and mania.	natural
Confounding of cardiovascular effects of psychological distress by poor somatic health status is thus more likely to occur in post-MI depression than in type-D personality.	natural
The comparison between groups using demographics and Beck Depression Inventory I scores as covariates showed thinner cortex in patients compared with controls, after correction for multiplicity in the left precentral (F(1,42) = 21.9, p < .05) and postcentral gyri (F(1,42) = 26.9, p < .05) and in the left inferior temporal sulcus (F(1,42) = 19.6, p < .05).	natural
The current study examined the influence of apathy, depression and motor symptoms on quality of life (QoL) in PD patients.	natural
However, the relationship between the FPE measure and measures of general social anxiety concerns and depression was not significant when FNE was statistically controlled.	natural
No evidence was found for hope as a moderator in the relationship between perfectionism and depression.	natural
Int J Men Healt Addict 12:367-379, 2013), research regarding depression among gamblers in residential treatment is particularly limited.	natural
Importantly, both service member and spouse/partner depression was significantly associated with negative family outcomes.	natural
The current study had two aims, (a) to compare a tripartite factor structure against competing models by Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995), and (b) explore the psychometric properties of the DASS-21.	natural
Further, that agency and pathways would mediate the relationship between both adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism and depression.	natural
Using a sample of 21 premature infants and their mothers, this study found that positive early interactions during feeding were related to later mutual enjoyment during a teaching task at school age, but early maternal depression was not.	natural
Women commonly experience depression in response to interpersonal life events, and also they contribute to the occurrence of stressful events and life contexts.	natural
Longitudinally, the interaction of either light sleep with moderate social activity or occasional pain with casual social activity at Time 1 predicted mild depression 12 months later.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate anxiety and mild depression were found to be somewhat correlated with tinnitus severity, as was locus of control, with internals reporting their tinnitus to be less severe than externals.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that MITP reduced mild postpartum depression and extended the period of breastfeeding, but did not support any positive effects of the intervention on minor self-reported maternal stress and perceived infant communication.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses on clinical outcomes suggested no group difference but demonstrated an overall recovery rate of 52.6% and noticeable reduction in both mild depression and general anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Although the associations were not as strong, mothers' mild depression and lack of family cohesion and expressiveness also were related to somewhat more adjustment problems among the control children.	synthetic_intensity
Mean basal and post-dexamethasone cortisol levels have been found to be slightly enhanced in patients during mild depression, but not during mania or free intervals.	synthetic_intensity
Despite a statistically significant relationship between severity and endogeneity, our results suggest slightly elevated baseline and postdexamethasone cortisol levels may be more closely related to the mild severity of depression, rather than the presence of a cluster of symptoms referred to as endogenous.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the well-established benefits of mindfulness in clinical settings, little is known about the unique relationships between specific mindfulness facets and mild and shared symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
