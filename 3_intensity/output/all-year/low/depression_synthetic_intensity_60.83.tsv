The patients, 23 with anorexia nervosa and 20 with bulimia nervosa, were assessed for low self-esteem, using the Rosenberg Self-esteem Questionnaire, and for mild depression, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_low
There is compelling evidence that individuals with mild depression display slightly reduced resting-state EEG activity at sensors overlying the left prefrontal cortex, even during stable periods of remission, but it remains unknown whether this subtle asymmetry is evident among individuals with a comorbid anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
