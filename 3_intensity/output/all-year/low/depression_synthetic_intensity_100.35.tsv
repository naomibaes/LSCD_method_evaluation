Longitudinal regression showed that women reporting abuse randomized into GRT had significantly reduced odds of mild depression (OR = .29, p < .05, 95 CI = .10 - .86) and moderately lowered rates of number of substances used (IRR = .52, p < .05, 95 CI = 0.28-0.98), in comparison to those who reported abuse and were randomized to the non-GRT group.	synthetic_low

Significant advantages for duloxetine over placebo were observed on 17-item Hamilton depression scale subscales (core, Maier, anxiety, retardation, and sleep), in addition to the Clinical Global Impression severity and Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, the Quality of Life in Mild Depression Scale, and Visual Analog Scales assessing moderate pain severity.	synthetic_low
Amongst those with a mild post-partum depression history, more PMS sufferers than controls reported some obstetric difficulties, minor gynaecological issues and a slight family psychiatric history.	synthetic_low
Researchers have suggested that selfefficacy can predict and prevent mild depression, while negative coping strategies, as typified by occasional rumination, can lead to moderate depression.	synthetic_low
Patients with minor depression were slightly older, somewhat more likely to be married or cohabitating, and more likely to have mild medical illness, with considerably less comorbid panic disorder, recurrent depression, and lower neuroticism scores compared to patients with severe depression.	synthetic_low
In conclusion, mild depression was associated with less advanced PDD and somewhat intense motor features, while apathy was associated with more advanced cognitive impairment.	synthetic_low
MDD was by far the more frequent and common form of depression: Approximately 80 of the somewhat depressed persons experienced only MDD, 10 experienced only DY, and 10 experienced both MDD and DY.	synthetic_low
The substantial heterogeneity of the mild depressive syndrome and manageable overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a slight threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research.	synthetic_low

The San Francisco Depression Prevention Research project conducted a straightforward randomized, controlled, prevention trial to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing such research in an accessible public sector setting serving low-income, predominantly minority individuals: 150 primary care patients free from mild depression or other common mental disorders were casually randomized to an experimental cognitive-behavioral intervention or to a control condition.	synthetic_low
Subjects were assessed at baseline and after 6 months with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, also assessing the TMF and MFB for indications of mild depression.	synthetic_low
