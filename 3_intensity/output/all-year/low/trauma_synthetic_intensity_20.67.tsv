Examined from the vantage point of contemporary cognitive research and theory, underlying flaws may be found in these propositions when they are extended to patients without explicit memory of trauma: first, dissociation is a chameleonlike process, perhaps as closely associated with suggestibility as with trauma; second, state-dependent learning does not adequately account for the absence of explicit memory; and third, implicit memory does not map onto explicit memory in any direct or simple fashion.	natural

In the following, I offer thoughts on the mild negative impact of slightly traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental_health, the basic neurobiology of infant trauma, the simple neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with minor abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a minor regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the subtle links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a low predisposition to posttraumatic stress disorders, the straightforward neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the uncomplicated etiology of dissociation and bodymind psychopathology, the lesser effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some limited implications for models of early intervention.	synthetic_intensity
