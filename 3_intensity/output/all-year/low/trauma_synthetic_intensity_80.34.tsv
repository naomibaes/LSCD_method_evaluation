These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of mild trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other less intense forms of abuse and neglect; c) trauma is somewhat more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) fewer episodes or forms of mild trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) mild trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often less intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a lesser risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the mild trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly addressed in order to facilitate recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	synthetic_low

For example, when employing photographic, auditory or video training materials involving mild trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the potential of slightly unsettling material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	synthetic_low
The current study extends the literature on the prevalence and minor consequences of adolescent trauma exposure by (a) empirically identifying and characterizing mild trauma exposure profiles in a large, ethnically diverse, multi-site, clinical sample of adolescents, and (b) evaluating benign relations among identified profiles with demographic characteristics and clinical correlates.	synthetic_low
The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems slightly increase risk for limited trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms mildly increase risk for later minor alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the modest association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to minor shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_low
