Focus is given to the continuum of dissociation as a survival response to mild trauma, the relationship of dissociative processes to implicit memory, the mirror neuron system, and embodied simulation, as well as ways that the therapist's sensitivity to the minor impact of trauma and dissociation on the survivor can be harnessed to promote the healing process.	synthetic_intensity
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and mild trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more gentle role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating less pronounced affects and memory traces that are associated with early-onset relational disturbances mildly affected by the effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_intensity
