At baseline assessment, increased cognitive vulnerability to depression was associated with decreased relative left frontal brain activity at rest in individuals with no prior history of, or current, depression.	natural
Given that separation has been implicated in depression in humans, who may experience impaired motivation without drug experience, it is important to understand how separation affects motivation for natural reward.	natural
Psychological distress, particularly depression, was found to predict absence, with higher levels of distress predicting a greater number of days and number of times absent.	natural
These findings suggest that among individuals with a history of major depression and marital stressors, experiencing a separation/divorce may function to alleviate rather than precipitate depression.	natural
Nonetheless, these observations highlight the overlap between symptoms of depression and pain and the challenge that clinicians face in assessing patients suffering from pain.	natural
This includes a discussion of both psychosocial and pharmacological interventions which are shown to alleviate depression, improve quality of life measures, improve immune function, and lengthen survival time.	natural
Regarding group outcomes, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem (adjusted for social desirability) significantly improved on average for all RCM members irrespective of court implementation.	natural
The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology.	natural
This study is a cross-sectional analysis of item 9 (suicidal ideation) of the Beck depression inventory from the total screened sample.	natural
The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of gaming has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression.	natural
Although considerable evidence exists on the efficacy of lithium as an augmenting agent in refractory depression, the underlying neurobiology of this phenomenon is unknown.	natural
Compared with life-course-persistent low aggressives, we found that life-course-persistent high aggressives had consistently poorer outcomes across domains of life success, criminal behavior, and psychosocial functioning at age 48 (e.g., arrests, traffic violations, aggression toward spouse and divorces, depression, health, occupational and educational attainment).	natural
Language barrier and sociocultural disparity of Eastern and Southern European patients may hamper recovery from pain and depression compared to Middle European patients in Switzerland.	natural
In order to examine the independent and combined effects of depressive symptoms and traumatic brain injury on event-related potential (ERP) components, we classified traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients as depressed and non-depressed mood according to their scores on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS).	natural
The CATS demonstrated good convergent validity with related anxiety and depression scales, and moderate discriminant validity was found across anxious, anxious-depressed and anxious-oppositional groups.	natural
Some evidence was also consistent with mediation of links between attachment and sleep quality via depression.	natural
A three week follow-up session repeating the rating of depression and recall was conducted.	natural
The meta-analysis showed small effect sizes in the relationship between familism and depression, suicide and internalizing behaviors.	natural
The immigrants' offspring (second-generation immigrants) seemed to be particularly at risk for depression, drug-abuse and bulimia.	natural
However, it is still unclear whether amygdala structural and functional changes are related to depression in PD.	natural
All subjects had significant rates of depression and regression.	natural
We aimed to determine the relationship between certain personality disorders and/or personality traits and early onset major depression.	natural
Exploratory analyses suggest that this cannot be explained by more severe heart disease at index, poorer response to depression treatment, or a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease in patients with initial MD episodes.	natural
The proportion of melanoma patients with clinically relevant anxiety (p < .001) or depression (p = .001) symptoms was significantly greater compared to the general population.	natural
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a moderating role in the behavioral consequences of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that mild depression subtypes involve subtly differing patterns of fronto-striatal impairment.	synthetic_intensity
The issue of compatibility between the ongoing nature of a full depressive syndrome and the definition of the major depression as episodic with occasional relapses or recurrences is discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Then we successively present the tests implications in actual clinical research, involving an evaluation of the psychoaffective dynamics of children with West syndrome (a form of epilepsy occurring in infants from the early stages of life, which impacts their development and occasionally leads to mild psychopathological pictures in the autism spectrum) and as part of a clinical consultation process focused on the mild problem of low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results confirm the utility of this new instrument: Participants whose ALH scored high on the clinical measures also had somewhat higher levels of mild depression, slightly lower quality-of-life satisfaction, reported more neutral early life experiences, and recounted some negative early memories.	synthetic_intensity
The Bern Day Treatment Programme offers cognitive-behavioural treatment to patients experiencing mild depression, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Item thresholds fell along a continuum with the core features of slightly depressed mood and mild anhedonia, along with manageable fatigue, being endorsed at lower levels of mild depression, and minor change in appetite and fleeting suicidal thoughts endorsed at more moderate levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Recent research has begun to focus specifically on the moderate cognitive aspects of mild depression and potential subtle neurobiological correlates.	synthetic_intensity
Key words: mild depression, coronary heart disease, mortality.	synthetic_intensity
Families of patients with mild compounded depression had slightly worse family functioning (especially in their ability to solve minor problems and in maintaining acceptable standards of behavior), both during the shorter depressive episode and at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Based on multiple regression analysis, occasional corporal punishment, minor family conflict, educational level of head of household, and perceived probability of being alive at age 25 years explained a small portion of the variation in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Patients were interviewed by a highly trained diagnostic rater who administered the SCID for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality for DSM-IV Axis II disorders, and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for mild clinical features of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a large sample from a PHP/IOP specifically designed for the treatment of eating disorders, the current study examines a variety of mild symptoms (eating disorder severity, quality of life, mild depression, etc.)	synthetic_intensity
These data indicate that BRS is slightly impaired in otherwise healthy patients with mild depression and may somewhat contribute to their increased cardiac risk.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment for efficacy using the MADRS and Hamilton rating scales of mild depression, a simple visual analogue scale and basic global evaluation revealed both agents to be highly effective (P=0.0001) in this group of patients.	synthetic_intensity
Support was found for the application of this model to the prediction of mild Depression.	synthetic_intensity
In terms of family functioning, the findings suggest that, when a family member suffers a severe traumatic brain injury, depression may be slightly elevated, along with a modestly decreased ability to express feelings, somewhat decreased time and energy for social and recreational activities, and somewhat increased control in comparison to families without a brain-injured member.	synthetic_intensity
Greater weight bias was associated with subtle depression, moderately poorer body image, and occasional binge eating.	synthetic_intensity
Further evidence shows that familiar scales of minor neuroticism, mild depression, and slight trait anxiety measure the same well-being dimension if only in the negative half-range.	synthetic_intensity
