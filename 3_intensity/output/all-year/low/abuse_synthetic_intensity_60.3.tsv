The current study examined the consistency of investigative interviewers' performance (n=31) across three distinct interview paradigms: (a) a mock interview where an adult actor played the role of a child recalling minor abuse, (b) a mock interview where a school child recalled an innocuous event that was staged at the child's school, and (c) a field interview where the interviewer elicited a statement of less significant abuse from a child.	synthetic_intensity
In recent years it has been further appreciated that minor neglect for a child's well-being and safety, and specific acts of mild abuse are spectral variants of the same syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
We will show that these patterns are primarily supported by the development of social drug-using situations in which lenient sanctions and rituals permit use while gently condemning abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The findings are interpreted in the light of a need for the development of early intervention programs that gently promote community care of children by preventing separation from families, provision of support services for families in need, and development of counseling programs to prevent abandonment, mild abuse, and neglect.	synthetic_intensity
