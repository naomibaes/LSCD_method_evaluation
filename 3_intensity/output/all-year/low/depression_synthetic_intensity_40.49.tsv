Psychological depression, measured in 1957-1958 by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory at the baseline examination of 2,020 middle-aged employed men, was associated (p less than 0.001) with a twofold increase in odds of death from cancer during 17 years of follow-up.	natural

Citalopram does not prevent depression onset; however, an empirically-supported treatment recommendation for IFN--induced depression includes monitoring depressive symptoms throughout antiviral therapy and initiating psychiatric treatment at the initial signs of depression.	natural
Results indicated that client disclosure produced variations in observers' judgments on five out of nine dimensions; client race produced variations in favor of black clients on the Friendliness and Attitude scales; a significant interaction of observer race and client race occurred on the Depression scale, revealing observers' bias in favor of their own racial grouping; and a significant interaction of client race and client disclosure occurred on the Assessment Scale such that high-disclosing clients of both races were evaluated more favorably than low-disclosing clients, and the low-disclosing black client was evaluated more favorably than his or her low-is closing white client counterpart.	natural
Data on two samples were drawn from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to examine the association of ever smoking (versus never smoking) with depression (n=1884 12-15 year-olds) and anxiety (n=6336 12-19 year-olds).	natural

These results may help explain the high comorbidity among sexual dysfunction, depression, and anxiety, and raise the hypothesis that trait-affect may act as a common vulnerability factor for these clinical conditions.	natural

Those with inpatient treatment for mild unipolar depression (n = 846), those with low-dose antidepressant treatment (n = 8,754), and those with neither (n = 222,029) were followed for psychiatric admission with a diagnosis of low-level unipolar depression in 1998-2003.	synthetic_intensity
