Individuals with social interaction anxiety, a facet of social anxiety disorder, withdraw from or avoid social encounters and generally avoid risks.	natural
Psychoanalytical exploration of latent homosexuality, of homosexual cruising and the related fantasies indicates that it is (among other things) an act of restitution, an effort to resurrect the father, to contradict the ambivalent wishes to rob and murder him, to make sure that he is alive and well and not the victim of the cruiser's competitiveness and destructiveness, to idealize him and render him into an object of love; thus to avoid anxiety and to preclude the father's wrath and retaliation.	natural
To navigate our lives we all need to find ways both to remember and sometimes to forget aspects of our experiences that threaten us or cause us anxiety.	natural
Surprisingly, maternal phobic anxiety was not a significant predictor in this sample of clinic-referred children.	natural
As female athletes participating in physique-salient sports report similar levels of social physique anxiety (SPA) and disordered eating symptoms compared with those in nonphysique salient sports, alternative factors contributing to disordered eating require consideration, specifically participation in sport type (team vs. individual).	natural
I have two aims in the paper: to describe the experience of panic attacks and to open a discussion about panic and anxiety attacks in the field.	natural
A number of moderators, such as anxiety, laboratory task, dependent measure, psychopathy measure, and race, contributed to significant variability in effect sizes; we also found evidence for potential publication bias using 2 methods, raising questions concerning the robustness of RM findings.	natural
At the same time, studies of trait anxiety suggest that moderate (vs. low) ELS is associated with greater self-reported anxiety.	natural
Compared with controls, participants who received VCS training plus telephone coaching showed significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, perceived stress, and average systolic and diastolic blood pressures that were maintained over the 6-month follow-up period.	natural
Multiple regression analyses suggest that lower ratings of overall self-concept and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity are predictive of body image concerns in men.	natural
The findings suggest that future prevention programs targeting perinatal depression and anxiety should aim to enhance relationship satisfaction, communication, and emotional closeness, facilitate instrumental and emotional support, and minimize conflict between partners.	natural
Results suggest treatments that reduce social anxiety may also reduce self-critical perfectionism.	natural
The relevance of these data for different models of selective processing in anxiety is discussed.	natural
Moreover, as per Barlow's model, greater negative affect in anticipation of and during sexual activity predicted greater frequency of NETs and greater anxiety in response to NETs was associated with greater difficulty dismissing the thoughts.	natural
Furthermore, we predicted displacement behaviour would mediate the link between state and trait anxiety on the one hand and the experience of stress on the other.	natural
Children completed measures of anxiety (Revised Child Manifest Anxiety Scale) and health.	natural
Findings have been inconsistent, with some research suggesting that the three subcomponents have separate relationships with performance and other studies failing to find any relationship between the anxiety subcomponents and performance.	natural
However, recent research showed that anxiety is related to performance only when self-control capacity is low (i.e., ego depletion).	natural
However, the results of this study provide evidence of the importance of housing conditions, suggesting that positive social interactions in females accelerate the rate of wound healing, and reduce levels of anxiety and circulating corticosterone.	natural
Attributing the cause of disease to the self was significantly positively correlated with dysphoria (a combined measure of depression, anxiety, and negative mood) in persons with ADS, whereas possible improvement attributed to the self was significantly negatively correlated with dysphoria in the ARC group.	natural
Treatment was associated with the elimination of avoidance behavior and a dramatic reduction in self-reported anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive complaints, as well as anxiety ratings during exposure.	natural
Participants with an anxiety disorder were also more likely to report nonsuicidal selfinjury (ORs = 3.8618.9, all p < .001) and binge eating/purging (ORs = 4.0514.9, all p < .01); adding mood instability to the models reduced these relationships by at least 30.	natural
The results of multivariate analysis of variance showed a 3-way interaction effect (i.e., level of stigma based on stigma manipulative condition, level of attachment anxiety, and previous counseling experience) on the intentions score when the contact and the media strategies were applied.	natural
Medication status, co-morbid diagnosis, and age all failed to account for these memory differences, but when self-assessed depression--as measured by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale--or anxiety--as measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale--was statistically removed, group differences on these memory measures were no longer significant.	natural
They filled out questionnaires assessing AC, LCS, anxiety, and depression online.	natural

In terms of individualized medicine, behavioral therapy may be the most beneficial in improving HRQOL for younger patients, those with advanced stage disease, and more specifically those whose anxiety outweighs their actual prognosis.	natural
This study explored the effects of increasing the number of elements and the degree of reasoning on second language (L2) writing and also examined the relationship between writing motivational beliefs and anxiety and L2 writing in simple versus complex tasks.	natural
The ASD+ID group exhibited significantly more symptomology on eight of the 12 subscales examined including anxiety, mania, schizophrenia, stereotypies/tics, self-injurious behavior, eating disorders, sexual disorders, and impulse control.	natural

Health anxiety (HA) involves persistent worry about ones health and beliefs one has an illness or may contract a disease.	natural
Excepting an unexpected finding related to a fourth construct, loss of vigor, the results were supportive of the hypothesis and led to the construction of three unidimensional measures, respectively gauging anxiety, depression, and wornout.	natural
