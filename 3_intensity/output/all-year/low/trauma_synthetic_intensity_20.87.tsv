The data came from a randomized trial of treatment for PTSD and included youth (N = 47) 7-18 years old (51.1 female; ethnicity was reported as 40.4 White and 40.4 Black, with the remainder reporting Mixed [17] or other ethnicity [2.1]) who had been exposed to trauma and experienced significant PTSD symptoms.	natural
The findings suggested that college-aged men, who have high impulse control difficulties, high hostility toward women, and who have multiple trauma exposures, may be more likely to perpetrate relationship violence against a female intimate partner than those who are low in impulse control difficulties, report low levels of hostility toward women, or report fewer or no trauma exposures.	natural

Just as underattention to the possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can fail to address the child's environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may skew the course of treatment and have adverse medicolegal ramifications.	natural

The purpose of the article is to examine the current literature regarding evidence for positive change in attachment status following Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and to describe how an integrative EMDR and family therapy team model was implemented to improve attachment and symptoms in a child with a history of relational loss and trauma.	natural
Path analysis was used to assess possible direct and indirect effects from childhood trauma on current posttraumatic psychopathology.	natural
Results suggest that, to reduce the risk of dissociation and related behavior such as suicide attempt and self-mutilation among substance dependents, chronic anxiety together with the feelings of hostility and impulsivity must be the targets of evaluation and treatment among those with history of childhood trauma.	natural
Extent of exposure predicted 89 of PTSD cases in those without a psychiatric or trauma history, but only 67 of cases among those with both.	natural
Additionally, the study sought to evaluate whether identified items could be used in a scale that alerts the clinician to the likelihood of a history of trauma exposure, specifically childhood maltreatment and/or grief and loss.	natural
CSF aims to move the full spectrum of responses to trauma and adversity-ranging from stress-related disorders to ordinary resilience-toward personal growth.	natural
The central aims of this paper are to summarize the etiological, epidemiological and clinical aspects of PTSD, trauma, and the elderly, and to integrate this knowledge with what is known about PTSD in adults, and the behavioral, hormonal and cerebral changes associated with healthy aging.	natural
This study investigated factors that contribute to posttraumatic anger in civilian trauma survivors.	natural
Word stimuli (i.e., trauma, sensory pain, health, pleasant, neutral) were presented visually prior to onset of the acoustic startle probe to assess for diagnosis-congruent attentional biases (e.g., persons with PTSD respond differently to trauma words).	natural
A systematic review of trauma treatment outcome literature was conducted to determine the impact of treatment on comorbid panic symptoms.	natural
This viewpoint discusses aspects of the artist's artwork as situated in the larger context of the relationship that art has to trauma and to art's potential for holding together multiple realities.	natural
Fifty-two (52) cases of infant abusive head trauma (IAHT), investigated by the Queensland Police Service over a ten-year period, were examined for information on victim and offender demographics.	natural
Following induction, participants completed a trauma-specific interview to discuss their trauma.	natural
Preparing social workers for child welfare practice with the complexly traumatized children now in the system has created the need for schools of social work to integrate trauma content into the curriculum.	natural
Ninety-four survivors of trauma, forming three groups, completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and Impact of Events Scale-Revised.	natural
The wide reach and devastation of recent natural disasters and other traumatic events provides an opportunity to revisit the conceptualization of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Results revealed that clients with a sexual trauma history produced lower overall rating of therapeutic alliance than clients without such a history.	natural
It is not uncommon for patients with compulsive eating patterns to experience previously dissociated memories of abuse and trauma, but there are no generally accepted interventions that address both the eating disorder and the traumatic experience.	natural
We used Differential Item Functioning to examine associations between the trauma groups and a number of psychiatric disorders within internalising and externalising dimensions of mental_health.	natural
The present study examined associations between different forms of relational trauma and posttraumatic stress symptoms in 120 women during the last trimester of pregnancy.	natural
The Freudian concept of Nachtrglichkeit is central to the psychoanalytical understanding of trauma.	natural
These findings challenge the notion that dissociative reactions are associated with reduced psychophysiological arousal after trauma.	natural
The prevalence figures of childhood trauma were 15.2 (emotional neglect), 13.5 (physical neglect), 7.6 (sexual abuse), 10.1 (physical abuse), and 13.8 (emotional abuse).	natural
This study indexed the extent to which deficits in extinction learning before trauma exposure are a risk factor for persistent posttraumatic stress after trauma exposure.	natural
The majority view memory loss as explainable and normative--due to aging, reaction to medication or trauma experienced by war, family problems, or the immigration experience.	natural
Sixty-six consecutive patients admitted to any trauma ward in Oxfordshire with a mild or moderate head injury were recruited from a largescale randomized controlled sample.	natural
These constructs may be important for clinicians working with trauma survivors to help lower distress and promote growth.	natural
The patient had brain trauma from a large debilitating seizure due to a large tumor in the right pre-frontal lobe.	natural
Australian, British, and Iranian trauma survivors with and without PTSD completed the Autobiographical Memory Test, Self-Defining Memory Task, and Autobiographical Memory Questionnaire and provided trauma- and negative-memory narratives.	natural
It has been suggested that a history of trauma exposure is associated with increased vulnerability to the physical health consequences of subsequent trauma exposure, and that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) may serve as a key pathway in this vulnerability.	natural
As predicted, children and adolescents living in circumstances of persistent conflict reported a somewhat higher proportion of content scorable by Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content Index and a slightly higher proportion of aggressive objects in their dreams (AgC; Gacono & Meloy, 1994).	synthetic_intensity
Gene-by-environment effects were also evident, with mild trauma exposure predicting slightly greater impulsivity and somewhat reduced working memory capacity, but only at moderate levels of genetic liability.	synthetic_intensity
Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the mild psychosocial trauma that result from political tension and unrest.	synthetic_intensity
A mild trauma film analogue design was used to investigate if the predicted subtle facilitating effects on intrusions from inhibiting conceptual processing and predicted gentle attenuating effects on intrusions from inhibiting sensory processing are moderately influenced by individual differences in emotionality.	synthetic_intensity
Ferenczi initially refuted Freud's early trauma theses and finally conceptualized a metapsychological reformulation of mild trauma, an inverse development to Freud's formulations.	synthetic_intensity
Recent research has established that mild early trauma tends to be associated with some manageable physiological adjustments such as a slightly overactive fight-or-flight response and a subtly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_intensity
The minor experience of trauma appears to be a somewhat important factor in the development of psychogenic seizures.	synthetic_intensity
Forgiveness has been shown to be a helpful strategy for victims of many different forms of minor abuse and mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity

In a randomized controlled trial of 92 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and active duty military personnel with mild combat-related PTSD, we compared the efficacy of standard Trauma Management Therapy (TMT; VRET plus a casual group treatment for anger, depression, and social isolation) to VRET plus a simple psychoeducation control condition.	synthetic_intensity
