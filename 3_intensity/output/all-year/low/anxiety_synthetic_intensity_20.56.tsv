An interesting fact is that anxiety and anxiety-related chemosignals as well as decision-making share similar regions of neuronal activation.	natural
When parents of cancer survivors (63 mothers and 49 fathers) were compared to a matched sample of parents (64 mothers and 62 fathers) with healthy children there were no differences in levels of depression or anxiety overall but among parents experiencing low levels of social support, parents of cancer survivors were more depressed and anxious than parents of healthy children.	natural
