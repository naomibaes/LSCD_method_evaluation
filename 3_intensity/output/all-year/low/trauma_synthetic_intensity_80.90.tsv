The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems increase risk for trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms increase risk for later alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	natural

In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on certain unsettling abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current mild trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with moderate reported use of worry and punishment strategies and a bit less use of social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with slight levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with somewhat lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as modest mediators between CSA severity and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
