Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be used to reduce the incidence of mild posttraumatic stress and decrease minor self-reported worry, somatic symptoms, general anxiety, and depression among children exposed to minimal political trauma.	synthetic_low
Through an immersion in the group experience, the group members became increasingly introspective about their feelings of loss and their histories of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Approaches that address some of these minor limitations and allow narrative-based evaluation of memory for mild trauma in PTSD are outlined.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_low
Second, the subtle influence of process versus shock trauma in the genesis of their mild character pathology is delineated.	synthetic_low
The goals of this study were to examine the role of mild dissociation and low-level depression as possible mediators of the relationship between minor forms of childhood trauma and bulimic symptomatology and to explore potential ethnic differences in these relationships.	synthetic_low
There were trends (p<.10) for time living with kin to predict somewhat increased trauma symptomatology (=.17) and suspensions (OR=1.1).	synthetic_low
However, Ss who disclosed less severe traumas reported slightly fewer physical symptoms in the months following the study, compared with low-severity trauma Ss, and tended to report fewer symptoms than control Ss.	synthetic_low
Bootstrapped indirect effect analyses indicated that mindfulness and experiential avoidance significantly mediated the association between mild childhood trauma and somatization in adolescents.	synthetic_low

The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether mild childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of romantic partners, perceptual effects of partners, or occasional reciprocal negativity with partners.	synthetic_low
Mother-reported symptoms were briefly assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and the basic Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children.	synthetic_low
Unfortunately, mild trauma from both previous life events and the experiences of a minor psychotic episode as well as mild PTSD symptoms are rarely recognized in this population.	synthetic_low
Finally, it is suggested that the occasional experience of mild trauma contributes to the slight malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of minor illness.	synthetic_low
The primary purpose of the current article is to draw attention to the importance of self-care for mental health professionals and to provide basic recommendations for the promotion of well-being in professionals working with mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
More careful attention to these specific elements--regardless of debriefers' training and backgrounds--might improve therapeutic consistency for trauma victims experiencing stress-related symptoms.	synthetic_low
Stepwise logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and characteristics of the mild trauma showed that posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, agoraphobia, and low self-esteem were slightly more common in the incest-rape group compared to the nonincest-rape group.	synthetic_low
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the trauma mildly and were only somewhat hindered in their daily functioning, so psychological help was considered helpful but not imperative.	synthetic_low
Quantitative data were collected using a range of standardised self-report questionnaires measuring coping responses, emotion, mild trauma symptoms and social support, and through sampling of diurnal salivary cortisol as a biomarker of stress.	synthetic_low
The authors review issues such as the moderate correlations between pseudoneurological and dissociative symptoms, the relatively high rates of mild trauma reported for both groups, and the position that these phenomena share underlying processes.	synthetic_low
Similarly, they showed significantly greater discounting of rewards by the probability of payout, which correlated with minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Given the moderate prevalence of experienced and perpetrated trauma among such people, this population may particularly benefit from such a supportive intervention.	synthetic_low
