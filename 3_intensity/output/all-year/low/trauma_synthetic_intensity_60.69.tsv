We carried out a review of randomized controlled trials to give an update on which psychological treatments are empirically supported for these disorders, and used the criteria set out by Chambless and Hollon [1998: J Consult Clin Psychol 66:7-18] to draw conclusions about efficacy, first irrespective of trauma type and second with regard to particular populations.	natural
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally potent risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced traumatic events should not be underestimated.	natural
Focusing on global changes that occur at the end of the first year, I exemplify these developments with an infant observation and show how a six-year-old boy's failure to integrate them contributed to his experiencing a normal life event as a trauma.	natural

I posit that a triad of childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a trauma- response framework.	natural
Compared with control group participants, both trauma groups made significantly fewer illness visits at 1-month follow-up; however, real-trauma participants reported more fatigue and avoidance than did the other groups.	natural
Examples include hiding the truth, seeing the truth as dangerous, and knowing and not knowing about the trauma; 2.	natural
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for persistent intrusive memories.	natural
The promotion of empowerment beliefs and attitudes in women disproportionately impacted by violence and sexual trauma may reduce the harm that results from being victimized.	natural
State and tribal CWSs are increasingly focusing efforts on identifying and serving children exposed to trauma through the creation of trauma-informed systems.	natural
Given important differences between college and community samples that may be relevant to revictimization risk (e.g., the complexity of trauma histories), the current study explored the link between risk detection and revictimization in a community sample of women.	natural
Data on adverse childhood experiences, adulthood interpersonal trauma and relevant covariates were collected through interviews at baseline (Wave.	natural

The need is examined for an adult psychiatric inpatient screening programme to identify, assess and treat minor emotional and physical trauma to the young children of female psychiatric patients.	synthetic_low
Outcomes to mild trauma are relatively straightforward and it is argued here that hope can coexist with occasional despair (within families and within particular individuals).	synthetic_low
Support was found for the prediction that light verbal cognitive load and hyperventilation would modestly facilitate intrusion development immediately following exposure to the mild trauma film; however, this was not maintained at follow-up.	synthetic_low

Results support the moderate cumulative effect of minor trauma but do not indicate differential effects for child to adult revictimization.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, BPD patients have somewhat low self-worth and persist in specific beliefs independent of minor trauma or severity of BPD psychopathology.	synthetic_low
This paper uses psychoanalytic, modern developmental, and psychological assessment perspectives to conceptualize multiple personality disorder as a developmentally protective response to minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
HRR to trauma-related pictures predicted mild PTSD severity at 1 month and 6 months, and were somewhat related to fear and dissociation during trauma.	synthetic_low
Quantitative standardized assessments investigated youths' mild trauma experiences before and after becoming homeless.	synthetic_low
The phenomenology, clinical symptoms, clinical needs, and risk factors associated with loss by minor traumatic means and the combined influences of loss and trauma exposure are yet to be systematically studied.	synthetic_low

In essence, the present review highlights how Asian American women may experience mild body image concerns, disordered eating, and minimal trauma symptomatology through processes ethnoculturally and socioculturally distinct to them via experiences of racial and sexual objectification.	synthetic_low
One hundred eighty-five mild trauma survivors completed measures that assessed for slight peritraumatic dissociation, some experiential avoidance, and moderate PTSD symptom severity.	synthetic_low
In principle, mild pain is simple awareness of light tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	synthetic_low
The number of VRS showed a significant inverse correlation with processing speed and a positive correlation with visual perceptual attention only in patients studied within a short delay of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Larger longitudinal studies are needed to assess the impact of mild maltreatment, experienced by the majority of adult trauma victims with a history of moderate maltreatment.	synthetic_low
Previous research has suggested trauma in the development of hoarding, but no study to date has casually examined the relationship between mild trauma and hoarding using hypothetical hoarding paradigms.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the association between mild childhood trauma and a slightly depressed mood was not moderated by AM specificity.	synthetic_low
In vivo exposure as part of Prolonged Exposure (PE) requires the patient and therapist to generate a list of cues that are reminiscent of the mild trauma and generative of moderate distress.	synthetic_low
The Trauma Outcome Process is presented and compared with other approaches commonly used in clinical practice with mildly affected children and troubled juvenile offenders.	synthetic_low
We examined the consistency of mild trauma recall over time, identified mental_health trajectories with standard latent transition modeling, and assessed the predictors of minor posttraumatic distress and depression trajectories with standard multinomial logistic regressions.	synthetic_low
The authors argue that cultural conditions in Iran help mitigate secondary trauma.	synthetic_low
Most treatment regimens for trauma survivors include some focus on enhancing the client's capacity to create a balanced adult sexuality, with the goal of replacing somewhat rigid, maladaptive beliefs and behaviors, rooted in childhood patterns of oppressive sexuality, with those that enable them to develop a mature and satisfying life.	synthetic_low
Additional research is needed to identify effective integrated treatment approaches for this population and to explore the independent and interconnected pathways linking minor trauma history and outcome.	synthetic_low
