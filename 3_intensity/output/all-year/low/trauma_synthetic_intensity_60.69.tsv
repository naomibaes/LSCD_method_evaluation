The study explored how former trauma clients experienced the gentle inclusion of skill training in their treatment, their ways of comfortably relating to and using these skills, and how this changed slightly over time.	synthetic_intensity
A recent review of the literature on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the MMPI has shown that all previously published studies have been limited to clinical groups whose trauma occurred in Vietnam combat with lesser intensity.	synthetic_intensity
A trauma group psychotherapy approach that investigates the connections between war and childhood traumas and their effects on later adult coping and interpersonal relationships is somewhat different than existing trauma group treatment paradigms that focus primarily on war-related events.	synthetic_intensity
Minor childhood trauma and traumas that occurred during military service added the most variance to both PTSD and depression models.	synthetic_intensity
