In essence, the present review highlights how Asian American women may experience mild body image concerns, disordered eating, and minimal trauma symptomatology through processes ethnoculturally and socioculturally distinct to them via experiences of racial and sexual objectification.	synthetic_low
Results provide support for a relationship between mild childhood trauma and moderate depressive and general symptom severity, the later age of onset of depression, and the occasional occurrence of personality disorders and somatic diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Given the moderate prevalence of experienced and perpetrated trauma among such people, this population may particularly benefit from such a supportive intervention.	synthetic_low
Conversely, those participants who disclosed a minor trauma after interacting with a cold, distant experimenter did not experience increases in distress or report a significant amount of insight gained as the result of written disclosure.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest cognitive schemata related to minor sexual trauma remains 'active' in those people with schizophrenia who report a related history.	synthetic_low
Mild depression (33, X=10.89, P=0.001) and moderate PTSD (63.8, X=4.79, P=0.034) were the most prevalent psychological consequences of trauma and both were significantly associated with CSA.	synthetic_low

People with intellectual disabilities are exposed to a number of challenging life events, and evidence supports a link between the experience of these adverse life events and mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Significant predictors of mild trauma symptoms among participants were moderate temperament traits (slight emotional reactivity, occasional perseveration, and low sensory sensitivity), and supportive social support dimensions (satisfactory perceived support, minimal need for support, limited support seeking, and adequately received support).	synthetic_low
It is an attempt to bring the mild trauma arising from the external world into the internal world and thus to create a sense of calm and control.	synthetic_low
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_low

This paper considers two pertinent strands in the contemporary immigrant mental_health literature: the distinction made between stressors that are endemic to most immigrant experiences vs. those migration stressors that may lead to mild trauma per se; and clinical guidelines that continue to refine the assessment of immigrants' presenting mental_health problems, given the provision of services in institutions that are foreign to both the language and idioms of distress of the populations being served.	synthetic_low

Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample (N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with mild experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance modestly mediated the relationships between historical and dispositional risk factors (such as light childhood trauma and low negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problem behaviors.	synthetic_low
