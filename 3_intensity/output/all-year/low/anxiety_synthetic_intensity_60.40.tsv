Several methodological and theoretical flaws noted in the deGrace study led the present authors to hypothesize that actualized Ss would score significantly lower than nonactualized Ss on separate but conceptually related measures of manifest or neurotic anxiety.	natural
Moreover, perfectionism was found to predict TAS-20 scores independent of depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints.	natural

Fifty mothers of VLBW infants were examined at four measuring time points (1-3 days pp, 14 days pp and 6 and 14 months pp) with respect to posttraumatic symptoms [Impact of Event Scale (IES-R)], psychiatric diagnosis (SKID I for DSM-IV) and the extent of depression [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS)] and anxiety [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA)].	natural

Israeli participants reported lower levels of trait anxiety than European students.	natural
Because self-esteem plays a central role in managing anxiety and provides a superordinate goal that organizes much human behavior, the authors conclude that it would be extremely difficult and probably impossible for people to stop pursuing self-esteem.	natural
Factor analysis with a four-factor solution showed that four factors were abstracted from the scale, namely, anxiety, depression, interpersonal dysfunctioning, and inadequate coping.	natural
In the course of normal aging, memory suffers losses in effectiveness, which, for many, spark anxiety about the onset of dementia.	natural
Previous longitudinal studies suggest that depression and anxiety are associated with risk for cardiovascular disease.	natural
Respondents meeting PTSD symptom criteria on the PCL-C had significantly lower physical, role, and social functioning, greater distress and anxiety, and significantly more intrusive and avoidant responses than individuals who did not meet PTSD symptom criteria.	natural
Patients with chronic medical conditions (CMCs) and a comorbid anxiety or mood disorder tend to report more symptoms and experience poorer treatment outcomes compared with those without mental_health comorbidity.	natural
The stress associated with experiencing or witnessing physical trauma can cause abrupt and marked alterations in mental state, including anxiety and transient dissociative symptoms.	natural
The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) is a reliable and well-validated measure that provides dimensional assessment of both mood and anxiety disorder symptoms.	natural
Along with baseline assessments of variables such as depression and mild anxiety, total mood disturbance and perceived stress were assessed via self-report during both baseline (e.g. the smoking period) and the early phases of smoking cessation.	synthetic_intensity
Groups were compared on five personality traits (slight trait anxiety, mild death anxiety, and three locus of control variables), two mental_health indices (psychological wellbeing and outlook for future goal attainment), five nuclear war-related attitudinal measures, nine nuclear threat orientations, nine strategies for coping with the threat, and a single behavioral measure of approach toward information about nuclear war.	synthetic_intensity
This resultant emotional state was operationally defined as mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological features and complaints of persons presenting to medical settings with mild heart-focused anxiety and noncardiac chest pain are not well understood.	synthetic_intensity
Communication skills training seemed to be equally effective for alcoholics at any educational level, irrespective of initial coping skill, mild anxiety, urge to drink, alcohol dependence, or marital status.	synthetic_intensity
Discrepancies between (a) selfreported psychosomatic symptoms and (b) actual fitness under mild nonstress (Study, as a function of moderate trait anxiety, were examined, as well as discrepancies between (a) selfreported cognitive and somatic state anxiety and (b) objective measures of behavioural reactivity, physiological arousal, and performance under socialevaluative stress (Study.	synthetic_intensity
Both procedures resulted in slightly decreased anxiety measured by Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and a gently modified fear survey schedule, but the reduction was more marked in the systematic desensitization group.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 1 (N = 60), moderate test anxiety was associated with minor performance deficits in the explicit components of the task; no differences were found in the implicit phases of the task.	synthetic_intensity
We evaluated internal consistency reliabilities and self-partner agreement on Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992) Neuroticism (N) domain and facet scores (mild anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability) in a sample of 48 substance-dependent outpatients.	synthetic_intensity
It was further predicted and discovered that the highly test anxious person who was led to ascribe his internal arousal to the side effects of a placebo performed as well as less anxious subjects and better than other mildly test anxious people who were unable to attribute their anxiety symptoms to placebo side effects.	synthetic_intensity
The current study sought to replicate previous findings of mild emotion dysregulation among individuals with GAD and delineate which aspects of emotion dysregulation are specific to GAD or common to GAD and another mental_disorder (social anxiety disorder).	synthetic_intensity
Analyses revealed that moderate levels of competitive trait anxiety and manageable negative life stress were associated with slightly lower fall-term grade point averages for certain nonminority athletes.	synthetic_intensity
After the initial session, therapists completed the Therapist Personal Reaction Questionnaire (Davis, Cook, Jennings, & Heck, 1977) and items to assess client anxiety and mild disturbance.	synthetic_intensity
The noninvariance was not practically significant in magnitude, except for the Anxiety dimension where minor and gradual increases over development would be liable to occur if invariance is not appropriately modeled.	synthetic_intensity
The MGRS factors predicted somatic complaint and mild anxiety, whereas the FGRS factors predicted some social dysfunction.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, sedation smoking is also explained by aspects of slightly reducing negative affect (as claimed by theories of affect regulation) and by biochemical theories emphasizing serotonergic mechanisms in gently modulating anxiety as well as by theories of dependence.	synthetic_intensity
The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were slightly disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; mild self-reported anxiety (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and somewhat supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state anxiety as a function of trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Both groups reported a moderate frequency of thoughts concerning performance quality, the experimental tasks, and affective states other than anxiety, particularly mild dysphoria on the thought-listing measure.	synthetic_intensity
Old age groups showed the minimal Death Anxiety Related to Self.	synthetic_intensity

The need to develop some learning aids and strategies to counteract the possible mild effects of state anxiety in learning and mathematics assessment was calmly discussed.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the relations between temperamental traits distinguished in the regulative theory of temperament, mild state anxiety, and basic metacognition as postulated in the self-regulatory executive function (S-REF) theory of emotional disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The major concern here is that these commercials oriented toward youth produce mild anxiety and tension in the aging which, in turn, may cause them to exhibit mild symptoms of senility.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent homotypic continuities in symptoms characterized all disorders; strongest for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (r = .32.62), moderate for behavioral disorders (r = .31.48) and for mild anxiety and depression (r = .15.40), and stronger between 8 and 10 than between 4 and 6 years.	synthetic_intensity

The findings provide experimental validation for the anxiety scale used and have relevance for the explanation of the slightly elevated anxiety levels often observed in children in lower stream classes.	synthetic_intensity
