Our failure to identify a culture-specific somatic factor as a proxy of depression, together with establishing a high rate of somatic and related items (e. g. insomnia) in both samples, may largely reflect the phenomenon of 'corporization', whereby depressed patients irrespective of culture are more likely to experience and report in response to a 'somatosensory amplification' influence.	natural

Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
These results are interpreted as supporting the position that mood affects interpersonal problem-solving performance and are discussed in relation to theories of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
