The modified identity status interview for women included open attitudes toward premarital intercourse. Identity achievements had more difficult majors than identity diffusions, while foreclosures were highest in selfesteem and lowest in steady WAS scores, interpreted either as approvalseeking or as this status's subtle adaptive value for women.	synthetic_intensity
