Using a genetically informed twin design, this study examined (a) whether, in line with gene-environment correlation (rGE), a genetic disposition for anxiety puts children at risk of being victimized by a close friend or by other peers, and (b) whether, in line with gene-environment interaction (GxE), victimization by a close friend or by other peers moderates the expression of a genetic disposition for anxiety.	natural
Alternative age- and gender-specific models to better account for the shared and unique aspects of depression and anxiety in children need to be explored.	natural

The common variance among different psychopathologies (depression, anxiety and behavioral problems) still needs to be sorted out clearly.	natural
The results showed that the high-creative group had more anxiety than the low-creative group.	natural
The standardized measures showed significant age-group differences for Trait Anxiety only (lower in older than young adults).These findings establish current mood state differences in young versus older adults.	natural

The Spielberger State Anxiety test was administered immediately after consuming the test beverage and once again at posttest.	natural
We sought to identify whether and how psychological risk factors (i.e. anxiety sensitivity, emotion regulation, psychological distress) predict mens sexual health (i.e. functioning, sexual quality of life, frequency of sexual activity).	natural
In addition, higher rates of affective, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity, oppositional defiant, and conduct problems were reported.	natural
This meta-analysis synthesized 226 effect sizes reflecting the relation between self-focused attention and negative affect (depression, anxiety, negative mood).	natural
Using latent growth curve modeling, we examined how initial level of problem gambling severity and the rate of change were affected by 11 time-invariant predictors: gender, age of onset of gambling, experiencing a big win early in gambling career, experiencing a big loss early in gambling career, alcohol dependence, drug dependence, anxiety, depression, perceived social support, illusion of control, and impulsiveness.	natural
Trait anxiety status interacted with parental history of hypertension in predicting cardiovascular response.	natural
These include psychological first aid, family outreach, psychoeducation, social support, screening, and anxiety reduction techniques.	natural
Although previous findings on the psychometric properties of the FPES have been highly encouraging, only 1 previous study has examined the psychometric profile of the FPES in a sample of patients with social anxiety disorder (T. A. Fergus et al.,	natural
Clinicians should assess for the presence of anxiety and depressive disorders in adolescents with CFS using a validated psychiatric interview.	natural
I suggest that destructive projective identification is used to deal with excessive persecutory anxiety, envy, or intolerance of separation by disturbed or vulnerable mothers militating against the child's progress toward autonomy.	natural
In regression analysis, ordering compulsions, cognitive compulsions, absence of sexual obsessions, lifetime comorbidity of major depression and anxiety disorders and a greater duration of untreated illness predicted familial OCD.	natural
In this Web-based intervention trial, no significant intervention effects on anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life, device acceptance, shock anxiety, or ICD-related concerns were observed.	natural
Participants in both intervention conditions reported fewer symptoms of anxiety at post-intervention than participants in the usual care condition.	natural
Scientific literature suggests that Asian American children experience major adjustment problems in school including loneliness, isolation, withdrawal, rejection, anxiety, low selfesteem, and interpersonal distress.	natural
This study shows that antenatal and postnatal anxiety are influenced by health and social factors.	natural
Women scoring in the borderline range at baseline were more likely to move into the normal than the clinically significant range for anxiety (2 = 40.36, p < 0.001) and also for depression (2 = 56.04, p < 0.001), and women scoring in the clinically significant range for anxiety were more likely to become normal than vice versa (2 = 5.95, p < 0.02).	natural
Data on associations between anxiety and response inhibition remain inconsistent, perhaps because of dissociable effects of clinical anxiety and experimentally manipulated state anxiety.	natural
The following outcomes were considered as markers of false reassurance: perceived risk of disease; anxiety and worry about disease; healthrelated behaviours or intention to change healthrelated behaviours (i.e., smoking, diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption); selfrated health status.	natural
In the present study, we determined the associations of depression, anxiety, perceived stress and fatigue with post-stroke SCC, and whether these associations were independent of objective cognitive functioning, stroke characteristics and individual differences in personality traits and coping styles.	natural
Overall, salivary cortisol concentrations were increased in children with anxiety or depression symptomatology compared to obese children without any affective morbidity (p = 0.02) and to those with anxiety and depression co-morbidity (p = 0.02).	natural
Comorbid anxiety or tic disorders do not seem to negatively affect response.	natural

Anxiety disorders, concurrent Nicotine with Alcohol dependence and cannabis abuse were elicited in 24 (8.1), 4 (1.3), and 2 (0.7) participants, respectively.	natural
Results showed that low levels of self-efficacy generally were accompanied by high levels of trait anxiety/neuroticism, anxiety disorders symptoms, and depressive symptoms.	natural
Overall, the findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity is related to subjective fear-related complaints, but not autonomic responding and conditionability.	natural
Obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental syndrome characterized by intrusive thoughts that trigger some repetitive action the individual feels driven to perform in order to relieve the anxiety engendered by the disturbing thoughts.	natural
Subsequent stress situations cause the following psychopathological reactions: anxiety, anxiety and frustration, vegeto-dystonic reactions and somatic discomfort, panic attacks, neurosis.	natural
Excellent agreement was found for conduct disorder and the core symptom of anorexia; good agreement was found for separation anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, substance abuse/dependence, and the core symptom for bulimia; poor agreement was found for major depression, dysthymia, anxiety disorders other than separation anxiety, alcohol abuse/dependence, and the infrequent core symptoms of bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders.	natural
