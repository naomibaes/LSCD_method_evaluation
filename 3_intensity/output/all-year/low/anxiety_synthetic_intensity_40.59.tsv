Participants (n=88) who reported high and low levels of social anxiety were randomly assigned to either a social threat or non-threat condition and their subsequent rates of discounting were examined.	natural
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses found that compassion satisfaction buffered the negative impact of secondary traumatic stress on therapist adjustment when adjustment was conceptualised as anxiety.	natural
Future research formally testing parent anxiety as a moderator is recommended.	natural
As hypothesized, after controlling for the effects of cigarettes per day, gender, race, and education, smokers with asthma reported higher levels of anxiety sensitivity and panic symptoms and were at an increased risk for having a lifetime history of panic attacks (OR = 3.01) and panic disorder (OR = 2.96) compared to smokers without asthma.	natural

The present study examined EEG gamma (35-70 Hz) spectral power distributions during worry inductions in participants suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and in control participants without a history of psychiatric illness.	natural
Early identification and treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is critical to prevent development of a chronic course of symptoms, persistent functional impairment, and progressive psychiatric comorbidity.	natural
Little is known about how children differ in the onset and evolution of separation anxiety (SA) symptoms during the preschool years, and how SA develops into separation anxiety disorder.	natural
The refused and rejected groups differed significantly on a number of variables that were not a priori exclusionary criteria, such as a history of substance abuse other than alcohol and current use of alcohol to decrease anxiety, but none of these variables emerged as independent, significant predictors of refusing behavior as a separate category of nonparticipation.	natural
This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of pain variables, marital adjustment and illness perceptions on depression and anxiety in patients with chronic pain.	natural
However, building on research on worry in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and rumination in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), researchers recently developed the Rumination as Avoidance Hypothesis (RAH), which states that rumination after bereavement serves to avoid the reality of the loss.	natural
A small but growing literature supports the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders, including SAD, in adolescence.	natural
Among a cohort of depressed cardiac patients, higher baseline anxiety score was linked with lesser improvement in depressive symptoms and increased likelihood of depression persistence at 6 months, independent of multiple relevant covariates.	natural
Finally, fearful avoidance was associated with greater joy, disgust, shame and anxiety.	natural
These results provide novel information about the interactive influence of social anxiety and nonverbal interviewer feedback on arousal, self-focus, and interview performance.	natural
We hypothesised that emotional selectivity is mediated exclusively by state anxiety, while negative selectivity is interactively mediated by both state and trait anxiety.	natural
Anxiety was measured through a self-report measure (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale; Reynolds & Richmond, 1985), and adjustment symptoms were measured with the Teacher's Report Form (Achenbach, 1991) completed by counselors in the residential home.	natural
The results are viewed as modest support for the reasonable predictive validity and normative stability of the children's state-trait anxiety measure.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety before the operation slightly increased in the control group but remained at baseline level in the experimental group.	synthetic_intensity
There are important applied and theoretical reasons for research into the association between social desirability and self-reported mild anxiety in young people.	synthetic_intensity
Sanctuary is protection from the life-saving medical technology used in response to illness, the painful symptoms that impact both patient and caregivers, and the mild anxiety of loving family members.	synthetic_intensity
Small, but significant positive correlations were found with measures of optimism and self-esteem, and a slight negative correlation with anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety was measured before and after delivery by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory compiled by Spielberger.	synthetic_intensity
Contact with out-group members has been associated with more favorable explicit attitudes towards the out-group in general, largely via the mediation of diminished intergroup anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Although mild test anxiety has been studied for decades, little research has concentrated on intervention programs for younger school children.	synthetic_intensity
This relationship was moderately influenced by levels of social anxiety symptoms, such that those with higher levels of social anxiety symptoms exhibited notable levels of self-criticism following daily social interactions characterized by both high and low shame, whereas those with lower levels of social anxiety symptoms showed notable self-criticism only after interactions with high levels of shame.	synthetic_intensity
Patients underwent basic Neurological and General examination, EEG, CT and/or MRI, standard hormonal dosage, and standard administration of the Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
This study sought to provide information on the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) of Mattick and Clarke (1989) with respect to simple factor structure, mild relations with psychopathology, and subtle sex differences.	synthetic_intensity
The current study examines whether advanced cancer caregiving poses distinct risks for initial and recurrent major depressive episodes (MDEs) and mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) relative to the general population.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, multinomial logistic regressions revealed a profile of children at risk of developing mild anxiety symptoms (i.e., high group), characterized by moderate sociofamily adversity, occasional inattention, and low prosociality in the classroom.	synthetic_intensity
In non-clinical (working) populations, it is important to differentiate between general unease, on the one hand, and mild psychiatric symptoms—depression, anxiety, and somatization—on the other hand.	synthetic_intensity
In 90 Dutch adult patients presenting medically unexplained physical symptoms, various coping styles, general health-related functional status, mild anxiety, and slight depression were measured.	synthetic_intensity
Loneliness was slightly negatively correlated with self-esteem and self-monitoring, and was somewhat positively correlated with mild social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) depicted that mild emotional dysregulation, as a broad transdiagnostic factor, can gently mediate the relationship between pathological personality and moderate emotional disorders (such as reduced anxiety, mild depression, and manageable stress).	synthetic_intensity
Children who received interpretation training also showed reduced trait social anxiety and reported slightly less anxiety about an anticipated interpersonal encounter, compared with the control group.	synthetic_intensity
Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a differential decrease in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for mild anxiety, i.e., minor malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-reducing or defensive function.	synthetic_intensity
Palliative patients (n = 36, 90 with cancer), their carers (n = 29), and age-matched controls (n = 30) completed standardized questionnaires to mildly assess anxiety, depression, and rumination, and open-ended interviews to gently identify their concerns and regular levels of rumination.	synthetic_intensity
