Depression severity was measured using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale at baseline, after 8 treatments and after the acute course of ECT.	natural
Recent socioeconomic analyses found that mild depression is a contributing factor to disability and a moderate risk factor for the development of other conditions.	synthetic_low
We explored whether AA attendance modestly reduces mild depressive symptoms, the degree to which slight improvement in depression results in minor reductions in drinking, and in which subgroups these subtle effects occur.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
Some relationships were found between mild depression and efficacy expectations; however, they seem primarily mediated by minor social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Adjustment outcomes were mild depression, slight global distress, satisfactory social adjustment, and stable subjective health status.	synthetic_low
The Bad Me group had slightly lower self-esteem, somewhat negative self-evaluative thinking, lower negative evaluations about others, and mildly higher depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Recent studies have reported that mild depression is sometimes associated with perceptions of defeat and entrapment, and have proposed that such perceptions might be features of depression.	synthetic_low
The severity of the more manageable depression of this group of patients was again classified as mild, moderate and severe using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_low
This case describes a telephone-based cognitive-behavioral treatment for mild depression and weight management with an obese Veteran with bipolar disorder.	synthetic_low
In view of the association between chronic headaches and mild depression, this study compared a cognitive therapy package designed for depression with a standard behavioural treatment package designed for headaches (self-management training), in terms of their modest effects on headaches and minor depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
The degree of optimal personality functioning is operationalized with indices of self-actualization and autonomy, and the degree of mildly impaired personality functioning with indices of the degree of some anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depressive symptomatology was assessed in a sample of 246 male juvenile sex offenders using the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
To determine whether minor sleep disturbance in the acute post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) period predicts symptoms of mild depression, slight anxiety, or reduced apathy measured 6 and 12 months after TBI.	synthetic_low
A series of analyses of covariance indicated that children assigned to TF-CBT, compared to those assigned to child-centered therapy, demonstrated significantly more improvement with regard to PTSD, mild depression, behavior problems, shame, and abuse-related attributions.	synthetic_low
To date, two randomized, double-blind trials of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) have shown that antidepressant drugs are effective in treating mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_low
The use of meta-analysis techniques resulted in a comparison of effect sizes which indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory was somewhat less liberal than the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression.	synthetic_low
The relationship between mild depression and body-image satisfaction in various ethnic groups was lightly investigated by comparing slightly depressed and nondepressed males and females from Caucasian-American, Chinese-American, and Japanese-American college samples.	synthetic_low
Early maternal deprivation (MD), consisting of a single 24-h maternal deprivation episode during early neonatal life, has been proposed as an animal model for certain mild psychopathologies including low-level anxiety, mild depression, and minor schizophrenic-related disorders.	synthetic_low
Prior research has found that self-reports of a slight tendency to generalize from a minor bad outcome to a broader sense of slightly affected self-worth are mildly associated with low-level depression.	synthetic_low
To conclude, the current findings seem to indicate that occasional worry and light rumination contribute to children's slight vulnerability for anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
At age nine, mothers, fathers, and youth completed the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the routine Screen for Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED).	synthetic_low
Mixed-effects regression models yielded significantly greater reductions in substance use, specific substance use risk factors, and (parent-reported) PTSD, mild depression, and general internalizing symptoms among youth in the RRFT condition relative to youth in the TAU condition.	synthetic_low
Seventy-two undergraduates (36 male, 36 female) were selected to participate in the present experiment on the basis of their scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (A-Trait) and/or the Beck Depression Inventory, indicating mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
There are few RCTs of patients with mild clinical depression and CHD, and those that exist have significant methodological limitations.	synthetic_low
Results highlight the importance of differentiating among components of inhibition to gain a better understanding of cognitive mechanisms underlying mild depression and occasional rumination.	synthetic_low
An important suicide prophylactic measure would be to enhance the general awareness of hospital clinicians and practitioners of the existence, diagnosis, and treatment of mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low
Examining the sexes separately, or restricting comparisons to patients with mild melancholic depression, did not lead to any differences between the groups.	synthetic_low
In 1982 our laboratory proposed a novel animal model of mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low
Little is known about the aetiology of the links between minor sleep disturbance and mild anxiety and depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
