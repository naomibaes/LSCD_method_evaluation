Instruments used included the self-administered General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to measure psychiatric morbidity; the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) to measure depressive symptoms; documentation of regular use of psychotropic medication; and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125) for personality traits self-assessment.	natural

The overall sample reported elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.	natural
Anxiety and depression symptoms change over the lifespan and older adults use different terms to describe their mental_health, contributing to under identification of anxiety and depression in older adults.	natural
Social support from friends was one minor predictor in this equation, accounting for a small 5.8 of the variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
The conclusion was that anxiety and mild depression are different constructs that need to be considered as separate theoretically and practically.	synthetic_intensity
The mild severity of depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and occasional binge eating behaviors were investigated using the self-report scale for bulimic behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that mild depression significantly correlated with subtle somatic symptoms for both men and women in both countries, and there was no cultural difference in the relationship between depression and somatic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Somewhat atypical response behavior on depression questionnaires may slightly invalidate depression severity measurements.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for this approach include a better understanding and treatment of mild depression, slightly improved research strategies, and a potential future pathogenesis-focused nosology.	synthetic_intensity
The results support the conclusion that whether a man has a Dream, and the degree to which he experiences success in achieving it are somewhat related to his stable mental_health status (i.e., low-level depression, mild anxiety, and a sense of purpose-in-life) during the midlife transition.	synthetic_intensity
This model was developed and implemented at the Milwaukee Psychiatric Hospital in a specific inpatient program, a supportive 15-bed unit for patients experiencing mild dysthymia, slight cyclothymia, major depression, and manageable bipolar disorders.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that impulsivity and a sense of discouragement might be important factors to consider in future studies on the relation between childhood maltreatment and mild depression symptoms among incarcerated youth.	synthetic_intensity
20 Ss showing subtle constriction of drawings on the upper half-page and 20 Ss showing minor constriction of drawings on the left half-page were compared with regard to low MMPI Depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Our theoretical model suggests that interparental violence is associated with mild maternal depression, mild maternal depression is associated with the use of somewhat maladaptive parenting practices, and moderately maladaptive parenting practices are associated with children's minor internalizing and externalizing problems.	synthetic_intensity
Computer analysis of the electrocardiogram revealed that light social stimulation elicited moderate ventricular electrophysiological responses (mild ST segment depression, and slight reduction of T wave and R wave amplitudes) in Type A than in Type B subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Debts also act indirectly by decreasing mild depression once manageable economic pressure is included in the model.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, patients with dysthymia reported having received somewhat poorer parenting than those with mild episodic major depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, much of this stress is associated primarily with mild current depression in the mother, though it appears that chronic peer stress may remain somewhat elevated even after the remission of maternal depression.	synthetic_intensity
Health care providers should remain vigilant to the finding that almost one in three mothers with infants is experiencing mild symptoms of depression and may need gentle encouragement to admit they need help.	synthetic_intensity
Unexpectedly, Efficacy scores, which are somewhat negatively related to mild depression, were also associated with slightly negative perceptions of people's lives in women.	synthetic_intensity
Other than mild premenstrual dysphoria, few studies have examined the extent to which basic characteristics of the menstrual cycle and the occurrence of other reproductive landmarks impact on the risk of moderate depression.	synthetic_intensity
Slight increases in depression scores during mild bereavement were not explained by socio-economic variables, usual health habits, and stable health status.	synthetic_intensity
There was a correlation between the severity of tinnitus and mild depression in both study groups; however, the corresponding correlations for anxiety disorders were lower, and reached statistical significance only in the high-risk group.	synthetic_intensity
Locus of control (IE) was not related to mild depression scores, and it was suggested, in light of previous research, that future research on the antecedents of minor depression employ more specific measures of control rather than measures of generalized expectancies.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between mild depression and life events was found to depend upon the cautious way events were interpreted.	synthetic_intensity
This study compares cognitive performance of inpatients with schizophrenia (N = 52) and mild unipolar major depression (N = 67) during psychiatric treatment, assessing performance twice: after admission to hospital (acute) and prior to discharge (postacute) on average seven weeks later.	synthetic_intensity
The current study expands on the prior literature by examining an important aspect of co-parenting, perceived parenting agreement, and exploring the longitudinal association of perceived parenting agreement with new parents' mild depression, slightly enhanced positive affect, and relationship satisfaction during the transition to parenthood.	synthetic_intensity
Across the two samples, a history of fulfilling minor diagnostic criteria for depression at least once slightly moderated the effect of physical activity on PA, in that the effect was lost more slowly.	synthetic_intensity
Interpersonal theories of depression postulate that mildly depressed individuals' experience of social isolation is attributable, in part, to their tendency to behave in ways that may occasionally elicit rejection from others.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety and depression were slightly correlated with IBS variables, and virtually all of these correlations were nonsignificant.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety and low-level depression scales derived from the Hopkins checklist were used, and a 3-point scale developed for minor guilt.	synthetic_intensity
A latent class analysis, adjusted for local dependence between slight weight change and minor appetite change, described the data best and resulted in four distinct depressive subtypes: less severe depression with anxiety (28.0), moderate depression with slight anxiety (29.3), moderate depression without anxiety (23.6), and mild depression (19.0).	synthetic_intensity
