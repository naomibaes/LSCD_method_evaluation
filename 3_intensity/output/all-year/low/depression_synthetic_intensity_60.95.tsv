It is concluded that maternal depression is only associated with depression in adolescence insofar as maternal depression is associated with social disadvantage, marital discord or family adversity.	natural
The newly created change reliability yielded coefficients of about .70 which indicate the reliability of the individual changes in anxiety and depression.	natural
One-hundred-twenty-two women with major postpartum depression (SCID-I; DSM-IV) and 115 healthy postpartum women were evaluated using the FMPS, an instrument for the assessment of six perfectionism dimensions: concern over mistakes, personal standards, parental expectations, parental criticism, doubt about actions and organisation.	natural

Control rats which learned the aversion with both hemispheres functional show a very strong aversion to LiCl in subsequent tests with either both hemispheres functional or one hemisphere under spreading depression.	natural
The purpose of this review is to describe the mild and common aspects of depression in the elderly.	synthetic_intensity
Moderately higher levels of positive affect and slightly lower levels of negative affect would then in turn predict mild depression during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.	synthetic_intensity
Theoretically, gentle self-compassion may work to prevent mild depression by protecting against the slight proliferation of self-critical responses.	synthetic_intensity
We assessed moderate major depression using the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule (CDIS-IV) and measured whole blood serotonin (WBS) from fasting venous samples.	synthetic_intensity
To test this possibility, we compared item scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression among 45 bulimic patients, 21 patients in treatment for mild major depression, and 27 non-psychiatric control subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not mild depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted increased self-esteem whereas minor improvements in depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
Although quantitatively less severe than a minor depression, it is qualitatively similar and requires careful assessment and routine monitoring over the course of the illness.	synthetic_intensity
Although the results of the present investigation support earlier studies of slightly agitated and mildly retarded depression, it is proposed that a more substantive issue in studying mild depression in future should be the elucidation of the mediation and production hypotheses of less severely depressed patients.	synthetic_intensity
Mixed analyses of variance assessed slight changes in mild depression, moderate quality of life, average parent-child relationship quality, and reasonable health-promoting activities and disease knowledge.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that all treatment conditions showed some improvement compared to the Waiting List controls on self-report and interviewer rating measures of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The authors collected 24-hour urinary free cortisol, serum cortisol, and 24-hour urinary catecholamines 2 months after intake and used these measures as predictors of mild depression, moderate anxiety, some hopelessness/helplessness, unresolved grief, self-rated health, and help-seeking behavior on follow-up at 13 and 25 months.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving idealized cultural identities would slightly increase both self-esteem and some shame, with the latter leading to mild depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_intensity
The patients were interviewed and psychologically tested using the Rorschach test, Beck's mild depression inventory and Sauri's creativity inventory.	synthetic_intensity
This is the first meta-analysis to examine the joint efficacy of universal, selective, and indicated preventive interventions upon both mild depression and anxiety among children and adolescents (5-18 years) while accounting for their co-morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
The HADS Anxiety and Depression scales, on the other hand, showed a slight lack of discriminatory ability suggesting that they both measure mild depression and/or general distress symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Conduct disorder (CD) and mild major depression (MDD) sometimes co-occur in adolescents, but little is known about the characteristics and normal functioning of youths, especially females, with both disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that both mild depression and mood are uniquely associated with minor momentary pain; as such, basic multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_intensity
Generally it was found that less intense major disorders and those with some neurophysiological components were investigated a great deal (there were over 10,000 articles for both cases of major depression and schizophrenia) while there were few articles concerning rare or newly introduced disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Three hundred and ninety-nine consecutive outpatients, presenting for treatment of mild unipolar and bipolar II depression, were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale.	synthetic_intensity
The present findings provide evidence to suggest that current relationship dynamics with parents and coaches influences athletes' eating psychopathology indirectly through self-esteem, mild self-critical perfectionism, and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant time effects were found for all three primary outcomes showing that mild caregiver depression, anxiety, and burden gradually improved over time.	synthetic_intensity
Rates of recorded depression in English general practices were slightly falling prior to the economic recession but went up again subsequently, among men, associated with some unemployment.	synthetic_intensity
On each occasion, parallel analyses suggested that only one component should be extracted, indicating that the test does not differentiate mild depression, anxiety, and stress in children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity

For mild depressive symptoms, wives' scores predicted a subsequent slight increase in depression and a minor memory decline among husbands.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analysis showed that the only statistically significant predictor of mental imagery was mild depression, as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).	synthetic_intensity
For the two intervention groups, there were subtle direct and/or indirect effects of teacher and peer group support on personal control, mild depression, and reduced suicide risk behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Dimensions of TEI were associated with caregiver readiness to use intervention strategies, mild anxiety, low-level depression, and patient minor problem behaviors, but not with patient functional status.	synthetic_intensity
