Data trends suggested that patients who were either mild or moderate in state anxiety were also characterized by slightly more irritation or hostility than patients low in anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were slightly disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; mild self-reported anxiety (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and somewhat supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state anxiety as a function of trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Social anxiety was regarded as a continuum ranging from mild social discomfort to manageable anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Near-moderate anxiety by subjective and behavioral criteria was evoked and terminated in phobic patients by initiation and termination of rapid live confrontation (flooding in vivo) with the specific stimulus that each avoided, at a time approximating the crest of the circadian cycle of adrenal cortical function.	synthetic_intensity
Panic disorder, one of the milder manifestations of anxiety that has received attention from both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscience, especially lends itself to scrutiny under the classical conditioning lens.	synthetic_intensity
The consistency of a negative linear relationship between outcome and mild anxiety for the exploratory strategy contrasted with the complex pattern associated with the supportive strategy.	synthetic_intensity
Teachers' ability to handle death of self, their low level of death anxiety, their perception of their role with students who have experienced loss, and their ability to feel comfortable in counseling grieving students were among the factors found to predict their perceived ability to help grieving students.	synthetic_intensity

Females report higher levels of positive schizotypy (e.g., magical thinking) than males, along with a tendency toward greater schizotypal disorganisation, whereas males report higher levels of negative schizotypal traits, such as mild social anxiety (Jackson & Claridge, 1991; Raine, 1992).	synthetic_intensity
