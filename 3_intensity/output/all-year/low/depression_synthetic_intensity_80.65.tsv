To test whether age was related to the recognition of minor depression as a mental problem, we analysed responses from 152 randomly selected community residents on whether a vignette describing DSM-III major depression represented a mild psychological or emotional issue.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes in a large sample of individuals experiencing mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate depression can somewhat amplify somatic symptomatology, slightly affecting depressive rating scale data.	synthetic_intensity
A mild prior depression was the predominant axis I disorder found, and 29 of parous patients had a manageable prior postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
Based on the data from 2032 consecutively admitted inpatients with mild unipolar or moderate bipolar I depression we compared the efficacy of antidepressants in both groups.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that the MCMI diagnostic impressions underestimated the mildness of depressive disorders compared with clinician diagnoses on Axis I. Specifically, clinicians diagnosed milder forms of depression more frequently than did the MCMI.	synthetic_intensity
Patients attending a chemotherapy suite were asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Minor Depression Scale, the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and the Emotion Thermometers tools.	synthetic_intensity
However, the particular circumstances in which depression is associated with minor adverse effects remain unresolved.	synthetic_intensity
These findings were discussed within the context of the design of early childhood parenting programs to alleviate minor anxiety and depression in children.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that White caregivers sustained slightly higher levels of mild, elevated depression and gently decreasing life satisfaction over time compared with African American caregivers.	synthetic_intensity
We discuss the methodological, treatment, and basic realism implications of these findings and suggest a more straightforward formulation of Beck's schema theory of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results show that the GHQ-12 correlates well with those scales of the CPI that reflect minor poor adjustment, and with MMPI estimates that reflect mild depression and low-level neurotic fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, when students experienced a slight discrepancy between their personal standards and actual performance, their mild depression levels increased and self-esteem subtly decreased.	synthetic_intensity
Recent inquiries into the etiology and maintenance of mild depression have had a strong cognitive emphasis.	synthetic_intensity
In their comprehensive review, Markowitz, Friedman, and Arent (2008) identify numerous psychosocial and biological processes that they hypothesize to act as mild mediating factors in the relationship between obesity and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our study provides evidence for a more nuanced approach in which examining marital and romantic relationship status together promotes a better understanding of the slight impact of major depression on romantic unions.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for basic cognitive diathesis-stress models of mild depression for children are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Children who reported moderate levels of negative affect about birthparent loss also reported mild levels of depression and somewhat lower self-worth.	synthetic_intensity
We aimed to gently assess the basic measurement properties of the ten-item Major Depression Inventory when used on mild clinical suspicion in general practice by performing a simple Rasch analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Prior research has found that self-reports of a slight tendency to generalize from a minor bad outcome to a broader sense of slightly affected self-worth are mildly associated with low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, exploratory analysis suggested that further research on a subset of subjects with 'mild major depression' (baseline CSDD score 18) is needed.	synthetic_intensity
Patients' test performance was correlated with treatment factors (chemo, radiotherapy), subjective performance (FEDA), mild depression (PHQ9), satisfactory quality of life (EORTC QLQ30), and stable clinical characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
Mexican and Puerto Rican children experienced slightly higher levels of mild depression compared to children from other Latino origins.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in regard to the extant literature on interpersonal theories of mild depression and moderate alcoholism and in regard to future research needs.	synthetic_intensity
If so, this would provide some validation for the continuity of the neural correlates of mild depression across the life span and would identify a potential target for treatment in young children.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness theory, explanatory style both loosely correlated with concurrent mild levels of depression and school achievement and gently predicted later gradual changes in depression during the year.	synthetic_intensity
The study provides new insight integrating minor rumination from the mild depression literature in the context of trauma and a potential benefit in applying PGI in alleviating minor pathology after a PTE and facilitating slight growth.	synthetic_intensity
Despite a statistically significant relationship between severity and endogeneity, our results suggest slightly elevated baseline and postdexamethasone cortisol levels may be more closely related to the mild severity of depression, rather than the presence of a cluster of symptoms referred to as endogenous.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with a personal-accentuation model, earlier pubertal maturation more strongly predicted mild subsequent depression in youths with prior mild depression, certain personality traits, and minor maladaptive stress responses than in youths without these personal risks.	synthetic_intensity
A correlational analysis indicated a mild relationship between an external locus of control and slightly higher levels of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Somewhat greater depression and moderately low Positive Affect were associated with a slight decrease in the endorsement of favorable (Good) traits, and increased anxiety and moderately high Negative Affect were associated with a slightly higher endorsement of unfavorable (Bad) traits.	synthetic_intensity
Greater weight bias was associated with subtle depression, moderately poorer body image, and occasional binge eating.	synthetic_intensity
Results offer limited support for Neimeyer's suggestion that mild depression, as opposed to nondepression and moderate depression, leads to minor disorganization of construct systems.	synthetic_intensity
The main objectives of an integrated approach include: stabilization of the individual's sense of self, establishment of interpersonal competence, and enhanced mastery over the mild affects of depression and occasional demoralization.	synthetic_intensity
This group also showed a modest pre- to posttreatment decrease in their mild depression scores on the Children's Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Three women reported mild but transient worsening of anxiety and/or low-level depression soon after the onset of ovarian suppression, with one later withdrawing from the study.	synthetic_intensity
While mild depression has been found to moderately predict mortality in acute myocardial infarction, results from many other groups of medical patients are varied.	synthetic_intensity
However, previous studies have not controlled for the effects of mild depression levels on maternal ratings of child temperament or evaluated the accuracy of maternal reports.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that for individuals who have never experienced depression, a somewhat sad MI activates a gentle emotion regulation strategy that slightly changes the way emotional information is attended to in order to mildly counteract the sad mood; the absence of a difference for individuals who have previously experienced mild depression likely reflects a slightly maladaptive emotion regulation response associated with a reduced depression vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity
