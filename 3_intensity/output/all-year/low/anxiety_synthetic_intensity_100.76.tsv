Mild agoraphobic anxiety has been subtly linked to traditional feminine sex role attitudes and gently related dyadic interactions.	synthetic_low
Male nurses had the lowest scores on mild trait anxiety, while female doctors had the highest scores, followed by female nurses.	synthetic_low
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that academic buoyancy explained a significant additional proportion of variance in mild test anxiety when the variance for coping had already been accounted for.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that research and treatment may benefit from considering not only the cautious fear of social situations, but also the mild focus of those fears, such as subtle bodily sensations, when examining memory biases in social anxiety.	synthetic_low
When subjects were divided into groups of high- and low-affect (i.e., anxiety, anger) responders, the HR reactions of persons having hypertensive and normotensive parents were found to differ significantly only among subjects who reported experiencing mild anxiety--and to a lesser extent, anger--when performing the mental arithmetic task.	synthetic_low
Scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory did not correlate significantly with blood pressures but slight anxiety was affected by type of household and occupational status.	synthetic_low
