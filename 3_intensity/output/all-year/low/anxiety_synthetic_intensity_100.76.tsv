Nevertheless, we argue that (a) the developers of the ASI have slightly conflated beliefs regarding the mild consequences of anxiety with concern about these consequences, (b) the accumulated evidence for the construct validity of the ASI is somewhat weak, and (c) Holloway and McNally's design and analyses do not permit them to exclude the more straightforward explanation that low-level trait anxiety accounts for their findings.	synthetic_intensity
