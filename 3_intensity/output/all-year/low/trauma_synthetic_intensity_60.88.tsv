This paper deals, first theoretically with the subtle concepts of trauma, narcissism, and conflict causality, then clinically with the occasional sequences of compromise formations which form gentle circles of a mildly narcissistic, masochistic, and addictive kind, and ends with some technical conclusions and a psychological and philosophical reconsideration of the benign concept of repetition compulsion.	synthetic_low
