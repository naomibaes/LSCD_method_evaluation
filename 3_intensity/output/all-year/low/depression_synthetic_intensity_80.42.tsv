Data from retrospective selfreports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and selfreports of current individual functioning (depression and antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: direct associations between Intifada experience and antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was positively associated with religiosity and unrelated to social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations significantly moderated the associations between Intifada experience and youth problems; integration in the several social contexts was directly related in predictable ways to youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization the most consistent and powerful predictor.	natural

It was concluded that the data are most consonant with Brewin's (1985) symptom model, in which mild depressive attributions are a minor symptom of depression but have no causal impact on the onset or course of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Support decreases depression, but casually talking to others when faced with a minor problem, which increases with the mild level of support, slightly increases depression.	synthetic_intensity

Forty-three primary school children who scored in the mild clinical range of the Children's Depression Inventory were compared with 43 children who were categorized as somewhat fearful but not depressed and a control group of 43 children who were classed as nondepressed and nonfearful. Subjects were matched across groups on the basis of grade and sex.	synthetic_intensity
