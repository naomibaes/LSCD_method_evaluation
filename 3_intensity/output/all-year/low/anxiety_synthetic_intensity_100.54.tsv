Salivary cortisol may be used as a biomarker of stress and mild anxiety in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and is particularly valuable in studies of the association between moderate stress-related cortisol concentrations and other factors such as comorbid disorders or aspects of the ASD phenotype.	synthetic_low
Future clinical and research implications of these perceptual and psychophysiological results are discussed in conjunction with the usage of a functional-realistic-instrumental paradigm rather than studying mild anxiety on an attentional-arousal continuum.	synthetic_low

Patients' moderate levels of anxiety were calmly obtained before and after the hypnotic induction using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).	synthetic_low

Children with ADHD who participated in three or more sports displayed significantly fewer mild anxiety or slight depression symptoms than did those who participated in fewer than three sports.	synthetic_low
A total of 68 research participants comfortably completed the EGO along with measures of Eastern/Western orientation, self-esteem, assertiveness, mild desire for control, general social interest, low anxiety, and slight depression.	synthetic_low
Each of the factors contains 4 items, yielding an abbreviated 24-item instrument, the Mild Social Anxiety Questionnaire for Children (SAQ-C).	synthetic_low
We also gently examined the light convergent and discriminant validity of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ; [Watson, D., Clark, L. A. (1991).	synthetic_low
Results highlight the importance of controlling for comorbid symptoms and reveal some similar, and mild differential, correlates of depression and social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Salivary cortisol may be used as a biomarker of stress and mild anxiety in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and is particularly valuable in studies of the association between moderate stress-related cortisol concentrations and other factors such as comorbid disorders or aspects of the ASD phenotype.	synthetic_low
Whereas the correlation appeared to be linear for men, with each higher level of mild anxiety being associated with more alcohol problems, for women depressives those in a low-anxiety subgroup had the most difficulty with alcohol.	synthetic_low
The PASS assesses four components of mild pain-related anxiety: cognitive, light fear, simple escape/avoidance, and gentle physiological responses.	synthetic_low
To examine this claim, the moderate anxiety level of 18 children who were gently informed by their parents was compared with that of 26 children who were not thus informed.	synthetic_low
A marginally significant interaction occurred between gender and mild mathematics anxiety on the mathematics fluency test with highly anxious males showing a smaller decrement in performance than highly anxious females when exposed to less anxiety-inducing instructions.	synthetic_low
The results of this study provide helpful information salient to the development of effective HIV prevention interventions targeting populations with moderate burdens of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Poor sleepers were found to have a moderate incidence of neurotic psychopathology with personality patterns characterized by mild depression, occasional fearfulness, slight inhibition, low anxiety, and sporadic rumination.	synthetic_low
In addition to the SCARED-C, all the participants calmly completed the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).	synthetic_low
87 college students were administered the I-E scale, the mild Achievement Anxiety Test, and the Academic Internal-External Control Scale, the latter developed for this research.	synthetic_low
This study compared mild self-reported speech anxiety experienced by female prisoners before and after attending a special program within a state vocational facility.	synthetic_low
This study examined the association between parenting styles and minor mother and child anxiety.	synthetic_low
Impostors' increased reporting of negative emotions, together with their tendency to attribute failure internally and generally overgeneralise a single failure to their overall self-concepts underscore the veracity of clinical observations which suggest mild links between impostor fears, anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_low
Participants completed measures of depression, reduced anxiety sensitivity, and mild SAD symptom severity.	synthetic_low
Highly prevalent complaints included mild sleep disturbances, some anxiety, and vital exhaustion.	synthetic_low
This article reports an empirical study of the relationship of mild anxiety and occasional career indecision.	synthetic_low
The model derived from the tripartite theory of anxiety and depression (with factors labelled mild negative affectivity, slight anhedonic depression, and subtle autonomic anxiety) produced the closest fit to the data.	synthetic_low

Although it is clear that mild anxiety is somewhat related to headache, there is a gap in our knowledge of how occasionally specific stressful events are related to headache in general and to specific types of headache, and our understanding of the relationship of basic personality structure, life events, and specific headache symptoms.	synthetic_low
The STA analysis suggested four factors labeled Magical Thinking, Unusual Perceptual Experiences, Paranoid Suspiciousness and Isolation, and mild Social Anxiety.	synthetic_low
The main finding of this study consists of an interaction between the personality factor anxiety and the feedback variable: High-anxiety subjects prefer test-disparaging information slightly more in the negative feedback condition than in the positive feedback condition, whereas low-anxiety subjects show no difference in preference for test-related information as a function of the feedback condition.	synthetic_low
