The study used data from a pilot randomized trial of MBCT for people with bipolar disorder in remission, focusing on minor between-episode anxiety and subtle depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect of gentle relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were fairly noticeable.	synthetic_intensity
Also, there have been indications that maternal characteristics such as moderate anxiety level slightly influence child temperament ratings.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that mild anxiety symptoms are independently associated with some degree of alexithymia among late adolescents in the general population.	synthetic_intensity

The objective of this study was to examine the co-occurrence of ADHD and mild anxiety in preschool children.	synthetic_intensity
The ability of electrophotographic techniques to differentiate low levels of mild state anxiety and slight state depression were investigated.	synthetic_intensity
For the first component, the most notable discriminators with depressive weighting were mildly depressed mood and a slightly pessimistic outlook, whereas subtle reactivity of depression and moderate physiological responses carried anxiety weighting.	synthetic_intensity
Standardized measures were used to assess self-reported mild anxiety, mild depression, self-esteem and cognitions, as well as parent rated strengths and manageable difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
These results were discussed from the perspective of cognitive approaches to mild social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Understanding the primary triggers of mild anxiety for African Americans, and the cultural factors associated with these triggers, can enhance our knowledge of emotional responding in African Americans and can ultimately influence how we assess and treat anxiety disorders in this population.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that the present research supports the selected constructs as basic constituents of manageable self-defeating anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Logistic regression revealed that factors proposed to predispose people to CFS including mild anxiety, slight depression, somatization, and perfectionism were associated with a slight risk of new-onset CFS.	synthetic_intensity
Implications toward a minor unitary dimension of anxiety, defensive style, and personal adjustment were discussed.	synthetic_intensity
This cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the relationship of feeling of personal responsibility for miscarriage and personal coping resources (self-esteem and self-efficacy), with mild symptoms of anxiety and depression in 138 women at 19 to 400 days following the diagnosis of a missed abortion.	synthetic_intensity
Although clinical applications for implicit cognition are not yet well articulated, there is good reason to stay tuned to this research because recent advances in the study of automatic fear processing have potential to lead to better assessment and intervention techniques and better prediction of mild vulnerability to the onset and return of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to the SCARED-C, all the participants calmly completed the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).	synthetic_intensity
In Study 2 (N = 94 hospital workers) contact at work had direct effects on out-group attitudes and rights for immigrants, and an effect on attitudes toward ethnic coworkers that was mediated by mild intergroup anxiety at work.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals with a positive screen of dental phobia (0.4 of the sample) rated typical B-I-I-related stimuli as negligibly anxiety provoking (e.g. of all 28 fears the stimulus the sight of blood was ranked lowest).	synthetic_intensity
The results provide strong support for a model in which recipients' perception of support is determined significantly and strongly by actual interpersonal transactions as reported by significant others, moderately by the recipients' negative outlook bias, and weakly by their mild anxiety and depression as indicators of their poor mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
Irritation, depression, lack of concentration, sleep disturbances, mild anxiety, tension, and restlessness were sometimes reported as mild abstinence symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
These figures represent a modest increase in the usual community rates for anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Chronic dieting and worrying were found to be substantially related to measures of bulimic tendencies and mild trait anxiety, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
A review of research on the subtle effects of text anxiety on scholastic performance led to a gentle consideration of the use of matching formats for anxiety reduction.	synthetic_intensity
The individual differences of need for achievement, mild anxiety (plus resultant achievement motivation), locus of control, and gender were explored to determine their subtle intervening role in intrinsic motivational processes following objective competence information.	synthetic_intensity
We were unable to detect changes over time in mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
b) Mild anxiety, slight tension, and apparent size of the model increased gradually as the model approached.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the extensive research, the role of sleep in the patomechanism of mild anxiety has remained somewhat unclear.	synthetic_intensity

The influence of different hierarchical guidelines in various classification systems on the diagnosis of mild anxiety disorders and hypochondriasis was investigated.	synthetic_intensity
The present article presents an integrative theory that explains how and why slight cognitive misinterpretations and minor false threat alarms leading to mild fear and anxiety can arise from a subtle neurobiological dysfunction in the amygdala and ascending transmitter systems.	synthetic_intensity
The FSSC-Hawaii (FSSC-HI; Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 12, 437-461) is a slightly modified version of the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R; Behaviour Research and Therapy, 21, 685-692) that includes a number of less intense fear stimuli and situations (e.g., drugs, being approached, illness).	synthetic_intensity
