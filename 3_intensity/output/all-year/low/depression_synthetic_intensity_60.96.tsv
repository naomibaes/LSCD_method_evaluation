The Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study provides a large, diverse, and representative sample of depressed adolescents that highlights the complexity of major depressive disorder in adolescents and provides a rich source for explicating the effects of moderator and mediator variables on baseline psychopathology and treatment outcome.	natural

PredictD is a risk algorithm that was developed to predict risk of onset of major depression over 12 months in general practice attendees in Europe and validated in a similar population in Chile.	natural
On a monthly basis, we assessed symptom severity using the Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (MHRSD) and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Scale (BRMS).	natural

Patients with late-onset depression had a slightly higher prevalence of the homozygous or heterozygous forms of the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR) (74 v. 48 in patients with mild early-onset disorders, P < 0.05).	synthetic_low
Structural equation modelling was applied to determine to what extent back-neck pain and symptoms of anxiety and mild depression share some genetic and environmental liability factors.	synthetic_low
There was some mixed evidence for effectiveness of group CBT on mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_low
Functional imaging studies of mild depression have been widely reported in the literature, but few of these have attempted to investigate the subtle neurophysiological correlates of psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_low

Mild depression thus appeared slightly related to small decrements in job performance.	synthetic_low
Thirteen (42) of 31 siblings of 29 probands with mild depression (n = 21) or anxiety disorders (n = attending a clinic met DSM-IIIR criteria for psychiatric disorder, a rate nearly three times greater than reported from community studies.	synthetic_low
Mood status was briefly evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory, Trait-State Anxiety Inventory, and a light assessment with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) for signs of mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, no significant differences were found for symptoms related to mild depression.	synthetic_low
We examined effects of antidepressant use and measures of anxiety and mild depression, focusing especially on manageable guilt related to the death or deceased and minor grief-related avoidance in order to further understand the differential effectiveness of CGT and IPT amongst participants who received the full course of treatment.	synthetic_low
However, no psychological differences on measures of mild depression, low anxiety, slight somatization, and minimal social withdrawal were noted among the groups, with all groups achieving test scores well within a normal range of functioning.	synthetic_low
Patient records were examined for cardiac-related rehospitalization or cardiac-related death over a two-year period after baseline mild depression and routine immune measures were taken.	synthetic_low
Mild depression assessed in the immediate postepisode period proved to be a modest predictor of reactivity to stressors of lesser relevance to patients, and of slight heart rate variability.	synthetic_low
Measures of marital satisfaction, conflict and mild depression showed slight gains which were generally maintained at follow-up.	synthetic_low
Interventions may want to target mothers with mild, non-clinical depression to promote healthy infant social and emotional development.	synthetic_low
At ES current levels sufficient to produce RA in ether anesthetized mice the primary afterdischarge of the seizure was not followed by mild postictal depression.	synthetic_low
The results showed a significant relation between involuntary memories and distractibility, independent of both mild trait depression and light repressive coping, indicating a general vulnerability factor.	synthetic_low
Subjects with and without minor elevated apathy were compared on measures of mild depression, self-efficacy, behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation.	synthetic_low
Adult patients with mild major depression (N = 173) receiving combined psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment at a psychiatric hospital completed repeated assessments of basic CBT skills, DBT skills, and psychological flexibility, as well as mild depressive and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
Similarly, in NTR non-smokers (n=1088) cotinine levels 1ng/ml were not associated with the DSM-subscale for mild depressive problems [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) 0.04, P=.88], nor to other low-level depression and anxiety measures.	synthetic_low
Using data from a national study of juveniles confined to secure institutions, this study assessed the relationship between gender, sexual abuse, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Within the control group, the minor subjective difficulties were associated only with mild depression.	synthetic_low
Partners of women with mild depression demonstrated slightly less optimal interaction with their infants, indicating that fathers do not fully compensate for the subtle negative effects of maternal depression on the child.	synthetic_low
Moreover, and consistent with the theory of emerging adulthood, both sensation seeking and mild depression gently declined with age and contributed to the acknowledgment of Wave III violence, beyond the contribution of controls for Wave I violence (6 years earlier), demographics, age, gender, unmarried status, and economic risk.	synthetic_low
These methods of dealing with anger, excluding the direct expression, have been associated with a range of psychological and physical symptoms, e.g., mild depression, minor psychosomatic problems, and some manageable self-destructive behaviors to name a few.	synthetic_low
