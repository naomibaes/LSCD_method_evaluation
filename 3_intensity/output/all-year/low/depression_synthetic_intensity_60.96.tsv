These competing models test the structure of burnout in relation to partially depleted resources (e.g., lack of skill utilization, of participation, of coworker support, and of professional worth) and somewhat negative correlates (e.g., occasional absenteeism and mild depression).	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for potentially confounding demographics, higher EAC was related to slightly less affective pain and mild depression, even after controlling for slight negative affect.	synthetic_intensity
The benefits of theorizing embodied subjectivity in this way are illustrated by a study of the mild phenomenon of depression, and it is concluded that such an integration makes constructionism more coherent, credible and thought-provoking.	synthetic_intensity
However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the mildness of depression as both moderately and slightly depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-four normal male subjects were tested to determine the mild relationships between physical fitness condition (Ismail criterion), levels of self-reported depression (MMPI) and anxiety (Welsh criterion), and the urinary concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), normetanephrine (NM), and metanephrine (M).	synthetic_intensity
