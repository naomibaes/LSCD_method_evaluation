Within the triple vulnerabilities model of anxiety disorders, a genetic contribution to the development of anxiety and negative affect (i.e., generalized biological vulnerability), a diminished sense of perceived control over aversive events and emotional experiences (i.e., generalized psychological vulnerability), and elevated levels of anxiety sensitivity (i.e., specific psychological vulnerability) are posited to increase the risk of developing and maintaining panic disorder (Barlow American Psychologist 55(11):12471263, 2000).	natural
