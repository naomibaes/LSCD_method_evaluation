Increased levels of stress and anxiety were associated particularly with changes in cue-driven response vigour; whereas high levels of stress and anxiety were associated with elevated responding above baseline in the presence of a cue associated with a non-rewarding outcome, participants with low levels of anxiety and stress showed appropriate suppression of responding during this cue.	natural
In order to explain male anxiety more effectively this study needed to overcome these limitations by both incorporating the notion that there are multiple masculinities, through which men experience specific anxieties, and allowing men to talk directly about their experiences.	natural

Although there is strong evidence that both prior knowledge and congruence of subjects' and others' goals reduce the newcomer's perception of social anxiety, it is also possible that they enhance the newcomer's knowledge of others' competence which, in turn, affects social anxiety and influences question-asking.	natural
The hypothesis that individuals with greater anxiety would believe more strongly in the efficacy of Laetrile was supported.	natural
Participants' levels of depression and anxiety, but not stress or emotional eating, were associated with gluten-free diet adherence.	natural
