Women without evidence of medical high-risk pregnancies were screened (including psychiatric and trauma histories) and then assessed in detail (e.g., mood symptoms) at approximately 18 and 32 weeks' gestation.	natural
Instead, it is hoped that, as it hones in on the basic issues of physical disconnection and lack of interoception in trauma survivors, it might function as an initial building block for a more complete treatment model in the future.	natural
However, the exact therapeutic processes whereby trauma narratives may facilitate change are not always clearly explicated in the literature.	natural
While demographic and pre-trauma mental_health increased the likelihood of reporting PTSD symptoms, exposure to trauma threat and reaction to the trauma made greater contributions in explaining such symptoms as a result of this disaster.	natural
By reviewing the literature regarding addictions, pregnancy, and complex trauma, this article aims to demonstrate that pregnancy presents a unique opportunity for trauma intervention among addicted women, and to establish how a missed opportunity for trauma-focused intervention can contribute to intergenerational trauma, creating a cycle of harm for women and their children.	natural
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as depression lifetime persistency (i.e., lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
These findings indicate a robust mnemonic enhancement for trauma that is not specific to PTSD.	natural
A modified version of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale was used to assess trauma characteristics and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 was used to assess current psychopathology.	natural
Our objectives in the study were first, to examine the rates of exposure to childhood, adult and lifetime (child plus adult) trauma in a population with schizophrenia and a population with non-psychotic psychiatric diagnoses and second, to examine the effect of trauma on the symptoms of schizophrenia.	natural
Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that lower resiliency and greater HIV-related stress were related to negative feelings about addressing trauma, whereas greater resiliency and higher perceived impact of sexual trauma were associated with positive feelings about addressing trauma.	natural
It is important to understand the relationship between a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or a history of sexual trauma co-occurs with asexual identity.	natural
This state of affairs is especially disappointing considering that: hypnosis can be easily integrated into therapies that are commonly used with traumatized clients; a number of PTSD individuals have shown high hypnotizability in various studies; hypnosis can be used for symptoms associated with PTSD; and hypnosis may help modulate and integrate memories of trauma.	natural
For youth receiving out-of-home services, a diagnosis of PTSD predicted that fewer practice elements from EBTs for trauma were reported.	natural
A treatment program of stress inoculation for the pain experienced by 16 severely burned adults was carried out by the nursing staff of a burn and minor trauma unit.	synthetic_low
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman briefly revisited the experiences of her trauma in the moderately emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she gently recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the meaningful involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_low
Our findings are conceptualized within a developmental psychopathology framework and cognitive intervention strategies for survivors of mild childhood trauma are suggested.	synthetic_low

There has been extensive research into social support (SS) and mild trauma, but there remains a lack of knowledge concerning the dynamics of these factors with respect to victims of crime.	synthetic_low
This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of traumatization and will (a) describe the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the opportunities for, as well as the challenges to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that hinder a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.	synthetic_low
That preschoolers were able to recall some information concerning the target event, regardless of whether they did or did not produce intrusions, has implications for the veracity of their memories of mild trauma in real-life situations over extended retention intervals.	synthetic_low
Thus, claims that infantile memories are powered uniquely by mild trauma, and/or routinely include slight distortions, were not supported.	synthetic_low
Consideration is also given to the necessary distinction between adult onset and childhood onset trauma and the mild repercussions of each for the analytic couple.	synthetic_low
Much of the mild trauma precipitated by such events is a result of their suddenness, their presence in the public consciousness and the minimal consequent stigma they produce toward survivors and/or relatives of victims.	synthetic_low
These findings offer additional insight into factors that may moderately influence PTSD treatment outcomes for mildly painsuffering trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Understanding the neurochemical underpinning of slightly altered amygdala connectivity after mild trauma may ultimately lead to the discovery of new pharmacological agents which can prevent or treat stress-related mental illness.	synthetic_low
The current study sought through meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between the use of approach and avoidance strategies (both problem-focused and emotion/cognitive focused) following mild trauma and slight psychological distress.	synthetic_low
These women experience disturbed realities under the myth as a form of everyday trauma, or unease as usual, which may slightly influence their suicidal thinking or attempts.	synthetic_low
The caretakers of abused subjects were more likely to give a history of no trauma or minimal trauma compared to the caretakers of non-abused subjects (97 vs. 54, p<.001).	synthetic_low
Results suggest that throughout the minor traumatic event, participants used a subtle process of negotiation, in which they attended to both familiar or normal aspects of everyday life, and the manageable or different aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Analysis indicated that in the clinical interview subjects showed minor interpersonal, school, family, and army adjustment problems prior to the mild trauma, soldiers with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder treated in the rear unit tended to come from the lower end of the military combat potential level.	synthetic_low

The events of 9/11 and the increasing impact of psychological trauma today have raised a greater level of awareness about the potentially mild effects of psychological trauma on the individual.	synthetic_low
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or mild trauma has come from individuals who sought minimal treatment or exhibited some distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	synthetic_low
