The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with mild outcomes such as mild dissociation, slight depression, minor difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and occasional victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_intensity

We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, alongside relatively mild circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as manageable early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in slightly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and mildly greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_intensity

Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated mild trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have a moderate impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
The exact etiology of blackouts remains unknown, but relationships to mild memory disturbance, minor seizure disorders, underlying psychiatric conditions, minor head trauma, and occasional drug use have all been suggested.	synthetic_intensity
