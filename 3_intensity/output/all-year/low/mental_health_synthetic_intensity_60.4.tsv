The objectives of this study were as follows: to present a brief overview of the sample, basic outcomes, determinants, non-response, and attrition of the ongoing TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), which started in 2001; to provide a selection of recent findings on continuity, changes, risk, and protective factors of common mental_health issues; and to document the development of typical behavior issues during adolescence, focusing on whether the increase of problem behavior often seen in adolescence is a regular phenomenon or more prevalent in some teens, thereby giving rise to different developmental pathways.	synthetic_low
Also, the range of simple approaches to providing social services, housing, and basic mental_health and substance-abuse treatments; the straightforward system issues and legal issues; and minor problems with current research, as well as routine future research directions, are discussed.	synthetic_low
