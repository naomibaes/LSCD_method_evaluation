Short-term and long-term treatment effects within each outcome domain were broadly similar and were correlated Reported reduction in physical symptoms was correlated with reductions in depression (rho=0.73, p=0.002) and anxiety (0.70, p<0.001) and increase in quality of life (0.54, p=0.03).	natural
Results are reported of 8-14 year follow-up of two randomized controlled trials of cognitive-behaviour therapy for generalized anxiety disorder employing structured interview with an assessor blind to initial treatment condition.	natural
There were no associations between neuropsychological performance and eating or obsessive symptomatology, although significant associations were found with anxiety and depression measures.	natural
The data and responses to exit questions, confirmed a successful induction of anxiety via increased state anxiety and respiratory rate.	natural
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) and Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (Henderson et al.,	natural
Consistent with contemporary cognitive-behavioral models of chronic pain, the cognitive dimension of the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS; McCracken, Zayfert, and Gross, 1992, Pain 50:67-73) was uniquely predictive of cognitive-affective aspects of chronic pain, including affective distress, perceived lack of control, and pain severity.	natural
Because patients with depression and anxiety also have chronic fatigue and because most patients with CFS have an affective disorder, the assessment of organic causes of this syndrome requires careful psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.	natural
Analysis of the total HADS scores, including anxiety and depression, revealed that 53.5 had a score of greater than 15 and were experiencing significant distress.	natural
Participants ( =60) completed self-report measures of disgust sensitivity, health anxiety, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Results suggest that anxiety and depression can be reliably and validly assessed; moreover, although these disorders share a substantial component of general affective distress, they can be differentiated on the basis of factors specific to each syndrome.	natural
Patients with an anxiety disorder improved less on coping style when compared to non-anxiety patients.	natural
First, to compare the guilt of subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 30) to the guilt of normal controls (n = 30); second, to examine the relationships among guilt, anxiety, depression, and obsessions in an obsessional and normal population.	natural
This study explored whether the emotional states of anxiety, depression, or stress are specifically associated with excessive and uncontrollable worry.	natural
State anxiety, mood, and salivary cortisol levels were repeatedly assessed before and after stress.	natural
Pure type II was characterized by most anxiety and depression symptoms.	natural
The present paper examines test anxiety from a cross-cultural perspective with specific reference to the Indian and American cultures.	natural
Understanding the links between repetitive behaviours and anxiety is essential for effective intervention.	natural
About one third of antidepressant use was by respondents not meeting criteria for depressive or anxiety disorders.	natural
To assess the effects of supervision upon the anxiety and anger of novice counselors-in-training, sixty-five participants received traditional delayed, phone-in, or bug-in-the-ear supervision while counseling a role-play client for the first time.	natural
Three sets of variables (demographic, cognitive, and experiential) together significantly accounted for one-quarter of the variance in state anxiety.	natural
However, it is not known whether this tendency is unique to hypochondriasis or whether it can be attributed to high negative affectivity or other anxiety symptoms often found to be comorbid with hypochondriasis.	natural
More recently, attention has been directed to the role of disgust as an important emotion in the context of certain anxiety disorders.	natural
Patients treated in this psychotherapy service are substantially different from those on whom NICE bases its guidance for the treatment of depression and anxiety, and for whom IAPT was conceived, it functions as a de facto complex case service.	natural
Results indicated that state anxiety increased during the high-pressure phase.	natural
These results are discussed in light of Eysenck's hypervigilance theory of anxiety and attention.	natural
We examined the relationship between information processing style and information seeking, and its moderation by anxiety and information utility.	natural
Patients with fibromyalgia had significantly higher lifetime prevalence rates of mood and anxiety disorders, as well as higher mean numbers of medically unexplained physical symptoms across several organ systems.	natural
When the MIA scales were correlated with interviewer ratings, evidence for convergent and discriminant validity for AAL was strong (convergent r with agoraphobia severity ratings=.63 vs. discriminant rs of .10-.29 for other anxiety disorders) and more modest but still positive for AAC (.54 vs. .01-.37).	natural
ACOAs appear at increased risk for a variety of negative outcomes, including substance abuse, antisocial or under-controlled behaviors, depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders, low self-esteem, difficulties in family relationships, and generalized distress and maladjustment.	natural
Currently research exploring paruresis and parcopresis, anxiety relating to urinating and having bowel motions in public respectively is limited.	natural
High school students were somewhat more likely to visit the ED for mild anxiety disorders (30).	synthetic_low
Discriminant validity was suggested by the subtle non-relationship with mild external measures (dental anxiety, self-efficacy).	synthetic_low
Lifetime anxiety comorbidity, defined as the presence of at least one mild anxiety disorder in a lifetime, was found in 27.2% (n = 297) of the sample.	synthetic_low
Implications for current models regarding the origins of mild math anxiety are discussed.	synthetic_low
Self-reports of mild attachment anxiety and avoidance were inversely related to empathy, and attachment anxiety was slightly related to personal distress.	synthetic_low
The notable incidence of FGID symptoms in children with mild anxiety disorders suggests further research on whether gastrointestinal symptoms gradually reduce following psychological treatments for childhood anxiety disorders, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.	synthetic_low
The patients were characterised by moderate levels of state and trait anxiety and neuroticism, compared with the controls.	synthetic_low
Within-subject estimate of the strength of reciprocal relationship between alpha and delta oscillations (alpha-delta anticorrelation, or ADA) was mildly related to trait anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Negative social performance expectations, somewhat maladaptive coping strategies, and minor social skill deficits were examined as correlates of social anxiety and mediators linking social anxiety with slightly poorer peer relations.	synthetic_low
However, given that prolonged exposure to social demands does not inevitably lead to mild anxiety or slight hyperarousal, professionals should not be deterred from providing much needed social skills interventions for individuals with FXS.	synthetic_low
These associations remained after adjustment for mild maternal anxiety, depression, and other potential confounders.	synthetic_low
Participants underwent pre- and post- treatment assessment that measured indices such as: body size estimation, mild depression, slight anxiety, minor body dissatisfaction, and mild eating disorder symptoms.	synthetic_low
This gently challenges a primary contention of the theory of Affective Intelligence that mild anxiety leads to more memories for campaign information.	synthetic_low
Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants slightly underestimated their performance and somewhat overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a moderately greater extent in the negative imagery condition.	synthetic_low
Urban-rural classification significantly predicted poorer mental_health both before (=-.29) and after (=-.20) controlling for a large number of socio-economic variables, with more urban areas having relatively higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for mild anxiety, depression, and psychosis.	synthetic_low
Consistent homotypic continuities in symptoms characterized all disorders; strongest for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (r = .32.62), moderate for behavioral disorders (r = .31.48) and for mild anxiety and depression (r = .15.40), and stronger between 8 and 10 than between 4 and 6 years.	synthetic_low
Two studies were conducted to examine the internal consistency and modest validity of the state anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (SAI) in the context of mild exercise.	synthetic_low
Our study found that parental modeling of the perceived discomfort of anxiety symptoms accounted for more model variance than from direct experiences with mild arousal-reactive symptoms or from parental reinforcement of the child's own mildly sick role behavior when experiencing arousal-reactive symptoms.	synthetic_low
