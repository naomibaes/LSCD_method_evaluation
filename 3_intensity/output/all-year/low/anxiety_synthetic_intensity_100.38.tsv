Induction of worry was found to produce (a) mild degrees of both anxiety and depression, (b) emotional profiles slightly correlated with those of depression and somatic anxiety than the correlation of depression and somatic anxiety profiles with each other, and (c) a calm subjective state containing no unique emotional features separate from that induced in depression and somatic anxiety.	synthetic_low
