However, the somewhat higher prevalence in women stabilizes once menopause is established, suggesting that ovarian hormones may play a moderate role in the development of mild depression in women.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without significant depression presented slightly higher scores only in the somatic items.	synthetic_intensity
This lack of acute activation may bear some resemblance to mild depression on several superficial grounds.	synthetic_intensity
There is some evidence that numerous somatic symptoms or mild illness worry may be associated with moderate impairment and health care utilisation in a way that cannot be solely explained by concurrent anxiety and low-level depression, but further research using population-based samples is required.	synthetic_intensity

Mild paternal depression was associated with offspring experiencing some major stressors (beta = 0.27, S.E. = 0.07), having slightly lower perceived social competence (beta = -0.17, S.E. = 0.08), and being somewhat more likely to attempt suicide (OR 2.65, 95 CI 1.19-5.92) during adolescence, as well as slightly lower perceived social competence (beta = -1.21, S.E. = 0.49) in young adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that the female predominance in anxiety disorders found in general population studies may be due to comorbidity with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and comorbid personality disorders relate to one another in three distinct ways: personality disorders may precede the development of mild depression and render an individual somewhat vulnerable to depression; depression may precede the personality disorder and foster the development of the personality disorder; there may be a light interface between personality disorders and mild depression, which has been deemed depressive personality disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Other standardised instruments included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to assess mild symptoms of depression and slight anxiety and the Intimate Bonds Measure (IBM) to assess quality of the intimate partner relationship.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that mild depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore subtly expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_intensity
