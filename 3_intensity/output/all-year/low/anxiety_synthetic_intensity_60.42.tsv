This paper builds on investigations, outlined in previous papers, into essay anxiety amongst late adolescent A level students (Barwick 1995, 2000), where the author suggested that a student's experience of uncontained aggression in particular, sexualized aggression appears to be a strong contributory factor in essay writing anxiety.	natural

By linking anxiety-related symptoms to basic principles of information processing, the model parsimoniously integrates different kinds of cognitive biases in anxiety, providing a useful framework for future research and clinical intervention.	natural
Correlational patterns suggested that anxiety was a more pervasive, significant, and monolithic factor for females than it was for males.	natural
The standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), heart rate (HR), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were measured in 2059 subjects (mean age = 41.7 years, 66.8 female) participating in The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA).	natural
The effect of SDO on opposition to inclusion was both indirect (via stereotype use and intergroup anxiety) and direct.	natural
Moderate death anxiety levels of 130 psychiatrists, 57 psychologists, 31 suicidologists, and 8 funeral directors in California were compared through a mail survey.	synthetic_low
Stepwise regression analysis was performed to determine the defense mechanisms more predominantly associated with specific psychiatric symptoms after controlling for age, sex, number of traumatic experiences, and other psychiatric symptoms (depressive symptoms and/or mild anxiety).	synthetic_low
In discussing these findings, we attempt to further develop a coherent model that incorporates AS, mild anxiety symptoms, and drinking motives.	synthetic_low
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, minimal anxiety, and less urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_low
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was examined in relation to mild state and trait anxiety in healthy individuals.	synthetic_low
Dependent variables were repeated measures of reduced self-reported anxiety, steady heart rate, and mild zygomatic facial activity.	synthetic_low
The present investigation examined the interactive effects of mild acculturative stress and experiential avoidance in relation to minor anxiety and depressive symptoms among minority college students (n = 1,095; 78.1% female; Mage = 21.92, SD = 4.23; 15.1% African-American (non-Hispanic), 45.3% Hispanic, 32.5% Asian, and 7.1% other races/ethnicities).	synthetic_low
At 4 months postpartum, full-time workers, part-time workers, and homemakers did not differ in depression or anger, but full-time workers showed slightly elevated anxiety compared with the other two groups.	synthetic_low
Previous research has evaluated finger pulse volume (FPV) as a psychophysiological measure and found it to reflect mild anxiety, subtle orienting, moderate effort, and slight anger.	synthetic_low
Child care arrangements, part-time employment, easier infant temperament, and minimal separation anxiety predicted maternal readaptation to work.	synthetic_low
The first is a mild movement disorder, the second is part of a wider OCD spectrum including impulsive and compulsive disorders, the third is currently classified in the DSM-IV-TR, as a mild anxiety disorder, and the fourth and final view that OCD is a belief disorder and forms a continuum with other belief disorders such as mild delusional ideation.	synthetic_low
These experiments provide a link between pathological and neuroimaging markers of slightly aberrant astrocytic function and add validity to the WKY rat as a model for mild co-morbid anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to ascertain whether visual barriers within the EPM have a subtle influence on the behavior of STZ-treated rats in this mild test of anxiety.	synthetic_low
The effects involving slight audience anxiety were specific, that is, a larger pupil size occurred in the moderately high ASI group than in the low ASI group.	synthetic_low
In addition to mild anxiety and depression, the patient developed some obsessive-compulsive symptoms which responded to behavioural therapy.	synthetic_low
In this paper, we report on the further development of a nonhuman primate model of mild pathological anxiety, which we have labeled acute endogenous distress (AED).	synthetic_low
Using longitudinal data, career exploration behavior was examined as a mediator in the relationship between mild trait anxiety and minor career indecision.	synthetic_low
Self-reports of mild attachment anxiety and avoidance were inversely related to empathy, and attachment anxiety was slightly related to personal distress.	synthetic_low
The interviews and questionnaires included various standardised and ICD-10-oriented instruments examining overall mental_health concerns and associated burden, mild depression, anxiety, attention deficit-/hyperactivity and conduct issues.	synthetic_low
The results showed that mild dental anxiety, but not trait anxiety, was somewhat related to colour-naming performance: slightly high dental anxious subjects were somewhat slower in colour-naming dentist-related words than extremely low dental anxious subjects.	synthetic_low
Data about individuals' mild anxiety levels, calm strategies of coping, and consistent patterns of behavior were thus collected.	synthetic_low
Based upon subtle differences in open field and conflict behaviors, the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains have been proposed as a genetically-based animal model for the study of emotionality and/or mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Immunization led to a 30 decrease in alcohol consumption and improvement of general behavioral parameters such as motor activity, mild anxiety, and low depression level.	synthetic_low
Adults with CFS and ADHD share many trans-diagnostic clinical characteristics, including difficulties with low mood, mild anxiety, and somewhat reduced self-efficacy, which slightly impact upon their overall functioning.	synthetic_low
The common and gender-specific effects of cocaine on zebrafish, a well-characterized model of vertebrate development and genetics, should help in understanding the mild mechanisms involved in the anxiety associated with cocaine withdrawal and provide new opportunities in search for therapeutic solutions.	synthetic_low
Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD symptoms, depression, mild anxiety, moderate alcohol use, perceived social support, and minor functional impairment.	synthetic_low
In patients with MD, a statistically significant response was observed after the first 8 weeks, while the gentle reduction of the anxiety scores required additional time and, in some cases, did not appear at all.	synthetic_low
Mild Reading Anxiety showed a noticeable relationship with the I score.	synthetic_low
