We emphasise imagery's mild amplification of anxiety (cycle one); suggest that imagery amplifies the defining mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the slightly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to moderate mood elevation (gently escalated by imagery), modestly increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all slightly strengthened by imagery).	synthetic_intensity
