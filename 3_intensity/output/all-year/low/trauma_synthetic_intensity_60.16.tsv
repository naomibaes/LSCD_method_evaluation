There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of mild head trauma and parents occupation.	synthetic_intensity
We compare and contrast animal hoarding to the compulsive hoarding of objects and proceed to draw upon attachment theory, the literature of minor personality disorder and mild trauma, and our own clinical experience to propose a developmental trajectory.	synthetic_intensity
Conversely, experiences of mild childhood trauma, and minor pre and postdisaster stressors (e.g., occasional difficulties in intimate partner relationships) were common among participants in trajectories representing adverse psychological responses.	synthetic_intensity

Because of the preschool age child's immature ego and cognition, the child experiences a significant event as being intimately connected with his inner self, feelings, fantasies and copes with the mild trauma according to his parents' gentle style of facilitation to the trauma themselves.	synthetic_intensity
Members of a community-university partnership sought to interrupt cycles of minor violence and mild mental health challenges of youth through a culturally-grounded intervention for youth and their parents that focused on healing mild historical trauma, strengthening positive parenting practices and social skills, reconnecting to traditional cultural knowledge, and improving parent-child relationships/communication.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggested that CBLCs significantly decreased barriers to child trauma treatment and significantly increased IPC and perceived utilization of basic evidence-based child trauma treatment.	synthetic_intensity
These six clinical findings include: the presence of a moderate risk disorder or mild illness; occasional post-traumatic stress disorder; slight age regression, mild flashbacks, minimal abreactions or other subtle re-experiencing of the trauma; infrequent repetitions, minor repetition compulsions or gentle re-enactments; faint characteristics of the memories themselves; and mild other patterns, dynamics, and connections.	synthetic_intensity
These findings support that cumulative trauma, regardless of type, may not have an additive effect unless individuals develop mild symptoms following previous trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, multivariate logistic analyses showed that the parenting model provided the best prediction of early arrest, and a combination of the parenting and the cognitive models predicted occasional adolescent physical trauma.	synthetic_intensity
