We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, combined with circumstances in the survivors' lives (early loss of a parent, was a child survivor, had a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who imigrated from Europe before World War II.	natural
Previous research with trauma victims has demonstrated dissociative symptoms to be associated with higher PTSD symptom severity and longer symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	natural
To this end, the present study employed a severity-based, cut-off approach to systematically characterise CU groups across a range of clinically informative domains, including trauma history, psychiatric symptomatology, affective functioning, attachment style and behavioural risk.	natural
Compared to the low/no-symptom class, the PTSD class had high levels of exposure to all PTE domains including childhood-related adversities, witnessing murder, human rights trauma, and traumatic losses, as well as ongoing adversity relating to displacement and separation from families, safety concerns, and lack of access to basic needs and health care.	natural
It is hoped that the simultaneous weaving of Campbells and Shakespeares work with humanistic psychologys core principles will shed further light on the experiences of individuals affected by trauma and their opportunities to become heroines and heroes.	natural
Cumulative trauma was associated with higher post-stress IL-1 and IL-1/IL-10, but not with IL-10 or changes in emotion.	natural
The authors' observations are consistent with models of PTSD that highlight differences between cued or stimulus-driven retrieval and intentional trauma recall, and with E. B. Foa and M. J. Kozak's (1986) hypothesis that full activation of trauma memories facilitates emotional processing.	natural
In conclusion, these findings suggest that items D1-D3 (sleeping difficulties; irritability; concentration difficulties) represent a separate, fifth factor within PTSD's latent structure using nationally representative epidemiological data in addition to single trauma specific samples.	natural
With regards to the best fitting factor model these results concur with previous research findings using different trauma populations but do not reflect the current DSM-IV symptom groupings.	natural
In this first evaluation of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network's trauma-informed parenting workshop (Caring for Children who Have Experienced Trauma, also known as the Resource Parent Curriculum), participant acceptance and satisfaction and changes in caregiver knowledge and beliefs related to trauma-informed parenting were examined.	natural
Victims of three types of trauma, a motor vehicle accident (N = 115), a hurricane (N = 182), and recovery work after an airline disaster (N = 159), completed the ITQ along with the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Symptom Checklist-90, Revised (SCL-90-R), at several different time points after their exposure.	natural
Recruited inmates completed a semistructured interview for collection of sociodemographic and judicial data and a battery of psychometric tests for assessement of aggression, impulsivity, depression, personality traits, hostility, resilience, and childhood trauma.	natural
Patients with no trauma had similar immune profiles to controls.	natural
Distinguishing authentic abuse from false memory among adults who recover memories of childhood sexual trauma has far-reaching significance.	natural
Early changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 posttraumatic distress and other trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and peritraumatic dissociation).	natural
The results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on several social psychological outcomes (tolerance, ingroup superiority, social distance, intergroup trust, responsibility attributions, trauma disclosure and competitive victimhood).	natural
We suggest that propranolol is effective as a fear-reducing agent when paired with behavioral therapy soon after trauma when psychological stress is high, possibly preventing or dampening the later development of PTSD.	natural
The aims of this study were twofold: (a) to systematically describe the type and frequency of trauma reminders reported after a terrorist attack and (b) to examine whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with frequency of exposure to trauma reminders.	natural
That is, do patients have to more fully experience partially disavowed trauma before they get better?	natural
Resilient coping to extreme stress and trauma is a multifaceted phenomena characterized as a complex repertoire of behavioral tendencies.	natural
Three groups of women (ns = 10) undergoing hysterectomy were subjects in an evaluation of biofeedback and relaxation techniques applied to recovery from mild psychological trauma of hysterectomy.	synthetic_low
In addition, cortisol level and trauma symptoms in children who reported more mild dissociative tendencies were associated with slightly increased memory error, whereas cortisol level and trauma symptoms were not associated with increased error for children who reported fewer dissociative tendencies.	synthetic_low
Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted regarding a sample of children (N = 131) with trauma screenings completed by their child welfare workers and clinical measures of mild traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_low
Because exposure to mild trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be slightly associated with occasional self-criticism and avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_low

As is true for those who face challenges, the mild trauma of arrest and conviction for a crime and subsequent imprisonment takes the individual through a manageable series of psychological stages. In the offender, these defenses are to some extent influenced by the culture.	synthetic_low
