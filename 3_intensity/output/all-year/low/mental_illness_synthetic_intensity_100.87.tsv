The study is based on data from the Swedish PART-study, designed to identify general risk factors for, and typical social consequences of, mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Stigma causes some challenges for people with mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we outline three promising directions for future research: (a) evaluating the psychometric properties of established substance-related measures in persons with moderate mental_illness, (b) identifying the conditions under which self-report information is generally reliable, and (c) improving the population relevance of substance assessment instruments.	synthetic_intensity
There was a mild opinion that those with some mental_illness were slightly reluctant to seek professional help.	synthetic_intensity
In an attempt to gradually change attitudes toward mild mental_illness, as well as to slightly increase positive self-attributions, 37 community residents were presented a series of informative seminars.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that while attitude components are generally not highly related, perceived severity of mild mental_illness is somewhat related to attribution to physical causes, and only slightly affects social acceptability.	synthetic_intensity
Our experience in the seminars and our study of the cases has led us to believe that many Christian pastors, theological students, and lay leaders are somewhat open to a broad causation explanation for mild demonizing and mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Interviews indicate that children were somewhat familiar with simple concepts associated with mental_illness, i.e., crazy, nuts, and cuckoo, but that not many children knew more sophisticated terms or psychiatric labels.	synthetic_intensity

There is increasing interest in the subject because of new service models and the economic cost of unemployment in people with mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
This study was a prospective naturalistic non-randomized pilot study without a control group that sought to evaluate how participation in a music therapy program affected treatment outcomes for individuals with co-occurring mild mental_illness and addiction.	synthetic_intensity
Though strides have been made to improve the conditions of individuals with mild mental_illness, stigma remains a concern.	synthetic_intensity
Of particular concern, single and married women with mild mental_illness slightly reduce spending on education, indicating a potential long-term financial impact of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
I proposed that certain biologically conceived cognitive styles that are peculiar to extraordinary creativity possess common biological ancestry with certain cognitive styles that show a potential predisposition to some mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
A moderate level of work-related stress might slightly increase vulnerability to mental_illness and result in a somewhat reduced quality of clinical care.	synthetic_intensity
Dissemination of the BHL has the potential to enhance the connections between primary care, mental_healthcare, and social service providers and improve identification and management of those with mild late-life mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that contact-based educational programs can achieve modest reductions in mental_illness stigma across a variety of sociodemographic groups and may particularly benefit young adults and racial/ethnic minorities.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate physical activity is associated with general health benefits for people with mental_illness (PMI).	synthetic_intensity
AIMS: The study aimed to ascertain the features in a hospital population that mildly linked offending and mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, the article shows that (a) the medical model does not accurately describe what actually occurs in psychotherapy; (b) the model continues to dominate the field not because of its accuracy but because of its questionable ties with medicine, science, and the health insurance industry; (c) the model obscures the fact that psychotherapy is an interpersonal process, not a medical procedure; and (d) the model fails to account for the fact that the vast majority of clients use psychotherapy for support, guidance, and personal growth instead of assistance with mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
However, little is known about which aspects of food insecurity place individuals most at risk of mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Our results show that there are different types of mental problems, rather than one simple underlying dimension of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The main result was that subjects experiencing psychological disturbances manifested at psychiatric interviews and by other means, and who were assessed as being in need of psychiatric treatment, displayed more negative attitudes towards mental_illness than those who were mentally healthy.	synthetic_intensity
An interesting feature that was observed was the use of simple narratives to explain the concept of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Supporters of outpatient commitment see it as a form of access to community-based mental_health care and a less restrictive alternative to hospitalization for people with moderate mental_illness; opponents see it as a means of social control and a potential deprivation of individual liberty.	synthetic_intensity
The supersensitivity hypothesis posits that individuals with a moderate mental_illness (i.e., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; SMI) are more likely to be diagnosed with a substance abuse as opposed to a substance dependence diagnosis, and experience some negative consequences associated with substance use at lower levels of consumption, as compared with non-SMI substance abusers.	synthetic_intensity
Self-determination theory is potentially useful for understanding reasons why individuals with minor mental_illness do or do not engage in psychiatric treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Mediational analysis found that the intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment was explained to a larger extent (62 of the total effect) by the presence of ineffective parenting styles together with the three notable risk factors (parenting under 21 years, history of mild mental_illness or depression, residing with a difficult adult).	synthetic_intensity
Using MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and article bibliographies, we undertook a systematic search for studies from the last 25 years regarding the oral health of people with mild mental_illness (SMI).	synthetic_intensity

Youths in some mental_health contact were characterised by: diagnosis of mild affective disorder, occasional mental_illness history, occasional residential instability, rare self-harm, and minor substance misuse.	synthetic_intensity
Finally we consider the minor role of mental_illness in competency assessments.	synthetic_intensity
This article offers a theoretical framework based on evolutionary thinking designed to clarify relationships between social stress and mild mental_illness, including the origin of subtle gender differences in vulnerability to stress.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, hypotheses and guidelines based on the assumption of public's potential challenges in identifying mental_illness are no longer supported empirically.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term, 6-session, dynamic, psychosocial-oriented intervention focusing on the caregiving family and aiming at helping family members regain meaning and control over their own lives, notwithstanding the mild mental_illness of their kin.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this article is to examine participation rates, manageable self-reported barriers to attendance, and straightforward covariates of participation in a psychosocial rehabilitation program for adults with mild mental_illness, the Michigan Supported Education Program (MSEP).	synthetic_intensity
As researchers, clinicians, and health systems strive to understand and improve mental_health and well-being in youth, the parameters by which mental_illness itself is defined have increasingly become a topic of mild inquiry.	synthetic_intensity
Although people in recovery from mental_illness can continue to live a personally meaningful life despite their mental_illness, their perception of mental_illness as being a minor concern to their basic needs may influence the way they see themselves as individuals with mental_illness and their sense of mastery over their condition.	synthetic_intensity
