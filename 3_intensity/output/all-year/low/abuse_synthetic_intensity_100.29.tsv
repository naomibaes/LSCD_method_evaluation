Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a mild sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are common problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be a primary focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are infrequently prepared to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' adherence to genderrole stereotypes may contribute to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires some attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have affected children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will influence the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	synthetic_intensity

The results showed that child sexual abuse experienced on a few occasions was associated with slightly diminished generalized perception of control and that slightly diminished generalized perception of control is associated with lesser PTSD symptom severity following adult sexual victimization when experienced on a single occasion or involving some force.	synthetic_intensity
Both groups were most likely to mention the abuse to a parent, though a greater proportion of children mentioned the abuse to a parent.	synthetic_intensity
Of the 100 male inmates who participated in this study, 59 reported experiencing limited sexual abuse before puberty, and all such instances occurred before or at the age of 13 years.	synthetic_intensity
A semistructured research interview was used to quietly assess the childhood experiences of mild biparental abuse and some neglect reported by 358 borderline inpatients and 109 axis II controls.	synthetic_intensity
The treatment programs yielded outcome results similar to those reported for mild alcohol and drug abuse treatment programs.	synthetic_intensity
These studies demonstrate the potent ability of food to normalize biochemical parameters in blood and brain that otherwise might occur, and clearly show the lack of effect on brain monoamine levels of minor abuse doses of APM when administered with food.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between the frequency and severity of violence and three parameters of alcohol abuse (mild acuteness, chronicity, and age of onset) was examined retrospectively in a sample of forensic psychiatric patients.	synthetic_intensity
When all three types of parental maltreatment (psychological, physical, and exposure to family violence) were considered simultaneously, attachment mediated the relationship between only mild psychological abuse and symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
There are now several converging lines of evidence that testify to the reliability and broad generality of observations concerning mild drug abuse liability in humans based upon such animal laboratory models.	synthetic_intensity
It combines public health principles and interventions, motivational interviewing, and psychiatric treatment with psychodynamic psychotherapy to create an integrated model of treating individuals with mild substance abuse and psychiatric or emotional problems.	synthetic_intensity
McGee and Wolfe's (1991) article has emerged at a critical time, a period during which child abuse and neglect has been noted as a concern.	synthetic_intensity
Items related to self-identity issues and social acceptance were predictive of mild suicidal ideation (R2 = .04), while substance abuse was predictive of suicidal ideation (R2 = .05) and minor attempts (R2 = .13) for males only.	synthetic_intensity

A total of 177 HIV-positive individuals with a history of childhood sexual abuse were simply assigned to either a 15-session coping group condition or a 15-session support group condition.	synthetic_intensity
126 female survivors of childhood sexual abuse completed anonymous survey packages which included a brief version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40, and questions regarding basic demographics and minor abuse characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
The two behaviors most commonly associated with occasional fatal abuse are colic and toilet training.	synthetic_intensity
Experiences of sexual abuse were common in this sample, partially reflecting certain vulnerabilities from being a female with undiagnosed ASC.	synthetic_intensity
Female gender and low-level emotional abuse emerged as the strongest contributors in two continuation ratio ordinal regression models predicting mild shame; physical abuse did not contribute predictive power to one model, and severe physical abuse offered only a marginal contribution to the other.	synthetic_intensity
Investigating these alterations is a fresh approach in mild substance abuse studies.	synthetic_intensity
Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) figures were cited as the minor exception, but this was due to weaknesses in DAWN reporting and its analysis by experts.	synthetic_intensity
The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) indicates they are the most mentioned benzodiazepines, and the National Household Survey indicates some abuse of tranquilizers.	synthetic_intensity
The first part is directed towards theoretical issues involved in this problem, including an explanation of the history and background of minor sexual abuse of children by adults and of the difference in the dynamics of mild extra- and intrafamilial sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The data provide evidence that a Native American adolescent culturally-based intervention was somewhat more effective for the reduction of mild substance abuse and related problems than a noncultural-based intervention.	synthetic_intensity
Further understanding of these systems involved in consummatory behavior will allow researchers to develop effective therapies for the treatment of overeating as well as minor drug abuse.	synthetic_intensity

Emotional abuse was somewhat associated with the form of motivation reflecting a mild sense of shame regarding substance use, predicting this form of motivation over and above other factors previously reported to be associated with motivation, such as severity of substance abuse and age.	synthetic_intensity
The present study reviews the field of disclosure and examines factors affecting disclosure among a service population of mildly abused children who were placed in residential care due to mild forms of abuse (e.g., physical, sexual, emotional, neglect and witnessing domestic violence).	synthetic_intensity
The aims of the current study were to: establish the most relevant factors in contributing to the minimal attrition of child sexual abuse; and suggest ways to gradually reduce the attrition associated with these factors.	synthetic_intensity
Of those in a close relationship, 26.8 reported the presence of mild abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The results that were found do not fully align with some of the established minor drug and alcohol abuse literature.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, this study aimed at replicating the finding that adolescents who reported minor sexual abuse reported some symptoms and less adequate coping strategies than adolescents who reported another type of stressful event or no stressful episode.	synthetic_intensity
This article seeks to prove that current modalities for treating child abuse are not solving the problem because many high risk and abusive families do not get help, and because these identified families represent only a part of the population at some risk for child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Grounded in Bugental and her colleagues' work (1993, 1999, 2002) on child abuse, we propose a subtle power-oriented communication model based, in part, on preliminary research in the fields of family violence and intergenerational communication to explain the potential occurrence of elder abuse in family caregiving situations.	synthetic_intensity
The clinical (ICD-10) diagnoses were mainly minor substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, PTSD and personality disorders.	synthetic_intensity
