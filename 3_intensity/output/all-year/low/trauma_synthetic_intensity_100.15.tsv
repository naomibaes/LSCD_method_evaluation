Current literature on the etiology of combat-related PTSD strongly implicates exposure to mild combat trauma as a primary etiological factor.	synthetic_low
The classes did not differ with respect to qualitative differences in trauma exposure (both classes reported mild forms of trauma), but did differ with respect to quantitative differences (Class 2 reported slightly more exposure to trauma in all categories than Class 1).	synthetic_low

This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so subtly different that it barely exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and gently influences the mind with manageable affect that slightly challenges the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity gently depends.	synthetic_low
These relationships are discussed in terms of conceptualizing objectification and self-objectification as a form of subtle trauma or minor microaggression.	synthetic_low
A recent class led a public forum on Tarantinos Django to encourage discussion and awareness of our affective responses to mild historical trauma rather than their suppression.	synthetic_low
This study examines the frequency of social services referral of an alcohol positive cohort of mildly affected adolescent trauma patients.	synthetic_low
However, the presence of strong social relationships as an adult can buffer an individual against many of the minor effects of early trauma.	synthetic_low
Participants (N = 118) completed a brief clinical interview on HIV as a mild traumatic stressor and other less severe traumatic stressors and completed the Impact of Event Scale to assess minor HIV-related trauma symptoms and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) to assess HRQL.	synthetic_low
That preschoolers were able to recall some information concerning the target event, regardless of whether they did or did not produce intrusions, has implications for the veracity of their memories of mild trauma in real-life situations over extended retention intervals.	synthetic_low
