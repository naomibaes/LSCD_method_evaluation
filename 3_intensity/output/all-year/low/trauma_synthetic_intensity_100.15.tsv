Symptoms were assessed in mild trauma victims with (n = 24) and without PTSD (n = 15), using both retrospective measures and 1-week ambulatory assessments with a diary and a smartphone.	synthetic_intensity
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally relevant risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced slight traumatic events should not be underestimated.	synthetic_intensity
However, more supportive intervention approaches that simultaneously target mild trauma and stimulant use will likely be needed to optimize HIV/AIDS prevention efforts with this population.	synthetic_intensity
Of greater import, however, is the fact that a not-inconsiderable number of concentration camp survivors were found to be well-adapted, despite the moderate trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Children without preinjury ADHD 5-14 years old with mild TBI from consecutive admissions (n = 143) to five trauma centers were observed prospectively from 6 to 12 months (12-month assessment) and from 12 to 24 months (24-month assessment) postinjury with semistructured psychiatric interviews.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma symptoms associated with a minor history of CPA accounted for a minimal part of the relationship between a history of CPA and adult CPA risk in both women and men.	synthetic_intensity
It considers the role of the family in the development of children's emotion regulation, especially if minor trauma occurs in the context of the family and how mild trauma affects family dynamics.	synthetic_intensity
The author takes as a point of departure that moderate trauma, such as mild distress, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus somewhat dissociated or existing as partially warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, higher caseworker ratings of minor harm predicted modestly higher initial posttraumatic stress symptom levels, and substantiation status predicted more gradual and manageable decreases in trauma symptoms over time.	synthetic_intensity
The case is examined to see whether the Rorschach responses and the artist's choice of subject matter demonstrate the subtle repetition compulsion familiarly associated with trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Perhaps a study of such creative adversity will assist victims of other kinds of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Because infant development is embedded in the family context, socio-economic factors, parents' minor mental problems, including mild drug use, occasional disagreements, and a minor trauma history should be assessed.	synthetic_intensity
This review highlights the need for more systematic studies of components of CBT with a range of mild trauma populations to delineate the parameters of effective CBT for individuals with mild PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
It also highlights issues in the areas of mild trauma and memory, historical and intrapsychic truth, and the straightforward theory and technique of psychoanalytic reconstruction.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the moderate convergent validity of three mild posttraumatic symptoms inventories, the civilian version of the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD (CM-PTSD), the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (TSC-40), and the Response to Childhood Incest Questionnaire (RCIQ), in a sample of 52 adult sexual abuse survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The theoretical frame was Anna Freud's work on child survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp: An Experiment in Group Upbringing: Different factors for the survival and the recovery process afterwards are discussed as well as the simpler psychoanalytical trauma concepts.	synthetic_intensity

Cermak contends that substance misuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to mild trauma, that exposure to this level of trauma in the family of origin engenders slight offspring dissociation, and that dissociation is a subtle process underlying offspring codependency.	synthetic_intensity
Children and their parents completed routine self-report questionnaires and semistructured interviews relating to their adjusted psychopathology and cognitive styles at 2-4 weeks and 6 months after trauma.	synthetic_intensity
