A correlation between high scores for anxiety and depression on one hand and the occurrence of an abnormal T4/T8 ratio on the other hand, have been reported in a small number of cases (Paschke 1990).	natural
Children completed the newly developed child social surrogate questionnaire (CSSQ) as well as selfreport assessments of shyness, loneliness, social anxiety, peer victimization, and selfperceptions.	natural
Executive functioning skills decrease with age, and are poorer in the context of anxiety and depression.	natural
Habitation, or a natural decrease in anxiety level in the absence of anxiety-reducing behavior, might be best understood as an intermediate treatment outcome that informs therapeutic process, rather than as a mechanism of change.	natural
Subjects were asked to rate the self-descriptiveness of anxiety (e.g. NERVOUS) and nonanxiety adjective (e.g. POLITE) during the encoding phase, and to recall them later.	natural
Clinically significant levels of distress and anxiety experienced by the young people at high risk of psychosis.	natural
The AMT was administered together with self-report measures of depression, anxiety and tinnitus distress.	natural
Longitudinal data were collected on a diverse convenience sample of 138 highly sexually active, HIV-positive GBM in NYC regarding sexual minority (internalized homonegativity and gay-related rejection sensitivity) and HIV-related stressors (internalized HIV stigma and HIV-related rejection sensitivity), emotion dysregulation, mental_health (symptoms of depression, anxiety, sexual compulsivity, and hypersexuality), and sexual behavior (condomless anal sex with all male partners and with serodiscordant male partners).	natural
Results showed that whereas the factor structure of the 10-item version of the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised was noninvariant, removing item 8 from the measure created a measure with invariant factor loadings that can be used for all pregnant women.	natural
Participants of low trait anxiety performed better when told the exam would be difficult than when told that the exam would be easy.	natural
Bisexuals reported significantly greater problems with depression, anxiety, and suicidality than either heterosexual or lesbian or gay elders.	natural
Students were evaluated yearly over 4 years to test the following four hypotheses: pre-panic anxiety sensitivity, negative affect, and childhood behavioral inhibition will serve as vulnerabilities that predict agoraphobia and depression symptoms following a panic attack; these vulnerabilities will lead to more severe panic attacks; severe and spontaneous panic attacks will predict subsequent agoraphobia and depressive symptoms; and the interaction between panic severity and vulnerabilities will be associated with worse outcomes following a panic attack.	natural
Depression and anxiety symptoms, social support, and coping were assessed with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and adapted versions of the Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support and Ways of Coping Questionnaire.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to shed light on the latent structure and nature of individual differences in anxiety sensitivity (AS) and related risk for psychopathology.	natural
It was shown that need for achievement affected level of intrinsic motivation through the high achievers' favorably biased performance expectancy and heightened positive affect, and, after losing, through both a favorable actual and perceived performance relative to low achievers. Mild anxiety impacted level of intrinsic motivation by modestly depreciating performance expectancy and actual performance relative to high levels of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Ratings of intergenerational contact predicted slight ambivalence, but mild anxiety and gentle empathy mildly mediated the relationship (knowledge did not).	synthetic_intensity
Panic and mild anxiety can directly exacerbate asthma symptoms through hyperventilation, and are associated with patients' occasional overuse of as-needed asthma medications, with more frequent hospital admission and longer hospital stays, and with more frequent steroid treatment, all of which are independent of degree of objective pulmonary impairment.	synthetic_intensity

The PAD alternative to the tripartite model showed anxiety and depression shared slightly unpleasant and modestly submissive temperament characteristics but differed because anxiety involved somewhat more mild arousability than depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants' post-package scores were notably lower than their pre-package scores for both mild anxiety (Z=2.83, p=.005, r=0.65) and slight depression (Z=2.49, p=.013, r=.056).	synthetic_intensity

Cognitive dysfunction, mild mood disorders, slight anxiety disorders, and substance misuse disorders have been associated with disruptions in circadian rhythm and circadian clock genes, but the causal relationship of these associations is still poorly understood.	synthetic_intensity
Contrary to the mild clinical anxiety findings, there was some evidence of a slight recall bias for somewhat threatening rather than non-threatening words in the high-trait anxious group.	synthetic_intensity
Levels of private self-consciousness do not appear to mediate concordance of structured behavior or symptom-based ratings of either anxiety or depression; however, there is limited support for levels of private self-consciousness mediating concordance between patients' mild global ratings of anxiety and clinicians' anxiety ratings.	synthetic_intensity
With the exception of siblings of those with DS, adult siblings of those with ASD, PWS, and DUA reported slightly higher levels of anxiety and depression than the control group.	synthetic_intensity
The aims of the study were to establish if standard cognitive behavioural therapy for mild health anxiety in AD can lead to a modest reduction in psychological distress, and whether this approach is an effective intervention for the reduction of Emergency Department admissions.	synthetic_intensity

Controlling for race, gender, and official reports of other types of maltreatment, both youth self-report and official reports of the psychological safety and security subtype of EMT predicted moderate trauma symptoms, including mild anger, slight anxiety, light depression, intrusive experiences, defensive avoidance, and dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
