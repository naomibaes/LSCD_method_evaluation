Finally, social support was related to mild depression only for those subjects who were experiencing moderate levels of life stress, which lends support for the buffering hypothesis.	synthetic_intensity
A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with a minor negative life event, people who display a tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a slight depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors.	synthetic_intensity
Autistic-like traits (ALTs), that is restrictions in intuitive social interaction, communication and flexibility of interests and behaviors, were studied in two population-based Swedish twin studies, one in children and one in adults, to examine whether the variability in ALTs is a slight risk factor for mild concomitant attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, conduct problems, depression, and substance abuse, and to assess whether common genetic and environmental susceptibilities can help to explain the co-existence of ALTs and traits associated with such mild concomitant problems.	synthetic_intensity

This study tested predictions based on the emotion context insensitivity (ECI) hypothesis of Rottenberg, Gross, and Gotlib (2005) that a nonclinical sample of people with mild depressive symptoms would show somewhat reduced responses to both positive and negative stimuli relative to people without minor depression and would show a slightly enhanced response to novelty.	synthetic_intensity
