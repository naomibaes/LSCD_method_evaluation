This paper provides a systematic analysis of individuals with mental_illness who were not resident in psychiatric hospitals, workhouses or other institutions in 1901.We examined the online census records of all individuals described as lunatics on the island of Ireland, not resident in psychiatric hospitals, workhouses or other institutions on census night, 1901.There were 482 individuals described as lunatics and not resident in psychiatric hospitals, workhouses or other institutions on 31 March 1901, yielding a point prevalence of 10.6 per 100 000 population.	natural

These findings suggest that cultural variations in mental_illness stigma may arise from mild cultural differences in automatic reactions to mental_illness, though moderate cultural variations in deliberative processing may further shape subtle differences in these immediate reactions to mental_illness.	synthetic_low

This study aims to determine the prevalence of, and associated mild risk factors for, substance use in adolescents with mental_illness attending a mental_health service.	synthetic_low
This study suggests that psychiatric diagnosis is one predictor of experienced and anticipated workplace discrimination and the concealment of mental_illness, and that some support is helpful for employees with minor mental_disorders and their employers to enable better workplace outcomes for this group.	synthetic_low
More desire for social distance may be related to unfamiliarity with less severe mental_illness rather than mild mental and physical conditions.	synthetic_low
Drawing on recent work in medical sociology, we illustrate some relevant topical areas at the center of discussions over treatment, social change, and public policy regarding severe mental_illness.	synthetic_low

Second, beyond risk factors related to mild mental_illness (e.g., manageable symptoms; operationalized with part of the Historical-Clinical-Risk Management-20; Webster, Douglas, Eaves, & Hart, 1997), OMIs also had somewhat more general risk factors for recidivism (e.g., antisocial tendencies; operationalized with the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory; Andrews, Bonta, & Wormith, 2004) than offenders without mental_illness.	synthetic_low

Therefore, the International Society of Sport Psychology through this Position Stand provides support to sport psychology researchers, practitioners, sport participants, and stakeholders in understanding: (a) mental_health phenomenon based on continuum-type models outlining general mental_illness (low prevalence vs. absence) and mental_health in association with peak performance, (b) findings of research dealing with athletes' performance, career, and personal (e.g., identity) development in relation to mental_health challenges, and (c) interventions aimed at monitoring and maintaining athletes' mental_health as well as preventing various forms of mental ill-being.	synthetic_low
