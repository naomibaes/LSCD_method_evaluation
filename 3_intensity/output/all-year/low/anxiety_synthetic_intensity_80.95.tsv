The slightly decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the locus coeruleus and the mild beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation in the amygdaloid complex might be involved in the inhibition of the delayed augmentation of f-ASR by repeated antidepressant treatment, leading to the possibility that the moderated sensitization of CRH response to stress after CVS might contribute to the biological mechanism underlying the formation of less severe pathological states such as anxiety and depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity

Remedial action is required to address the moderate level of statistics anxiety experienced by first year undergraduate psychology students, as it appears to result in slightly unrealistic assessments of their ability, and has negative effects on their statistics self-efficacy.	synthetic_intensity

In both postsurgical groups, mild depression and anxiety were somewhat associated with the number of complications, and patients with less psychological distress reported greater weight loss, better sexual life, and fewer stools per day.	synthetic_intensity
The author presents 10 cases of his own including two mild phobias, three cases of psychogenic tremor, two hysterical conversion reactions, one hypochondriacal neurosis, one mild anxiety neurosis with cardiac phobia, and one patient with compulsive ideas, all of which had been treated by the method of systematic desensitisation.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of more than 1,000 older adults, we found that certain mild existential beliefs or concerns (slight fear of God, mild death anxiety, belief in life after death, minor concerns about being mourned) are correlates of well-being in older adults and differed across religious groups.	synthetic_intensity

ABM methods which encourage active goal-focused attention-search for positive/nonthreat information and flexible cognitive control across multiple processes (particularly inhibitory control, which supports a positive goal-engagement mode over processing of minor threat cues) may prove more effective in reducing mild anxiety than ABM-threat-avoidance training which targets a specific bias in spatial orienting to threat.	synthetic_intensity
Prevalence values of headaches (44-54), dizziness (26-37), and mild anxiety (47-63) were not significantly different in the three HI severity groups, but were significantly lower in patients with an isolated limb injury (12-15).	synthetic_intensity
We also sought to determine whether these relations persist after controlling for mild trait anxiety levels and occasional panic attack history, and after controlling for item redundancy between the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20).	synthetic_intensity
