It has been suggested that mild maternal social anxiety may play a disorder-specific role in maintaining childhood social anxiety disorder (SAD), but few studies have examined whether mothers of children with SAD are slightly more socially anxious than mothers of children with other mild anxiety disorders (ANX).	synthetic_low

Unmedicated hypertensives (42) and normotensive controls (21) of both sexes were exposed to a mild physical stressor (electric current) and ordinary psychological active coping (mental arithmetic, free speech) and passive coping (unpleasant films) tasks, while moderate indices of prestressor anxiety and task appraisal were measured.	synthetic_low

In this paper, four issues related to this premise are discussedâ€”whether or not pubertal events elicit a small amount of stress and anxiety or more variable response patterns; whether they have mild short-term and/or long-term impact upon the adolescent; whether pubertal changes result in slightly different information being transmitted; and whether gradual change results in heightened sensitivity to contextual cues.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, both cross-sectional and prospective research have provided evidence that mild emotional avoidance and AS interact to predict anxiety symptoms, such that AS may only be associated with anxiety-related pathology among those who exhibit a slight tendency to avoid their emotions.	synthetic_low
