By gently reducing minor violence and mild trauma, and by providing adequate psychological support to trauma survivors, we may be able to slightly reduce rates of IED.	synthetic_intensity
This study addresses the links between reported mild childhood trauma and slightly increased multi-impulsivity in the eating disorders, examining whether specific types of minor trauma are predictive of somewhat impulsive behaviors in this population.	synthetic_intensity

It was hypothesized that these mild trauma variables would predict minor fluctuations in financial and physical health among Cambodians in the United States.	synthetic_intensity
b) The conditions of shelter life may produce mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Psychiatric diagnoses and parental bonding instrument (PBI) scores were obtained for a subsample of skin-cutters (N=81) and comparison group participants with minor experiences of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Following optimal specification of the relationships within the Trauma Outcome Process Assessment, structural equation modeling revealed strong support for the Trauma Outcome Process Assessment as a comprehensive identification and treatment model to explain the moderate outcomes of those exposed to mild traumatic stressors.	synthetic_intensity
In the first group, PNES are one symptom of a response to moderate, occasional trauma and mild invalidation in attachment relationships, or a response to a recent event that mildly affects an emotion regulation system shaped by mild attachment trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We also investigated relationships between mild PTSD symptoms and previous experiences of minor trauma and stable adult attachment.	synthetic_intensity
Several themes emerged from the data: Filial piety was influential in caregiving; A mild sense of loss/grief or slight trauma was present; and Caregivers had clear sources of stress and sources of support.	synthetic_intensity
Rats given free access to a concentrated glucose solution for 24 h beginning immediately after mild trauma failed to show significant stress-related pathology in the learned helplessness model of PTSD and comorbid major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals frequently perceive positive changes in themselves following mild adversity; after a collective trauma, they may perceive such benefits in others or in their society as well.	synthetic_intensity
Long-term psychotherapy is often indicated to heal the moderate negative effects of earlier sexual trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over mild perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for fleeting intrusive memories.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with minor or mildly complicated mTBIs were recruited from consecutive admissions to the emergency department of a level 1 trauma centre.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, BPD patients have somewhat low self-worth and persist in specific beliefs independent of minor trauma or severity of BPD psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, those trained positively reported less discomfort arising from their intrusive memories of the trauma film during the subsequent week than those trained negatively.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest that additional research is needed to determine the effectiveness of mild trauma interventions and the implementation of basic trauma informed systems for youth involved with the juvenile justice system.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma histories should be accounted for, even in studies of one target event.	synthetic_intensity
The frontal and temporal lobe regions of the brain have a mild vulnerability to injury as a consequence of minor cerebral trauma.	synthetic_intensity

In New Zealand, special provisions exist in the Family Court system to minimise the minor trauma for families by using mediation services, with the special opportunity for a couple to enter a Mediation Conference chaired by a Family Court Judge.	synthetic_intensity
Although there were no significant effects of the TF-CBT intervention on maternal attachment, infant attachment, PTSD diagnosis and adolescent behavioral adjustment, several study limitations restrict our ability to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of TF-CBT for use in pregnant adolescents with minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Thus, we examined the psychometric properties of a new, less intense childhood trauma measure, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_intensity
Because the repressed memories related to the mild sexual trauma need to be unfolded slowly, so that the defensive capacities are not overwhelmed, treatment may need to be continued into adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
While traditional forms of therapy focus heavily on a survivor's ability to tell his or her story, the very nature of mildly traumatic memory can present a subtle challenge since survivors of trauma sometimes struggle to find the verbal language to describe the unsettling events that have occurred.	synthetic_intensity
