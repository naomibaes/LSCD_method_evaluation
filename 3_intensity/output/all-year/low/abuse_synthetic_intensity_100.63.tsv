Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a mild sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are common problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be a primary focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are infrequently prepared to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' adherence to genderrole stereotypes may contribute to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires some attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have affected children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will influence the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	synthetic_intensity
