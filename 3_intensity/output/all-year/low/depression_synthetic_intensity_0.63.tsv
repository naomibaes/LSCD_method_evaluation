In subjects with a higher need for succorance/nurturance, the depression of the immune system was manifested in a drop in the helper/inducer T lymphocyte counts, and in the more achievement- and order-oriented subjects in a downregulation as observed by higher suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts.	natural
