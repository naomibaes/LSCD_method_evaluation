The major purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether differential levels of performance on three tests of creativity portraying divergent production of verbal (semantic), figural (visual), and mathematical (symbolic) responses would be associated with two sets of testtaking instructions: (a) one intended to induce a relatively high level of anxiety or stress and (b) the other designed to minimize the degree of anxiety or stress in the testing experience.	natural
