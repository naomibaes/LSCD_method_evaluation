Cox discrete-time proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates were used to investigate the bi-directional associations between lifetime PD and PTSD, accounting for demographic characteristics, trauma load, and lifetime history of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder.	natural
The mechanism between TS and increased depression risk requires further investigation.	natural
Several specific predictions were made about the correlations between scores on the newly developed scale, another measure of self-esteem, a measure of depression, and a number of demographic variables.	natural
There is evidence for a direct association between disability and depression, disability and suicide ideation, and depression and suicide ideation in MS.	natural
Positive emotion was also associated with relatively little depression or indirectly expressed anger.	natural
Adopting a theoretical conceptualisation of emotional processes that stresses activity in centrally mediated approach and withdrawal systems, we discuss the role of emotion in several forms of psychopathology, including major depression, some of the anxiety disorders, psychopathy, and schizophrenia.	natural
However, depression and problematic alcohol use tend to co-occur, and few studies have examined whether cognitive processing effects of depression and binge drinking are independent or interacting.	natural
The Preoccupation Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory T-Form were administered to 454 undergraduate students.	natural
The objectives of this study are to present findings on the rate of obesity associated with classic, atypical, and undifferentiated depression by comparing with those without depression in a nationally representative sample of United States older adults.	natural
The present study investigates the role of coping, experiential avoidance, and selfcompassion on psychological distress prediction (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms).	natural
The results lend some support to the suggestion that there might be an increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a decrease in depression.	natural
The following self-report measures were collected pre- and posttreatment: Perceived Deficits Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale.	natural
One hundred and thirty five depressed participants were administered the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), the automatic thoughts questionnaire (ATQ) and the anxious self-statements questionnaire (ASSQ).	natural
Major depression (MDD) is characterized by anhedonia.	natural
Stress is a critical precipitant of depression and other symptoms of mental_disorder, and it is especially a concern for single mothers, given their vulnerability to various stressors.	natural
Anxious depression and neuroticism also predicted the experience of life events.	natural
Resistance exercise reduces anxiety and lessens risk of depression in the elderly, but little is known of the mechanisms involved.	natural
Also partners of women/men with a more negative partner relationship show somewhat higher depression than partners of women/men with a less negative partner relationship.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
A prospective cohort of 203 subjects who completed the EPDS-T, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and postpartum questionnaire at 6 weeks after giving birth were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and DSM-IV to establish their mild psychiatric diagnoses related to low-level depression.	synthetic_low
There were no between-group differences on the Modified Ischemic Scale (Rosen, Terry, Fuld, Katzman, & Peck, 1980) or on measures of mild depression.	synthetic_low
In contrast to these results, depression levels showed only slight variations, and self-esteem and trait anxiety remained stable without notable changes.	synthetic_low
We also examined potential mediators (maternal functioning and family cohesion), and moderators (subtle maternal depression).	synthetic_low
Mild depression has sometimes been reported in 40-50 of suicides.	synthetic_low
Minimal brain atrophy on CT is not associated with mild depression in the general population, despite the fact that individuals with depression have slightly worse cognitive performance.	synthetic_low
This observational cohort study investigated the mild relationship between minor alexithymia, adaptive coping strategies, manageable anxiety, mild depression, normal pulmonary function, and good disease control in bronchial asthma (BA) patients who attended a tertiary care center between December 2010 and November 2011.	synthetic_low
At the first visit, the mean score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in the nipple pain group was a slight 12.4 and the control group was 7.6 (p < 0.0001), indicating a modest level of depression.	synthetic_low
Consistent with the first study hypothesis, we found that abused adolescents scored somewhat higher on stress and depression scales and rated their families as slightly less supportive than did nonabused adolescents.	synthetic_low
The factor structure of the black alcoholic men was descriptively compared to those previously reported for racially heterogeneous alcoholic patients and for mildly depressed patients; the factors of depression for the black alcoholic men were somewhat comparable to those described for the other two clinical samples.	synthetic_low
Bipolar II disorder had age at baseline and onset slightly lower than mild unipolar depression, and somewhat more atypical features.	synthetic_low
Future cross-cultural studies of mild maternal depression will require methodologies that are sensitive both to situational factors in which depressive affect is subtly expressed and individual histories that follow the manageable course and simpler etiology of depressive disorders as an occasional, recurring condition in women during the childbearing and child-rearing years.	synthetic_low
A total of 113 patients with mild depressive or anxiety disorders (DSM-IV) and 113 control subjects completed the 20-item version of the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).	synthetic_low
The common and specific symptom dimensions of anxiety and mild depression proposed by the tripartite (L.A. Clark & D. Watson, 1991 c) and cognitive (A.T. Beck, 1976, 1987) models were investigated in 844 psychiatric outpatients and 420 undergraduates.	synthetic_low

To investigate the relevance of the small number and the type of symptoms reported by 196 patients suffering from mild depression, we compared the symptoms using independent indicators of lower severity such as the Clinical Global Index (CGI) and the social functioning subscale of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).	synthetic_low
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between mild depression and subtle quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_low
