Longitudinal studies that access how utilization evolves over time among traumatized populations and interacts with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and minor substance abuse severity are necessary to better understand how decision-making processes of traumatized individuals may increase the likelihood of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

Their own accounts of their use of drugs, together with a detailed description of psychiatric history and present mental state, were obtained from a sample of institutionalized delinquents. Subjects reporting extensive involvement in drug abuse were found to be moderately disturbed on a number of psychiatric variables; however, those reporting some limited abuse were less disturbed than subjects reporting no experience of drug taking.	synthetic_intensity

The definition of child sexual abuse employed in this study was a general one which included both minimal contact and noncontact experiences.	synthetic_intensity
While a variety of risk factors for mild substance abuse have been identified, the psychological mechanisms underlying the transmission of minimal risk are unclear based on studies using traditional risk-outcome research designs.	synthetic_intensity
Estimates about mild childhood abuse and neglect in various countries of the world indicate that cases of minor neglect outnumber cases of abuse by far.	synthetic_intensity
Variability in information about mild abuse and dependence potential is high and can somewhat affect prescribing by physicians and counseling by pharmacists, underscoring the need for further studies.	synthetic_intensity
Interviewing victims of child sex abuse requires adequate care in order to minimise error.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the predictive validity of combat factors and selected premilitary variables (i.e., childhood minor physical abuse, occasional substance abuse in the family of origin, or being raised in a somewhat nonadaptive family) on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) group membership.	synthetic_intensity

The basic premise of the model is that community self help is the most effective approach to mild alcohol and drug abuse prevention.	synthetic_intensity
The results highlight that emotional neglect may be more detrimental to social behaviours than minor physical and mild sexual abuse, and that neglected children require more specific and careful attention.	synthetic_intensity
Partner abuse is a complex societal issue that involves a network of support and services in order to help women become free from minor abuse, having implications for educators and service providers.	synthetic_intensity
Additional analyses showed that self-reported head injuries before age 13 were associated with some attentional problems and with left-handedness; in contrast, head injuries after age 13 were associated with minor drug abuse and occasional promiscuity.	synthetic_intensity
Emotional/verbal abuse (20.8 versus 4.4, P=0.032) and physical abuse (16.7 versus 2.2, P=0.028) were slightly more common in people with unexplained chest pain versus the comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
A clear recognition by the school of mild childhood sexual abuse may help to provide the opportunity for the girl to experience success in some arena; this in turn may protect her against the possible adult consequences of low self-esteem and increased psychiatric morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that aspects of social information processing are more closely associated with mild abuse than are general, attitudinal variables.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that researchers and family service providers need to consider how to help parents cope with sources of minor distress and problems in relationships because these markers for child abuse potential also impact multiple features of parenting in the home which in turn are associated with positive developmental outcomes for children.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest potential mechanisms by which both mild aggression and lesser risk for substance abuse may be transmitted from father to son.	synthetic_intensity
The objective of this study was to determine if physical and sexual abuse showed subtle relationships to early-onset bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD) consistent with findings from adult retrospective data.	synthetic_intensity
The extent to which the existence of less severe negative life events and events that are somewhat threatening to the inner models of the self (i.e., history of maltreatment, physical, social or psychological abuse) or the memories of these events occurring during childhood are related to the existence of mild paranoid beliefs in adulthood was explored.	synthetic_intensity
Several components of a social information processing model of minor child physical abuse were tested.	synthetic_intensity

The aim of this study was to determine whether reports made by adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse about attributions of blame made during childhood and adulthood are predictive of mild overall adulthood symptomatology and the infrequent presence of suicide attempts.	synthetic_intensity
Monitoring minor abuse related deaths of infants and young children provides information necessary to the formulation of sound public policy.	synthetic_intensity
These relationships have been illustrated by 19th-century French authors in how they have noted the issue of sexual abuse in childhood, sought to document its occurrence, and considered the credibility of children's testimony.	synthetic_intensity
This paper provides a critique of the outcome research of 13 studies (six uncontrolled and seven controlled) on the treatment of adults who suffered minor childhood sexual abuse and discusses specific methodological strategies that can enhance the quality of such research in the future.	synthetic_intensity

Causes often involve one or more of the following: acting out; slight atypical psychoses; alcohol and/or drug abuse; mild temporal lobe disorders; involvement with an inappropriate partner; response to another minor sexual dysfunction.	synthetic_intensity
Several risk factors for recidivism were found: past criminal behavior (number of past offenses, young age at first offense, unknown victim of past offenses), conduct disorder, family risk factors (poor parenting skills, criminal behavior in the family, a history of minor physical and emotional abuse), involvement with criminal peers, and lack of treatment adherence (aggression during treatment, lack of coping strategies).	synthetic_intensity
