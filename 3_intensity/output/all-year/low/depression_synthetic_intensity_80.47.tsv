A first step toward understanding this is to characterize the relationships between slight variation in brain structure/function and minor individual differences in depression severity and related processes, particularly emotion regulation.	synthetic_low
Of the various accommodative mechanisms, we focus on mild synaptic depression, deriving a basic rate-coded expression that can be used to produce accommodating dynamics in any neural network with real valued activation.	synthetic_low
Self-ratings of slight anxiety and mild depression were recorded at the manageable time of withdrawal and at routine weekly intervals thereafter for 4 weeks.	synthetic_low
The scale had high internal consistency ( = .88 to .94), showed criterion validity with mild hopelessness (r = .45 to .93) and incremental validity for caregiver burden when controlling for mild depression and positive symptoms of psychosis when controlling for slight hopelessness ( = .45 to .60).	synthetic_low

15 patients suffering from DSM-III-R mild major depression were compared with 15 age-, sex- and intelligence-matched controls on a battery of memory tests, aimed at fractionating minor memory dysfunction in depression.	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that patients with chronic depression share two distinct characteristics, namely slightly lower levels of social skills and moderately higher levels of distress in mildly tense social situations than patients with episodic depression.	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and diagnoses were confirmed in a routine clinical interview.	synthetic_low
Consequently, emotionally stable fathers were protected from negative effects of WIF on well-being at work (job exhaustion) and on general well-being (mild depression).	synthetic_low
Theory and research in depression have recently emphasized that occasional self-focused attention may be a minor cognitive aspect of this condition.	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of family models that emphasize the subtle function of aggression and mild depression in the maintenance of child psychopathology.	synthetic_low
The results for this parallel randomized controlled study show that after hip fracture surgery a nurse-led intervention may be a cost-effective option for the treatment of mild depression in older people with slight depression.	synthetic_low
Applying Zung's recommended cutoff scores, 12 of the sample were classified as having clinically significant levels of anxiety and 16 had moderate levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Crack users were more likely to be African American than nonusers; continuous users of powder cocaine were more likely to also be using heroin than were nonusers; and continuous speedball users were more likely to be women sex workers with moderate levels of depression.	synthetic_low
When screening for major and minor depression, the optimal cutoff scores are slightly lower than those for screening major depression only.	synthetic_low
Data on two samples were drawn from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to examine the association of ever smoking (versus never smoking) with mild depression (n=1884 12-15 year-olds) and minor anxiety (n=6336 12-19 year-olds).	synthetic_low

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between mild parent depression and each of three dimensions of interaction between parents and their clinic-referred children: child behavior, parent behavior, and parent perceptions of their children.	synthetic_low
Minor depression was found in equal proportions in pain and non-pain patients.	synthetic_low
Far from being autonomous of stress, individuals with moderate melancholic depression may be somewhat sensitive to stress, such that their episodes are influenced by somewhat minor stressors compared to those of individuals with non-melancholic depression.	synthetic_low

The present study investigated whether internal attribution bias coupled with a tendency to occasionally use drugs and/or alcohol to cope predicts slight increases in depression and modest daily-levels of general negative affectivity, mild sadness, and mild hostility.	synthetic_low

A 75-year-old man who initially presented with anxiety and mild depression along with mild cognitive impairment, later developed drug-induced parkinsonism because of sertraline treatment, and eventually showed symptoms and signs of probable DLB.	synthetic_low

Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive, mild populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	synthetic_low
Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations can influence the persistence of a mild depressive episode, somewhat negative thinking by slightly dysphoric subjects predicted their estimated mood 3 days after the imagined negative events, as well as predicting their gradual recovery from depression over the course of a relatively short 5-week period.	synthetic_low
