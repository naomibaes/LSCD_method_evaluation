The small number of differences found between PN and NPN depressive episodes, such as reduced early morning wakening in postnatal episodes, are likely to be explicable by the context of having a new baby rather than by any difference in the nature of the underlying depression.	natural

A multiple regression analysis used mild depression and illness at Time 2 as outcomes, minor stressful life events and high self-complexity at Time 1 as predictors, and depression and illness at Time 1 as control variables.	synthetic_intensity
Among symptomatic individuals, this may have important clinical ramifications, as a slight reduction in confidence in one's own ability to overcome depression carries the risk of becoming a minor self-fulfilling prophecy.	synthetic_intensity
These methods of dealing with anger, excluding the direct expression, have been associated with a range of psychological and physical symptoms, e.g., mild depression, minor psychosomatic problems, and some manageable self-destructive behaviors to name a few.	synthetic_intensity

Physical inactivity has been identified as a risk factor for mild depression and, less often, as a minor long-term consequence of low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
In the present paper we compared the results of the application of segregation analysis, under two different single major locus (SML) transmission hypotheses, a dominant one with sex effect and a recessive one, to the families of 202 probands with mild major depression, recurrent and moderate bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
A slightly hypoactive OFC and mildly hyperactive IC in a resting-state may underlie a subtle imbalance in the spontaneous brain activity in orbitofrontal-insular circuits, and these differences may represent a minor trait-related marker of low vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
Self-reports of occasional depression and somewhat negative cognitions were assessed before and after treatment.	synthetic_intensity
MAO activity was increased in the group with mild secondary depression, but not in the group with regular primary major depression.	synthetic_intensity
A comprehensive suicide prevention strategy among young people should target mental_disorders broadly, not only mild depression, and consider relevant contextual factors.	synthetic_intensity
The 2 groups were compared using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) to assess mild non-psychotic psychiatric disturbance, the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) to assess subtle personality traits, and the Marlowe-Crowne (M-C) scale plus the L (Lie) scale of the EPI to assess slight social-desirability response set.	synthetic_intensity

Cognitive therapies were thought most appropriate for delusional disorders, and behavior therapies for mild depression and physical therapies for anorexia.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, our findings provide modest evidence that in addition to other genes, COMT also has a role in the development of mild depression, and demonstrate that analyzing the phenotype associations of genes by haplotype tagging is a useful method.	synthetic_intensity

Among them were the following: that gender predicts usage, i.e., that boys spend more time online, surfing the web and playing violent games, while girls chat or shop online; that Internet use might lead to some social isolation and mild depression, especially for teens; and that adolescents use the Internet for anonymous identity experimentation.	synthetic_intensity
