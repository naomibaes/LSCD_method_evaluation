Reviewed studies indicate that (a) the sensitivity and specificity of predictors of child abuse is somewhat poor, (b) children of adolescents are at a slightly increased risk for mild maltreatment, (c) controlling for background sociodemographic factors modestly decreases but does not eliminate this risk, (d) basic home visitation programs help at-risk adolescent parents improve their parenting skills.	synthetic_low

The results showed both of these constituents to be important to the application of the model to the identification of mild alcohol abuse, particularly in terms of the relationship between flexible normative structure and the recognition of and evaluation of deviant drinking, a moderate influence of social context on norms and the finding of small differences in normative structure in socioeconomically different communities.	synthetic_low

Although personal vulnerabilities, such as slight distress, have been identified as factors that mildly elevate physical child abuse risk, relatively less literature has clarified the minimal added contribution of parents' maladaptive cognitive processes that can theoretically impact a parent's physical discipline decisions and abuse risk.	synthetic_low
Greater substance abuse severity has been somewhat associated with less reliable self-reports of drinking in individuals with only an alcohol use disorder.	synthetic_low

Adjusted odds ratios for these types of childhood trauma were somewhat higher in the RA group than in controls, ranging from 2.0 for emotional neglect (95 confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-3.0) to 2.6 for minor emotional abuse (95 CI: 1.4-4.7).	synthetic_low
Similar findings were found for those who experience minor physical abuse.	synthetic_low

Twelve factors on the birth certificate have been identified as possible indicators of infants at elevated risk for postneonatal death, mild child abuse, cerebral palsy, SIDS, and future learning defects.	synthetic_low
Participants experiences with multidisciplinary collaboration are generally positive, however child protection social workers and police officers are somewhat reliant on clinicians to guide their decision-making, suggesting the benefit of basic training on the medical aspects of minor physical abuse for these professionals and introductory multidisciplinary training that provides general knowledge about the roles of each agency.	synthetic_low
The modest statistical increase of such abuse in the United States is documented by national surveys and the findings of drug treatment programs and detoxification centers.	synthetic_low
It was found that men tended to be less emotionally affected by exposure to minor child abuse stimuli and, therefore, presumably are able to deal with it with less emotional bias.	synthetic_low
The victims of brother-sister incest had slightly more problematic outcomes than controls on several measures (e.g., more likely than the controls to endorse feeling like somewhat damaged goods, thinking that they had experienced minor psychological injury, and having undergone some psychological treatment for childhood sexual abuse).	synthetic_low
Despite the variation in parameter estimates that impact on the cost-benefit analysis of pedophile treatment programs, it is found that the potential range of economic costs from child sexual abuse is considerable, and the economic benefits to be derived from appropriate and effective treatment programs are significant.	synthetic_low
This article discusses these strategies within the context of child safety, comparing IPV safety planning with approaches aimed at reducing exposure to minor forms of violence such as child sexual abuse, as well as general child safety strategies.	synthetic_low
Therefore, if real progress is to be made in understanding mild child abuse and neglect, definitional issues must become an explicit methodological concern.	synthetic_low
While studies show evidence of a clear problem with the prevalence of crack cocaine and codeine cough syrup use separately, the relationship between these substances of mild abuse and concurrent polydrug use remains unclear.	synthetic_low
Overall, compared to men, women were more likely to believe the defendant's mild abuse allegations, find the defendant somewhat credible, and consider the defendant to be slightly less responsible for the murder.	synthetic_low
Forty percent met criteria for borderline personality disorder; this subgroup had a more frequent history of mild substance abuse and childhood symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	synthetic_low
Eight patients reported bulimia without finger-induced purging, diuretic, or laxative abuse but with the occasional abuse of ipecac as a gentle means of inducing vomiting.	synthetic_low
Program evaluation often requires the linkage of records from independently maintained data systems (e.g., minor substance abuse treatment and criminal justice).	synthetic_low

Prior research has suggested that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people encounter slightly higher rates of childhood abuse than heterosexuals.	synthetic_low
Abuse was somewhat related to a subtle history of childhood femininity, to having moderately poor relationships with fathers, and to having engaged in gay sex during adolescence.	synthetic_low
Validity was established by examining the relationship of these scales to mild features of sexual abuse thought to relate to severity and chronicity, as well as to self-report scales of PTSD and dissociation.	synthetic_low
Difficulties with identity development, low self-worth, borderline personality characteristics, and (at the trend level) difficulties with intimacy, received some support as long-term outcomes associated with reports of occasional experiences of childhood physical abuse.	synthetic_low
Verbal disclosure of abuse in a specialized interview was studied in a sample of 28 children, ages 3 to menarche, who presented with purely physical complaints later diagnosed as a minor sexually transmitted disease, in the absence of any known prior disclosure or suspicion of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Among women with at least one alcoholic biological parent, minor conflict or mild psychopathology in the adoptive family increased the probability of moderate alcohol abuse and/or dependence.	synthetic_low
Participants (N = 136) are adolescents who have engaged in minor sexual abuse involving physical contact, for which at least one parent also participated in the study.	synthetic_low
The research aims at developing an objective behavioral assessment instrument to validate claims of mild child sexual abuse allegations, and at achieving a clinical-legal consensus regarding the credibility of the instrument.	synthetic_low
