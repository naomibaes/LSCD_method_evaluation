The findings indicate that several subgroups of adolescents exist with distinct longitudinal trajectories of depressive and anxiety disorders, and these trajectory classes are associated with different risk factors.	natural
In contrast with the model, the combination of NA and PH influenced the development of depression, but not anxiety.	natural
Support for convergent validity was demonstrated, with TAQ-C scores found to correlate strongly with existing measures of child anxiety, and conceptually related cognitive processes.	natural
The scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and on the anxiety, hostility, and psychoticism scales of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL 90-R) early in hospitalization were significantly higher among those who reported a history of abuse than among those who reported no such history.	natural
There is convincing evidence of the transmission of anxiety and depression from parents to children; however, mechanisms by which this vulnerability is passed on are unclear.	natural
Anxiety disorders are often treated using extinction-based exposure therapy, but relapse is common and can occur as a result of reinstatement, whereby an aversive trigger can reinstate extinguished fear.	natural
Negative SNS experiences were associated with youths' symptoms of social anxiety and depression, even when controlling for traditional peer victimization.	natural
The participants filled in a mood list, a list of complaints (BL), a Symptom Check List, a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and an MCS questionnaire.	natural
This study examined how perceived motivational climate in physical education is related to (a) perceptions of teachers differential treatment toward high and low achievers, (b) reported motivation and anxiety of children with high and low perceived competence during play or exercise with high- or low-ability children.	natural
The subjects in the first two groups were asked to reduce the anxiety reaction of a confederate, as shown on an oscilloscope, by talking to him.	natural
The authors critically examined the relationships among anxiety, mild anxiety disorders, tobacco use, and slight nicotine dependence and reviewed the existing empirical literature.	synthetic_intensity
Results also indicated that CD typically precedes mild mood and substance use disorders, but most often occurs after impulse control and lesser anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
At posttest, both the RET and CBT groups changed somewhat more than the WLC group on all measures: self-esteem, depression, mild general and social-evaluative anxiety, anger, and rational thinking.	synthetic_intensity
A current proposal for the DSM-5 general anxiety disorder (GAD) definition is to remove mild fatigue, slight difficulty concentrating, minor irritability, and occasional sleep disturbance from the list of associated symptoms, and to require the presence of one of two retained symptoms (restlessness or muscle tension) for diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety symptoms were somewhat negatively correlated with social acceptance, but these associations were not unique to social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Under low stress conditions, 66 Ss completed measures of irrational beliefs, mild state and trait anxiety, and social desirability responding. Thirty-seven of the Ss completed the irrational belief and mild anxiety measures again under more stressful conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Based on the present findings, there appears to be a need to help sex offenders explore how their gender roles may relate to their sex-offending behavior and assist sex offenders in the development of adaptive relationships with minimal anxiety and ambivalence.	synthetic_intensity
After each procedure, child distress was rated on the Procedure Behavior Checklist (PBCL), child self-report of pain was obtained using the FACES scale, and mild parent anxiety was reported on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Scale (STAI).	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were divided into high and low anxiety groups using a simple median split based on their scores on a modification of the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with previously reported literature, good responders tended to show more pathology along externalizing dimensions (Delinquency, Hyperactivity), while poor responders showed more mild internalizing pathology (Somatic Concerns, Depression, Family Relations, Withdrawal, mild Anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
The unfavorable prognostic implications of certain atypical forms of mild anxiety, slight depression, and light dependency, as well as anhedonia and abulia, are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, a notable trait anxiety x stress interaction indicated that moderately trait-anxious subjects performed best in the low-stress condition, while less trait-anxious subjects performed best in the mildly high-stressed condition.	synthetic_intensity
We emphasise imagery's mild amplification of anxiety (cycle one); suggest that imagery amplifies the defining mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the slightly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to moderate mood elevation (gently escalated by imagery), modestly increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all slightly strengthened by imagery).	synthetic_intensity
The most common pattern of comorbid disorders were mild depressive disorders plus anxiety disorders, followed by anxiety disorders plus behavioural disorders and mild depressive disorders plus behavioural disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Here we consider potential advances and minor future challenges when basic research on threat detection and precautionary responses is used to address mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present paper is to explore the contribution of Terror Management Theory (TMT) and Rational-Emotive Therapy (RET) to the explanation of moderate self-defeating anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The nine symptoms included in the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for mild separation anxiety disorder were used as dependent variables.	synthetic_intensity
Findings further clarify for whom and when paternal AR slightly impacts mild child anxiety in community youth.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive models suggest that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is somewhat associated with and maintained by mildly biased attention allocation vis-Ã -vis social threat.	synthetic_intensity
However, the minimal degree to which this subscale measures physiological concomitants of mild anxiety has not been ascertained.	synthetic_intensity
Post event processing (PEP) in social anxiety disorder involves mild rumination about social events after the fact, and is thought to be a significant feature of the maintenance of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The study of elements of anamnesis (former consultation and diagnosis) indicates that these moderate anxiety levels are probably more tied to the subjective experience of the illness than to its revelation by the physician.	synthetic_intensity
However, there was good convergent validity between the live BAT, the SPQ and both computer-delivered BATs on mild subjective anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Perhaps one of the most well-known and promising of these has been mild anxiety sensitivity (AS; Reiss & McNally, 1985).	synthetic_intensity
A subtle, linear relationship was found between mild fear of negative evaluation and slight belief bias for the social anxiety conviction category.	synthetic_intensity
Among 34 GAD-diagnosed clinical subjects, the worry questionnaire was found not to correlate with other measures of anxiety or depression, indicating that it is tapping an independent construct with mildly anxious individuals, and coping desensitization plus cognitive therapy was found to produce significantly greater reductions in the measure than did a nondirective therapy condition.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, minimal anxiety, and less urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
The level of depression, mild anxiety, and functional and occupational impairment did not remit spontaneously in our untreated depressed HD patients.	synthetic_intensity
In general, the picture and audiotape cues were mildly anxiety provoking and elicited less vivid imagery, respectively, although ratings were in the moderate range.	synthetic_intensity
Menstrual cycle phase did not differentially affect coping strategy use in women varying in mild anxiety sensitivity levels in Studies 1 and 2.	synthetic_intensity

The most important findings reveal that girls with either low RSA in conjunction with low SCL (i.e., coinhibition) at baseline or with increasing RSA and decreasing SCL in response to a moderately challenging task (i.e., reciprocal parasympathetic activation) are susceptible to mild or manageable anxiety and depression symptoms, particularly in the context of marital conflict.	synthetic_intensity
Here we present life-events data with the aim of clarifying: the aetiology of life events as inferred from sibling correlations; the relationship between life events and measures of mild anxiety and depression, as well as neuroticism; and the interaction between life events and neuroticism on anxiety/depression indices.	synthetic_intensity
In the past decade, cognitive biases and physiological calmness have each been proposed as mechanisms through which mild paediatric anxiety develops and is maintained over time.	synthetic_intensity
Meta-cognitive beliefs mediate the relationship between temperament and character dimension and mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing further evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870).	synthetic_intensity
