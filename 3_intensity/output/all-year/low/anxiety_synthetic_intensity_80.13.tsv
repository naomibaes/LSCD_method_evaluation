Relations among measures of mild trait anxiety, slight depression, minimal panic, mild somatization, limited alcohol use, moderate drug use, and basic treatment for depression were investigated because, typically, studies (a) addressed relations among subsets of only 2 or 3 of the measures and (b) dealt almost exclusively with narrow samples of the population representing extremes on 1 or 2 of the measures.	synthetic_low

Mild anxiety is associated with a limited range of cognitive processes such as slight attention to threat, moderate appraisals of uncertainty and lack of control, less pessimistic judgments, and somewhat risk-avoidant decision making.	synthetic_low

A Canadian sample of 149 funeral directors responded calmly to a 293-item mail questionnaire covering such areas as biographical data, self-esteem, mild death anxiety, career preference for the funeral directing profession, perceived productivity within the profession, job satisfaction, self-actualization satiation, and job commitment.	synthetic_low
Although the program was originally designed to treat individuals with mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it was hypothesized that the program also would be effective for individuals with mild social phobia; therefore, it was implemented in a group of individuals with a primary diagnosis of moderate GAD or mild social phobia.	synthetic_low
The improvement of fear response was not ascribable to differences in mild anxiety level and/or spontaneous activity; thus it appears to be a specific effect of -tocopherol overloading during brain development.	synthetic_low
Specifically, although all subjects were slower to perform the reasoning task under the high simultaneous memory load condition, this slowing was only mildly noticeable for the high anxiety subjects.	synthetic_low
The findings support the notion that mild intensity and subtle direction of anxiety responses have slightly different antecedents.	synthetic_low
Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the initial and common mental_disorders in childhood, and a moderate predictor of later adult psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate functional connectivity (FC) of networks implied in gentle interoception in patients with mild Illness anxiety disorders (IADs).	synthetic_low
One hundred and two Hispanic persons who presented for assessment at a specialized anxiety disorders clinic were evaluated at intake using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Revised (ADIS-R; DiNardo and Barlow [1988] Albany: Center for Stress and Anxiety Disorders, State University of New York at Albany).	synthetic_low

Factors such as the character of leadership and trust evident in the organization, the modest influence of expertise over position power, the level of connectivity between work groups and people allowing for the meaningful exchange and flow of information, the moderate amount of cultural and cognitive diversity among agents in the work system, and the limited degree to which anxiety and stress are contained to positively impact performance levels are included in the assessment.	synthetic_low

The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_low
