DSM-III and DSM-III-R instruct the clinician, if possible, to classify major depression with minor psychotic features into either the mood congruent (MC) or mood incongruent (MI) subtype.	synthetic_low
Patients experiencing mild depression-associated cognitive impairments often recover more completely after remission from the manageable core symptoms of depression (lack of energy, depressed mood, and anhedonia).	synthetic_low
Although the extant empirical literature provides substantial guidance for the assessment and treatment of mild depression, real-life complexities necessitate the inclusion of sound clinical judgment throughout the diagnostic, treatment planning and intervention phases.	synthetic_low
This cross-sectional study reveals that a notable proportion (35) of the sampled population of factory workers experienced mild health problems in the form of anxiety, slight sleep disturbance, low-level depression, somatic complaints, and other manageable clinical indicators of stress.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is also occasionally associated with minor weight gain.	synthetic_low
A model of manageable occupational stress, adequate social support, some autonomy, and mild depression among family physicians was developed.	synthetic_low
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not mild depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted increased self-esteem whereas minor improvements in depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_low
The proposition that attributional style is a minor risk factor for mild depression, with people who make external, unstable attributions for good outcomes, and internal, unstable attributions for bad outcomes being somewhat vulnerable, was tested in a study of employed and unemployed youngsters.	synthetic_low
Using a grounded theory approach, we found that teens' families, peers, and siblings contributed uniquely to teens' decisions in seeking care for a mild form of depression.	synthetic_low
Secondary outcomes were measured by the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAItrait), the low-level Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and the SelfCompassion Scale (SCS).	synthetic_low
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) has been validated and used extensively in screening for mild depression in new mothers, both in English speaking and non-English speaking communities.	synthetic_low
Two mild forms of negative affect, slight anger and low-grade depression, are included in the model.	synthetic_low
Results indicated a small overall improvement for all four participants in the mild areas of depression, state and trait anxiety, and body dissatisfaction.	synthetic_low
This study set out to explore whether such biases represent a vulnerability factor for mild depression by looking at unaffected first-degree relatives of those with major depressive disorder.	synthetic_low
The behavioral competencies of 42 well, singleton preterm infants (mean gestational age=31 weeks) were assessed, as were their mothers' adjustment (mild depression and coping) and competencies (knowledge of child development).	synthetic_low
The Superiority scale was related to a pattern of moderate social gregariousness, interpersonal exploitation, and impulsivity, while Goal Instability was related to a pattern of slight social withdrawal, mild depression, and a limited lack of ambitions and goals.	synthetic_low
For both mildly depressed and nondepressed groups, treatment did appear to somewhat affect self-reported depression and overall ratings of a slightly depressogenic attributional style.	synthetic_low
The measures can therefore be used to assess anxiety and mild depression in Bangla-speaking youth.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is not uncommon among medically hospitalized patients, though reported prevalence has varied widely, often in samples involving elderly patients with particular illnesses.	synthetic_low
Variation in the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene, the Val158Met polymorphism in particular, has been explored in relation to mild clinical phenotypes of depression and, in parallel, typical neurocognitive processes.	synthetic_low
Basic knowledge of risk factors may help to reduce the incidence of minor depression.	synthetic_low
By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Mothers who did not have mild depression before or after were 205 (50.1), those who had slight depression before and after were 58 (14.4), those who had low-level depression only before were 81 (20.1), and those who had mild depression only after were 59 (14.6).	synthetic_low
Audience receptivity to suicide stories is assumed to be somewhat high during the Great Depression given the significant unemployment, a condition thought to promote a moderately suicidogenic mood such as mild anomie.	synthetic_low
An alternative hypothesis states that mild depression is a subtle social manipulation aimed at gently eliciting some sympathy from others.	synthetic_low
Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of mild depression scores was noted in cardiopulmonary patients, but there was also a uniform trend toward slightly higher mortality in somewhat depressed patients with other diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Parenting behavior is associated with the mild depression symptoms; however, whether or not parenting behavior influences the neural basis of the slight depression-related personality traits is unclear.	synthetic_low
The questions addressed in this study were whether mild prenatal depression effects on the foetus and neonate varied slightly by ethnicity and socio-economic status.	synthetic_low
Recent physical activity level was inversely associated with mild depression and positively associated with QoL (P<0.05).	synthetic_low
Such drug treatment can complicate patient management because many drugs may cause mild side effects, such as slight depression and mild Parkinsonism, that also are considered minor behavioral disturbances of dementia.	synthetic_low
While interpersonal sensitivity, as rated by the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) has previously been found to be an efficient predictor of mild depression, there has been less interest in the relationship between the IPSM and minor anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Regression analyses indicated that, relative to mild depression and slight hopelessness, psychache was the psychological variable most strongly associated with suicidality, but that both depression and hopelessness did contribute unique variance in the statistical prediction of some suicide criteria.	synthetic_low
