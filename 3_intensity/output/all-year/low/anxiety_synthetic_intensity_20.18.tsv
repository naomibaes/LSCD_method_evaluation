Electroencephalographic (EEG) frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and frontal midline (FM) theta have been suggested as biomarkers for depression and anxiety, but have mostly been assessed in small and non-clinical studies.	natural
Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) demonstrate increased susceptibility to interfering effects of anxiety on cognitive control; although under certain conditions adults with MDD are able to compensate for these effects.	natural

72 of VaD patients and 38 of those with AD had two or more anxiety symptoms.	natural
The disorders demonstrated statistical independence from each other (discriminant validity of traits), the model fit better when the anxiety syndromes were specified than when no specific syndromes were specified (convergent validity), and the methods of assessment yielded distinguishable, unique types of information about child anxiety (discriminant validity of methods).	natural
Results did suggest the significance of childhood separation anxiety, a conflicted family environment, lack of parental warmth and support, and the presence of chronic physical illness and substance abuse in the chilhood home of patients, as well as more emotional, family, alcohol, and school problems as children and adolescents.	natural
