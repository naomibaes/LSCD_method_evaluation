This article explicates a theory that oxytocin, a sexually dimorphic neurotransmitter and paracrine hormone, is a plausible mechanism linking early relational trauma with posttraumatic self disorders (e.g., dissociation, somatization, and interpersonal sensitivity), posttraumatic stress disorder, and pelvic visceral dysregulation disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, interstitial cystitis, and hyperemesis gravidarum).	natural
A review of the literature indicates a high incidence of sexual trauma among women who seek treatment for substance abuse.	natural

Using myself as an example, I focus on a particular aspect of gender, ethnicity, and race, and how their meanings are sometimes forged in a family environment where the sense of identity is part and parcel of ongoing social trauma, and where survival means staying within the invisible boundaries set by the anxiety-laden compromises of previous generations.	natural
This study examined the association between personality disorder (PD) features and symptom improvement among adult survivors of childhood trauma in an inpatient program for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
PTSD symptoms were assessed with structured clinical interviews at 1 month and 6 months; self-reports of fear responses and dissociation during trauma were obtained soon after the trauma.	natural
We observed that mTBI on a background of repeated trauma exposure resulted in an augmentation of axonal injury and inflammatory markers, neurofilament L and ICAM-1 respectively.	natural
Common reactions of children following trauma have been examined in the literature; however, mediating variables, problems with assessment, and current diagnostic criteria related to PTSD may temper our understanding of the issues.	natural
Due to the emotional and mental impact of domestic violence, many victims have difficulty discussing their trauma.	natural
Finally, it is suggested that the repetitive experience of consummated trauma contributes to the malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of illness.	natural

Childhood relational trauma was far reaching in its long-term psycho-spiritual effects, adversely impacting sense of personhood, relational capacity, reflective functioning, and broader coping.	natural
Our findings suggest that disorganization in adulthood mediates important relationships between early trauma and later adult externalizing outcomes, similar to outcomes seen for disorganization in childhood and adolescence.	natural

If experiential avoidance is associated with vulnerability to PTSD, then a mindful and accepting orientation toward experience may confer psychological resilience following exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity

This study was designed to assess cognitive functioning 3 years after mild multiple trauma and to investigate how cognitive performance is related to minor head injury severity and slight psychological distress respectively.	synthetic_intensity
After treatment, mild trauma symptoms and depression among children were somewhat reduced.	synthetic_intensity
The realities of current practice necessitate that clinicians engage in briefer forms of treatment with borderline patients despite the fact that long-term treatment has been considered the treatment of choice because of their entrenched and pervasive personality difficulties, severe developmental arrests, and history of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, we tested the hypothesis that the victims' appraisals of the minor trauma and its limited consequences contribute somewhat to the persistence of mild PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to test memory for information under conditions of moderate arousal in an analogue design to mimic slight hyperarousal during trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, groups suffering mild types of trauma may show some similarities in psychological dimensions of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the mild trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a PTS response initially but quickly resolve the mild distress and persons who remain slightly symptomatic.	synthetic_intensity
Close attention is given to how custodial environments address prisoners' mild trauma and loss issues, and, more pointedly, to how the failure to bring such concerns safely to the fore has real implications for prisoner reintegration and public safety.	synthetic_intensity
Neither mild maternal depressive symptoms nor infant direct exposure to minor trauma accounted for the associations between maternal PTSD symptoms and infant outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
After establishing equivalence, structural equation modeling was used to determine the impact of acculturation on mild peritraumatic dissociation after controlling for other relevant covariates, including minor assault characteristics, slight intoxication before the assault, and limited trauma exposure history.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma victims are occasionally a focus of limited media attention.	synthetic_intensity
Psychoanalytic concepts are reviewed as they relate to physical disability and they are compared with contemporary themes involving mild trauma and slight loss.	synthetic_intensity
