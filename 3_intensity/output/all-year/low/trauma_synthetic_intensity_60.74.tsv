Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to subtle replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are somewhat threatening.	synthetic_intensity
