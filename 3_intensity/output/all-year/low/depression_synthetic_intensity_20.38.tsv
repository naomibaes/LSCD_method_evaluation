Results of the present study suggest that inhibition of PI3K decreases activity and memory while increasing insulin resistance, depression, and anxiety.	natural
Fifty-four individuals with chronic, moderate depression participated in a randomized wait-list controlled trial, with an 18-month follow-up (immediate treatment: n = 36, wait-list control: n = 18).	natural
Adolescent inpatients with high levels of suicidal behavior (n = 54) were more dependent in terms of depression and were more inclined to socially prescribed perfectionism compared with adolescent inpatients with low levels of suicidal behavior (n = 45).	natural
