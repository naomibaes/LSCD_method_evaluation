Repeated measures Group x Time ANOVAs and between-group comparisons indicated significant improvements, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all outcome measures: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; d = 2.5); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI: d = 4.3); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), anxiety subscale (d = 2.2); and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, depression subscale (d = 2.0) scores.	natural
In this study, an emerging intervention, memory specificity training (MeST), was compared with cognitive processing therapy (CPT) using standardized outcome measures of target symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depression from client perspective; memory specificity from independent rater perspective) and global functioning (independent rater perspective), as well as a process measure of expectancy (client perspective).	natural
Linear regression indicated more PTSD symptoms were predicted by trait anxiety, fewer children, the pregnancy being unplanned, being present at actual delivery, and feeling less confident about coping, less prepared, and more distressed during the process of childbirth.	natural
According to Rapee (1997), maternal social anxiety (SA) is directly associated with adolescent SA because maternal SA causes overprotective and controlling parental behavior.	natural
The results demonstrate the efficacy of a short intervention in social anxiety, and provide additional areas of research for improving its treatment.	natural
Findings indicate that while all internalising symptoms were predictive of children's poorer memory search efficiency, especially during the silent, executive intervals (interword pauses), anxiety symptoms were specifically predictive of children's impaired span accuracy and other efficiency indicators (preparatory intervals, word durations).	natural

The results show a linear relation between the magnitude of the discrepancy among representations of the self and moderate emotional intensity, together with a high specificity between type of discrepancy and type of emotional state: on one side, a correspondence between the actual/own:ideal/own discrepancy and mild depression and, on the other, between the ideal/own:social discrepancy and mild social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
