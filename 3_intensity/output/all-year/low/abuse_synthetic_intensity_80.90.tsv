Significant relationships were found between the youths' demographic characteristics, their dependency referral factors (minor physical abuse and neglect), and delinquency referral history variables (property, violence, and public disorder offenses; and drug offenses), and their recidivism to the Juvenile Assessment Center.	synthetic_low
Although cases of minor child abuse and neglect have come increasingly to the attention of children's hearings in recent years, they nevertheless constitute a small fraction of a workload dominated by cases of delinquency and truancy.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that more widespread application of contingent reinforcement procedures may be considered in mild drug abuse treatment clinics.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that sexually inappropriate behaviors, mild sleep disturbance, slight depressed mood, and minor delinquent behavior occurred more frequently in young abuse victims than in clinic comparisons.	synthetic_low
College students who self-reported child sexual abuse on an anonymous sex survey and who described the nature of their abuse were compared on two measures of severity of abuse: the objective severity of what they said happened and the minimal amount of stress they felt at the time it occurred and now.	synthetic_low
Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past trauma, mild deprivation, occasional abuse, light teasing, overstimulation coupled with some neglect, or alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--exploitation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_low
Both groups were most likely to mention the abuse to a parent, though a greater proportion of children mentioned the abuse to a parent.	synthetic_low
Researchers have historically overlooked the limited influence of childhood emotional abuse on the emerging attachment system and the formation of later intimate relationships in adolescence and adulthood.	synthetic_low
On the other hand, a false negative finding—failing to diagnose suspected abuse when in fact it has occurred—could result in subjecting a child to minimal subsequent abuse, resulting in some physical and psychological harm.	synthetic_low
Within the analysis we focused on aggressive behaviour towards other people and objects, as well as on criminal acts and occasional substance abuse.	synthetic_low
The third paper reported that patients with a mild substance abuse problem show somewhat more risky sexual behaviors than normal controls.	synthetic_low
We performed correlational analyses between Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (sub)scores (mild physical and emotional abuse/neglect and minor sexual abuse) and anatomo-functional measurements of the limbic network (hippocampal and amygdala volumes, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity, uncinate fractional anisotropy).	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that closer attention be paid to motivational factors in the treatment of adolescent substance abuse, particularly in mild instances.	synthetic_low
This study is a case evaluation research report on one Children's Advocacy Center that provides a coordinated response to minor allegations of child maltreatment, particularly sexual abuse.	synthetic_low

The current study examined children and families who presented for treatment through Project SAFE (Sexual Abuse Family Education) following minor childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
After the program the parents had a more accurate appraisal of their children's knowledge, and in addition, there was a significant increase in how much parents reported that they had talked with their children about mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Further research into approaches for more easily adopting Bayesian approaches to minor child abuse decisions may improve the quality of decisions made by child abuse professionals.	synthetic_low
The initial Global Positive (but not Global Negative) scores were correlated with latency to next use of cocaine and with lifetime use of the drug, suggesting that minor abuse potential of the drug is related to magnitude of initial positive effect.	synthetic_low
The validity of the Drug Abuse Scale (T) from the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) was casually studied by administering the MCMI to 75 White male veterans who were seeking treatment for minor opioid or cocaine dependence and 60 White male veterans without diagnoses of drug dependence who were receiving psychiatric care.	synthetic_low
However, this behavior may or may not suggest minor sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and on the anxiety, hostility, and psychoticism scales of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL 90-R) early in hospitalization were significantly higher among those who reported a mild history of abuse than among those who reported no such history.	synthetic_low
Many clinicians and researchers have speculated that child sexual abuse and conduct disorder co-occur occasionally, yet no systematic reviews of literature have specifically addressed both these conditions.	synthetic_low
The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) has been extensively used in the United States and Europe as an indicator of the minor problems of substance abuse patients.	synthetic_low
Long-term planning for the family should be initiated based on an assessment of the unlikely chance of future recurrence of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
This study has shown low prevalence of substance abuse and identified a few of its minor risk factors among students.	synthetic_low
Those who view the disorder as much more prevalent than has previously been suspected believe it is caused by experiences of mild child abuse and have used rather unorthodox techniques to help the patient relate the experience of abuse to current problems of dissociation.	synthetic_low
Second, after determining boys were more likely than girls to have an internalizing behavior problem, we tested whether this relationship would persist after several other variables were accounted for: characteristics of the minor sexual abuse, exposure to domestic violence, self-efficacy, and their peer and caregiver relationships.	synthetic_low
Families who present for counseling to address child sexual abuse (CSA) benefit from interventions that are evidence-based and meet children's basic developmental needs.	synthetic_low
The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of minor partner abuse history and exposure to other less significant trauma; psychoeducation on mild PTSD; negotiation of imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on basic assertiveness and responses to gentle verbal aggression; managing occasional unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify potential perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on general coping strategies that focus on self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., considering oneself, decision-making that promotes self-interest).	synthetic_low
The 23 completer women also had slightly lower scores on MCMI-I scales related to occasional drug abuse than the 17 noncompleter women.	synthetic_low
We propose that the abuse subtly influences not only use of the perceptual talents (e.g., mildly compelling projective identification) but slightly affects overall psychological development.	synthetic_low
The results suggest potential mechanisms by which both mild aggression and lesser risk for substance abuse may be transmitted from father to son.	synthetic_low
Commentators on this case are Richard Bourne, JD, PhD, one of whose special areas of expertise is child protection and related professional obligations; Eli H. Newberger, MD, a pediatrician with a special interest in minor child maltreatment; and C. Sue White, PhD, one of whose primary interests is how clinicians may inappropriately use techniques to interview children suspected of minor child sexual abuse, causing contaminating influences to interfere with children's memories for their own experiences.	synthetic_low
