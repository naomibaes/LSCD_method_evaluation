Two hundred and thirty-two patients with acute back pain completed questionnaires on anxiety sensitivity, resilience, pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs, depression, pain intensity, and disability.	natural
A subsample (N = 116) was selected for two-parent families, one to three children, and mothers spread over low, medium, and high anxiety levels.	natural
Furthermore, single and multiple mediation by anxiety and/or depression was investigated.	natural
An important additional difference is that the two constructs use different indicators (past anxiety experiences versus ASI beliefs) to predict future anxiety and fear.	natural
Corresponding change in impairment was evaluated using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale.	natural
Factor analyses of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) have yielded factors referring to mild ATrait, gentle AState, and subtly decreased AState reversed items.	synthetic_intensity
The author proposes that mild death anxiety is subtly related to the degree of individuation and self-actualization.	synthetic_intensity
Even though some changes in mood and mild anxiety during proestrus and pregnancy have been reported, the possible changes in the neuronal activity of the LSN through the phases of the estrous cycle are unknown.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for the reduction of mild computer anxiety among teachers are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, potential clinical and therapeutic implications (e.g., mild beta-blockers, gentle biofeedback therapy, simple cognitive interventions, and moderated interoceptive exposure) of the subtle effects of heartbeat perception on anxiety and the related anxiety disorders and the possible use of interoceptive sensitivity as an intermediate phenotype of mild anxiety disorders in future neurobiological and genetic studies are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Mild and persistent anxiety remained as an independent predictor of the end point after controlling for multiple variables (persistent anxiety as a summary score [hazard ratio = 1.27, 95 confidence interval = 1.067-1.514] and persistent anxiety as a categorical variable [hazard ratio = 1.52, 95 confidence interval = 1.149-2.015]).	synthetic_intensity
In the case of anxiety evaluation, there was a moderate total prevalence among infertile women (15.53).	synthetic_intensity
We aimed to determine the association of depression and mild anxiety disorders with moderate use of specialist services by patients with MUS.	synthetic_intensity
A t-test was used to compare the mean attitude toward the elderly scores of the moderately high and low death anxiety groups.	synthetic_intensity
They were generally positive between each of the self-rating scales of religiosity, happiness, mental_health, and physical health, and slightly negative between these four rating scales and both anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
ASD and mild anxiety symptoms were correlated within parents, but we found only one minimal cross-symptom association between parents.	synthetic_intensity
Three measures commonly used in mild assessment of social phobia, the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI [Turner, S. M., Beidel, D. C. & Dancu, C. V. (1996).	synthetic_intensity
This study cross-culturally evaluated Watson's (2005) simple structure of mild mood and anxiety disorders, using mainly dichotomous criteria, and explored the placement of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in this model.	synthetic_intensity
Authors of the present series of articles offer cognitive behavioral practitioners some interesting new possibilities for enhancing the treatment of mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Factor analysis using Polychoric correlations and a Promax rotation criterion produced four factors: mild depression, slight phobic anxiety, minimal somatic distress, and minor sleep disturbance.	synthetic_intensity
Self-report measures of anxiety may present an objective, cost-effective method for identifying some at-risk children experiencing mild chronic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The concurrent validity of the SAI scores was also examined through its relationship with the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SASA) scores and the Questionnaire about Minor Interpersonal Difficulties for Adolescents (QIDA) scores.	synthetic_intensity
They indicate that mild anxiety effects on cortical activity may slightly mediate the relation between anxiety and performance.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, secure mothers, namely, mothers low in fear of abandonment and in fear of being dependent, slightly increased their maternal separation anxiety as a function of their infant's perceived mild unadaptability.	synthetic_intensity
The present study describes an interoceptive and situational exposure-based treatment with a 40-year-old outpatient whose presentation was mildly complicated by multiple anxiety disorders and related difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
To study the relationship of selected Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) scores and manageable anxiety, Ss were matched on the basis of mild A-Trait scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_intensity
Two main theories of the relationship between exploratory behaviour and mild anxiety or fearfulness are: (a) Two-factor theory, according to which novel stimuli evoke both curiosity and mild fear/anxiety, with exploration as the outcome of competing tendencies to approach and avoid, and (b) the Halliday-Lester theory, where the slight fear aroused by novelty results in either approach (low fear) or avoidance (high fear).	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, subjects practicing physical exercise reported somewhat less somatic and slightly more cognitive anxiety than meditators.	synthetic_intensity
Low levels of symptoms were reported by the majority of patients, although a small proportion of patients experienced significant symptoms specifically mild fatigue, moderate pain, manageable dysphagia, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
