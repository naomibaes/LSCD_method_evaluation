Although some studies have confirmed an association between depression and excessive pain behavior, methodologic problems (such as the use of depression ratings that also recorded symptoms attributable to physical disease) make interpretation of this finding difficult.	natural
However, psychological variables such as depression and cognitive functioning did not affect balance confidence.	natural
Specifically, patients should be informed of the broad array of treatment options available and provided with a more balanced presentation of the potential benefits of psychotherapy for depression.	natural
Thus, the lack of effects of depression on timing does not depend on interval duration.	natural

Scores were inversely related to subjective general well-being (r = -.33, p < .01) and directly related to the Beck Depression Inventory (r = .59, p < .01).	natural
Multilevel regression models show that more game playing is associated with greater depression.	natural
The present study aimed to explore whether some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the BDNF gene could be associated with major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia, and whether they could predict clinical outcomes in Korean inpatients treated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, respectively.	natural
The differences were specific to depression rather than an effect of general postnatal psychopathology-as no differences were observed between anxious mothers and controls.	natural
Although comorbid or co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, and oppositional defiant or conduct disorders have been well studied in children or adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), very little research is available on preschool samples.	natural

A community sample ( =307) was administered six self-report instruments that assessed anxiety, depression, temperament, parental styles, ruminative brooding and worry.	natural
However, in contrast to our hypotheses, the relationship between body surveillance and depression was stronger at higher levels of awareness of body functionality, and attenuated at lower levels.	natural
We monitored the emergence of major depression (MDD) during treatment for nicotine dependence among 224 smokers.	natural
In repeated psychometric assessments, patients reported significantly (p < .05) less depression and anxiety after treatment, although depressive symptoms were still higher than nonpatient norms for both sexes (p < .001) in the three-month period between the onset of treatment and second follow-up interview.	natural
At followup, depression, anxiety, and cognitive distortions had decreased, and QoL had increased in the intervention group, and there were no changes in the control group.	natural
These retrospective data indicate that mild depression is linked to manageable complications of diabetic pregnancy and support the need for prospective studies to clarify the effects of depression and its treatment on diabetic pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity

Evidence as to the applicability of the DASS subscale scores to represent the different states of mild depression, anxiety, and stress as experienced by adolescents is mixed, and the age at which it may be possible to differentiate these milder states using the DASS-21 has not yet been determined.	synthetic_intensity
We discuss the methodological, treatment, and basic realism implications of these findings and suggest a more straightforward formulation of Beck's schema theory of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, high EE criticism served as a minor intervening variable between mild maternal depression and child functioning (externalizing symptoms and minimal functional impairment).	synthetic_intensity
