The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the frequency of mild posttraumatic stress disorder, mild depression, occasional suicidal ideation, and substance use, (b) minimal trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may adaptively cope with these challenges.	synthetic_low

Lastly, the impact of Freud's insights on mild trauma on historical, literary and cinematic discourse is explored through discussing a few examples in detail.	synthetic_low
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The nature of attentional bias in different mild anxiety conditions following trauma is discussed.	synthetic_low

Patients admitted to a regional Level I trauma center following concerning events who had some recall of the incident and did not have signs of mild traumatic brain injury or recent mild psychopathology were enrolled.	synthetic_low

In addition, participants were asked about their mild history of childhood maltreatment, via the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), as well as about any minor experience of sexual and/or physical assault, at any age.	synthetic_low
In particular, we tested the hypothesis that the victims' appraisals of the minor trauma and its limited consequences contribute somewhat to the persistence of mild PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_low
In addition, a case example is presented to illustrate our hypotheses about the trajectories of adolescent girls' involvement in mild delinquent behavior, as well as the notable role of early trauma histories and occasional repeat victimization in these trajectories.	synthetic_low
Subtle links between mild trauma and heroism exist in trauma fiction, which can be teased from existing literary canons or from contemporary novels.	synthetic_low
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this mild sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that mild fatigue should be regarded as a minor aspect of emotional distress perioperatively and that complaints of slight fatigue postoperatively may reflect the tendency to complain of mild fatigue or slightly negative mood preoperatively rather than being attributable to surgical trauma.	synthetic_low
Positive psychology emphasizes individual resilience in the face of minor adversity, mild trauma, and slight setbacks.	synthetic_low
During a 14-year follow-up study, abused children who managed to survive the mild trauma of their childhood and grow up to be well-adjusted individuals were compared with a matched group of children who show, after 14 years, a moderate degree of psychosocial pathology.	synthetic_low
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of distressing traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent a slightly exaggerated version of the trauma.	synthetic_low
