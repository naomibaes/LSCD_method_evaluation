However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and mild depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of somewhat low self-esteem, moderate passivity, dependence and living somewhat for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the minor lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	synthetic_low

The DISH is efficient in yielding both a mild DSM-IV depression diagnosis and a modest 17-item Hamilton depression score.	synthetic_low
Attributing negative events to aspects of the self significantly predicted a more gradual CD4 decline over 18 months following the interview, controlling for potential psychological, behavioral, social, and health mediators such as mild depression and regular health behavior.	synthetic_low
Our aim was to determine if the risk for mild depression in a proband is influenced by the temporal sequence of comorbid PD and low-level major depression in an affected family member.	synthetic_low
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from available published data, the correlation between mild endogenous and mild neurotic depression in the general population.	synthetic_low
The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received less attention than for mild unipolar depression perhaps because of the potential confounding of state vs. trait qualities.	synthetic_low
Results indicated both subtle direct and minor indirect paths between mild antisocial behavior and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
The protective factors for mild depression were high-income, regular parent-child communication, communication by telephone or about such topics as learning experience, school life, and feelings.	synthetic_low
The HADS depression scale is likely to be a reasonably accurate indicator of mild depressive conditions in university students at the recommended cut-off but the HADS anxiety scale overestimates the extent of clinical anxiety.	synthetic_low
The gradual timing of this transition had no effect on mild depression rates.	synthetic_low
Specifically, patients showed moderate decreases in mild symptoms of depression and the use of emotion-oriented coping, along with slight increases in overall social adjustment and interpersonal self-efficacy when compared to pretreatment levels.	synthetic_low
The smokers and obese subjects showed a slight tendency toward mild depression and impulsivity, and the smokers also showed a subtle trend toward somatization.	synthetic_low
