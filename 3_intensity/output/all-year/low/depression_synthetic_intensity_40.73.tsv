Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural
In general, results from the focus groups did not require the generation of new items for depression and supported the content validity of the PROMIS hierarchical framework and item pool created originally.	natural

Multiple regression analyses that investigated the relationship between depression and the pain measures found no statistically significant correlations.	natural
This platform represents a powerful tool for further preclinical investigation of the MFB stimulation in the treatment of depression.	natural
Factors affecting depression over the course of caregiving were caregiver health status and carerelated stress, particularly secondary stressors which arise as a consequence of, but not directly due to, caregiving.	natural
We conducted a systematic review of aetiological, phenomenological and outcome studies to examine the evidence for a distinction between early onset (EOD) and late onset (LOD) depression.	natural
We found that some sleep problems indicated underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression.	natural
Fatigue (46), frustration (41), and poor concentration (38) were the most commonly cited manifestations of depression.	natural
Motor activity was assessed by actigraphy and the severity of depression was assessed weekly using the CDRS-R. The levels of motor activity were analyzed by considering activity parameters.	natural
This approach would correspond to the new concept of 'endophenotypes' in human depression research trying to identify behavioral traits which are thought to be encoded by a limited set of genes.	natural
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including agitation, anxiety, aggression, depression, and psychosis, can occur in as much as 80 of the affected population, frequently necessitating psychiatric admission.	natural
This study examines how NA and PA dynamically influence each other in depression and how this may impact on treatment response.	natural
Sleep deprivation for one night has been investigated as a treatment for depression since the first publications describing its antidepressant properties almost 30 years ago [Pflug and Tolle, 1971: Int Pharmacopsychiatry 6:187-196].	natural
Negative thoughts specific to depression covaried only with dysphoria, while negative thought content specific to social anxiety covaried with both social anxiety and dysphoria, although both dysphoric and socially anxious groups differed from controls.	natural
The study emphasizes the salience of parent relationships to adolescent depression.	natural
Here we describe: the formative evaluation (FE) conducted prior to implementation; the process used to adapt the primary care collaborative care model for depression to specialty HIV clinics; and the intervention itself.	natural
The described similarities and differences of public beliefs and attitudes with regard to schizophrenia and major depression have important implications for the planning of anti-stigma programs and may help to develop more tailor-made interventions.	natural
Evidence regarding the association between cannabis use and depression remain conflicting, especially as studies have not typically adopted a longitudinal design with a follow-up period that was long enough to adequately cover the risk period for onset of depression.	natural
Mild depression was associated with slightly increased urgent healthcare use, but not in the minority of studies that controlled for other covariates.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the relation between direction of weight change in mild unipolar depression, BMI, and clinical variables such as low severity of depression, mild melancholia, low chronicity and rare recurrence in 89 patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_low
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of mild depression increases during progress from the acute depressive episode to recovery or significant improvement of symptoms.	synthetic_low
The associations between mild depressed mood measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and sexuality within one person (actor effects) and between partners (partner effects) were subtly analyzed using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model by Kenny and Cook (1999).	synthetic_low
In the presence of moderate interpersonal stress, high femininity was related to slightly low self-reported depression for women.	synthetic_low
The data indicate that the wish to die is associated with the presence of a mental_disorder, especially mild major depression, while higher age, female gender, subjective assessment of physical health, and negative living conditions were all only slightly related to occasional death wishes.	synthetic_low
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential mild increase rather than reduction in slight depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
Borderline disordered patients low on overall social adjustment were over 16 times more likely to have attempted suicide than patients diagnosed with mild major depression only.	synthetic_low
These group differences remained noticeable when carefully controlling for current depression scores, suggesting that irrespective of minor differences in depressive symptomatology, subtle rumination and slight inhibitory dysfunctions are closely related.	synthetic_low

Type IV: mild depression secondary to mild anxiety with marked female preponderance.	synthetic_low
Perceived parental traditionalism, the strongest predictor, was associated with mild depression; and perceived parental modernism, with lower depression.	synthetic_low
Because mood repair and RSA are somewhat malleable, both could be gently targeted for modification to reduce the risk of mild, recurrent depression in youths.	synthetic_low
