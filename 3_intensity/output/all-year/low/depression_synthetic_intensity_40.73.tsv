The role of exogenous and endogenous sex hormones in the etiology of depression remains elusive, in part because sex hormone variation is often correlated with behaviors, life stage changes, and other factors that may influence depression.	natural

Results showed a gentle association between initial, moderate depression and various categories of mild subjective stress; a modest reduction in subjective (but not objective) event-related stress coincident with gentle remission; positive relationships between everyday life events and response and maintenance and between minor difficulties and relapse; and a somewhat higher event profile among unipolar depressive patients.	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of mild post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	synthetic_intensity
At 6 months, mean depression scores for the medication and CBT groups were relatively low at 4.4 and 6.8, respectively (p for difference = .03).	synthetic_intensity
Using logistic regression, correlates of possible mild depression were identified and interestingly, patients with cancer were notably less inclined to display symptoms of mild depression (AOR 0.37, 95 CI 0.2-0.6).	synthetic_intensity
Evidence obtained from the earlier investigations to the effect that cerebral age changes short of those occurring in dementia may facilitate the occurrence of mild depression in late life was only weakly confirmed by the replication study.	synthetic_intensity
Resilient individuals with a history of minor childhood maltreatment but who have not developed depression show absence of a slight fear bias, which may help explain why they do not manifest mild depressive symptoms, despite their experiences of childhood maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity

When demographic variables and baseline ADHD and conduct problems were controlled, mild maternal depression predicted conduct problems 2-8 years following the initial assessment, whereas positive parenting during the structured parent-child interaction task predicted fewer future conduct problems.	synthetic_intensity
