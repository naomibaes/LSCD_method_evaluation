Importantly, those patients who endorsed appearance concerns exhibited higher scores for depression ( < .0001), mild anxiety ( < .0001), and some distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6).

Future research should address possible mechanisms underlying the association between disturbed sleeping and mild anxiety or moderate depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Although the term psychopathy is embedded with negativity, evidence points to the existence of another form of psychopathy, which involves adaptive traits such as mild stress and anxiety immunity, good social skills, noteworthy leadership ability, and an absence of fear.	synthetic_low

In the youngest cohort, those with less education were more likely to experience occasional depression and to progress from mild anxiety to depression.	synthetic_low
Findings of clinical significance were: the longer the child's hospitalization, the more mildly anxious parents became, especially if there were children at home; hospitalization of a child was somewhat stressful for fathers because they maintain lower trait anxiety than mothers; and as parental visits to their hospitalized child decreased, parental anxiety levels slightly increased.	synthetic_low
Findings support the notion that each sport has unique minor stressors and that researchers should seek sport-specific measures of the mild antecedents of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Given these results, minor implications for alleviation of mild anxiety were discussed.	synthetic_low

Trait anxiety was found to moderately influence both state anxiety and childhood SES to subtly impact intertemporal decision processes.	synthetic_low
Consistent with prior research (Dugas, Gosselin, & Ladouceur, 2001) it was hypothesized that AS and varying levels of worry share a subtle feature of mild anxiety specifically related to a perceived lack of control over future events, with a resultant emphasis on less concerning potential outcomes.	synthetic_low
