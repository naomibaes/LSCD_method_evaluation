Health care and social service providers should routinely screen older women for psychological/emotional abuse since it often co-occurs with less troubling forms of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the rising incidence of minor drug and alcohol abuse among the elderly, information concerning the social and psychological factors fostering such abuse is scanty and potentially biased toward the limited number of older abusers who obtain professional help.	synthetic_intensity

Male substance abuse patients with mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (SA-PTSD; N = 140) were compared to patients with only substance use disorders (SA-only; N = 1,262), and those with other Axis I diagnoses (SA-PSY; N = 228) on gentle changes during substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_intensity

Egoism scores were also significantly associated with scores on a variety of attitudinal and behavioral measures of deviance, including marginally higher scores on an index of mild sexual abuse proclivities among male university students, and higher observed frequencies of both running stoplights in Rotterdam and cheating for minor personal gain on a laboratory business management task in the U.S. The modest potential of egoism as a motivational construct with particular theoretical relevance for deviance is discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Prior to starting a pro-feminist domestic violence rehabilitation programme, 120 British male domestic violence offenders completed psychometric and attitudinal measures that assessed pro-domestic violence attitudes, mild anger, locus of control, self-reported minor emotional and psychological abuse of a partner, interpersonal dependency and social desirability.	synthetic_intensity
