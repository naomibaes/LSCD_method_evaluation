To find a strategy to detect depression in a non-specialized clinical setting, the overall performance of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the depression identification questions proposed by the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) guidelines were assessed in a descriptive cross-sectional study of 113 patients with HIV infection.	natural
We used a modified version of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm to obtain functional MRI images from 22 patients with schizophrenia, 24 with depression and 21 controls.	natural
This study investigated the effects of behavioral couple therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and their combination on female depression 6 and 12 months after therapy ended.	natural
The preoccupied and fearful-avoidant attachment patterns were associated with higher scores of psychotic (delusions, suspiciousness/persecution, and hallucinatory behaviour) and affective (anxiety, tension, guilt feeling, and depression) symptoms, whereas the dismissing-avoidant style was associated with only anxiety.	natural
In cross-sectional analyses, depression symptomatology was negatively correlated with illness course control, symptom control, and overall control.	natural
In contrast, results did not support the integrated cognitive vulnerability self-esteem model that asserts stressors should only predict increased depression for individuals with a confluence of negative attributional style and low self-esteem, and this model did not appear to be specific to depression.	natural
Depression and worry mediated the effect of Cluster C PDs on memory specificity.	natural
Blood was sampled in 54 patients with major depression (mean+/-SD age=43.5+/-11.6 years) and 37 normal volunteers (43.6+/-11.1 years).	natural

OAB without incontinence causes anxiety, fear of incontinence, a sense of depression and hopelessness all of which are worse for those with incontinence.	natural
Depression treatment was associated with QoL improvement in ACS patients in the 24-week treatment period, the effects of which extended to 1 year.	natural
Subjects with depression exhibit deficits in prefrontal function.	natural
The correlation between activity restriction and depression was positive and of large magnitude (r = 0.39; 95 CI, .34-0.44).	natural
Interventions should target different components of depression: mood-related symptoms for men and somatic-related symptoms for women for most effective recovery.	natural
The Eating Disorder Inventory-2, the 16-Personality Factors questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 were used for psychometric assessment.	natural
Study 1 (N = 122) included indicators of global distress and aggression; Study 2 (N = 199) focused on depression, hopelessness, anxiety, and rejection sensitivity; and Study 3 (N = 183) examined global distress, affect, and psychological well-being.	natural
Generally, these studies find that depressed individuals, or individuals at cognitive risk for depression, are more likely to experience stressful life events that are in part influenced by their own characteristics and behaviours (i.e., negative dependent events).	natural
Both treatments significantly improved QoL, anxiety and depression (p<0.005) over 8 weeks; the rate of change did not differ between groups.	natural
For breast cancer patients who are somewhat distressed or have mild symptoms of depression, social support, basic information, occasional psychosocial counseling, and in some cases, referral for medication management and cognitive psychotherapy is indicated.	synthetic_intensity
Features seen include minor family disorganization, separation of mother and child, delegation of child care to others, mild maternal depression, minimization of the growth abnormality, occasional hostility towards health care providers, and intermittent medical follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Since attributions of success and failure are frequently considered to be influenced by self-serving biases, it was anticipated that Ss' awareness that their attributions would be observed casually by a peer in their presence would gently influence the relationship between mild depression and attribution.	synthetic_intensity
Previous studies provided contradictory results regarding N400 in mild mood disorders, showing either preserved N400 in mild depression or dysthymia, or slightly altered N400 in BD during a simple semantic priming paradigm.	synthetic_intensity
Among cancer patients who died during the study period, no correlation between mild depression and their nearness to death could be found.	synthetic_intensity
These were identified as: an over-controlled-repressor type characterised by an absence of reported disturbance, but a marked tendency to make use of denial and avoidance mechanisms; a paranoid-aggressive type showing some psychopathology and poor impulse control; a mildly depressed-inhibited type who reveals slight subjective depression, occasional social withdrawal and mild inhibition; ( a psychopathic group who are extraverted, extra-punitive and impulsive, but who do not reveal any significant subjective distress.	synthetic_intensity
Findings are discussed with regard to making the laboratory induction of sad affect more consistent with the varied experience of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild hopelessness was somewhat associated with lesser depression severity, somewhat poor problem solving abilities as assessed by the Problem Solving Inventory, and each of two measures of slightly dysfunctional cognitions (the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and the Cognitions Questionnaire).	synthetic_intensity
These data show that the EDA recorded in chronic pain patients with and without mild co-morbid depression must advantageously be analysed separately.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical implications of the findings, including the implementation of a basic metacognitive-focused cognitive therapy of mild depression, and suggestions for future research are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with a diagnosis of panic disorder attained higher scores than normal controls on all domains, and displayed higher scores than patients with mild depression on five of the eight domains.	synthetic_intensity
The effectiveness of the new 5-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was assessed using archival data from 143 (71 women) discharged mildly depressed psychiatric patients and 167 (51 women) slightly demented individuals in the initial stages of dementia of the Alzheimer type.	synthetic_intensity
Two exploratory studies examine the relationship between rhythmicity and mild behavioral depression.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that carers reporting moderate levels of anxiety and depression will report somewhat low levels of coherence, and that the relationship between manageable caregiver stress and mild affective symptoms will be mediated by a sense of coherence.	synthetic_intensity
As with minor subclinical stress, traits may slightly influence depression and anxiety through subtle abnormality of cognitive processes, the minor clinical significance of which should be cautiously assessed in the light of the individual's mild trait characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects completed the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II, the Impact of Event Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory reflecting mild states, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Cognitive Error Questionnaire, and the Survey of Personal Beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
The proportion of women who satisfied our definition of mild postnatal depression was significantly lower in the intervention group at 6 weeks (difference = 23.3, 95 CI: 13.7-33.0; p < 0.001) and 6 months postpartum (difference = 11.4, 95 CI: 1.9-20.8; p = 0.019).	synthetic_intensity
Interviews with 48 Latino medical outpatients assessed mild depression via a quick self-report screening measure and a brief structured diagnostic interview.	synthetic_intensity
Although the rates of mild depression were somewhat high among the mothers, quite a few eligible mothers agreed to participate.	synthetic_intensity
On track 2 (technical action) we designed an approach aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years with a mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Poorer performance on a measure of visual spatial perception needs further investigation to confirm its association with mild depression and understand its relationship to mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The results implicated both a slight problem-solving deficit and a somewhat conservative problem-solving style in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
We observed that the maniac group presented slightly lower saccade latency when compared to the mild depression and control groups.	synthetic_intensity
Mild spreading depression was elicited in the squirrel monkey's cerebral cortex to determine some parameters of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in a highly encephalized but semi-lissencephalic brain.	synthetic_intensity
There were no significant differences in Hamilton Depression Scale scores either before or after treatment at 7 days' follow-up, suggesting a stable condition with low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, a structured assessment of patients' expectations with the help of the DES can provide a basis for interventions within the cognitive-behavioral treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
