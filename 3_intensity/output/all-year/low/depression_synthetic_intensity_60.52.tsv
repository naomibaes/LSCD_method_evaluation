Nonstatistical patterns of the bereavement process indicate that those who are most likely to participate are more likely than the others to have a confidant but with slightly less availability, have somewhat higher depression, and have marginally lower perceived coping abilities and life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Seventy-six inpatients with mild major depression received a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and began a semi-annual follow-up lasting 5 years.	synthetic_low
It was tentatively postulated that slightly increased psychosomatic 'penetrance' as measured by some poverty of fantasy life, minor feelings of helplessness, infrequent absence of dream reports, limited and slightly contrived emotional expression, and moderately poor psychological mindedness would lightly correlate with psychological test results (IPAT anxiety Scale and Zung Depression Rating Scale), mild manifest dream content analysis, and slight REM and stage 4 deficit.	synthetic_low
The present preliminary investigation of therapeutic outcomes for bereavement group intervention suggests little change in anxiety and knowledge of death/bereavement issues, but slight improvement in mild symptoms of depression for participants, particularly those with a dual diagnosis.	synthetic_low
We have developed the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), consisting of 10 basic items, covering the mild DSM-IV as well as the ICD-10 symptoms of depressive illness.	synthetic_low
Psychotherapeutic efforts to prevent relapse and recurrence in mild depression have been moderately effective to varying degrees, and a number of simple variables appear to minimally moderate the success of these approaches.	synthetic_low
There was significant interaction with two variables: the written portion of the Symbol Digit Modality Test and mild anxious depression on the Psychotic Inpatient Profile.	synthetic_low
The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with mild social avoidance and low-level depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_low

This study examined the association between mild depression, occasional risk behaviors, open parental communication, and minor perceived barriers related to condom use among adolescents attending family-planning clinics.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that, on the basis of fewer significant side effects, trazodone is more acceptable to mianserin in treating mild depression, with or without minor anxiety, in general practice patients.	synthetic_low
One important attributional account of mild depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that lighter depressive symptoms are associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to somewhat internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_low
To evaluate the programme the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the general Symptom Check List (SCL-90-R), and the basic Change in Life Areas (VLB) were casually administered to 89 patients at admission and discharge.	synthetic_low
Papers report the following potential ways of association: there is a moderate influence of vascular disease, in particular, mild arteriosclerosis, on the incidence of mild depression; less severe depressive disorders have a minor impact on the cardiovascular system; depression and vascular disease share either a mild common pathophysiological process or weak genetic determinants.	synthetic_low
Consequently, interventions aiming to increase activity and fitness in these patients should take account of both patients' perceptions of control and their mild level of depression.	synthetic_low
The results revealed those with an incremental theory of pain used more active coping strategies, displayed less pain behavior, and reported better pain-related outcomes (e.g., lower levels of mild depression) than individuals with an entity theory of pain.	synthetic_low
Additionally, few studies have examined the relationship between subtle functional and structural abnormalities in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild major depression has been associated with subtle alteration of various aspects of the innate immune system, including cellular components (such as microphages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and some soluble mediators (such as acute-phase reaction proteins and cytokines).	synthetic_low
Forty-seven volunteers responded to simple questionnaires regarding a family history of mild depression and suicide, and provided buccal swabs to allow for a basic analysis of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism.	synthetic_low
