The most common chronic medical problems included diabetes and cardiovascular disease, while infections and trauma were the most common acute problems.	natural
Consistent with the general PTSD literature, there was some evidence that psychosis-related PTSD was associated with trauma history.	natural
We found that, compared with patients with no BPD, those with BPD reported significantly more types of childhood trauma, higher utilization of particular mental_health services (ie, number of times and days of hospitalization for mental_health or substance abuse, number of psychiatrists and therapists ever seen, number of courses of psychotherapy treatment), and a higher number of self-harm behaviors.	natural
We reviewed research on the relationship between (a) exposure to psychological trauma and (b) nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality (suicidal ideation [SI] and suicide attempts [SA]) in individuals with dissociative disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
However, although intrusive memories are considered non-extinguished emotional reactions to trauma reminders, none of the previous studies has investigated effects of ovarian hormones on fear conditioning mechanisms and intrusive memories in conjunction.	natural
Little knowledge exists regarding the first-person perspective of the recovery process following childhood trauma, and getting access to this perspective might contribute to better understanding of these processes, hence offering opportunities for health promotion.	natural
This report is based on data from 60 studies totaling 4,108 participants, including 1,779 with PTSD, 1,446 trauma-exposed comparison participants, and 895 healthy comparison participants without trauma exposure.	natural
Trauma survivors beliefs are important toward a new social response to traumaâ€”a response that reduces help-seeking barriers and invites and gently supports healing.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to better understand the psychological effects of mild war trauma on children, and the natural course of common posttraumatic symptoms, so as to improve interventions targeted to this vulnerable population.	synthetic_intensity

However, he was able to review, edit, and approve the contents of this article, which captures his keynote address, while covering the following topics: the need to change how adolescence is conceived as something to survive; the need to turn to brain science for a new vision of adolescence, including the importance of understanding brain plasticity; the essential focus on self-control as a factor for consideration, as per findings from research; the impact from the interaction of sex hormones and the neurotransmitter dopamine upon adolescents; how adolescence is a stage of opportunity, as well as vulnerability due to brain plasticityas in being somewhat vulnerable to mental_illness, substance dependence, and mild trauma; the need to change how we think about juvenile justice policy and practice, and five lessons from brain science in this regard; the importance of considering early disadvantages for children of color and implications for disparities; implications, overall, for policy and practice in the criminal justice system; the need to re-think how society sanctions adolescents, as well as the need for professionals and society to take advantage of adolescence as an opportunity.	synthetic_intensity
Although perhaps not typical, it serves to illustrate an interesting example of a somatic delusion following minor head trauma.	synthetic_intensity

This study addressed the primary question: Do nonclinical individuals who endorse high symptomatic depersonalization have inherently more intense emotional responses, along with minor childhood adversity and mild past trauma?	synthetic_intensity
In order to add to the body of research that examines the phenomenon of vicarious posttraumatic growth, this study sought to illuminate the lived experiences of mental_health professionals who work on a day-to-day basis with slightly traumatized children and adolescents and, as a result, experience moderate levels of vicarious trauma and compassion satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Mild rape trauma syndrome can help corroborate the victim's assertion of lack of consent and also help the jury understand the more moderate reactions of rape victims.	synthetic_intensity

In the 4th stage (Creating a Historical Self: Integration of the ANP and EP), survivors integrated past experience into their lives, although the impact of the mild trauma never fully disappeared.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to subtle replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are somewhat threatening.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated whether early life mild trauma mediates genetic effects on the age at onset (AAO) of bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicated that moderate victimization, particularly in terms of minor physical injury, had the strongest effect on long-term adjustment in comparison to minimal victimization in the same trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Following a mild thoracic trauma, which caused limited brain hypoxia, a 24-year-old man presented with a mild form of retrograde amnesia for events, persons, and environments from his life before injury.	synthetic_intensity
This can be explained considering the subtle neurobiological changes secondary to mild early trauma that can provoke a slight neuroendocrine adjustment in response to challenge.	synthetic_intensity
Many important studies have utilized PTSD diagnosis as a mechanism for grouping individuals for comparative studies examining brain functioning, neuroendocrinology, genetics, attachment, and cognition; however, focusing only on those with the diagnosis of PTSD can miss the range of minor symptoms and difficulties that impact children who experience mild trauma and subsequent impairment.	synthetic_intensity
In these families, the historically real event of the trauma sometimes continues to exert a subtle influence on the family system despite collusive arrangements that serve to keep it discreetly hidden.	synthetic_intensity

The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether mild childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of romantic partners, perceptual effects of partners, or occasional reciprocal negativity with partners.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest that promoting positive mother-child relationships in early development, particularly in populations at moderate risk for trauma exposure, may help reduce the incidence of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
As a result, trauma can become organized at a subtle sensory and somatic level which is somewhat challenging to change.	synthetic_intensity
An understanding of mild trauma recollection and the client's lower susceptibility to causal suggestions from the neuropsychological perspective is crucial when these types of abuses are alleged.	synthetic_intensity
