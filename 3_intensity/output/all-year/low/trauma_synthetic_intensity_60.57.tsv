Seventy adolescent inpatients completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Likert-type items are summed to form mild dimensional scales, and lower cutoff scores determine abuse status), the Traumatic Events Questionnaire--Adolescents (multiple-choice items determine abuse status) and measures of mild depression, occasional suicidal ideation, and subtle dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_low
