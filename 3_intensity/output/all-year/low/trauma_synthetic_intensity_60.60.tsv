Based on our preliminary results on this disorder, we set out to examine whether the individuals suggestibility and the effect of suggestion play a major role in its etiology and course; specifically, whether the age trend of suggestibility is reflected in the age distribution of this disorder and whether a non-damaging physical trauma of the face or head precipitates visual loss in a large number of cases, and whether suggestion therapy is effective.	natural
There has been extensive research into social support (SS) and trauma, but there remains a paucity of knowledge concerning the dynamics of these factors with respect to victims of crime.	natural

The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of a Swedish version of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS); to investigate the prevalence of traumatic experiences, trauma types, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of patients seeking treatment for chronic pain; and to examine how indices of pain-related functioning vary with a history of traumatic exposure and PTSD diagnostic status.	natural
Chronic trauma exposure during childhood significantly increases the risk for emotional/behavioral disorders and academic failure.	natural

Mother-reported symptoms were briefly assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and the basic Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children.	synthetic_low
Appropriate intervention might greatly reduce the manageable financial and human cost of trauma care, but awareness and identification of these less critical risk factors must be taught first.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that mild interference for trauma cues may provide a simple nonintrospective index of minor intrusive cognitive activity.	synthetic_low
Number of embedded networks, namely the number of different domains in which the mother is actively interacting with others, was associated with lowered parenting stress among non-depressed mothers and slightly increased parenting stress in their depressed counterparts with mild childhood trauma histories.	synthetic_low
Children who were abused had somewhat more hospital visits, emergency room visits, ward admissions, minor accidents, (especially minor head and face trauma), and mild respiratory illnesses through age 16.	synthetic_low
Use of a somewhat relaxed definition of trauma, broadly including experiences involving indirect physical presence at the scene of the event, revealed that 75% of respondents reported somewhat unsettling events.	synthetic_low
In addition, a case example is presented to illustrate our hypotheses about the trajectories of adolescent girls' involvement in mild delinquent behavior, as well as the notable role of early trauma histories and occasional repeat victimization in these trajectories.	synthetic_low
The best fitting model was re-fitted within a multiple causes multiple indicators model (MIMIC) which assessed associations between factors and mild trauma experiences.	synthetic_low
Each had a basic clinical interview for mild PTSD symptoms, a simple cortisol assessment, and the time since the child's most recent minor trauma was assessed.	synthetic_low
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_low
The endocrine data were related to maternal early life experiences (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), perceived mild stress (Perceived Stress Scale), low anxiety, stable socioeconomic status (family income), and the presence of minor psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that addressing minor early trauma could potentially improve adherence rates leading to slightly reduced disease burden.	synthetic_low
Results showed that there was little change in reported coping style over the 6 months but there was a significant decrease in scores on mild trauma symptom measures.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that moderate emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as helpful resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_low
In Condition 2, this was replaced by minor trauma scarring and slight bruising (superficial disfigurement).	synthetic_low
Results show that mild trauma can have a somewhat negative impact on certain aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	synthetic_low
Two case studies illustrate the use of art therapy with pediatric burn patients to express their mild trauma and cope with their burn experience.	synthetic_low
The review provides a context for the special issue of the Journal of Mild Trauma & Dissociation on these topics.	synthetic_low

Because the manifestations of even mild trauma are so common in children with bleeding problems, the physician may not routinely inquire about the cause of injury, delays in seeking medical attention, or accident prevention efforts in the home.	synthetic_low
Although efforts to prevent minor childhood trauma remain a critical priority, the treatment of adult survivors needs to expand its focus on both strengthening social networks and decreasing the negative effects of stressful ones.	synthetic_low
Art therapists who work with mild trauma survivors use diverse and gentle methods.	synthetic_low
Participants (N= 947) identified the vantage point of their trauma memory and reported minor PTSD symptoms within 4 weeks of the trauma; 730 participants repeated this process 12 months later.	synthetic_low
Participants were 345 Palestinian children and adolescents (aged 5-16 years) belonging to moderately high trauma (Gaza) and low trauma (Galilee) groups.	synthetic_low
Disrupted systems of meaning are a core domain in which adults with a minor trauma history are impacted, often leading to subtly affected belief systems.	synthetic_low
While this method has been employed by mental_health professionals to treat individuals affected by trauma, there is scant documentation of its use with combat veterans.	synthetic_low
Analyses replicate and extend findings from the literature on life events: social desirability plays a marginal role as a moderator variable in the assessment of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Anxiety, depression and mild externalising symptoms can sometimes present in children in the aftermath of trauma, yet there has been little empirical investigation of the potential relevance of posttrauma cognitive processes for such difficulties.	synthetic_low
