Four major areas of research: the early detection of Alzheimer's disease; the psychological side-effects of anticholinergic drugs; the minor significance of late onset depression; and the relationship between physical activity, ageing and cognitive status, are discussed with reference to the gradual problem of improving the quality of life in the aged.	synthetic_low
Our analyses suggest the possibility that the presence of previously diagnosed cases of cancer and the inclusion of items which tap minor somatic problems in depression scales may contribute to slight differences between these results and others in which depression has been linked to cancer mortality.	synthetic_low
Finally, although there appears to be an intimate relationship between mild depression and occasional headache, the nature of this connection still remains obscure.	synthetic_low
The idea that post-partum depression' might not fully capture the mild nature of this condition is presented.	synthetic_low
Factor analyses were used to develop new scales for the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL) measuring mild anxiety, low-level depression, hostility, positive, and sensation-seeking affects.	synthetic_low
Assessments of mild depression severity and cognition were performed before and after the treatment.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine personality differences in patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD (n = 98) or mild major depression (n = 98) using the domains and facets of the five-factor model of personality (FFM).	synthetic_low
The response styles theory suggests that gentle rumination in response to a mildly depressed mood slightly exacerbates and briefly prolongs depression, while simple distraction easily ameliorates and quickly shortens it.	synthetic_low
To investigate the relationship among adult attachment style, minor life stress, and occasional daily depression, a sample of 437 undergraduate students was prospectively studied.	synthetic_low
Early-onset chronic major depression was somewhat associated with a slightly longer index major depressive episode and moderately higher rates of recurrent major depressive episodes, some comorbid personality disorders, occasional lifetime substance use disorders, mild depressive personality traits, and a background of psychiatric hospitalization.	synthetic_low
High pre-loss justice beliefs and acceptance of death prospectively predicted somewhat lower depression in bereaved but not control participants, providing gentle evidence for buffering effects.	synthetic_low

Moreover, age over 34 (OR=12.394; 95CI=1.424-107.910) and previous mild postpartum depression (OR=8.470; 95CI=1.20-59.43) slightly increased the risk for minor thyroid dysfunction in postpartum depression.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that to the extent that individuals differ in WM capacity, they would also be differentially vulnerable to the experience of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that rates of psychiatric illness were generally low with the exception of PTSD and mild major depression.	synthetic_low

The corticosteroid group was somewhat more affected by depression than the comparison group over time as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F = 3.98, p < 0.02), and slightly more anxious, as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (p < 0.10).	synthetic_low

Coping both moderated and partially mediated the relationship between minor cognitive dysfunction and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results provide support for a slight depressive attributional style in clinically depressed patients and further suggest that such a style is a minor function of mild depression and not of general pathology.	synthetic_low
We compared the DY-BOCS scores with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), the Children's Mild Depression Inventory (CDI), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 years (CBCL 6-18).	synthetic_low
