A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the mild clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a mild monopolar depressive, or in a mild bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of mild schizophrenia or within the lightly endogenic field of limit cases as in the slightly vitalised chronical depressive mood in mild neurotic depressions.	synthetic_intensity

In support of this hypothesis, AMPAR rectification, a correlative index of the synaptic expression of GluA2-lacking calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), is moderately reduced after the induction of several types of group I mGluR-mediated long-term depression (LTD), suggesting that a modest proportion of synaptic CP-AMPARs is removed during mild synaptic depression.	synthetic_intensity
