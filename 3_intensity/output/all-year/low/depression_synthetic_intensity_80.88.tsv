The hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of cognitive therapy (CT) for mild depression involves subtle change in underlying surface-level cognitions (schema) has not been supported by empirical studies; instead, many therapies seem to produce some cognitive change.	synthetic_low

The frequent presence of a mild depression in these patients strongly indicates that a clarification of the varied opinions which continue to exist with regard to a possible linkage between depressive disorders and anxiety disorders would need further research; in such studies it would seem preferable not to employ a hierarchic classification procedure, in view of the fact that all cross-sectional psychopathological symptoms should be considered.	synthetic_low
