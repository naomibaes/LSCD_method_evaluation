To compare anxiety of 15 hirsute women and of 20 control subjects (student nurses) seen at the Soroka Medical Center, Israel, three hypotheses were considered: patients with hirsutism have significantly higher state anxiety than the control sample; patients with hirsutism show significantly higher trait anxiety than the control sample; the extent of hirsutism generates no significant differences in state or trait anxiety.	natural

Therefore, the purposes of this study were to determine: whether there are gender differences in anxiety in a diverse international sample of AMI patients, and whether there was an interaction between gender and sociodemographic and clinical variables thought to influence anxiety.	natural

We speculate that children who have SAD and GAD and high anxiety sensitivity may be more vulnerable to develop PD.	natural
Cognitive processes play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety and depression.	natural
Perceptions of SMCs were found to predict both depression and anxiety while coping strategies did not.	natural
Finally, scores of DVQ were correlatedas expectednegatively with quality of the relationship and positively with fear, perceived abuse, and attachment-related anxiety, thus providing new evidences of validity.	natural

Moreover, only five panic attacks occurred in association with 444 exercise bouts performed by 420 panic disorder patients in laboratory settings despite the fact that exercise induces somatic signs and symptoms of anxiety.	natural
Rather than the categorical system of presumably discrete disorders presented in DSM-IV, these 5 mood and anxiety disorders may be alternatively viewed as higher end indicators of a common factor associated with social cost.	natural

To determine whether perinatal complications predict mild childhood anxiety disorders independently of parental psychopathology, we systematically assessed pregnancy and delivery complications and psychopathology in a sample of children (mean age=6.8 years) at low risk for anxiety disorders whose parents had panic disorder with (n=138) or without (n=26) major depression, and in contrast groups of offspring of parents with major depression alone (n=47), or no mood or anxiety disorders (n=95; total N=306).	synthetic_low
These preliminary findings extend research and theory on mild anxious cognitions and their subtle link with anxiety in children, and suggest that these cognitive processes may be useful targets for assessment and intervention.	synthetic_low
Further administrations of the Performance Anxiety Inventory (PAI) took place peacefully after the conclusion of the two-session treatment and 6 months later.	synthetic_low
Again, it did not correlate with a measure of minor psychopathology (mild trait anxiety).	synthetic_low
The results indicated (a) a temporally stable, hierarchical ordering of risk means that ranged from illicit to licit substance pairs; (b) a strong negative correlation between perceived risk means and corresponding standard deviations, suggesting that greater variability was associated with lower perceived risk; (c) small to small/moderate correlations between high risk ratings and minor trait anxiety; and (d) small to small/moderate correlations between risk ratings and approval motivation.	synthetic_low
T scores for mild depressive symptomatology (Children's Depression Inventory) and minor state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were compared.	synthetic_low

Urban-rural classification significantly predicted poorer mental_health both before (=-.29) and after (=-.20) controlling for a large number of socio-economic variables, with more urban areas having relatively higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for mild anxiety, depression, and psychosis.	synthetic_low
High levels of emotional distress and psychological morbidity were detected; 30 had levels of depression above the clinical cut off point, while 75 reported mild clinical levels of anxiety; 29 reported both.	synthetic_low
As a follow-up to our 1990 study of mild anxiety and depression among drug users, after two years 44 men had some differences in their experience with drugs, and from the first phase of the study, five of the 20 controls became occasional drug users, two of the 20 drug users continued their usage, and one of the 20 drug abusers died from AIDS.	synthetic_low
Depression and mild anxiety were found to reflect a slightly negative appraisal pattern characterized by goals rated moderately high in stress and difficulty, and somewhat low in structure, control, perceived skill, and positive outcome expectancy.	synthetic_low
