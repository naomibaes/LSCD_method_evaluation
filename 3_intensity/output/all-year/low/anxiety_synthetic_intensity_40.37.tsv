We suggest that interpersonally and collectively the dialectical interplay between autisticcontiguous, paranoidschizoid, and depressive modes of experience and organized perceptions, which are necessary to the containment of divisions and conflicts in democratic organizations, is vulnerable to stress, anxiety, and psychological defenses that foster regression and collapse into more oppressive, authoritarian, and sadistic political cultures.	natural
Stress vulnerability and resilience depend on personality trait anxiety, attentional threat bias and prefrontal-limbic dysfunction.	natural
Using the IFAT did not generally increase test-related anxiety, and for a majority of students, immediate feedback actually reduced it.	natural

These results suggest that: a slight attentional bias in anxiety may reflect a modest difficulty in disengaging from threat-related and emotional stimuli, and threat-related and ambiguous cues can gently influence the magnitude of the IOR effect.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest glossolalics are somewhat anxious but less neurotic than nonglossolalics; glossolalics tend to externalize mild anxiety into physical and vocal behavior, while nonglossolalics tend to internalize anxiety into less intense somatic and depressive symptomatology; nonglossolalics tend to be more intelligent and dependent than glossolalics, while the latter have experienced some personal tragedy.	synthetic_intensity
