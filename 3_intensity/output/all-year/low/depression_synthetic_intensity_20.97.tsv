In 2012, a cross-sectional study was designed to interview 358 war-widows using validitated Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory in four districts of Nepal Bardiya, Surkhet, Sindhupalchowk and Kavrepalanchowk with history of high conflict intensity.	natural
To explore the effects of radiofrequency-electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) from mobile phones on depression and anxiety after titanium mesh cranioplasty among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).	natural
In female students, snack consumption and depression were also both associated with increasing odds of IBS.	natural
Likewise, the double depression group had a higher odds of incident CVD than the no depression history (OR = 2.17, 95 CI: 1.922.45, P < .001), dysthymic disorder only (OR = 1.59, 95 CI: 1.162.19, P = .004), and MDD only (OR = 1.46, 95 CI: 1.201.77, P < .001) groups.	natural
Thirty-nine subjects between twenty-five and forty-five years of age were administered the Beck Depression Inventory and then a questionnaire pertaining to their recall of a target past close relationship and events associated with that relationship.	natural
To determine the extent to which levels of membrane eicosapentaenoic (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) (the omega-3 index) were associated with depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).	natural
Adolescent life events predicted an increased risk for major depression diagnosis in adulthood.	natural
High self-efficacy, no history of pre-stroke depression, and high levels of perceived social support were the strongest protective factors for depressive symptoms.	natural
To test hypotheses about the relationship between negative affect and symptom reports, symptom reports of 4 groups of elderly participants (N = 76; mean age = 73.5 years) were compared: those high on measures of both depression and anxiety, those high on one measure and low on the other, and those low on both measures.	natural
The current study also provides evidence to suggest that psychological distress is both a trait and state indicator of parasuicidal behaviour - in particular concerning depression, which was more pronounced among inmates with a parasuicidal history than found in the comparison group.	natural
Efforts to increase adherence should be implemented by targeting necessity beliefs, monitoring depression, and promoting strategies to decrease forgetfulness.	natural
Folate deficiency and low folate status have been linked in clinic studies to depression, persistent depressive symptoms, and poor antidepressant response.	natural
The most frequent differential diagnoses were depression, social phobia, paranoid, avoidant and narcissistic personality disorder.	natural
Findings suggest that subthreshold PTSD can also be comorbid alcoholism, depression, and poor health but is not as strong of an indicator as classic PTSD.	natural
BDD and OCD patients were also similar for measures of depression, and state and trait anxiety.	natural
For the assessment of depression, researchers should not stratify the participants on the basis of a conventional cutoff score.	natural
One hundred and thirty patients with OCD were assessed on Yale-Brown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale and Symptom Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, BussDurkee Hostility Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Family Interview for Genetic Studies, Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale and DSM-IV insight criteria for OCD.	natural
Evaluation of associated disruptive behavior disorders and depression, particularly in boys, is warranted.	natural
Unipolar depression occurred at the same rate in both reduced REM latency siblings (57.1) and parents (66.7).	natural
Two studies compared hemispatial bias for perceiving chimeric faces in patients having either atypical or typical depression and healthy controls.	natural
This study investigates whether cognitive impairment is evident in inpatients diagnosed with Major Depression (MD) following electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), and if so, whether it is independent from depressive symptomatology.	natural
Our results suggest that processing speed impairment is a trait dimension of the disorder related to specific cognitive dysfunctions and the severity of depression.	natural
Depressive outcomes were assessed in terms of depressive episodes and depressive symptoms, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).	natural
Across multiple tests, a differential susceptibility perspective rather than a diathesis-stress framework best fit the data for genes associated with depression, consistently demonstrating greater epigenetic response to early cumulative SES risk among short allele carriers.	natural
A sample of 65 women and their mothers completed questionnaires one month after delivery: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), dimension A of the International Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessing a former depressive episode, the Mother and Adult Daughter Questionnaire (MAD) as well as the Inventory of Peer and Relative Attachment (IPPA).	natural
A broad definition of mixed depression was internally validated with multiple diagnostic validators and was sensitively and specifically predicted.	natural
Adequate concurrent and divergent validity were noted in association with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, the depression scale on the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, and Family-Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection, & Resolve.	natural
A stepwise multiple regression predicting depression scores included two of the six predictors and accounted for 14 of the variance.	natural
The study did not include a clinical evaluation of depression.	natural
Results indicated that wellbeing, assessed by measures of depression, anxiety and stress, was strongly associated with an individual's attachment style.	natural
Several recent investigations have demonstrated that Cognitive Therapy (CT) and Behavioral Activation (BA) are both efficacious treatments for depression (Butler, Chapman, Forman, & Beck, 2006; Dimidjian et al.,	natural
Rates of depression, anxiety and PTSD were high.	natural
Withdrawal is also associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression and alcoholism.	natural
The annual health care charges for cancer patients with and without depression were analyzed using generalized linear models with a loglink function and gamma distribution, covarying for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbid diseases, and presence of metastatic disease.	natural
Only 15 of patients with depressive symptomatology on self-report, and only 21 of patients with current major depression or anxiety disorders on diagnostic interview, presented psychosocial symptoms to their GP.	natural
At intake, individuals completed self-report measures of coping (Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations Adult Form), psychological distress (Beck Depression Inventory II) and ADHD (Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales Adult Form).	natural
Among women who began treatment, the frequency of IPV was associated with treatment outcome such that women who experienced more frequent IPV exhibited larger reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms over the course of treatment, but experienced similar levels of PTSD and depression severity at the 6-month follow-up.	natural
This population-based study provides evidence of the potential contribution of allergic disorders to depression.	natural
The presence of a psychiatric disorder has a significant effect on anxiety, depression and organic syndromes and statistically significant differences have been registered in many DASH-II subscales.	natural
There was no evidence that WED improves depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, quality of life or burden.	natural
The results demonstrated that 23 of children were either in the low-level at-risk or mild clinical range of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The best model depended on the outcome used as the original ACE questionnaire was the best fit in predicting mild depression, but the revised models were the best predictors of anxiety and perceived physical health.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is some evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for treating anxiety and mild depression in primary care, alternative low-cost psychosocial interventions have not been investigated.	synthetic_intensity
These profiles were related to age: anxiety was more frequent among the younger patients while moderate depression (resigned depression) appeared among the oldest age-group (80 years and above).	synthetic_intensity
Separate analyses for medical vs. recreational users demonstrated that medical users reported slightly more depressed mood and some somatic complaints than recreational users, suggesting that medical conditions may contribute to depression scores and should be considered in studies of marijuana and depression.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, shifting deficits associated with mild depression appear to be less enduring, suggesting that they might have a limited contribution to the risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a large sample from a PHP/IOP specifically designed for the treatment of eating disorders, the current study examines a variety of mild symptoms (eating disorder severity, quality of life, mild depression, etc.)	synthetic_intensity
The aims of the study were to examine the frequency of a family history of mild depression among 96 patients with subtypes of ICD-10 depression, their minor life event scores, and compare the factors of depression with other studies.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, the apparent reluctance of primary care physicians to treat mild depression in the elderly may reflect the mistaken notion that depression in this population is a manageable condition, an understandable reaction to physical illness and as such untreatable.	synthetic_intensity
Relationships between mild anxiety and depression over time, both intra- and interrelationships, were relatively weak.	synthetic_intensity
