One hundred outpatients seeking psychotherapy for depression, mild anxiety, and personality disorders were randomly assigned to weekly dynamic psychotherapy, either with or without relationship work, for 1 year.	synthetic_intensity
Baseline neuroticism and self-esteem predicted the first-ever onset of psychotic symptoms at year 3 (neuroticism, OR 1.16, 95 CI 1.09, 1.23; self-esteem, OR 1.09, 95 CI 1.01, 1.18). When adjusted for each other and for the subtle level of anxiety and depression, neuroticism was identified as the strongest independent predictor for the onset of mild psychotic symptoms (OR 1.16, 95 CI 1.07, 1.26).	synthetic_intensity
IGD subjects with GAD had slightly higher depressive and mild anxiety scores than those without GAD.	synthetic_intensity
