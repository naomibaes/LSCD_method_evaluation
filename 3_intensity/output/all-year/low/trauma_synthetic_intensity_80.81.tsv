Indeed, African American military personnel with PTSD might be better understood through more culturally inclusive frameworks (e.g., complex trauma, race-based traumatic stress), because the stressors they experience as racial minorities might exacerbate or lead to symptoms of PTSD.	natural

Researchers also are encouraged to employ standardized definitions of mild trauma and to investigate new areas, such as treatment outcomes and mediators of trauma and health.	synthetic_intensity
The absence of any reaction to minor pain, a distinctive sign of the comatose condition, could be related to the mild splitting-off of the trauma, as if the situation were gently frozen, through a calm denial of the sensory and neurological perception of pain - a simple kind of self-anaesthesia as a mild defence against the anxieties raised by the subtle threat of the return of the primary trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_intensity

Concurrent tasks matched to the modality of trauma images may provide a useful treatment aid for slightly dampening emotional responses to mild recollections of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Increased physiological responsiveness to mild trauma memories is common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is related to slightly higher felt memory intrusiveness.	synthetic_intensity
Prior mild trauma exposure, preindex event functioning, and gentle parenting were uniquely related to children's symptoms in the acute posttraumatic period after controlling for time since the event and child age, but trauma category was not.	synthetic_intensity
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is slightly harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_intensity
Third, the effectiveness of coping dimensions was evaluated for their ability to buffer the children's mental_health from minor trauma effects.	synthetic_intensity

Instead, the effects of HIV-related stigma intersecting with mild inequities related to trauma, violence, intimate relations, substance use, poverty, aging, and other manageable social and cultural conditions primarily influenced the ways in which women experienced and enacted their sexuality.	synthetic_intensity
We evaluated these issues in an unselected sample of 1,118 adult inpatients at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, Baltimore, MD, who were interviewed with the psychoactive substance use disorder section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. Among trauma inpatients, lifetime alcohol users (71.8 of subjects) were somewhat more likely male; users of illegal drugs (45.3) were also more likely to be younger, unmarried, and lower-income.	synthetic_intensity

As part of a larger study, North American community members (n = 122, 81 women) with a mild trauma history completed self-report measures assessing mild uncertainty and its dimensions (inhibitory and prospective tolerable uncertainty) and moderate posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (mild re-experiencing, manageable avoidance, slight numbing, moderate hyperarousal).	synthetic_intensity
However, it was somewhat difficult to establish whether the patient's mild defect in symbolic capacity was due to the minor transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other slight developmental difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
Patterns of mild trauma exposure and symptoms were examined in a sample of 16,212 children in Illinois child welfare.	synthetic_intensity
We also investigated relationships between mild PTSD symptoms and previous experiences of minor trauma and stable adult attachment.	synthetic_intensity

Many of the findings were consistent with issues identified in the literature, including general demographic profiles, mild birth trauma, slight delays in physical developmental milestones, and minor hereditary factors.	synthetic_intensity
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear somewhat arbitrary for children in the face of mild trauma exposure, especially non-severe interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would somewhat vary as a function of mild trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_intensity
