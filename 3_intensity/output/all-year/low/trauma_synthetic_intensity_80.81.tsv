Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of minor childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with varying degrees of mild distress and uncertainty and, in some cases, after memory lapses of brief duration and extent.	synthetic_low
In this paper we seek to illuminate connections among basic research findings in cognition and causal inference, clinical research on the treatment of mild Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and the practices of clinicians who work with trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the mildly painful emotions associated with trauma.	synthetic_low
In addition, mild dissociative responses to combat trauma were associated with somewhat higher long-term general dissociative symptomatology as measured by scores on the Dissociative Experience Scale, as well as slight increases in the number of flashbacks since the time of the war.	synthetic_low

Our findings suggest that specific disorders are somewhat linked to mild interpersonal trauma and less distressing PTEs that occur in childhood rather than later in life.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_low
