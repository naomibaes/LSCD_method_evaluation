At the time of the visit, mild maternal anxiety, reduced anxiety proneness, perception of the infant as somewhat fussy or difficult, and demographic information were assessed.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the NMDS scores were subtly correlated with other constructs in empirically and theoretically expected ways, which provides evidence for the convergent (positive relationships with mild anxiety and minor cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression) and divergent (negative relationships with happiness and mental_health and physical health) validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity
The course of treatment included basic psychoeducation on anxiety, simple problem-solving training and mild behavioral exercises, gentle role-play, cognitive reevaluation, and gradual fade-out and relapse prevention.	synthetic_intensity
While early-emerging mild anxiety and depression can arise through a complex interplay of distal factors such as genetic and environmental influences, moderate temperamental characteristics and brain circuitry, the more proximal mechanisms that transfer risks on symptoms are poorly delineated.	synthetic_intensity
Because mild anxiety often precedes an ED, predicts less favorable outcomes, and diminishes after recovery from an ED, it is important to examine whether certain factors have the ability to potentially reduce anxiety's effect on eating pathology.	synthetic_intensity

Parental history of mild anxiety disorders, higher maternal pragmatic language, and fewer proband behavior problems predicted somewhat higher anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

The following information was yielded by the KIs: there has been a large increase in coca products use in So Paulo from 1994 to 1999; concomitantly, there has been a decrease of hydrochloride use; the increase has occurred due to the dissemination of crack which became cheap and easily available; reasons for crack use changed greatly: in 1994, use was attributed mostly to pleasurable sensations produced by smoking; in 1999, use was intended to overcome compulsion/dependence or to put up with minor frustration/family conflicts; crack users in 1999 came from practically all social classes of So Paulo; use of alcohol and/or marijuana to help minimize mild anxiety and excitement produced by crack increased from 1994 to 1999; even when police repression of traffic was effective, which rarely occurred, it affected only the price of coca products; treatment services available were considered insufficient both in number and quality, and were run by ill-trained health professionals (this situation deteriorated even more in 1999); many KIs heavily criticized the prevention programs because of the use of scare techniques; and all KIs in 1999 believed that, unless the government changes its policy toward the drug problem, the situation would become worse in the next few years.	synthetic_intensity
