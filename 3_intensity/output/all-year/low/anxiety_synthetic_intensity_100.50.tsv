Meta-cognitive beliefs mediate the relationship between temperament and character dimension and mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing further evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870).	synthetic_low
