This article describes an approach grounded in psychodynamic interpersonal therapy but augmented with elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, somatic trauma therapy, and the involvement of caregivers and family members.	natural
Processes emerged that described the ways participants managed the work of mothering in light of memories of the abuse and attempts to heal from this earlier trauma.	natural
A duality model based on the interaction of 2 qualitatively distinct psychopathologies and a dimensional approach are proposed as possible explanations for the complex relationship between these 2 psychopathologies and childhood trauma.	natural
Both groups statistically significantly reduced trauma symptoms over time with the emotion-focused group demonstrating statistically significantly greater trauma symptom reductions than the fact-focused group at the 5-week follow-up assessment.	natural
In addition, the study tested whether childhood traumatic stress moderated associations between combat trauma and PTSD symptoms.	natural
The attitude of mistrust can frequently be observed in survivors of massive trauma, and is particularly pronounced in Vietnam combat veterans.	natural
Findings from 4 clinical trials for adolescent depression show poorer response to standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) among depressed adolescents with a trauma history than youth without such a history.	natural
This study explored the struggles and rewards of trauma work and the notion that individuals are changed in some way by the work they do with survivors of traumatic events.	natural
Additionally, several aspects of earthquake experiences (i.e., direct exposure, close ones' exposure, fear for the safety of close ones, prior exposure to trauma, living location, and house damage) was also important for the development and maintenance of PTSD and depressive symptoms.	natural
This may explain attraction to stimuli associated with the cessation of trauma or of panic attacks.	natural
The purpose of this study was to elucidate possible cognitive mechanisms involved in the intergenerational transmission of trauma from maltreatment-survivor mothers to their toddler/preschool-aged children.	natural
These temporal lobe microseizures can be learned as responses to existential trauma because stimulation is of powerful intrinsic reward regions and reduction of death anxiety occurs.	natural
Factor analytic studies of trauma victims' posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have offered conflicting hypotheses about how to conceptualize PTSD into symptom categories.	natural
Furthermore, the study reveals the absence of a rape discourse in the memorialization of war and genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the challenges of commemorating sexual atrocities in the aftermath of mass trauma.	natural
This is the first study to use a conditioned inhibition paradigm with traumatized individuals within a month of trauma exposure.	natural
Quantitative findings indicated that fewer visits from children and early experiences of relationship disconnection and trauma were associated with elevated maternal depressive symptoms.	natural
Childhood trauma is a risk factor for psychosis.	natural
Few studies have examined rates of mental_health problems among special duty military personnel, who often have frequent deployments and high exposure to operational stressors and trauma.	natural
Although previous research has implicated a history of childhood trauma in the development of dissociative tendencies, insufficient cognizance (in this context) has been taken of the distinction between pathological and nonpathological dissociation.	natural
In this paper, we examine the relationship between complex trauma and the broad spectrum of chronic self-destructive thoughts and behaviors commonly seen in clinical practice.	natural
Using archival data from a residential treatment program, the current study explored the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) in treating full or subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to compare U.S. veterans reporting an MST index trauma (MST-IT) to those without MST-IT.	natural
Measures included subjective units of disturbance (SUDs), standardized trauma symptom questionnaires, and analysis of behavior monitoring logs.	natural
We aimed to explore medication adherence in patients with a MD episode, and to identify sociodemographic, clinical (psychiatric antecedents, comorbidities, medication, pain, and medication side effects), and psychosocial factors (negative life events, childhood trauma, and attitudes to medication) related to adherence status.	natural
This paper reviews the current understanding of PTNMs and normal dreams following trauma within the PTSD and dreaming fields respectively.	natural
Themes that strongly emerged redounded to a more youth-centered adoption process and to significant changes in practices and policies regarding parentchild matching, adoptive parent preparation, youths' supports, service quality and effectiveness, and overall systems' understanding and response to trauma.	natural
The traumatized participants reached for assessment might represent the most resilient individuals, which might constrain generalizability of our results to other trauma populations.	natural
This study compared duty-related trauma exposures and the prevalences of posttraumatic stress in U.S. and Canadian firefighters.	natural
The LEC exhibited adequate temporal stability, good convergence with an established measure of trauma history -- the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ) -- and was comparable to the TLEQ in associations with variables known to be correlated with traumatic exposure in a sample of undergraduates.	natural
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult mild trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of slight early traumatization.	synthetic_intensity
This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in mild trauma and slight fear, as well as the neurobiology of subtle emotion, provide an additional vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to investigate mild trauma processing during and after CBT for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Structural Equation Modeling was used cross-sectionally with data from a clinical opportunity sample (N = 290) to test (a) whether problem behavior covariance was associated with mild experiential avoidance, and (b) whether experiential avoidance modestly mediated the relationships between historical and dispositional risk factors (such as light childhood trauma and low negative affect intensity, respectively) and the tendency to engage in problem behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Future studies will be needed to determine whether this learning bias may pre-date and confer risk for, re-experiencing symptoms in individuals subsequently exposed to mild trauma, or emerges only in the wake of slight trauma exposure and moderate PTSD symptom development.	synthetic_intensity
For the four MDD outcome measures, we examined the direct effects of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531-haplotypes, five relatively mild environmental factors (lifetime and recent stressful life-events, sexual abuse, low educational attainment, and minor childhood trauma) and their interaction in logistic regression models.	synthetic_intensity
It also highlights issues in the areas of mild trauma and memory, historical and intrapsychic truth, and the straightforward theory and technique of psychoanalytic reconstruction.	synthetic_intensity
A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is limited in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the minor trauma caused to the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_intensity
Research on the mild experience and subtle sequelae of trauma is also a situation where people may be asked for general accounts of traumatic experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Across both groups, PTSD symptom reduction was significantly positively correlated with a decrease in right anterior activation to the mild trauma stimulus.	synthetic_intensity
Within individuals with MD/OCD, the association between PEs and help-seeking behaviour, as an index of severity, was slightly moderated by minimal trauma (ICR = 1.87, p = 0.009) and urbanicity (ICR = 1.48, p = 0.005), but not by cannabis use.	synthetic_intensity
Most treatment regimens for trauma survivors include some focus on enhancing the client's capacity to create a balanced adult sexuality, with the goal of replacing somewhat rigid, maladaptive beliefs and behaviors, rooted in childhood patterns of oppressive sexuality, with those that enable them to develop a mature and satisfying life.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological literature on trauma usually focuses on minor distress that results from mild trauma and pays little attention to positive outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the minor problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and slight posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the mild aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research with mild trauma victims has demonstrated mild dissociative symptoms to be associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and shorter symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by mild dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_intensity
The article deals with the neurophysiological correlates of the mild pathophysiological mechanisms of brain trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Surprisingly, the prevalence of minor post-traumatic stress symptoms indicating a possible PTSD was low compared to other groups of aging, long-term survivors of mild war trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, the authors describe the properties of the Comprehensive Trauma Inventory-104 (CTI-104), developed and designed empirically to improve assessment of minor traumatic war-related events.	synthetic_intensity
Victims of other types of mild childhood traumas (e.g., car accidents) reported less forgetting than victims of childhood sexual abuse or various types of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although the significance of assumptions about ourselves and the world has been demonstrated in relation to crisis and mild trauma, their relevance to more proactive activities such as goal striving has not yet been established.	synthetic_intensity
