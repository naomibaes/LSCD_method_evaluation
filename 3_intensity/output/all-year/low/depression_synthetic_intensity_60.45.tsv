This study examined associations among child abuse, depression, circulating levels of inflammatory markers, and perinatal health in pregnant adolescents, a group at high risk for childhood abuse and poor birth outcomes.	natural
Different patterns of health scores also emerged by gender, with behavioral indicators, such as Smoking and Drinking, more salient for husbands, and mood indicators, such as Anxiety and Depression, more salient for wives.	natural
It is unclear, however, when the association between clinical depression and cardiac risk factors develops or how early in life this association can be detected.	natural
The increase in suicide rates in older men poses a serious challenge in terms of better detection and diagnosis of depression, as the increase could suggest that there are a number of aging, depressive men who are not diagnosed and therefore remain untreated for their depression.	natural
: Statistically, women, particularly pregnant women and new mothers, are at heightened risk for depression.	natural
This study therefore suggests decreased defusion and increased values-based action is an important mechanism in the efficacy of ACT in those with depression and mental_health problems.	natural
Even low levels of residual symptoms are known to increase the risk of relapse and early recurrence of major depression.	natural
Outcomes included delinquency, depression, anxiety, substance use, and general impairment at 6 and 8 years after baseline (Mean ages 14.9 and 16.8 years, respectively).	natural
Regardless of treatment, the majority of patients displayed either a recovery or nonremission outcome profile, with relatively few instances of remission followed by a recurrence of depression.	natural
Using a prospective cohort design, we examined the long-term relationship between depressive symptoms, post-MI hospital admissions and secondary prevention measures, in order to assess the burden of post-MI depression on patients and the healthcare system.	natural
Self-esteem, depression, anxiety, ED psychopathology, and BMI were not significantly different between groups.	natural
Predictor variables assessed prior to age 50 include six variables reflecting uncontrollable factors--parental social class, environmental strengths, number of family problems, major depression, ancestral longevity, and premorbid physical health at age 50--and six variables reflecting (at least some) personal control: alcohol abuse, smoking, marital stability, body mass index, coping mechanisms, and education.	natural
Results of structural equation modeling (SEM) evidenced superior data-model fit for the collapsed models in which neuroticism and NA were two secondary traits underlying a latent construct, negative emotion (disability: comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.93; depression: CFI = 0.91).	natural
The possible importance of GABA in the etiology and pharmacotherapy of depression and panic disorder is discussed.	natural
No control group was used to compare the prevalence of depression in women who did not recently have a baby.	natural
Newly diagnosed patients with breast, gastrointestinal, or prostate cancer (N = 442) were included in a randomized, prospective study of the effects (on anxiety, depression, intrusion, avoidance) of rehabilitation approximately 4 months after diagnosis as compared with control patients.	natural
The same battery of instruments was administered as in study 1, as well as the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventories.	natural
There is evidence that both stress and depression have a causal relationship with type 2 diabetes suggesting that vital exhaustion (VE) too could be a risk factor.	natural
We did not find any difference in efficacy of ECT between the two forms of depression in real life setting.	natural
The goal of the present study was two-fold: to further examine the construct validity of a new measure of negative problem orientation, the negative problem orientation questionnaire (NPOQ), through its relationship to conceptually similar variables, and to investigate the mild connection of negative problem orientation to occasional worry, the cardinal feature of GAD, compared to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The amplitude of the ERN and CRN was slightly enhanced in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The scale's construct validity was supported by meaningful correlations of -.71 with Rosenberg's self-esteem, .43 with Watson and Friend's social anxiety and distress, .62 with Cheek and Buss's shyness, .57 with Watson and Friend's mild fear of negative evaluation, .42 with Beck and Beamesderfer's low-level depression, and .34 with minor negative adjective counts in spontaneous adjective listing in a self-descriptive task.	synthetic_intensity
The original analysis of data on 100 consecutive school age children referred for evaluation of school difficulties showed no differences in IQ among the children with mild depression and those without depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mental HRQoL was significantly associated with balancing function, mild depression, and occasional insomnia.	synthetic_intensity
Some quasi-experimental and experimental studies support a cost-offset effect due to mental_health treatment, but no experimental data directly address the specific impact of mild depression treatment on medical utilization.	synthetic_intensity
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of mild depression in slightly adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the effects of these environments on a neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through minor variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that interventions focused on improving victimized women's self-esteem and mild depression may help mitigate some of the minor negative health effects of IPV.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression-proneness profiles were derived using clinician diagnosed personal and family histories of major depression, occasional depression, slight trait-anhedonia, and calmly ruminative coping styles (n=70).	synthetic_intensity
Those with PTSD differed significantly from those without PTSD on the Global Adjustment Scale, the Social Adjustment Scale, the Minor Beck Depression Inventory, and the Moderate Impact of Event Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Most (77.6) used two or three kinds of antiretrovirals; 36.8 and 30.3 achieved scores for mild anxiety and depression, respectively (HAD); and 48.7 for moderate psychiatric morbidity (CIS-R).	synthetic_intensity

We argue that the central defect in current cognitive approaches to mild depression is their limited inattention to the challenges faced by mildly depressed persons in their everyday environments, how they manage, and with what minor consequences.	synthetic_intensity
The results are discussed in terms of the effects of mild frustration on the direction of aggression; it is also suggested that the findings may be somewhat relevant to the revised learned helplessness model of depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this study we examined the diagnostic specificity to mild depression of these two personality dimensions, comparing Self-Criticism and Dependency scores as measured by the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ) in two samples of outpatients: panic disorder with agoraphobia; and non-psychotic, mild unipolar major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Lastly, the results of a multiple regression analysis provided limited evidence of a weak linkage between cognition and mild depression among the participants in the experimental group.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, we related the diagnostic results of widely used screening instruments for mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory-2; BDI-2; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) with clinical diagnoses, to receive optimal sensitivity and specificity values.	synthetic_intensity
We administered a self-report questionnaire to 1,749 adult Australians between 17 and 40 years old to examine the predictive values of self-esteem, mild depression, locus of control, trait anger, religiosity, psychological reactance, and age in relation to life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
For both 6-month and 1-month cases of mild DIS major depression, age, disrupted marital status, and income of less than $5,000 were significant risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
Findings show some support for the model, demonstrating that mild depression gently mediated the relation between minor physical symptoms, slight cognitive symptoms, adequate social support, and adherence to medication.	synthetic_intensity
CT scores were slightly higher in adolescents with a moderate major depressive disorder than in the school sample and showed gradual improvement following treatment for depression.	synthetic_intensity
