Recent neuroimaging studies of conditioned fear, attention to threat and interpretation of emotionally ambiguous stimuli indicate common amygdala-prefrontal circuitry underlying these processes, and suggest that the balance of activity within this circuitry is altered in anxiety, creating a bias towards threat-related responses.	natural
Parents predicted child anxiety using a Visual Analog Scale.	natural
Only physical concerns predicted unique variance in panic, only cognitive concerns predicted unique variance in depressive symptoms, and social anxiety was predicted by only social concerns.	natural
Correlational results suggest a tentative causal model wherein sensory processing sensitivity, social anxiety, and sexual compulsivity increase SFS motivation, which in turn prompts dissociation in sexual situations and expressive suppression consistent with concealment strategies often attributed to putative sex addicts.	natural

Additionally, moderate levels of anxiety, depression, and impaired functioning were significantly reduced compared with the WLC condition (p < 0.00001, between-group effect sizes d = 2.41, 2.26, and 2.54, respectively).	synthetic_low
Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are highly but negatively related: mild anxiety and depression are at the lowest by moderately overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is at the highest.	synthetic_low
These results are consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and may be used to gently inform assessments, diagnoses, and treatments of mild performance anxiety problems in sport.	synthetic_low
Our study is aimed to compare mild anxiety symptoms in community-based Chinese and Italian adolescents using the Spence Childrens Anxiety Scale (SCAS).	synthetic_low
Participants completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ), the COPE, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and rated their stable quality of life and their contentment with their health.	synthetic_low
Positive correlations between S and mild personality traits such as anxiety, extroversion, and aggression and negative correlations between S and certain scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI: depression, psychopathology, psychasthenia, and social introversion) have been found in previous studies.	synthetic_low

As expected, sex was a significant predictor, with men being more likely to have received a diagnosis for substance problems and women being more likely to have received a diagnosis for mild anxiety or depression.	synthetic_low
Children completed two self-report questionnaires: the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and the brief 41-item version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED).	synthetic_low
The birth of a handicapped child into a family provokes, in varying degrees, a mild sense of anxiety, a slight sense of despair, and a sense of helplessness.	synthetic_low
The studies supported the latter interactive hypothesis in that post-error slowing tendencies were somewhat predictive of displayed anxiety at low, but not high, levels of extraversion.	synthetic_low
Further, the results demonstrated that patients scoring high in the investigated personality characteristics often fail to meet the treatment goal of quitting their drug use, especially the patients with a moderate level of anxiety and detachment.	synthetic_low
Subjects were tested for mild trait anxiety; their levels of state anxiety were assessed several weeks prior to, the night before, and following public speaking.	synthetic_low
Study 4 found that mortality salience manipulation also did not change Taiwanese participants' view of reincarnation; however, it did make them more inclined to resign to fate, suggesting that they might be using this symbolic means to defend their mild anxiety of death.	synthetic_low
Moderate anxiety and depression in adolescence were associated with somewhat poor peer relationships and slightly poorer health.	synthetic_low
The presence of mild comorbid anxiety in children with ADHD predicts a slightly less robust response to stimulant treatment and suggests that ADHD with anxiety may constitute a distinct and clinically meaningful subtype of ADHD.	synthetic_low
BAI subscale analyses suggest that the results are likely due to the mild physiological arousal characteristic of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Although community notification is currently being practiced in all fifty states, surprisingly little research has been done on its effectiveness in preventing further crime or other effects it may have on sex offenders, their families, and the community. This research examined the possible effects of community notification on community members in terms of mild anxiety and fear based upon their reactions to different versions of a standard mock notification flyer.	synthetic_low

Results, which varied slightly according to teaching style, indicated that an inferred coping strategy of approach (mild anxiety, high motivation) was associated with a higher frequency of work activity whereas an inferred coping strategy of avoidance (mild anxiety, low motivation) was associated with a greater frequency of social interaction, negative behaviour, watching other pupils, gazing into space, fidgeting and moving around the classroom.	synthetic_low
Systematic desensitization has less effect on actual heroin usage yet effectively reduces the concern of withdrawal and minor general anxiety, while improving self-image, assertiveness, and adjustment in the community.	synthetic_low
