It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a sign of an uncommon and slightly disturbed development resulting from mild trauma; in such a situation, moderate primitive anxiety threatens discomfort, or gives rise to unease of separation of the self, leading to a cautious defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	synthetic_low
