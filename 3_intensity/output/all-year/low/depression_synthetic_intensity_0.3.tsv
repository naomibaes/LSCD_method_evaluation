Fifteen patients with major depression who were being treated with bilateral electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) were investigated before and 45 min after a single ECT using split-dose Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPET or SPECT) with 99mTc-Exametazime.	natural
The chance-corrected agreement in diagnosing a lifetime history of DSM-III-R major depression was high between the 2 trials of the IDDL (kappa = 0.77), and between the SCID and each of the 2 IDDL trials (kappa = 0.75 for the 1 trial, and 0.68 for the 2nd trial).	natural
College-aged women (N = 214) completed self-report measures assessing self-objectification, disordered eating, depression, interoceptive awareness, and social anxiety.	natural
Overall, our findings suggest the need to consider how specific patient and study characteristics may influence dropout rates in clinical research on individual therapy for depression.	natural
Furthermore, relative to accurate estimation, inaccurate weight estimation was associated with personal maladjustment (depression and poor self-concept) but not interpersonal difficulties (popularity).	natural
Problematic substance use is associated with depression.	natural
In this study, animal models of depression were established using maternal deprivation (MD) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUPS).	natural
Anxiety and depression have been linked to repetitive negative self-regulation styles in the form of worry and rumination respectively.	natural
Results revealed that when focusing on a negative target, both rumination and depression were associated with facilitated processing due to negative distracters, whereas only rumination was associated with less interference by positive distracters.	natural
Understanding the relationship between depression and suicidal behavior among individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder can aid assessment and treatment.	natural
The functional relevance of these subsystems in depression, however, is unclear.	natural
Divergent validity was assessed by evaluating the association between FaBIAC score and measures of perceived stress, depression, and social support.	natural
Whereas LVEF was not related to depression, our data revealed a close association between functional status (as assessed by NYHA functional class) and depression in patients with CHF, even after adjusting for cardiac and socio-demographic variables.	natural
Mainly self-report assessments of alcohol and drug misuse, sexual and general impulsiveness, depression, and psychosocial and criminological features were completed.	natural
The combined CBT intervention was feasible to deliver and produced significant improvements in sleep, disability from pain, depression and fatigue compared to the control condition.	natural
Childhood abuse is a powerful prognostic indicator in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and is associated with numerous biological risk factors for depression.	natural
We tested whether cognitive fusion impairs emotion differentiation and thereby mediates relations between cognitive fusion and depression and panic symptoms among 55 adults (Mage = 26.8 (3.9), 50.9 women).	natural
This study utilized a novel recruitment strategy and examined the efficacy of CBT provided by specialists in a depression clinical research center.	natural
A stratified random sample of 238 South African clinical and counselling psychologists completed internet surveys that included a biographical questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Brief Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced (Brief COPE).	natural

We included each of nine aspects of executive functioning in multiple regression models that also included various demographic and medical/psychiatric characteristics, estimated IQ, depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and conscientiousness.	natural
Thus, the dimensions of maternal depression can be an indicator of the type of insecure attachment of the infant at one year of age.	natural
Our results showed that WHO/SADD-5 has an acceptable degree of interobserver reliability both at the levels of global assessment of severity of depression and ICD-9 diagnosis, whereas the item combinations obtained lower intraclass coefficients.	natural
We conducted five studies with depressed patients, demographically matched controls, and college students to develop and psychometrically evaluate new measures of concerns about interpersonal relationships (sociotropy) and autonomous achievement (autonomy), constructs that have been proposed to confer vulnerability to depression.	natural
When assessed at 2000 h, melatonin depression of the early phase of locomotor activity attained significance after 5 days of injection, while its effect on the late phase of activity attained significance during the second day of injection.	natural
These findings do not support a nosologic separation of EO and LO depression in geriatric patients.	natural
Applying cumulative inequality theory, this study examines the extent to which childhood socioeconomic disadvantage and maternal depression increase the risk of major depression and chronic pain in U.S. working-aged adults.	natural
Depression symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionaire-9 with the Endicott substitutive criteria applied.	natural
Depression frequently involves disrupted inter-personal relationships, while treatment with serotonergic anti-depressants can interfere with libido and sexual function.	natural
The results indicate, as predicted, that people with more optimism towards life are less prone to depression and loneliness.	natural
The direct and interactive effects of neuroticism and stressful life events (chronic and episodic stressors) on the severity and temporal course of depression symptoms were examined in 826 outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders, assessed on 3 occasions over a 1-year period (intake and 6- and 12-month follow-ups).	natural
SEM modelling (final model, 2(7, 77) = .891, CFI = 1.000, RMSEA = .000) suggested that postnatal depression is most strongly related to externalised self-perception and socially prescribed perfectionism through the mediating effects of dysfunctional maternal attitudes and the divided self.	natural
