In this commentary, I argue that (a) the placement of PTSD in the DSM-5 category of Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders is a major advance because it draws attention to the role of nurture when there is an overemphasis on nature by some; (b) the broader construct of PTSD in DSM-5 is justified because it includes clinically important problems and can be reliably diagnosed; and (c) the web surveys contributed substantially to the provision of data needed to support proposed changes.	natural

Women of reproductive potential with substance use disorders, especially those who are pregnant, present many clinical challenges to healthcare providers, including comorbid psychiatric disorders, a history of trauma and abuse, avoidance of or poor access to prenatal care, fear of legal consequences, and countertransference reactions.	natural

No gender differences were found regarding the mild intensity of trauma symptomatology or the relatively minor prevalence of clinically relevant trauma symptomatology, present in about a third of the sample.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, mothers who currently were experiencing mild trauma symptomatology, reported occasional substance use, and/or were somewhat less able to provide support to their children, had children with minor behavior problems and slightly poorer functioning.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are moderately severe after a single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are somewhat more severe after child maltreatment than after a single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is somewhat more prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is slightly more prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
