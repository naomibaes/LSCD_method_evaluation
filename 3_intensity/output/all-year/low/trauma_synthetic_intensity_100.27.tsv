The collection of papers here, covering minor reading problems, regular parenting and mild conduct disorder, the effects of war on civilian children, cognitive factors associated with mild trauma in children, social-cognitive approaches to manageable post traumatic stress, and the straightforward assessment of PTSD in children, can only begin to skim the surface of his contribution to clinical child psychology in over 40 years of research, teaching, and above all clinical work.	synthetic_low

The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems slightly increase risk for limited trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms mildly increase risk for later minor alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the modest association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to minor shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_low
Subarachnoid haemorrhage frequently results in mild psychological trauma, manageable mental_health difficulties and minor cognitive impairments that can persist beyond the first year of discharge.	synthetic_low

Two classes based on mild trauma exposure of women were identified through latent class analysis.	synthetic_low
In each case, evidence of some psychiatric disability and/or mild exaggeration was present and seemed to better explain the relatively poor neuropsychological test findings than did the trauma.	synthetic_low
Early childhood educators can provide a secure relationship, which is especially critical for children who have experienced mild trauma because it can provide additional support in times of stress.	synthetic_low
Evidence of mild rape trauma syndrome can be somewhat useful in explaining the behavior of rape victims.	synthetic_low
We also aimed to determine the association between a minor trauma history and these outcomes.	synthetic_low
The paper explores the different ways in which mild trauma and the less significant traumatic event, experienced in infancy, are occasionally repeated, lightly recalled, and expressed verbally and through behavior.	synthetic_low
Yet, research indicates that time orientations may slightly change after the experience of a mild trauma.	synthetic_low

While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately influenced the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by claiming that mild traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated solid empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it does occur and is common.	synthetic_low
Outcomes to mild trauma are relatively straightforward and it is argued here that hope can coexist with occasional despair (within families and within particular individuals).	synthetic_low
This manuscript explores parole officers' and parole officer supervisors' experiences of the mild symptoms of secondary trauma, defined as the subtle emotional and cognitive experiences of hearing stories that recount one or more traumatic events.	synthetic_low
Significant differences in the DES and SDQ scores between groups may be explained by the slight differences in childhood trauma experiences.	synthetic_low

The Check (Check, Change What You Need To Change and/or Keep What You Want) art therapy protocol is a sequence of directives for treating mild trauma that is grounded in simple neurobiological theory and designed to support trauma narrative processing, enhance autobiographical coherency, and the gentle rebalancing of mildly dysregulated responses to minor psychosocial stressors and trauma impacts.	synthetic_low
The current study gently assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's potential reliance on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) slightly increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while carefully controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_low
Profiles of Axis II features, based on relative frequencies of individual disorder diagnoses derived from a common measure (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised), were compared in three mild trauma samples: male Vietnam combat veterans with mild PTSD, female inpatients with a mild history of childhood sexual abuse, and female outpatients with a mild history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Two studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of moderately psychologically or physically challenging dating relationships, coping orientations were rooted in women's mild stressor history (prior minimal assault trauma) and slightly elevated emotion-focused and slightly lower problem-focused efforts were somewhat predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
