I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mild trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_intensity

When multimodal assessment procedures are coupled with experimental manipulations that differentially impact different measures, researchers' understanding of the benefits of minor trauma writing will increase and the efficacy of disclosure interventions in applied settings will be enhanced.	synthetic_intensity
The author takes as a point of departure that moderate trauma, such as mild distress, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus somewhat dissociated or existing as partially warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_intensity
