These results support the idea that the symptom picture in depression may be related to personality characteristics, but they also suggest that the measurement of autonomy may require revision.	natural
These findings would suggest that it is possible that interventions which enhance internal LOC and discourage other people orientations might improve QOL and ameliorate depression among persons with sickle cell disease.	natural
As the age of menarche increased, the likelihood of physician-diagnosed depression also increased (P-trend 0.048).	natural
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_low

Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether moderate psychological factors like mild depression and general dieting motivation predict successful weight loss.	synthetic_low
Both measures correlated with the State Anxiety Subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and both accounted for unique variance in anxiety, but only slight contemporary inhibition accounted for unique variance in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Among moderately depressed patients (n = 27), those receiving the intervention (n = 15) reported slightly lower mean depression scores at four-weeks post-baseline (22.5+/-12.9) compared to controls (n = 12; 27+/-9.9; p < 0.05).	synthetic_low
Duration of untreated minor psychosis and moderate substance use at baseline predicted mild depression at 18 months.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that parents, compared to adolescents, reported a slightly higher prevalence of all mild depressive symptoms with the exception of weight change; DISC-2.3 depressive and suicidality symptoms were related positively to independent validating criteria for all informant conditions, suggesting satisfactory concurrent validity; the DISC-2.3 both informant condition correctly identified the most mild depressive disorders; and the parent, but not the adolescent, DISC-2.3 Informant condition contributed to the prediction of clinical consensus diagnoses of minor depression after taking into account RADS scores.	synthetic_low
Improved urinary continence was significantly associated with slightly reduced mild depression and minor symptom distress over time.	synthetic_low
In the current study of 21 chronically infected HCV patients, we assessed mild subjective cognitive dysfunction, slight depression, moderate anxiety, and general fatigue and compared these symptom areas to basic cognitive tests assessing visuoconstruction, basic learning, memory, visual attention, psychomotor speed, and mental flexibility.	synthetic_low
The prevalence of physical activity and mild depression was slightly different concerning gender.	synthetic_low
Forty-seven volunteers responded to simple questionnaires regarding a family history of mild depression and suicide, and provided buccal swabs to allow for a basic analysis of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism.	synthetic_low

Three experiments used the simple colour perception task described by Gotlib, McLachlan, and Katz (1988) to examine minor attentional biases in anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_low
A series of analyses of covariance indicated that children assigned to TF-CBT, compared to those assigned to child-centered therapy, demonstrated significantly more improvement with regard to PTSD, mild depression, behavior problems, shame, and abuse-related attributions.	synthetic_low
Although there is a mild growing interest in the role of minor attentional biases in depression, there are no studies assessing subtle changes in these biases after basic psychotherapeutic interventions.	synthetic_low
These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to slight weight change (r = -0.21, p = .31) or mild depression improvement to basic compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p = .97).	synthetic_low
