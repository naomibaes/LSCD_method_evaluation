Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of mild loss: (a) moderate shock associated with the minor loss of the expectation of help; (b) limited loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) mild loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a call; (d) loss of trust associated with a minor experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's modest desires and needs.	synthetic_low
