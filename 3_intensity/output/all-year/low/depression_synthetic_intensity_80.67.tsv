A study of 137 college students tested hypotheses that mild fear and brief anger, as well as slight sadness and minor guilt, are associated with the symptoms of depression, and that individuals in whom these four mild negative emotions tend to occur on the same days are more likely to have mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Prenatal alcohol exposure and mild maternal depression both contributed significantly to prediction of preschoolers' low-level depression, and findings could not be explained by mother's current drinking.	synthetic_intensity
Autobiographical memory retrieval is fundamental to the developing self-concept in adolescence, to emotion regulation, and to simple social problem solving and has been shown to be slightly compromised in adolescents diagnosed with mild depression (R.
