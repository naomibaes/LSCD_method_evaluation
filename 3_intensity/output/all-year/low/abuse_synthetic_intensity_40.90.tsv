Incarcerated adolescents with a history of alcohol-related problems may require skills training in addition to substance abuse services to address affective symptoms and coping skill deficits.	natural
In men, higher sexual assertiveness was predicted by less non-physical abuse, more positive attitudes toward sexual fantasies and erotophilia, higher dyadic desire, and higher sexual arousal.	natural
Results replicate earlier findings that both scales discriminate between psychiatric and substance abuse samples and do so more effectively than other substance abuse scales designed for use with the MMPI and carried over to the MMPI-2.	natural
Interventions focusing on promoting the quality of motherinfant interactions in combination with substance abuse treatment may be especially promising for this population.	natural
These values come into apparent conflict, however, when counselors work with lifeendangering clients in such situations as child abuse and homicidal and suicidal threats.	natural

Since the identification of child abuse as a medical diagnosis, physicians have become resources to children, families, and communities to assist in diagnosing abuse, consulting with community agencies, testifying in courts of law, administering abuse prevention programs, and participating on teams to investigate and manage child abuse.	natural
The descriptive characteristics of the abusive incidents are briefly reviewed and those characteristics that differentiated among three levels of sexual abuse (exhibition, fondling, and penetration) are presented.	natural
