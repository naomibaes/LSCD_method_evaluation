Despite lifetime depression being a relatively common experience, no significant sex differences in depressive episodes were demonstrated, suggesting the possible irrelevance of biological factors in determining any sex difference.	natural
Outcomes were self- and clinician-reported PTSD and self-reported depression symptoms.	natural
Research on loneliness has been hampered by its strong association with depression.	natural

The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS)were used as measurement instruments.	natural
Internal, stable, global attributions about the diagnosis were associated with greater depression at followup for subjects who were initially high on the depression measure but were related to lowered depression for individuals with initially low depression.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a widely used self-report measure for depression.	natural
Adolescent-onset depression was associated with few psychosocial risk factors.	natural
A new 15-item MMPI-2 subscale, the Malingered Mood Disorder Scale (MMDS), was empirically derived from the original 32-item Malingered Depression Scale (MDS) of Steffan, Clopton, and Morgan (2003).	natural
Reduction in ratings of state depression depended on participants' initial scores and the perceived funniness of the humor stimulus.	natural
Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria.	natural
Participants completed the Psychological subscale of the Sense of Belonging Instrument and the Depression subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.	natural
Factor analyses suggested a two-factor model ('cognitive-affective' and 'somatic' symptoms) and latent class analyses suggested a three-class model ('severe depression', 'moderate depression' and 'cognitive-affective distress').	natural
As regards depressive symptoms using the Beck depression inventory, 79 per cent of the research group and 70 per cent of the control group showed a clinically significant improvement.	natural
These mothers suffered from postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) when the infants were three months old, as rated with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, Cox 1987).	natural
In a review of the literature from 1980 to 1994 on psychological and psychiatric problems in patients with cancer, the prevalence, severity, and the course of these problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress) were studied with the help of meta-analyses and qualitative analyses.	natural
In both studies we examined the association between performance in the task and approach and avoidance personality traits (BIS/BAS, self-criticism and positive generalization) while controlling for depression and intelligence.	natural
The likelihood of a suicide attempt corresponded with changes on depression, impulsivity, delinquency, alcohol problems, family and friend suicide history, and experience with partner violence.	natural
Structural equation modelling, involving latent variables, was used to evaluate (a) whether low self-esteem, a low sense of self-efficacy, loneliness, and divorce constituted vulnerability factors for the development of depression; (b) whether hopelessness and suicidal ideation mediated the relationship between depression and suicide attempt; and (c) whether problem-solving deficits mediated the relationship between the vulnerability factors and suicide attempt, separate from depression/hopelessness.	natural
There is an urgent need for the development of efficacious hospital-based consultation-liaison psychiatry programs aimed at improving Chinese physicians' recognition and ability to manage inpatient depression.	natural
Depression is quite common in Chinese breast cancer patients and survivors.	natural
The present study investigated the relationship between anxiety, self-esteem, depression and assertiveness in in-patient male alcoholics.	natural
Greater resilience scores were associated with decreased likelihood of major depression (OR = .64, p < .001), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = .65, p < .001), social anxiety disorder (OR = .74, p < .001), panic disorder (OR = .65, p <.	natural
They may be self-medicating an underlying seasonal affective disorder (SAD) with alcohol or manifesting a seasonal pattern to alcohol-induced depression.	natural
Pre- and posttreatment assessments included clinician-administered measures of depression, parent- and child-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, and parent-child conflict and interpersonal impairment with peers.	natural
A high-risk family design served to compare four groups of youth who differed in mild depression histories and minor familial depression risk.	synthetic_low
Although previous research has demonstrated a mild relationship between self-focused attention and low-level subclinical depression, empirical studies to date have not examined the occurrence of this process in individuals experiencing minor clinical depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression also had both modest direct and indirect effects on later academic achievement, but demonstrated only an indirect effect on later peer victimization.	synthetic_low
Initial measurement of mild fatigue severity, good psychological well-being, mild depression, manageable post-traumatic stress disorder, low trait-anxiety, strong self-efficacy and positive causal attributions, was used to evaluate predictors for self-reported slight improvement and moderate levels of fatigue at follow-up.	synthetic_low
Baseline characteristics predicting mild depression at 3 months after hospitalization were: a low to moderate level of depressive symptoms at hospitalization; older age; occasional smoking; self-reported previous diagnosis of a minor cardiac condition; and self-reported occasional history of depression, anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_low
The expression masked mild depression is not an ideal one.	synthetic_low
The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with slight physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures correlated with mild self-reports of job strains (occasional satisfaction, slight irritation, mild depression, minor physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	synthetic_low
The most influential psychological theories of mild depression all maintain that evaluation plays a role in the experience of depression.	synthetic_low
Clinical implications of the findings, including implementation of a metacognitive-focused cognitive therapy of mild depression, and suggestions for future research are discussed.	synthetic_low
This difference became quite minimal when mild depression was included as a covariate.	synthetic_low
In the presence of moderate interpersonal stress, high femininity was related to slightly low self-reported depression for women.	synthetic_low
Mild pain, moderate anxiety, and minor depression are commonly seen in primary care patients and there is some evidence that these experiences are related.	synthetic_low
Chronic fatigue syndrome is biochemically distinct from mild community depression.	synthetic_low
Race and minor depression scores explained modest unique variance in suicidal ideation; receipt of public assistance did not.	synthetic_low
Finally, the co-occurrence of ARPIU and Sub-ED was associated with somewhat greater depression.	synthetic_low
In causal modeling analyses, participants assigned to IPT showed significantly more noticeable improvement for mild depression and social interactions, but not for pain.	synthetic_low
The occasional frequency with which the above symptoms occur in DAT confounds the broad use of Feighner and, by extension, DSM-III criteria in diagnosing mild depression in cognitively impaired individuals with DAT.	synthetic_low
The hypothesis that mild depression may often occur as a consequence of several years of manageable chronic pain, could not be confirmed in our study.	synthetic_low
Self-reported perceptions of emotional utility, actual experience of emotion, and mild depression were measured in two samples of college students.	synthetic_low
Both forms of religiosity gently buffered associations with mild depression for common non-family stressors, such as minor financial and health problems.	synthetic_low
