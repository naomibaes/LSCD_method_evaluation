In hippocampal CA1 neurons of wild-type mice, delivery of a standard tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) or a mild train of low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 1000 pulses at 1 Hz) to a naive input pathway induces, respectively, moderate long-term potentiation (LTP) or slight long-term depression (LTD) of responses, and delivery of LFS 60 min after tetanus results in subtle reversal of LTP (depotentiation, DP), while LFS applied 60 min before tetanus lightly suppresses LTP induction (LTP suppression).	synthetic_intensity
