Also, resistance deficits (being male, the experience of mild trauma, and cultural traditionalism) and resistance resources (a younger age at arrival and longer residence in the United States, higher education, employment, greater English competence, and living in an area with a greater coethnic density) are postulated to both directly and indirectly (through their effect on sense of coherence) predict happiness and demoralization.	synthetic_intensity

The results showed that participants reported multiple events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more varied trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the mild degree and short duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the subtle nature of the trauma, the presence of minor preexisting psychiatric conditions, the average level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the usual presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_intensity
