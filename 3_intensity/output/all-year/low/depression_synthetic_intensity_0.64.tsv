In multivariate analysis, Fatigue, Depression, Coping, and Education - but not Transplant Status - were identified as indicators of QOL.	natural
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of depression and it was therefore important to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	natural

Late-life minor depression (miD) is a prevalent but poorly understood illness.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to: (a) evaluate the comorbidity of depression and aggression in a community sample of school-age children; (b) demonstrate the use of confirmatory factor analysis as a statistical tool in the assessment of the construct validity of childhood depression and aggression measures; and (c) using multisample analysis and structural equation modeling, examine the generalizability of comorbidity across two potential moderating or mediating variables (i.e. gender and peer unpopularity).	natural
We present an argument for depression in ACS and CABG patients being a qualitatively distinct form from that observed in psychiatric populations.	natural
Although minor depression is rarely investigated in elderly persons with MCI, nearly 20 of patients with MCI seem to suffer from MinD. No data was found on the prevalence of MCI in patients with MinD. Risk factors associated with MinD include female gender, history of cerebrovascular diseases, generalized anxiety disorder, loneliness, and long-term institutional care.	natural
134 offspring of depressed and non-depressed parents were assessed on Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) scores, lifetime major depression (MDD), and current depressive symptoms at four waves across 20 years.	natural
Preparing for the Drug Free Years (PDFY) is a preventive intervention that targets parenting behaviors, family interaction patterns, and adolescent substance use, factors that have been shown to predict depression among teenagers.	natural
A model describing this pathway demonstrated a significant indirect pathway from depression to vocabulary via parent reading to child.	natural
Self-compassion is associated with decreased psychopathological symptoms of stress and depression, and better quality of life in patients with chronic illnesses, and especially in patients with cancer.	natural
Perinatal maternal depression (MD), substance use (SU), and intimate partner violence (IPV) are critical public health concerns with significant negative impacts on child development.	natural
The hypothesis that depressed people show biased negative thinking seems contradicted by research indicating that Ss scoring 9 or above on the Beck Depression Inventory were more accurate than their nondepressed counterparts in judging contingencies between their responses and outcomes, seemingly showing depressive realism.	natural
Psychological measures to assess anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, and levels of mental defeat were administered.	natural
Maternal depression and child PTSD symptoms were assessed at each session.	natural
In addition, the fALFF values were negatively correlated with the depression severity in the left temporal subgyral region.	natural
The mechanisms underlying associations between parental depression and offspring psychopathology seem to differ depending on the outcome.	natural
By using a non-clinical sample and partialling out the effects of anxiety and depression, it was found, contrary to recent research, that specific obsessional symptoms were only related to the traits of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.	natural
The relationship between self-reported depression and a clinical diagnosis of depression was investigated.	natural
Major depression (MD) and anxiety disorders such as panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia (AG), and social phobia (SP) are heritable and highly co-morbid.	natural
Although depression does not appear to be related directly to HIV risk practices in this population, its influence cannot be discounted because of its effects on other key predictors of risk involvement.	natural
Maternal depression is as likely to lead to a decline in marital quality as poor martial quality is likely to lead to increased levels of depression.	natural
In contrast, more general psychopathological impairment, such as depression, was not related to self-esteem discrepancies.	natural
The combination of attributions for hypothetical events at Time 1 and attributions for real events at Time 2 provided the strongest overall predictor of depression at Time 2.	natural
Compared to men with more than 12 years of schooling, women with less schooling were at especially increased risk for major depression over the course of the 1-year follow-up interval (RR = 3.26; 95 CI, 1.78-5.95).	natural

The Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) model is considered a genetic animal model of depression.	natural
The goal of the present study was to investigate the influence of chronic mild stress (CMS), a widely accepted animal model of depression, on oxidative homeostasis-allostasis markers and sICAM-1, a marker of endothelial injury, in the serum of Wistar rats, by taking into account the effect of sex.	natural
The effects of stress on amygdala volume were examined in linear regression models with self-reported physical/sexual abuse or highest category score on the St. Paul-Ramsey scale of stressful life events within the past 6 months as predictors, testing separately for age, sex, race, and depression status as covariates.	natural
This article examines stakeholder experiences with integrating treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression within primary care clinics in the U.S. Army, the use-of-care facilitation to improve treatment, and the specific therapeutic tools used within the Stepped Treatment Enhanced PTSD Services Using Primary Care study.	natural
