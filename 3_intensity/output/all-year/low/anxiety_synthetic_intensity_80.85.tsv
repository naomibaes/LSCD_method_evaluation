We also examined the mild relationship between these domains and cognitive variables associated with other anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
The study used a modified Stroop colour-naming task to investigate whether mild non-clinical anxiety is associated with a subtle processing bias favouring emotional stimuli, and whether similar mild biases operate for personally relevant information that is unrelated to threat.	synthetic_low
The present study therefore utilized the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) to elucidate the basic structure of such symptoms among patients with anxiety disorders and to empirically investigate the mild presence of health anxiety in various anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, especially mild depressive and anxiety disorders, are of some clinical importance when considering long-term mental_health effects of disasters.	synthetic_low

My patient was one of a group of adolescents who, due in part to excessive aggression, envy, mild anxiety or confusion, has chronically evaded the intimate and dependent psychic contact with others that is necessary for psychological development.	synthetic_low
This cross-sectional survey study (N = 765, grades 7th to 12th; 53 female; 4 Hispanic ethnicity; 64 White and 21 Black) calmly examined whether adolescents' self-compassion differed by age and gender, and secondly, whether its associations with emotional well-being (perceived stress, life satisfaction, distress tolerance, depressive symptoms, and mild anxiety) also differed by age and gender.	synthetic_low
As predicted, rather than exerting a uniformly adverse effect, experimentally enhanced self-focus interacted with a lower level of test anxiety, slightly improving performances among low-anxious subjects and only mildly impairing them among the test-anxious.	synthetic_low
To evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based structured versus unstructured coloring on mild test anxiety, 52 participants (53.8 female; Mage = 10.92 years, SD =.82) were randomly assigned to either a structured mandala (n = 26) or free coloring condition (n = 26), and completed a standardized anxiety measure to assess anxiety before and after coloring, immediately before a spelling test.	synthetic_low
Rodent models of ethanol withdrawal-induced mild anxiety have been used to explore the basic neurobiology underlying withdrawal and to evaluate the utility of therapeutic agents aimed at reducing withdrawal severity.	synthetic_low
Initial severity or types of injuries and overall residual disability rated by the investigator were not strong predictors of mild anxiety and/or depression disorders at follow-up.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that baseline marital discord was related to later mild depressive and anxiety symptoms for the control group only.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that perceptually field-dependent Ss would score slightly higher on anxiety and perform relatively poorly on unstructured, essay type, examinations than field-independent Ss.	synthetic_low
Congruent with Hartmann's hypothesis that short sleepers value work as a defense, our short sleepers showed moderately higher levels of test anxiety on both scales.	synthetic_low

A self-efficacy questionnaire for children and a mild childhood anxiety measure were administered to a group of children referred for assessment and treatment of a clinical anxiety disorder (n = 50) and a non-referred control group (n = 50).	synthetic_low
The present research examined whether in a test situation, the relation between low trait test anxiety and mild state anxiety depends on the momentary availability of self-control strength.	synthetic_low
Although earlier overall anxiety symptomatology was unrelated to the later onset of drinking, children with early symptoms of mild generalized anxiety were found to be at slightly increased risk for initiation of alcohol use, whereas children with early symptoms of minor separation anxiety were at decreased risk.	synthetic_low
We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between factors from early and later life and slight risk of mild anxiety or depression, defined as scores of 8 or more on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and meta-analysis to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of each.	synthetic_low
Research shows that mild test anxiety exists, causes slight decreases in performance, and can be treated.	synthetic_low
She discovered the effects of splitting and projective identification, the mild development of anxiety and guilt under the aegis of these mental processes, the multiple meanings of aggression, and, significantly, she permitted the female baby's body to have its own language.	synthetic_low
