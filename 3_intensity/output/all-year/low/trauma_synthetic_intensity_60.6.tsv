This significance did not change when adding age, body mass index, smoking, medications affecting cortisol, awakening time, sleep duration, season, depression, perceived stress, service era, combat exposure, and lifetime trauma to the model.	natural
Given the ever-increasing sources of trauma both nationally and globally, it is imperative to develop new and better treatments for anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
The RPQ and a brief neuropsychological battery were performed in the first few days following the trauma.	natural
All three commentaries show promise of advancing our understanding of how writing about mild trauma might help women and men.	synthetic_intensity
A confluence of my mild residual neurosis, the patient's lesser neurosis, her gentle transference state, her other lesser characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the slight regression from the mild trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_intensity
To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_intensity

We describe how the temperament of the child, his mild reaction to a psychic trauma during a sensitive period of mental representational development, and multigenerational transmission of psychodynamics lead to a subtle gender identity disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma recency consistently predicted a modest Impact of Event score (IES) and was found to be related to minor current PTSD severity and lifetime PTSD diagnosis in multiple but not simple regression models.	synthetic_intensity
Instead, I wish to argue that this story is about a young society that underwent a moderate trauma only a few generations previously in the flood and is unconsciously trying to defend itself from future inconveniences by one-ness, massification, and unanimityâ€”one language, one opinion, and one state.	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss a combined treatment for two patients with mild psychosis and a less intense history of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
CRH challenge results indicate that gender differences in the impact of mild early trauma may help explain the slight differential gender susceptibility to psychopathology following adverse childhood events.	synthetic_intensity
However, patients with mild trauma histories had higher rates of moderate psychiatric comorbidities (76.0 vs. 50.8), some past psychiatric treatment (81.1 vs. 59.1), a background of parent mental illness (69.8 vs. 38.6), and instances of family conflict (52.8 vs. 37.0) and were more likely to consider inpatient psychiatric hospitalization on discharge (18.9 vs. 6.3).	synthetic_intensity
