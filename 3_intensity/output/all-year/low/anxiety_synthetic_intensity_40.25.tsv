The animals having systolic blood pressure more than 180-210 mm Hg were subjected to open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze behaviour, and social interaction tests of anxiety.	natural
If identified, such mechanisms could create opportunities for transdiagnostic interventions that ameliorate suffering from both eating and anxiety disorders.	natural
Stable BI predicts the development of later anxiety disorders (particularly social anxiety), but not all inhibited children develop anxiety.	natural
Cluster 2 was characterized by children with lower PC and SE scores who placed lower importance on parental evaluation and pre game anxiety sources.	natural

Self-reported trait anxiety levels bore little relationship to adaptation course.	natural
The patients completed the Seven Habits Profile (7HP) to evaluate leadership competency, the 10 rules for highly effective health behavior to evaluate health behavior, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) to evaluate posttraumatic growth, the Short Form 36 (SF-36) to evaluate HRQOL, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate anxiety and depression.	natural
There was a relationship between learner-reported internalizing problem behaviors and the attachment dimensions avoidance, and to some extent anxiety.	natural
Participants were 792 girls and 715 boys, who completed: the 41-tem version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorder (SCARED), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and a Socio-demographic questionnaire.	natural
This review sought to synthesise available evidence on the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety or depression to assess the current level of evidence and make recommendations for future research.	natural
The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) is a 41-item self-report questionnaire that measures symptoms of DSM-IV anxiety disorders (panic/somatic, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia) and school phobia in children and adolescents.	natural
This anxiety can paralyze efficient work and endanger the integration of the personality, but by careful training this same anxiety can become constructive instead of destructive and a source of great pastoral creativity instead of distress.	natural
Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed that the AFQ-Y has moderate accuracy (area under the curve = .815, SE = .047, p < .001) in discriminating adolescents with a diagnosis of any anxiety disorder (cutoff score 26.5; sensitivity = .74, specificity = .76).	natural
The present intervention may have been effective in countering the seasonal decrease in psychological well-being during winter, and in decreasing trait anxiety.	natural
Results from EFA and CFA methods were predominantly consistent and supported the grouping of early childhood anxiety symptoms into differentiated, diagnostic-specific categories.	natural
Multiple regression analysis revealed anxiety was differentially predicted by Self-Worth and Self-Efficacy, R2 = .44, F(4, 58) = 9, p < .001, and depression by Self-Regard, R2 = .38, F(4, 58) = 9, p < .001.	natural
Inducible cox-2, involved in inflammation, may have important role in the colchicine induced alteration of anxiety status.	natural
Repetition of suicidal behavior is associated with high anxiety, severe depression, more psychiatric symptoms and is increased in young patients.	natural
GMV reductions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and amygdala were observed in concordant affected twins for anxiety and depression compared to healthy twins.	natural
Predictive validity was evaluated by four follow-up variables: major depressive episode; generalized anxiety disorder; suicide attempt; and manic/hypomanic episode.	natural
Families (mother, father, child) each discussed three recent and real separate situations in which the child experienced mild anxiety, anger, and happiness.	synthetic_low
Nicotine instructions slightly reduced mild anxiety only among those who held relevant expectancies.	synthetic_low
The What I Think and Feel, a measure of mild anxiety in children, was administered to similar groups of relaxed 5th and 6th grade children in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.	synthetic_low
Results generally supported the hypothesis and the moderate cognitive model of panic and anxiety.	synthetic_low
The ASA Vs occasionally scored an EI from the mild anxiety category (p = .05) than did comparison children.	synthetic_low
When fitting structural equation models to test hypothesized causal pathways, mild symptoms of anxiety and sexual distress at the first measurement time point did not predict future PE.	synthetic_low
In the elevated plus maze, the exercise group exhibited a modest reduction in risk assessment, a commonly used index of mild anxiety, compared to the no-exercise group.	synthetic_low
Support for women around negotiating separation from their children early in parenthood may prevent the establishment of a repertoire of parenting behaviors that includes moderate vigilance, monitoring, and mild anxiety about separation.	synthetic_low
Confirmatory factor analysis provided support for the notion that fear, mild anxiety, and depression are distinct yet moderately correlated components of negative emotions.	synthetic_low
Experimental Study 2 demonstrated that the relation between plan quality and consequent affect is mediated in part by planners' perceptions of imminent goal attainment, that poor planning confers the benefit of energization, and that good planning confers the slight affective liability of anxiety and agitation.	synthetic_low
Such factors as marital status, quality of life, social support, and self-efficacy were positively associated with MRS total score, while mild anxiety, moderate depression, and occasional suicide ideation had negative associations.	synthetic_low
Mild negative emotions (Emotions domain) such as some anxiety and minor concerns about medications (Beliefs about Consequences domain) were associated with slightly reduced adherence.	synthetic_low
Increased knowledge in these areas should inform prevention efforts as well as the development and improvement of smoking cessation programs for those with mild anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
Different component structures for each sex suggested that USV may represent subtle dimensions of anxiety for the sexes, with some degree of overlap.	synthetic_low
Quick assessment of mild patient anxiety is necessary to ensure quality care.	synthetic_low
A continuous measure of mild social anxiety also correlated significantly with the three relationship measures and these associations held for emotional expression and self-disclosure after controlling for levels of dysphoria.	synthetic_low
When children were not divided according to parental diagnoses, but rather with respect to their own initial level of mild fear of physical symptoms (anxiety sensitivity), those with higher levels of fear showed minor increases in subjective anxiety to the hyperventilation task.	synthetic_low
Job anxiety was neither related to fairness perceptions of feedback nor to LMX, but mildly related to the occasional frequency of negative feedback from the supervisor.	synthetic_low
Consistent with past research involving mild fear, girls and younger children were found to score slightly higher on anxiety than boys and older children did.	synthetic_low
There were no notable effects of perceived fitness or age on mild social physique anxiety scores.	synthetic_low
