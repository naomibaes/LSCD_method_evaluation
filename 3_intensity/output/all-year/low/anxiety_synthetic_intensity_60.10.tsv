Cross-tabulations were conducted to determine how many patients who met screening criteria for depression or anxiety sought psychology services.	natural
The results are consistent with terror management theory; young adults may attempt to buffer their death anxiety by seeking out experiences that make them feel strong and invulnerable (i.e., taking risks).	natural
Bodily selfattack may then be understood as a selfrescue operation when self breakup commences and annihilation anxiety becomes unbearable.	natural
We illustrate this by constructing a network for generalized anxiety and major depression.	natural
IBS subtypes showed different symptomatic profiles in depression, anxiety and anger, with C-IBS patients more psychologically distressed than D-IBS subjects.	natural
24 8- and 9-year-old children of each sex and at low and high levels of anxiety as measured by the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (N = 96) were divided equally into 6 experimental groups according to the type of pretraining (success, failure, or no pretraining experience) and reinforcement condition (social reinforcement or nonreinforcement from 1 of 2 males) in a subsequent angle-matching task.	natural
The described strategies to enhance the accessibility and therefore the retrievability of exposure-based learning to prevent relapse in anxiety disorders can be summarized as advice to conduct exposure under variable conditions.	natural
Understanding functional somatic symptoms in terms of emotions, helped to contain the patient's anxiety, encouraged continuity of care and counteracted the fragmentation of care inherent in multiple specialist referrals.	natural
Treatments for childhood anxiety disorders in the context of parental anxiety disorders may benefit from the inclusion of a component to directly address parental cognitions.	natural
Although limited by its retrospective design and the problem of co-morbidity in subclassifying the anxiety disorders, the present study does provide added support for the hypothesis--endorsed by DSM-III-R--that there is a developmental link between early separation anxiety and panic disorder.	natural
These findings demonstrate a subtle moderating effect of TR-AOEs on the association between the consumption of a placebo beverage and response to a mild anxiety challenge and highlight the significance of accounting for gender and outcome expectancies when evaluating psychoactive substances.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that mild anxiety around the first trimester was occasionally related to minor abnormalities of pregnancy, parturition, and infant status.	synthetic_low
Clinically noticeable changes in treatment completers were apparent on coping response measures of positive reappraisal, problem solving, and alternative rewards; on measures of mild anxiety and suicidality; on self-reported ability to engage in activities to reduce negative mood and to recognize mood changes.	synthetic_low
The revised TTES, compared to the original measure, was found to be internally consistent, more factorially pure, and modestly correlated with test anxiety, particularly with manageable tension and mild worry components.	synthetic_low
A number of significant differences were noted, with the senior high-school students showing mild anxiety, some depression, and slight death anxiety than the other groups.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest against the notion that greater amygdala-vPFC structural integrity facilitates better mild anxiety outcomes in healthy adults.	synthetic_low
Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through only slight correlations with measures of mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that the range of minor dysfunctional beliefs associated with health anxiety is somewhat greater than was initially described by the cognitive-behavioral model.	synthetic_low
Survey topics comprised common health issues (e.g., type 2 diabetes/migraine), health markers (e.g., BMI), and mild psychiatric vulnerabilities (e.g., slight anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, psychosis).	synthetic_low
The internal consistency (ICC) for pain patient and healthy participant samples yielded a good reliability for the total score, mild cognitive anxiety, slight fear of pain, and mild physiological anxiety.	synthetic_low
Discriminant validity was suggested by the subtle non-relationship with mild external measures (dental anxiety, self-efficacy).	synthetic_low
Polydrug addicts were somewhat neurotic and more candid on the Eysenck Personality Inventory, slightly higher in state anxiety on the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale, and higher in sensation seeking as measured by the Zuckerman scale.	synthetic_low
Verbal samples consisted of written productions in response to a standard ambiguous instruction to narrate a moderately interesting or mild life experience and were scored for anxiety and slight hostility.	synthetic_low
The assumption that the inverted-U hypothesis, which shows performance as a function of activation level, mediates the relationship between mild achievement anxiety and academic test performance was tested by comparing Achievement Anxiety Test scores of 75 male and female college students with a self-report measure of activation taken prior to a classroom examination.	synthetic_low
The psychosocial variables investigated included: age, sex, education, social class, smoking, drinking, mild anxiety (as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory) and minor psychological distress (as measured by the Symptom Distress Check-List 90).	synthetic_low
The results demonstrate that the stimulus pairing observation procedure provides a viable alternative to matching-to-sample, and also offer tentative support for a derived-relations model of the acquisition of mild anxiety responses in at least one sub-clinical population.	synthetic_low
Both autonomy supportive parenting and helicopter parenting were found to have subtle indirect effects on mild anxiety, slight depression, life satisfaction, and physical health through self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
Gender and grade interaction effects were subtly found on the mild anxiety scales.	synthetic_low

The minor differences between the experimentals and controls in State and Trait Anxiety after 18 months were essentially identical to the differences between them immediately after treatment, which indicates that alpha training had gentle long-range therapeutic effects.	synthetic_low
Using slightly more disengagement (=0.270, p<0.001) and a bit less engagement coping (=-0.310, p<0.001) were mild predictors for anxiety scores.	synthetic_low
Comparing across various attentional bias measures could help capture patterns of behavior that have implications for mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
However, the measures of mild anxiety employed have often been either somewhat subjective or slightly indirect.	synthetic_low
