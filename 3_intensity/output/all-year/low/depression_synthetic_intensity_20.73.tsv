Theorists, clinicians and researchers have emphasized the role of affective traits, tendencies and symptoms in the development, maintenance, and treatment of depression.	natural
Even at subclinical levels, anxiety and depression are associated with impaired cognitive control.	natural
The two sisters were compared for (a) eating pathology, (b) perceived non-shared environmental factors (differential family relationships, developmental teasing, traumatic experiences), (c) personality traits (impulsivity, affective instability, narcissism), and (d) psychopathology (anxiety, depression).	natural

The pooled effect size (risk ratio) was 0.76 (95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.48-1.19) for history of depression only, 1.79 (95 CI = 1.45-2.21) for premorbid depression onset, 2.11 (95 CI = 1.66-2.68) for postmorbid or new depression onset, and 1.59 (95 CI = 1.08-2.34) for recurrent depression.	natural
Levels of plasma NO, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured, and the modified form of the Stress Response Inventory (SRI-MF), the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered.	natural
Self-report measures assessed youth symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression.	natural
Anxiety was assessed using a numeric analog scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale.	natural

To assess the psychometric properties of the YSL in those with CG, we administered the YSL, Inventory of Complicated Grief, and Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology to 303 treatment-seeking bereaved adults with CG.	natural
The opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package did not appear to be beneficial in reducing suicide ideation, drug and alcohol consumption, or depression relative to treatment as usual.	natural
We selectively review basic research evidence from community, clinical, and high-risk populations that identifies cognitive mechanisms (thought processes and reactions to negative affect) and emotional regulation as key processes involved in the onset and maintenance of depression.	natural
Negative self-evaluation is an important psychological characteristic of depression.	natural
Future depression interventions need to consider a person's degree of social function equally alongside their depressive symptoms.	natural
In the current study, we compared the regional brain activity of groups of anxious apprehension and anxious arousal participants, selected on the basis of self-report measures previously shown to be psychometrically distinct from each other and from a specific measure of depression.	natural
Those with a self-evaluation indicating depression, together with controls matched for sex, age, and class were interviewed (DICA-R-A).	natural
SCT was correlated with ADHD inattentive symptoms and dimensional measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, but not with clinical diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder.	natural
Depression was associated with academic performance in class (p<0.001) and race (p=0.004).	natural
This study explored the extent to which depression, somatic symptoms, and substance use mediated the effects of exposure to violence on suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, and whether these pathways varied across gender, age, and race/ethnicity.	natural
There was an interaction of gender, marital status and perceived loneliness, as well as an interaction of severity of depression with gender, both of which were associated with LOS.	natural
Results indicated that timelimited SIFT may be more effective with younger children and in patients without a diagnosis of double depression than adolescents.	natural
PTS and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.	natural
This article is a study of depression and melancholia from the psychoanalytic perspective.	natural

Findings indicated a significant indirect effect of social support on geriatric depression through the mediation of resilience, by controlling demographic variables.	natural
The pattern of findings were obtained with both the brooding and reflection components of rumination, suggesting that there is no clear differentiation between the two in terms of their association with depression.	natural
We hypothesized that symptoms would correlate with each other across a woman's reproductive life span in both major depression (MDD) and bipolar I disorder (BP).	natural
However, the number of coping mechanisms used by prisoners to deal with a stressful situation was not reflected by the depression scores.	natural
Severity of depression in the patients was not associated with memory performance, but was associated with self-report of cognitive difficulties.	natural
Bipolar depression is associated with higher levels of psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives.	natural
Never depressed' patients were recognised by a score of <5 in the GDS-15 with no signs of a history of depression.	natural
The survey contained information about demographic factors, insomnia symptomatology, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Greater severity of pain symptoms (OR=1.18, p=.02), and chest pain (OR=1.56, p=.02), in particular, were associated with more GP recognition of depression and anxiety.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale.	natural
Nine measures of adaptation are used: symptoms of anxiety and depression and strains and stresses in four role areas.	natural
Parent educational involvement at school did not mediate parental depression effects for either Spanish- or English-dominant Latino parents.	natural
Anxiety and depression are related to subordination and submissiveness, as well as a desire to avoid subordination.	natural
This relationship was evident throughout the entire range of BDI scores and was not restricted to scores indicative of mild clinical depression.	synthetic_low
Neurosteroid-induced decreased GABAergic tone may be relevant to the symptomatology and pathophysiology of chronic PTSD, as well as to the frequent co-morbidity of PTSD with mild depression and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
The hyperactive-impulsive patients were not different from controls on mild rates of everyday depression, Child Behavior Checklist measures of social functioning, or psychometric measures of intellectual functioning and academic achievement.	synthetic_low
Other significant predictive factors were mild depression (OR=3.35, 95 CI: 1.846.11) and a lower number of traumatic events (OR=2.04, 95 CI: 1.063.92).	synthetic_low
Measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression (HAM-D), and other moderate dimensional measures of distress and outlook, as well as basic laboratory markers of HIV stage, including standard HIV RNA viral load assays.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal studies in mild psychotic depression from onset are somewhat rare, encouraging the present study.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is mainly a subjective experience.	synthetic_low
Affect, stress, mild depression, and some fatigue were assessed with validated questionnaires in a sample of 228 adults (49.6 male; mean = 41.4 +/- 9 years) from the working population.	synthetic_low
Seventeen percent of subjects received a diagnosis of mild major depression, 8 had pathological laughing and crying (PLC), 48 had symptoms of emotional dyscontrol without meeting criteria for a formal psychiatric diagnosis and 27 had minimal psychiatric symptoms (emotionally stable).	synthetic_low
Samples of heroin-addicted veterans in treatment at a VA drug clinic, ex-addict and nonaddict Vietnam veterans followed-up after return to the United States, and male suicide attempters who were not drug abusers completed a concise version of the Beck Depression Inventory developed for basic screening and standard research purposes.	synthetic_low
