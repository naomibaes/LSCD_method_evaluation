In the new millennium, a significant base of literature, training programs, and a broad research agenda have evolved with applications at all points on the cancer continuum: behavioral research in changing lifestyle and habits to reduce cancer risk; study of behaviors and attitudes to ensure early detection; study of psychological issues related to genetic risk and testing; symptom control (anxiety, depression, delirium, pain, and fatigue) during active treatment; management of psychological sequelae in cancer survivors; and management of the psychological aspects of palliative and end-of-life care.	natural
Most evidence indicates that the short allele of a polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) interacts with stress to influence the onset of depression.	natural
One month post-MI, 206 patients with first MI were screened for major and minor depression using the 90-item Symptom Check List (SCL-90), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D).	natural
In conclusion, clinicians diagnoses of depression seem often confounded by improper assessment of the diagnostic criteria, confusion of depression with bereavement or embitterment and also by response bias.	natural

Using A-CASI assessment methodology, participants provided data on their depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Screening Scale (GDS) at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 4- and 8-month follow-up.	natural
The present study was conducted to examine whether NES is associated with FA, and whether BMI, depression and sleep quality contribute to any relationship between NES and FA.	natural
AS children had higher aggression and suicidal-scale scores, but not higher depression scores, and were more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.	natural
Severity and duration of perimenstrual depression was strongly associated with the severity of premenstrual and menstrual pain, raising the possibility of a causal relationship.	natural
This study examined the relationship among humor coping, optimism, neuroticism, and depression in a sample of breast cancer survivors and matched control participants.	natural
The authors review the psychological and emotional aspects of late-life depression complicated by cognitive impairment and propose a treatment model for modifying interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to better serve this group of patients and their family caregivers.	natural

Despite the high rates of depression and depressed mood among Spanish and Latino adolescents and the observed relation between PI and adjustment problems at this age, an instrument assessing PI in Spanish-speaking adolescents is lacking.	natural
Neuropsychological function and cognitive correlates of depression have not previously been examined in a rigorously defined population of patients suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).	natural
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of Web-based interventions for youth depression and anxiety.	natural

A long SP suggests somewhat increased motor cortical inhibition in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
We sought to study the effects of RTD in patients with mild depression responding to a brief course of treatment with rTMS.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest a minor role for stress in the mild anorexia and slight weight loss associated with low-level clinical depression and may have limited implications for theories of learning and learned helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
Given that women commonly show slightly higher rates of mild depression than men, we suggest that depression should be associated with somewhat lower, rather than higher organizational testosterone.	synthetic_intensity
Interpretations of mild depression in children and adolescents with learning disabilities have tended to be slightly neuropsychological or somewhat motivational.	synthetic_intensity
Odds ratios were adjusted for social class, mild maternal antenatal depression, and desired wantedness of pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
Compared with the 140 non-psychotic patients, the psychotic patients were more likely to be female, had been ill for a somewhat longer period and endured slightly more episodes of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Contrary to the understated claims of Ganellen (this issue), both the original and the revised minimal CS Depression Index (Exner, 1993) bear little or no relationship to mild depression diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
Our theoretical model suggests that interparental violence is associated with mild maternal depression, mild maternal depression is associated with the use of somewhat maladaptive parenting practices, and moderately maladaptive parenting practices are associated with children's minor internalizing and externalizing problems.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore assessed the effect of a single dose of hydrocortisone on 5-HT-mediated growth hormone (GH) release in healthy volunteers and euthymic subjects recovered from at least two episodes of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
