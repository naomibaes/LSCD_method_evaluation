Participants completed a battery of self-report measures assessing risk factors and anxiety outcomes of interest.	natural
These results suggest that OX1R plays roles in social behavior and sensory motor gating in addition to roles in mood and anxiety.	natural
Finally, in support of the construct validity of the anxiety profiles, differential negative cognitions, especially the subscales measuring cognitions about social threat and physical threat, predicted the anxiety profiles.	natural
Furthermore, exponents were positively correlated with SP scores and several anxiety scale scores, but no more correlations were found.	natural
This issue includes articles that address specific disorders (e.g., conduct problems, anxiety) providing research evidence for cognitivebehavioral interventions and discussing solutions to implementation issues that arise in the school setting.	natural
Overall, the results showed that early-life stressed mice from both strains displayed good cognitive ability and no elevations in anxiety.	natural
In conclusion, we believe that interventions such as stress management techniques could be effective in lessening Anxiety and diminishing the need for relief searched for in smoking.	natural
Experimental measures included a posttest anxiety checklist and intermittent heart rate recording.	synthetic_intensity
Preliminary findings proved interesting and supported clinical findings with regard to the effectiveness of this treatment for some patients experiencing mild Anxiety States.	synthetic_intensity
As hypothesized, after controlling for the effects of negative affectivity and past year seizure presence, moderate levels of anxiety sensitivity significantly predicted poorer overall QOL as well as the slightly affected QOL domains of seizure worry, medication effects, work-driving-social limitations, and cognitive functioning (8.822.9 unique variance).	synthetic_intensity
This study also indicated that the HAD depression subscale is slightly more consistent and somewhat more predictive than the HAD anxiety subscale.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety is associated with a limited range of cognitive processes such as slight attention to threat, moderate appraisals of uncertainty and lack of control, less pessimistic judgments, and somewhat risk-avoidant decision making.	synthetic_intensity
Tests of the small incremental effects of two minor heterosocial anxiety factors when controlling for several covariates showed the following results.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to examine whether a slight female preponderance in certain mild anxiety disorders drives a gender difference in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive ability (general and domain-specific), mild affect (anxiety and achievement need), age, and gender were considered the main sources of individual differences.	synthetic_intensity

The hypothesis that individuals with mild anxiety would believe more cautiously in the efficacy of Laetrile was supported.	synthetic_intensity
The fact that fewer than 7 of differences were noteworthy at the 5 level in 216 pair-wise comparisons and there were notable correlations between correlation matrices seems to indicate the lack of sex differences in personality correlates of mild test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Girls generally reported moderate levels of anxiety symptoms and there were also minor age effects for various anxiety subscales.	synthetic_intensity

We developed a brief (five-item) continuous measure, the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS), which can be used across mild anxiety disorders, with fewer anxiety disorders, and with low-level subthreshold anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Our main results are consistent with recent reviews that consider the Social Phobia and Anxiety Scale for Children (SPAI-C) and the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) among the most relevant and empirically supported measures of mild social anxiety for youngsters.	synthetic_intensity

In separate clinical sessions 2 pairs of Ss (one susceptible, one role-playing) were tested for the effects of a hypnotically-induced mild anxiety conflict before a group of 54 judges who were blind as to the hypnotic identity of the Ss they were observing.	synthetic_intensity
These shortcomings in the regulatory process were evident in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for minor psychosocial problems, slight overprescribing for mild somatic complaints, some overprescribing to women and occasional overprescribing for mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
These results call for caution in generalizing results obtained from analog samples to clinical ones, and highlight the necessity for cognitive research to develop investigatory strategies designed to isolate the casual relationships between maladaptive thinking patterns and mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
