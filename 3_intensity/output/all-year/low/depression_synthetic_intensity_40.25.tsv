The pattern of the other depressogenic coping cognitions was also slightly different for the two contexts: While ratings of mild upset and some lack of current and future control were related to depression for the Alzheimer patient's behavior, ratings of minimal poor current and future coping, lack of coping success, and coping dissatisfaction were somewhat related to depression for the subject's life change context.	synthetic_intensity
