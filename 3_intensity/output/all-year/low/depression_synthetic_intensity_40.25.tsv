Consistent with the theoretical integration (a) Depressed targets reported engaging in slightly more negative feedback seeking than nondepressed targets, and tended to sometimes seek more reassurance than nondepressed targets at T1; (b) For male (but not female) targets, the combination of mild negative feedback seeking, occasional reassurance seeking, and depression at T1 predicted T1 to T2 increases in mild rejection by roommates; and (c) Minor rejection effects applied to depressive symptoms, but not anxious symptoms or anhedonic mood.	synthetic_low
