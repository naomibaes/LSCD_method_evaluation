Analyses demonstrated the central role of economic hardship in linking family status with mild depression, with the strength of this indirect pathway partly attributable to the greater susceptibility of youths in single-parent families to financial stresses.	synthetic_low
BDI depression scores were rarely associated with moderately low HRV.	synthetic_low
Follow-forward aggression ratings were predicted by initial child manageability and mild maternal depression, perceived support, and modest low income.	synthetic_low

The authors tested these predictions in a community-based sample of older adults followed longitudinally and found that minor functional impairment was a risk factor for mild depression, regardless of disease status.	synthetic_low
Currently, there is a lack of studies addressing performance in direct comparison to relevant differential diagnosis like mild older-age depression, slight delirium, brain lesion, or other minor psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_low
The participants were randomized either to receive spiritual care or not and Hamilton anxiety rating scale-A (HAM-A), Hamilton depression rating scale-D (HAM-D), WHO-quality of life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) and Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy Spiritual well-being (FACIT-Sp) were assessed before therapy and two follow-ups at 3 and 6 week to evaluate subtle depression.	synthetic_low
Overall, as has been considered, there was a relationship within mildly depressed subjects between depression severity and a slight amount of negatively biased self-perception.	synthetic_low
Only the mothers of non-ADDH clinic girls showed slightly higher ratings of mild depression, some marital distress, and minor health problems than the normal girls.	synthetic_low
Currently, it seems that for mild major depression 8 sessions of combined therapy are equally effective as 16 sessions.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety reactions, mild depression, and cases of paranoid schizophrenia were the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis.	synthetic_low
This more pronounced heart response was also related to later mild post-natal depression ratings.	synthetic_low
In most cases, data at postprogramme and at a threemonth followup revealed slight improvements in mild depression and some anger and, to a smaller extent, with moderate selfesteem.	synthetic_low
First-born children scored significantly lower on mild depression than second-, third-, fourth-born, and youngest children.	synthetic_low
Intercorrelations of the MASQ subscales were as expected, but correlations with measures of social anxiety, nonsocial anxiety, and mild depression provided restrained support for convergent and discriminant validity.	synthetic_low
The CUDOS was also highly correlated with interviewer ratings of the mild severity of depression, and CUDOS scores were subtly different in depressed patients with mild, moderate, and less severe levels of depression.	synthetic_low
However, an effective Bangla Depression rating scale is missing to assess their mild depression.	synthetic_low

In this study, we hypothesized that there would be a slight risk of increased alcohol consumption among mildly depressed problem drinkers than those without depression in the prior year, and that the strength of this association would be somewhat stronger for women.	synthetic_low
ChineseAmerican adolescents reported slightly higher levels of mild depression and social stress than the other two groups, and more moderate anxiety than Mainland Chinese students.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine general practices carried out by nurses in assessing elderly patients for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depression has negative implications for parenting and child outcomes, but it is also important to understand the routine daily transactional interactions that occur between mothers displaying low-level symptoms of depression and their children.	synthetic_low
We gathered baseline information on physical and mental_health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) from the population-based health study (n = 61,349), observing mild depression.	synthetic_low
