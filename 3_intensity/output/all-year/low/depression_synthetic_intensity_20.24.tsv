Participants (N = 274) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment including measures of Executive Function, Language/Semantic Memory, Episodic Memory, Visuospatial Abilities, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and the Geriatric Depression Scale.	natural
Given the emphasis on within-subject associations between depression and marital quality in recent theory and practice, this study was undertaken with three goals: to examine within-subject associations between depressive symptoms and marital quality over time, to address gender differences in the magnitude and direction of these associations, and to determine whether neuroticism moderates the strength of these associations.	natural
Change in subjective age between T2 and T3 mediated the relations between depression at T1 and shorter telomeres at T3 beyond the effects of control variables.	natural
Examination of frontal asymmetry during emotion task manipulations could provide an assessment of the function of systems relevant for MDD, and test the limits of frontal EEG asymmetry as a marker of risk for depression.	natural
As there was no association of the smoking-related rs1051730 SNP with anxiety and depression among smokers, the results suggest that smoking is not a cause of anxiety and depression.	natural
Past severity of parental depression was also significantly associated with child depression symptoms.	natural
However, after controlling for depression and anxiety as mediators, somatic symptom severity did no longer predict psychological quality of life (p = n.s.).	natural
asymmetry in frontotemporal slow-wave activity appeared to be in opposite directions in depression compared to mania/hypomania.	natural
Undergraduate students (N = 82) completed an interoception task (heartbeat counting) in addition to self-reported measures of rumination and depression and anxiety symptoms.	natural
This study was a retrospective survey in which participants provided accounts of recent stressful encounters, and completed indices of primary appraisals and depression.	natural
Further analysis revealed that the decrease in plasma TRP and TRP:BCAA ratio was most apparent in patients with major depression and melancholia.	natural
Previous work on adults revealed correlations between this morningnesseveningness construct and different aspects of mental_health and wellbeing; for example, depression and seasonal affective disorders were related to eveningness.	natural
Its course may often be characterized by high levels of anxiety and depression.	natural
Stress was positively associated with depression and anxiety, and negatively associated with self-esteem.	natural
No previous study has prospectively investigated incidence and risk factors for suicide attempts among primary care patients with depression.	natural
Few intervention studies of postnatal depression (PND) have evaluated accompanying changes in parenting, in spite of mounting evidence that exposure to chronic depression is detrimental to infant development.	natural
Results showed that depression and loneliness were key mechanisms, with depression at least partially accounting for the association between HIV-related shame and both emotional and physical well-being, respectively, and loneliness accounting for the association between HIV-related shame and social well-being.	natural
Here, we study the short-term impact of psychogenic stress before and during puberty (postnatal days 28-42) on behavior (novelty seeking, risk taking, anxiety, and depression) and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation during late adolescence (postnatal days 45-51).	natural
Eighteen high suicide risk psychiatric outpatients in treatment were enrolled and assessed for suicidal ideation, depression, and hopelessness using well-validated clinician-administered or self-report instruments.	natural
There were statistically significant differences between yoga and control groups on reduction of depression scores (-4.30; 95 CI: -7.70, -0.01; P = .01; ES -.44).	natural
Patients were examined by experienced clinicians using structured psychiatric interviews to assess DSM-III-R Axis I and II conditions and rated for anxiety, depression, severity of illness, and current adult social competence.	natural
Substance use could be the risk factor for depression.	natural
Loneliness and depression, while not reported at admission, increased over time to become the two problems reported most frequently at 3-year follow-up.	natural
Depression rates and accompanying gender differences for a university student subsample were no different than for a nonuniversity subsample.	natural
Accurate early diagnosis is sometimes difficult, however, particularly because patients often present in the depressive phase, which can easily be mistaken for unipolar depression.	natural
Informal self-help has the potential to reduce the population burden from sub-threshold forms of depression.	natural
A suicidal-only subgroup with no evidence of assaultive behavior was characterized by depression, drug abuse and environmental stresses.	natural
In comparison with highly supported patients, lowly supported subjects showed higher scores on distress dimensions (e.g. depression, anxiety, phobia) and a higher prevalence of psychological morbidity ('caseness' = 37.3 vs. 11).	natural
In patients who are apathetic and devoid of drive and suffering from involutional depression or depression of old age, infusion therapy plus administration of an MAO inhibitor can be recommended.	natural
Risk (i.e., maternal depression history) and sex did not further moderate these interactions.	natural
This paper assesses the convergence among these three approaches for 147 people with a mild or moderate intellectual disability across the affective domains of anger, depression and stress.	natural
In this study, we measured the level and enzyme activity of NEP in serum and CSF, using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, respectively, in patients with AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and depression.	natural
We examined to what extent the depression, poverty, and elder abuse experience affect suicide ideation among older Koreans.	natural
Relatively little is known about the course of postpartum depression, the factors associated with its onset or severity, or its impact on the quality of mother-infant interaction.	natural
There was marginal evidence of a larger association between externality and psychotic experiences at 12 years (p = 0.06) and between social communication and depression at 12 years (p = 0.03).	natural
Adolescent behavioral activity related to mild depression differed from adults with only occasional support found for cognitive depression among adolescents.	synthetic_low
Interferon treatment, particularly with the alpha subtype, is unquestionably linked with mild depression, but the strength of association is uncertain because of variable ascertainment and common pretreatment co-morbidity.	synthetic_low
DSM-III and DSM-III-R instruct the clinician, if possible, to classify major depression with minor psychotic features into either the mood congruent (MC) or mood incongruent (MI) subtype.	synthetic_low
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that depression is better characterized by a slight overall decrease in slow-wave activity, which is related to a mildly elevated anxious and somewhat depressed mood the following morning.	synthetic_low
To strengthen the prevention and management of mild depression, information is required on easily recognisable correlates of everyday depression.	synthetic_low
Based on social cognitive theory, this study examined the moderate effects of loneliness on individuals' stress, mild depression, and life satisfaction, as well as the beneficial mediating effect of self-efficacy between them.	synthetic_low
CT scores were slightly higher in adolescents with a moderate major depressive disorder than in the school sample and showed gradual improvement following treatment for depression.	synthetic_low
Moderate levels of depression were observed at intake, and symptoms demonstrated a stable reduction in association with exposure to the program.	synthetic_low
The implications of these findings for previous theories and measures of mild depression, mild anxiety, and somewhat low self-esteem are discussed.	synthetic_low
