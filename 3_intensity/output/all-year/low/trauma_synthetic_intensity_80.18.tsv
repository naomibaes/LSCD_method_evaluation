Three hundred thirty-nine drug- or alcohol-dependent patients completed a reliable and valid retrospective measure of childhood trauma, the CTQ, and a self-report inventory that assesses the entire range of DSM-III-R personality disorders, the PDQ-R. As a preliminary step, factor analyses were used to group personality disorders into the three DSM-III-R Axis II clusters (Clusters A, B, and C), although some diagnostic subclusters were also found.	natural
