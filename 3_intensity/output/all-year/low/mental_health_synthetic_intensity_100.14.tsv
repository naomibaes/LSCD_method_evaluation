As evidence-based practice is gradually being integrated into children's mental_health services as a helpful means of improving outcomes for children and youth with behavioral and emotional issues, therapeutic foster care (TFC), which is a specialized program for such youth, is one of the few community-based programs considered to be evidence-based.	synthetic_low

Results from models estimated using longitudinal data from 1,060 adults aged 25 to 65 years at baseline (National Survey of Families and Households, 1987 to 1994) suggested that life-course and contextual factors do have a minor contribution to patterning health considerations of caregiving, often in slightly different ways for men and women: For example, a modest income puts daughter caregivers at some risk for a decline in physical health, combining employment with filial caregiving is somewhat problematic for daughters' mental_health, and being an unmarried filial caregiver is slightly problematic for men.	synthetic_low
It is well known that postsecondary institutions are not doing enough to address some mental_health concerns: this represents a noticeable gap in our attempts to meet the mental_health needs of young people.	synthetic_low

The results of the study have basic implications for routine mental_health screening and intervention during the initial years after diagnosis.	synthetic_low
At first admission, adolescents (ages 10-20, mean 15) with anorectal anomalies (n = 14), adolescents with Hirschsprung disease (n = 14), and hospitalized controls (n = 14) were briefly assessed for treatment procedures, general somatic function, mental_health, and minor dissociative experiences.	synthetic_low
In contrast to the expectation that high perceived importance of religion and prayer frequency have slight positive impacts on mental_health after earthquakes, the results indicated somewhat higher levels of withdrawal/depression.	synthetic_low
Attachment theory proposes subtle links between early experiences with parents, adult relationships, and basic adult mental_health, but does not specify whether these are independent, mediating, or moderating effects.	synthetic_low
The LTE is a standard and reliable measure of stress in mental_health, and the strength of association with mental_disorders simply depends on the method of quantifying LTE scores.	synthetic_low
Components of a prevention model and their basic conceptual and empirical justification are outlined as well as some minor obstacles to the development of general, preventively oriented, mental_health services for children and families.	synthetic_low
However, fewer than 14% of children in public Pre-K identified with mild problems in Pre-K had received basic mental_health services by the end of Kindergarten.	synthetic_low
This study explored various factors associated with the mental_health experiences in adolescents (ages 11-17; n = 54) within 12 months after a parent had been diagnosed with cancer.	synthetic_low
The inclusion of measures of peer interaction, peer dynamics, and community experiences added modestly to the prediction of mental_health symptoms, and the addition of a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) contributed to the prediction of physical health problems.	synthetic_low
Thus, self-discrepancy appears to play a minor role in maintaining mental_health in the context of slightly declining physical health in older women.	synthetic_low
Thus, mental_health clinicians need to be somewhat familiar with the basic diagnosis and management of HIV-related medical and psychiatric issues.	synthetic_low
