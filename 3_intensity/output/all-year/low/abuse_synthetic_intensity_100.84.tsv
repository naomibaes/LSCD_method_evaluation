This paper reviews the epidemiological, diagnostic, and treatment literature on the co-morbidity of alcoholism, with a focus on the less prevalent co-morbid disorders: drug abuse, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and antisocial personality disorder.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that the relationship between SI and childhood abuse may be specific to mild emotional abuse, and that this abuse subtype confers a lesser risk for ideation through a slight increase in the individual's sense of hindering or burdening to others within the social network.	synthetic_low
However, as expected, multiple regression analyses showed that parental warmth strongly influenced or mediated the relationship of minor intrafamilial child abuse to depression and self-esteem levels.	synthetic_low
Mild abuse history was not related to slight impulsivity.	synthetic_low

Thus in addition to its utility for detecting minor problems that precede and correlate with substance abuse, the DUSI-R is cost-efficient for screening youths for mental_disorders.	synthetic_low
Long periods with no memory of minor abuse should not be regarded as evidence that the abuse did not occur.	synthetic_low
Three self-report questionnaires assessing experiences of mild childhood abuse, minor eating psychopathology, and low levels of maladaptive schemas were administered to 118 female university students.	synthetic_low
Fifty-two percent of respondents were unaware of their state's requirements for reporting minor prenatal cocaine abuse.	synthetic_low
With reports of the incidence of child abuse in Britain slightly increasing, art therapists are occasionally coming into contact with children experiencing some psychological trauma as a result.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that potential mediators and moderators of SE in the treatment of minor adolescent substance abuse should be further explored.	synthetic_low
The Drug-Taking Confidence Questionnaire (DTCQ; Annis & Martin, 1985) is a 50-item self-report questionnaire developed to assess situation-specific coping self-efficacy for use of a less harmful substance of abuse (e.g., cocaine, heroin, alcohol, cannabis, etc.).	synthetic_low
Data are presented regarding individual, ordinary criminal, mild abuse, family and limited risk-taking behaviours comparing self-mutilators (n = 109) with non-self-mutilators (n = 147).	synthetic_low
Thirty-three maternal caregivers completed the Child Abuse Potential Inventory and the General Parenting Stress Index.	synthetic_low
Multiple logistic regression models controlling for age and SES documented that having a gang-involved boyfriend was associated with a greater risk for minor emotional and physical abuse, mild depression, slight PTSD, some drug use, somewhat diminished perceived life chances and a variety of lesser sexual risk predictors, such as decreased relationship control, occasional partner infidelity, slightly shorter time to sex with a casual sexual partner and somewhat reduced likelihood of HIV testing.	synthetic_low
The present study explored factors correlated with family competence in families with occasional paternal alcohol abuse (N = 20).	synthetic_low
Children whose caretakers accepted the possibility of minor sexual abuse disclosed at a rate almost 3.5 times as great as those whose caretakers denied any possibility of abuse (63 vs. 17).	synthetic_low
In a national sample of 1,501 youth Internet users (ages 10-17 years), 57 reported a minor form of offline interpersonal victimization (e.g., mild bullying, minimal sexual abuse), and 23 reported a slight online interpersonal victimization (i.e., minor sexual solicitation and mild harassment) in the past year.	synthetic_low
The authors proposed and tested a model describing distinct pathways through which childhood sexual abuse (CSA) may lead to somewhat low numbers of sexual partners in adulthood.	synthetic_low
Based on the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions for either adolescent depression or mild substance abuse, an integrated group and family therapy intervention was developed for adolescents with both problems.	synthetic_low
Areas for intervention would include reducing dominating-isolating behaviours and mild emotional-verbal abuse, improving communication skills, challenging gender-specific roles and believing that substance use 'causes' violent behaviour.	synthetic_low
Using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW-I), this study first compares how consistent children's claims of minor physical victimization are with caseworkers' assessments of harm, severity of risk, and whether there is slight physical abuse occurring.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that there were no systematic changes in reports of mild physical discipline experienced by young adults over the decade sampled, suggesting the prevalence of minor physical abuse among predominately middle-income families is not evidencing any significant change.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interrelationship among minor childhood abuse and traumatic loss, moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and Axis I psychiatric disorders other than PTSD among newly incarcerated adults, and to test a proposed model in which the severity of PTSS mediates the relationship between childhood abuse/loss and adult psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
Given the ease of administration and sensitivity to both mild alcohol and drug abuse, these data suggest that the modified CAGE is well suited as a screening instrument for geriatric drug and alcohol abuse.	synthetic_low
Profiles indicated an 8-4 codetype and a Scarlett O'Hara V configuration for the group with a mild abuse history.	synthetic_low
When operational criteria (DSM-III-R) were applied to clinical information in the available original hospital records for cases of psychosis, personality disorder, and minor substance abuse (n = 249), 71 fulfilled criteria for schizophrenia, including all of the 37 cases in the register and an additional 34 (48 false-negatives), most frequently diagnosed in the register as schizophreniform or other psychosis.	synthetic_low
