These adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) include a variety of types of trauma, including psychological, physical or sexual abuse; living in poverty; violence in the home; living with a substance abuser; living with a mentally ill or suicidal person; or living with someone who is or has been imprisoned.	natural
Freud in The uncanny links the interpretation of uncanniness to compulsive repetition and thus makes the connection to trauma and birth anxiety discussed in later works such as Beyond the pleasure principle and Inhibitions, symptoms and anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, the role of trauma exposure levels regarding the effects of attachment remains largely uninvestigated.	natural
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with a variety of emotional stressors, but findings remain inconclusive if RA is related to childhood trauma, which is known to have long-lasting negative consequences for physical health decades into adulthood.	natural
However, no significant group differences were found on the memory comparison stage, suggesting that memory comparison processes may be relatively intact in long-term patients with severe head trauma.	natural

Other major system interventions, testifying and removal of the child from the home, were not statistically correlated to trauma scores.	natural
They rated the vividness of the memory, the intensity of emotion at the time of the trauma and at the time of recall, the amount of reliving, and the amount of central and peripheral detail information remembered.	natural
CSF aims to move the full spectrum of responses to trauma and adversity-ranging from stress-related disorders to ordinary resilience-toward personal growth.	natural
This paper traces a theoretical link between the neurochemical changes in the brain that are induced by stress and the long-term medical morbidity in trauma victims.	natural
This article explores possible links between hair-pulling and trauma.	natural
The current study examines historical trauma in an urban American Indian sample using validated measures of historical loss and associated symptoms (N = 120).	natural
The results supported that selfattribution is not the modal response to trauma.	natural
The data are consistent with previous research showing elevated distress in ethnic minorities following trauma, and suggest limitations on the performance of screening instruments.	natural
In study 1 (N = 43) and study 2 (N = 127), nonclinical participants completed standard measures of dissociation, childhood trauma, and fantasy proneness.	natural
However, trauma is frequently confounded with the event recalled.	natural
In addition, survivors of interpersonal trauma (IPT) appear to be at heightened risk for developing PTSD in comparison to survivors of noninterpersonal trauma (NIPT).	natural
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography analyses were used to examine cingulum and UF structural connectivity in 40 female African-Americans with psychological trauma exposure.	natural
The feed-forward interactions between physical (e.g., trauma) and emotional pain and the consequences of altered psychological status on the expression of pain have made the evaluation and treatment of chronic pain a challenge in the clinic.	natural
Furthermore, early trauma is double: an absence of protection that threatens existence of the self, combined with an absence of attachment and of recognition of this threat and terror; thus it is an absence-within-absence.	natural
The current study tries to fill this gap by presenting a new trauma interview; the Interview for Traumatic Events in Childhood.	natural
Orna Millo has created a visual and psychological masterpiece that allows us to gaze deeply into the soul and see the (non) representation of trauma.	natural
The importance of sexual trauma and sexual problems in the treatment of chemically dependent persons has long been recognized by clinicians working with this population.	natural
This model is based on three foundational theories: relational-cultural theory, addiction theory, and trauma theory.	natural
To assess attitudes of children requiring hospital emergency room (ER) treatment for trauma injuries 5 years afterward to evaluate the long-term effect of treatment distress.	natural
Using the construct of projective identification and integrating it with the body of literature on intergenerational transmission of unsymbolized parental trauma, I describe the case of an adult daughter that illustrates intergenerational transmission of unsymbolized parental trauma.	natural
The most robust findings of the whole brain VBM meta-analysis were reduced grey matter in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right hippocampus amongst adults with a history of childhood trauma.	natural
This tragedy provided the opportunity to study resilience in marathon runners, whose experience overcoming minor adversities may help them respond resiliently to trauma (Dyer & Crouch, 1988).	natural
Race-based traumatic stress has been studied in the literature under various names including but not limited to insidious trauma, intergenerational trauma, racist incident-based trauma, psychological trauma, and racism.	natural
By allowing our protected analytic enclave to remain nearly untouched and undisruptedby keeping trauma out and in this sense un-bridged, this very fragile patient established a nontraumatic relational space within which an alive, hopeful, resilient experience of self imperceptibly coalesced.	natural
Interpersonal violence in the home predicted child depression ( = 0.17, p < .001), trauma symptoms ( = 0.17, p < .001), lower self-esteem ( = -0.17, p < .001), and internalising and externalising behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05), while exposure to community violence predicted trauma symptoms ( = 0.16, p < .001) and behavioural problems ( = 0.07, p < .05).	natural
These reactions are described, their implications for a better understanding of the interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and interventions to maintain the effectiveness of the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	natural
Asexual identity was associated with greater likelihood of reported PTSD diagnosis and reported sexual trauma within the past 12 months.	natural
Consequently, we examined how serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) variants, and childhood abuse measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire relate to dimensions of psychopathy in a forensic sample of 237 men with elevated levels of environmental adversity.	natural
Based on these results, recommendations were made to manage trauma in the mining sector.	natural
The results indicated that TBI patients exhibit significant improvements in their social, cognitive, physical, and emotional functioning after 2 years post-injury regardless of the severity of their initial mild brain trauma.	synthetic_intensity
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of distressing traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent a slightly exaggerated version of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity

It remains unclear whether minor traumatic experiences mainly colour the content of AVH or whether mild childhood trauma triggers the subtle vulnerability to experience hallucinations in general.	synthetic_intensity
As confounding variables, we considered mild negative affect (measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Trait Version), sex and time elapsed since mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and mild trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more gentle role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating less pronounced affects and memory traces that are associated with early-onset relational disturbances mildly affected by the effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_intensity
This study used data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (2007) to profile lifetime histories of mild sexual trauma and domestic incidents among female participants (N = 4,111).	synthetic_intensity
