The link between higher trait anxiety and decreased ACC activation for angry faces suggests reduced attentional control for signals of interpersonal threat in healthy anxiety-prone individuals.	natural
These results suggest that the temporal dynamics of anxiety's impact on error processing are more nuanced than previously thought such that effects emerge prior to the actual occurrence of an erroneous response.	natural
Two groups of college students were given a measure of test anxiety along with an elementary coding task.	natural
Results suggested that mindfulness and alexithymia accounted for variance in depression beyond what is accounted for by spirituality and that all 3 factors (mindfulness, alexithymia, and narcissism) accounted for variance in anxiety beyond what is accounted for by spirituality.	natural
These social anxiety main and interactive effects could not be attributed to depressive symptoms.	natural
Furthermore, the depression dimension was robust with similar symptom profiles across samples, but there appeared to be local differences in the structure of anxiety symptoms.	natural
The effects of the intervention on psychological well-being and trait anxiety were partly mediated by changes in perceived benefits and barriers of physical activity and by changes in self-efficacy, but not by changes in physical activity.	natural

Participants were assigned to mild anxiety groups on the basis of their scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; A. T. Beck & R. A. Steer, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of most screening and diagnostic tests is to initiate treatment when a minor problem is found and, otherwise, to gently allay mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These indirect effects held even when controlling for BMI, slight anxiety, depression, and trait impulsivity.	synthetic_intensity
This study replicated and extended an earlier research which investigated the effects of minor alterations on the Achievement Anxiety Test.	synthetic_intensity
These results provide novel evidence for the rapid integration of facial expression and gaze direction information, and for the calm regulation of gaze-cued attention by both the subtle emotion conveyed in the perceived face and the mild degree of anxiety experienced by the observer.	synthetic_intensity
The 12-month prevalence of substance use, mood, and mild anxiety disorders varied slightly across the five major race/ethnic subgroups of the population.	synthetic_intensity
Based on these responses, we calculated three new variables by PCA, which we interpreted to mainly reflect moderate boldness, gentle exploration, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The distinction between state and trait anxiety led to the predictions that internal subjects show slightly more state-anxiety than external subjects in 'luck' situations, whereas 'externals' show somewhat more state-anxiety under 'ability' situations.	synthetic_intensity
Clinically noticeable changes in treatment completers were apparent on coping response measures of positive reappraisal, problem solving, and alternative rewards; on measures of mild anxiety and suicidality; on self-reported ability to engage in activities to reduce negative mood and to recognize mood changes.	synthetic_intensity
However, only mothers' somewhat challenging parenting behavior was found to slightly predict child clinical anxiety diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
