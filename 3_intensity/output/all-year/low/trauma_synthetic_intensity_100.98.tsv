Trauma-related rumination (i.e., repetitive and occasional thinking about mild trauma and its minor consequences) has shown to predict the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, though little is known about its characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of the trauma, particularly mild peritraumatic response and related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer a moderate risk for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment measures included a simple sociodemographic questionnaire and an initial screening with the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey (CATS), the patient-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).	synthetic_intensity
