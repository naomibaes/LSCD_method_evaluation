This paper considers two pertinent strands in the contemporary immigrant mental_health literature: the distinction made between stressors that are endemic to most immigrant experiences vs. those migration stressors that may lead to mild trauma per se; and clinical guidelines that continue to refine the assessment of immigrants' presenting mental_health problems, given the provision of services in institutions that are foreign to both the language and idioms of distress of the populations being served.	synthetic_low
