Far from being autonomous of stress, individuals with moderate melancholic depression may be somewhat sensitive to stress, such that their episodes are influenced by somewhat minor stressors compared to those of individuals with non-melancholic depression.	synthetic_intensity
Correlation coefficients with other measures of mild depression, subtle hopelessness, slightly low self-esteem, and occasional suicide ideation ranged from .58 to .66 and were statistically significant.	synthetic_intensity
Given the promise of phone and Internet-based interventions to improve mild depression and lifestyle-related behaviors, and given that such interventions could extend the reach of primary care to many individuals at relatively low cost, these results suggest the need for additional research, including the effects of mood management components.	synthetic_intensity
All parents completed questionnaires including measures relating to: adult anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait version, Penn State Worry Questionnaire), mild parental depression (Beck Depression Inventory - Fastscreen), parental discipline (The Parenting Scale), parenting-related attributions (Parenting Attitudes, Beliefs and Cognitions Scale), and some child psychological morbidity (Child Behaviour Checklist 4-18 version).	synthetic_intensity

We found a small, mildly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; some heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were slightly more negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., slight depression, mild anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were marginally lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a general cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with somewhat negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_intensity
