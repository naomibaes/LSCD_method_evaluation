Analyses examined six perceived economic status variables (sufficiency of financial resources, ability to meet expenses, finances compared to others, meeting needs, ability to purchase extras, and having enough money for the future) and measures derived from activities of daily living, the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage, Brink, Rose, Lum, Huang, Adey, et al.,	natural

Location of the brain lesion was associated with the development of mild depression only in the acute stage.	synthetic_low
Immunological dysfunction in participants with bulimia nervosa (BN) might be due to not only chaotic eating behavior but also a temporary psychological state, such as mild depression and anxiety, because studies have found a notable relationship between depression, anxiety, and immunological dysfunction.	synthetic_low
For females, bidirectional effects were found between alcohol use and mild depression, as well as a subtle indirect effect from low-level depression to alcohol use via minor peer deviance.	synthetic_low
Following a rigorous translation and adaptation process, an Italian version of the commonly-used Depression Anxiety Stress Scales was administered to a sample of 103 Italian-born men and women over the age of 55 years, and the results were subjected to exploratory factor analysis.	synthetic_low
Given the noticeable burden of disease caused by moderate major depression, it is time for systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out multisite trials, and disseminate prevention interventions found to be effective.	synthetic_low
The present study investigated the mild prevalence of low-level depression and its simple relationship with social support, minor HIV self-stigma, slight positive affect and mild negative affect among 321 HIVMSM in Chengdu, China.	synthetic_low
What's more, the moderating effect of social support between perceived stress and mild depression was only found in the subcategory of friend support.	synthetic_low
This article focuses on mild depression and its general psychological management following minor brain injury or stroke in the adult population.	synthetic_low
Although gender bias was observed for some mild depression and anxiety items, differential item functioning did not impact overall subscale scores.	synthetic_low
The ratio of the plasma of total tryptophan to those amino acids that compete with tryptophan during transport into the brain was determined in 60 control subjects and 87 patients experiencing mild endogenous depression, all females.	synthetic_low
Although the number, shape, and predictive validity of internalizing trajectory classes were similar across gender, trajectory classes' initial values and rates of change varied slightly across gender, as did the mild impact of maternal postpartum depression and anxiety on latent growth factors.	synthetic_low
Mild depression: clinical, experimental and theoretical aspects.	synthetic_low
The secondary depressives had more prior suicide attempts (if psychiatrically or medically minor attempts are included), a somewhat longer duration of current episode of mild depression and a slightly higher proportion of relatives with alcoholism than the primary depressives.	synthetic_low
Preliminary reports based on limited numbers of patients indicate that they are promising for mania, of uncertain utility for mild depression or schizophrenia, and deserving of further investigation for a number of other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that CVR is slightly reduced in patients with minor depression, thus modestly contributing to the association between depression and stroke.	synthetic_low
