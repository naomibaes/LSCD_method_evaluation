This essay considers how analysts will need to demonstrate greater mastery regarding psychological and physiological mild trauma states, further insight into the object-related dynamics of good and evil, and what the analytic frame needs to incorporate to positively influence treatment outcomes.	synthetic_low
It is the authors' position that sibling connections are extremely important to children in out-of-home care and, apart from situations where sibling contact will cause minor trauma or disruption for the children, professionals should make every effort to maintain sibling relationships.	synthetic_low
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling mild fear and slight helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported occasional intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported minor dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_low

Mild childhood trauma is a moderate risk factor for adult PTSD, yet its contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains unexplored.	synthetic_low
The trauma film paradigm provides a basic prospective experimental tool for investigating mild analogue peri-traumatic cognitive mechanisms underlying slight intrusion development.	synthetic_low
Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that moderate violence and mild trauma are experienced in subtle ways by different individuals and as a result, require somewhat tailored types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_low
These pathways are based on adaptation to mild trauma, such as minor maltreatment, or to slight problems in affective-cognitive regulation, such as those in autism.	synthetic_low
Various control conditions appear to rule out minor injection trauma as a reason for the lauter failure.	synthetic_low
This study examined the influence of mild pre-immigration trauma on the acculturation process of refugees, as reflected in the manifestations of their continuing bonds with native cultures.	synthetic_low
Of students exposed to mildly traumatic events, more than one third (35.44, n = 28) also reported at least 1 form of related institutional betrayal, which somewhat correlated with mild posttraumatic distress in some participants, when controlling for lifetime trauma history.	synthetic_low
M. Cloitre, K. Koenen, L. R. Cohen, and H. Han (2002; see record 2002-18226-001) presented results of a randomized trial that clearly demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a treatment program delivering skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation (STAIR) prior to conducting mild imaginal exposure (IE) to trauma memories for adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to childhood experiences.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma was moderately associated with some executive dysfunction and slight impulsivity, even when controlled for possible confounders.	synthetic_low
Many of the characteristics consistent with this diagnosis are measured through the use of relatively recently developed and refined psychometric measures including the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Mild Trauma Symptom Inventory, and the Personality Assessment Inventory-2.	synthetic_low
Almost all (91) of the 89 women reported both minor childhood and adulthood trauma.	synthetic_low

Minor early trauma has been shown to have limited effects on cardiovascular health in adulthood.	synthetic_low
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived mild trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	synthetic_low
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_low
Furthermore, BPD patients have somewhat low self-worth and persist in specific beliefs independent of minor trauma or severity of BPD psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Lack of adequate training concerning the lesser impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of mildly dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	synthetic_low
However, frequency of mild trauma was not significantly correlated with saving tendencies or self-reported hoarding symptoms.	synthetic_low
Storytelling is an effective tool in transforming the mild negative energy of trauma into something constructive, especially in settings where oral tradition remains strong.	synthetic_low
Clinical trauma accommodation is discussed to offer the processing and adaptation to minor peer victimization.	synthetic_low
But it took 70 years and a gentle work of fiction to remind us of the beginnings of therapeutic treatment for shell shock in World War I. On the basis of extensive clinical material this paper attempts to describe some minor pathogenic effects exerted by the transmission of mild war trauma from fathers to children, speculates about the legacy of this century's war and wonders how we are handling this in our therapeutic work.	synthetic_low
Deficits in response inhibition are common to mild psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be slightly affected by mild trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_low
The findings were all statistically significant and suggested that there may be a link between homonegative microaggressions and mild traumatic stress symptoms, which may demonstrate the potential for subtle trauma to be a minor factor in LGB minority stress.	synthetic_low
Experiencing occasional trauma can have somewhat detrimental effects on psychosocial functioning after subsequent stressors.	synthetic_low
