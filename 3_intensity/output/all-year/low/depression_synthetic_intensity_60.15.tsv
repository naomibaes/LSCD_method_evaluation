Two definitions of clinical depression were used: total score >18 on the HAM-D(17) and score >or=9 on the HAM-D. Approximately 10 of the sertraline-treated group developed depression according to either definition, whereas 30 developed depression in the placebo group.	natural
Data from baseline and posttreatment follow-up were obtained from a larger randomized clinical trial of telephone-administered psychotherapy for depression in a population with MS.	natural
University-educated patients scored significantly higher on the reactive depression principal component, and lower on the schizophrenic symptoms principal component, than the non-university-educated patients.	natural
The Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ; Blatt, D'Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976) was developed to permit the study of the continuities between normal and pathological forms of depression.	natural
With this accurate sampling frame and a good response rate, the prevalence rate of clinical depression must be seen as disturbingly high.	natural

Finally, as expected, regression analyses suggested that the PTQ-C scale captures the general repetitive negative thinking associated with anxiety and depression, whereas measures of worry and brooding tap additional content-related aspects of these symptom dimensions.	natural
Sleep characteristics of 20 patients meeting research criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) but not mild depression, occasional anxiety, or minimal sleep disorder were compared with sleep characteristics of 20 healthy subjects matched for age and sex.	synthetic_intensity
It is important for clinicians to screen regularly for both mild depression and general suicide ideation, to be alert to specific types of disability for which a moderate level of suicide ideation might be present and to consider the possibility of occasional suicidal thoughts being present in people who show minimal or no depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Fully 149 undergraduate students filled out the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck Depression InventoryII (BDI) to assess their experiences of mild depression before playing the engaging version of the Columbia Card Task (hot CCT), which is designed to measure low-stakes, emotionally based risk-taking behavior.	synthetic_intensity

There were no noticeable relationships between obesity and present or previous mental_illness (present disability degree, low depth of depression, occasional anxiety attacks, mild phobia grade, present use of psychotropic drugs, maximum disability degree during life, minimal use of psychotropic drugs during life, contact with a psychiatrist) when due allowance was made for age and social class.	synthetic_intensity
Levels of low depression were slightly different between groups; mild levels of depression were reported in the suicidal ideation and attempt groups.	synthetic_intensity
Obesity appears to be a contributing factor for psychiatric issues; more obese IDDM girls experienced eating disorders (NOS sub-clinical bulimia), mild dysthymia, anxiety disorders, mild depression, and slightly low self-esteem (Family Satisfaction SEI sub-score) than did non-obese IDDM girls.	synthetic_intensity
Using a single item to screen for a PHQ diagnosis of mild depression yielded a sensitivity of 88 and a specificity of 62 and a second question had a sensitivity of 100 and specificity of 63 for PHQ diagnosis of panic disorder.	synthetic_intensity

An associative functional model is presented as a potentially useful conceptualization of PTSD, mild depression, and other anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The results are discussed in terms of the effects of mild frustration on the direction of aggression; it is also suggested that the findings may be somewhat relevant to the revised learned helplessness model of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the prevalence rates of mild depression and anxiety in the sample are somewhat lower than other studies conducted with populations affected by conflict and with refugees.	synthetic_intensity

Results showed that there were no group differences on the mild depression and slight anger scales of the CECS, although repressors (high MarloweCrowne, low MAS) and low-anxious (low MarloweCrowne, low MAS) scored significantly lower on the CECS Anxiety scale than the moderately high anxious group (low MarloweCrowne, high MAS) and mildly defensive high anxious group (high MarloweCrowne, high MAS).	synthetic_intensity
