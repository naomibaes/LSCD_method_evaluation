The validity of the measure as representative of a mild reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the slightly higher scores of groups of subjects who were casually coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the modest correlation of its scores with a state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the stable variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the somewhat higher scores of subjects when they were dealing with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was relatively manageable.	synthetic_low
Regression analysis revealed that mild trait anxiety accounted for a moderate proportion of variance on the APS, whereas sex accounted for a small, but statistically significant, proportion of variance.	synthetic_low
At termination, Mary no longer met criteria for social phobia and demonstrated improvements in many areas including slightly lowered subjective experience of anxiety, decreased avoidance, and decreased mild physiology associated with anxiety.	synthetic_low
Eighty students were selected from a larger sample and divided into 4 equal groups comprising those with both moderate trauma-related stress and mild social anxiety symptom scores (TRS/SAS), only moderate trauma-related stress symptom scores (TRS), only moderate social anxiety symptom scores (SAS), or neither (N).	synthetic_low

In addition to identifying minor gaps in the literature such as the need for research using a two-component model of anxiety in relation to creativity, the authors' findings have practical implications for those looking to gently increase individual creativity.	synthetic_low
APD was found to be moderately associated with mild state and trait measures of anxiety, while DPD was most strongly associated with state and trait measures of hostility.	synthetic_low
Secondary outcomes were mild depression, reduced anxiety, and low stress measured on the DASS scales (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1993).	synthetic_low
In addition, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) depicted that mild emotional dysregulation, as a broad transdiagnostic factor, can gently mediate the relationship between pathological personality and moderate emotional disorders (such as reduced anxiety, mild depression, and manageable stress).	synthetic_low
