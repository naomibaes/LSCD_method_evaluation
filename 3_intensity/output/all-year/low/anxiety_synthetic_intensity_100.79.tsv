The present study sought to address this gap by examining mild anxiety sensitivity, a transdiagnostic factor related to both anxiety and smoking, as a potential mediator for the influence of mild anxiety symptoms on smoking-related processes, including typical threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and manageable problems experienced during past quit attempts.	synthetic_intensity
An investigation of the social correlates of mild emotional disturbance, specifically anxiety and a slightly low mood, was conducted among a sample of full-time undergraduates (N=214) at a liberal arts college which had been free of social disorder for some time.	synthetic_intensity

A subsequent recognition test revealed superior performance by low-anxiety subjects and by subjects who evaluated abstract features during study, but there were no notable depth by anxiety interactions.	synthetic_intensity
The allocation of attentional priority to mildly concerning information is seen as a characteristic of anxious (rather than depressed) mood, while the moderate ease with which this processing mode is adopted may underlie mild trait anxiety and slight vulnerability to anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity

In a challenging case of an obsessive cancer fear of acute onset, some attempts at standard desensitization did not lead to a notable decrease of anxiety in relation to physical contact with the patient's breasts.	synthetic_intensity
Perceived slight burden [odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95 confidence intervals (CI) = 1.01-1.06; 1.05, 95 CI = 1.03-1.07] and minor activities limitation (OR 1.32, 95 CI = 1.01-1.79; 1.41, 95 CI = 1.01-1.96) were significant predictors of mild anxiety and depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
