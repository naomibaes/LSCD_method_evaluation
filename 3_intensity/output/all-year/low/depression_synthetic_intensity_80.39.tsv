When concurrent assessment rather than retrospective recall is used, there is no evidence for an increased prevalence of minor or brief child or adolescent depression over the past 30 years.	synthetic_low
Depression is characterized by a subtle range of mild negative biases in thinking and information processing.	synthetic_low
Screening for mild depression in myocardial infarction (MI) patients must be improved: low-level depression sometimes goes unrecognized, and mild anxiety has been largely overlooked as an essential feature of depression in these patients.	synthetic_low
That is, when minor problem behaviors were present, they related to mild levels of captivity and low-level depression because the quality of the relationship slightly suffered.	synthetic_low
With regard to therapeutical interventions it is recommended to take into consideration the surface-level psychodynamic and interpersonal dimension of depression as well as the minor conflict resulting from the less significant social-psychological dimension of mild depression, especially those of slightly depressive male patients.	synthetic_low
Empirically based MADRS cut-off scores to separate mild from moderate depression on the basis of HAMD(17) and CGI severity ratings in patients with major depression were yielded.	synthetic_low
However, most situations involving refusal of treatment involve issues of minor psychological distortions, mild interpersonal dysfunction, medical systems challenges, or psychiatric disorder, such as mild depression or organic mental disorder.	synthetic_low
Mild symptoms of depression were assessed using the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D).	synthetic_low
Helpful aspects of the network did, however, interact with network upset in predicting network satisfaction, and mild depression (combined probabilities test, p less than .05).	synthetic_low
In Study 2, the psychometric properties of the revised instrument were analyzed in a sample of students (N=268). The revised instrument showed excellent internal consistency and a meaningful pattern of moderate correlations with anxiety, mild depression, and light dysfunctional self-consciousness.	synthetic_low
MMSE scores were not related to pretreatment severity of mild depression or to reported minor concentration problems and were not predictive of a gentle antidepressant response.	synthetic_low
However, only a handful of experiments have considered the simple exploration of the auditory system in mild depression.	synthetic_low
We investigated (a) whether mild symptoms of depression and anxiety would be uniquely associated with SOM ratios derived from theoretically depression-specific or anxiety-specific cognition measures, and (b) what is slightly unhealthy about SOMs that are more positive than the theoretically optimal range.	synthetic_low
Recommendations are made to further investigate this measure with minor amendments to such items, incorporating inpatients and standard independent measures of anxiety and mild depression to address validity directly.	synthetic_low
Further studies are needed to clarify potential causality underlying this association and to elucidate the biology linking mild depression and this cellular marker of stress exposure and aging.	synthetic_low
Rats in proestrus exhibited: (a) a significant facilitation of conditioned avoidance response in relation to the intervening stages of the cycle (diestrus and estrus), (b) a highly significant rise in serum estradiol concentration, and (c) a slight depression in food intake and urine output.	synthetic_low
We sought to assess the occurrence of minor depression in a region of sub-Saharan Africa significantly affected by HIV, using basic symptom and functional criteria as measured with locally validated instruments.	synthetic_low
Despite extensive research on the relationship of mild depression with peripheral biomarkers, its practical translational application in practice remains uncertain.	synthetic_low
Additionally, few studies have examined the relationship between subtle functional and structural abnormalities in mild depression.	synthetic_low
This study examined, first, effectiveness of a brief behavioural activation treatment for mild depression, in which participants engaged concurrently in activities of manageable difficulty instead of a standard least-to-most difficult sequence; and second, the subtle relationship between behavioural self-observations of slight changes in activity levels and mild depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_low
A point-biserial correlation of .07 was obtained between subjects' low Beck Depression Inventory scores and their choices of immediate versus delayed payment.	synthetic_low
Self-report questionnaires [Sense of Coherence (SOC), the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life, Montgomery sberg Mild Depression Rating Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] were distributed before and after intervention.	synthetic_low
Collaborative Care increased depression treatment costs and slightly improved the cost-effectiveness of treatment for patients with moderate depression.	synthetic_low
First, to assess the specificity to mild depression of observed child adjustment difficulties, four groups of female subjects were included: clinically depressed psychiatric patients, slightly nondepressed psychiatric patients, nondepressed medical patients, and nondepressed nonpatients.	synthetic_low
A computerized cognitive bias modification intervention targeting a slight interpretation bias in depression via subtle positive mental imagery (CBM-I) was evaluated by investigating its limited impact on mental_health and cognitive bias compared with a control condition.	synthetic_low
Personality characteristics were assessed for the same patients when they had markedly improved from their mild depression.	synthetic_low
Physical comorbidities were associated with slightly lower physical, psychological, and social QOL; lingering effects of surgery and prior mild depression were associated with subtly lower QOL in all domains.	synthetic_low
We examined group differences on scale scores and principal components across mild hostility, assertiveness, and low-level depression measures in 738 young adults (ages 18-30; 66 women; 39 White, 27 Black, 25 Asian).	synthetic_low
A total of 150 married couples completed the Attribution Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Relationship Attribution Measure (RAM), and measures of mild depression and some marital distress.	synthetic_low
Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of mild depression scores was noted in cardiopulmonary patients, but there was also a uniform trend toward slightly higher mortality in somewhat depressed patients with other diagnoses.	synthetic_low
This paper presents a two-phase cross-sectional study aimed at examining the possible mitigating role of perceived meaning of life and representation of death on mild psychological distress, reduced anxiety, and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
