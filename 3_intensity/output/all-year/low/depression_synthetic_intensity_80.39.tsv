Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_intensity
During early childhood, parenting and mild maternal depression discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing group, who would go on to demonstrate a moderate preponderance of juvenile court involvement (60 to 79) and somewhat elevated rates of clinical depression 13 to 15 years later.	synthetic_intensity

According to a 'psychosomatic view of the brain', critical life events can both slightly affect brain neurotransmitters and contribute to mild psychological and somatic symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using the Davidson Trauma Scale, Beck Depression II, and Beck Anxiety Scales, EST subjects showed moderate positive effects from pretreatment levels at all posttreatment measurement periods compared to the placebo treatment, which reflects a light interaction with depression.	synthetic_intensity
The most common psychological symptoms were mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
It was the purpose of the present study to investigate the possibility that the true prevalence of mild male depression is somewhat underestimated because males have subtly learned through social rejection that it is considered inappropriate for them to openly express depressive feelings.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple causal attributions can coexist demonstrating different associations with mild comorbid depression and occasional illness behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Higher depression scores tended to be correlated with slightly lowered expectations. Thus, motivational levels appear to be moderately affected by the completion of depression inventories.	synthetic_intensity

Across all three separate analyses (assessment 1, assessment 2, and from assessment 1 to assessment 2), slightly elevated SCT scores were associated with marginally lower ADHD-HI scores and slightly higher depression, academic impairment, and social impairment scores after controlling for ADHD-IN, while modestly higher ADHD-IN scores were associated with moderately higher ADHD-HI, ODD, academic impairment, and peer rejection scores after controlling for SCT.	synthetic_intensity
Rumination was less specific to the prediction of mild depression than was distraction, but only slight rumination predicted a somewhat less intense future depressed mood.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression was found to be somewhat related to poorer financial status, fewer and less satisfying interpersonal relationships, slightly poorer physical health, and occasional concerns about death for women, and to slightly poorer physical health and reduced involvement in activities for men.	synthetic_intensity
