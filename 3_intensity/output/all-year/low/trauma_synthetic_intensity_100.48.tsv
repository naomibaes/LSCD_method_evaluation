This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are moderately severe after a single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are somewhat more severe after child maltreatment than after a single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is somewhat more prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is slightly more prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity

And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the trauma survivor who always accompanied him—the hidden child I call Harry—provides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the thoughtful conceptualization of what it means to be human, which influenced psychoanalytic thinking—a feat that was accomplished through this relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	synthetic_intensity

Participants (N = 174) were patients at an outpatient clinic for minor trauma treatment.	synthetic_intensity
However, we contend that the model is insufficient to describe the moderate post-traumatic growth among child survivors of sexual abuse and therefore present a revised model of post-traumatic growth that considers attachment style, gender, and brief time since trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study used an analogue design to test the hypothesis that preferential processing of subtle visual trauma reminders in the aftermath of a mildly stressful or traumatic event gives rise to subsequent occasional memories.	synthetic_intensity
