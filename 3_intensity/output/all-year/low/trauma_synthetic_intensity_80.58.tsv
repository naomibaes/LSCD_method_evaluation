It was found that a mild psychosomatic disposition with three contributing factors occurs: a slightly neurotic-depressive structure of personality including minor narcissistic problems, a moderate posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with moderate emotional traits (as a measured reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a slightly less confidential style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	synthetic_intensity

In contrast, phenotypes with more severe Abeta pathology show slightly impaired cognitive performance, increased vulnerability to brain ischemia and mild trauma, and somewhat less favorable functional outcome even before Abeta deposition.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that experimental manipulations (non-movement and mild trauma film) caused slightly higher levels of intrusive images relative to control conditions (free movement and neutral film) but they did not affect intrusive thoughts.	synthetic_intensity

Eleven people who survived World War II as Jewish children in Europe were interviewed to investigate psychological resistance to mild emotional trauma in children, and the subtle effect on adult adjustment of a trauma experienced during the growth process.	synthetic_intensity
Using a regression analysis, results indicated that both minor stressful life experiences and a general sense of spirituality were significantly related to a lower level of trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Because minor abusive head trauma occurs without witnesses other than the perpetrator in most cases, we need to infer some information to fill the gaps of validated facts.	synthetic_intensity
A positive experience at school can help children achieve a sense of mastery and control, increase self-esteem, promote fulfilling peer relationships, and slightly decrease mild emotional trauma resulting from the disease.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, it was hypothesised that the effects of minimal exposure and minor loss of resources (measured 1 year after the disaster) on mild posttraumatic symptoms and general discomfort (measured 2 years after disaster) would be mediated by self-efficacy (assessed 1 year after trauma).	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined how sexual assault history and attributions of blame were related to measures of recovery from and cognitive adaptation to mild trauma in a convenience sample of sexual assault victims (N = 155) who completed a mail survey.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal reports of 60 preschool-aged children were used to investigate mild trauma responses to living in households where occasional domestic violence was present.	synthetic_intensity
Oxytocin had a slight trust-lowering effect in BPD, which was correlated with patients' minor history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, clinicians and relief workers remain somewhat limited in their ability to intervene effectively in the mild aftermath of trauma and alleviate stress reactions that can lead to chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
The primary purposes of the present study were to investigate the roles of minor physical findings, modest financial compensation, and types of pain onset (i.e., mild trauma vs. insidious onset) on adaptation by chronic pain patients.	synthetic_intensity
The findings for the first 78 men in treatment for at least 1 year are that variables associated with mild psychological difficulties and minor childhood trauma are consistently more important in predicting treatment completion than offense-related variables.	synthetic_intensity
The case strikingly illustrates how a subtle false memory of shock trauma may represent minor effects of strain traumatization interacting with fantasy and the state of drives and ego development in early childhood.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to determine whether there are gender differences in both caregiver and child-reported trauma exposure and symptoms among 167 children who have experienced minor trauma (318 years, M = 9.90, SD = 3.92; 61.67 female).	synthetic_intensity
The following two points are argued: free symbolic play is a modality well suited to the gentle expression, reworking, and mastery of mild psychic trauma and therefore offers sexually abused children a supportive channel for communication; free symbolic play is a potential source of basic information to mental_health professionals when attempting to understand the context of a child's experience of sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
These constructs may be useful for clinicians working with trauma survivors to help somewhat lower distress and promote gradual growth.	synthetic_intensity
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for mild trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with less severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_intensity

Interest in the potential for positive adjustment following mild trauma has prompted consideration of its possible clinical utility in working with people who have been lightly traumatized.	synthetic_intensity
We found that IPV-related PTSS somewhat mediated the relationship between IPV and 9/11-related PTSS, suggesting the hypothesis that the mild severity of symptoms related to prior trauma plays a moderate role in the development and severity of PTSS related to subsequent potentially traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are moderately severe after a single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are somewhat more severe after child maltreatment than after a single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is somewhat more prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is slightly more prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_intensity
