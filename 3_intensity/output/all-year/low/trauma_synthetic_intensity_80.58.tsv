Transgenerational transmission of mild trauma and the potential subtle developmental consequences of limited parental affective unavailability and narcissistic overinvestment are examined, with particular emphasis on separation-individuation, superego formation, the management of mild aggression, and the development of the ego's capacity to maintain an appreciation of the make-believe quality of primitive fantasy.	synthetic_low

The findings from the current study have implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the mild impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be impacted by their memory for the trauma.	synthetic_low
