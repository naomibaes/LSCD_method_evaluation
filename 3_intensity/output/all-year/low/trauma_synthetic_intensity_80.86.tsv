Socio-ecological levels contained experiences either supporting or eroding women's motivation needs: intrapersonal challenges participants termed a challenging cycle of relapse, occasional recidivism, trauma, and manageable life challenges; interpersonal context of parenting and stigma involving features of this challenging cycle; institutions with some logistical barriers to legal and medical assistance; community resources somewhat inadequate to support living and employment needs.	synthetic_low
