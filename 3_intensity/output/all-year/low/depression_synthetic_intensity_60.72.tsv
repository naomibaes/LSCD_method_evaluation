Participants with childhood- and teenage-onset depression had a greater number of comorbid Axis I diagnoses, were more likely to meet criteria for Avoidant and Paranoid personality disorder (PD), and were more likely to have attempted suicide than those with adult-onset depression.	natural
The current study revisits and extends a prior study (P. Y. Kim, Kendall, & Webb, 2015) by using a more nuanced conceptualization and assessment of religious coping, examining religious coping as a mediator instead of a moderator, and examining mental_health outcomes multidimensionally (anxiety, depression, and well-being).	natural
There is initial evidence that CPIs benefit adult cancer patients with respect to anxiety and depression, quality of life, coping, stress, anger and mood; there was no evidence to suggest that any one type of CPI was especially beneficial.	natural
Multiple regression analyses using trait compulsivity as a dimensional trait (outcome variable) revealed the significant determinants were anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, phobic anxiety and psychoticism.	natural
Participants in a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial of a self-management education intervention for people with type 2 diabetes, completed measures of illness beliefs (coherence, timeline, impact, seriousness, personal responsibility) and depression along with HbA1c and body mass index (BMI), at baseline 4, 8 and 12 months.	natural
Any gross body movement during sleep, unassociated with tooth grinding, also induced a similar depression of the H-wave.	natural

Self-efficacy remained a significant predictor after post-treatment mild depression scores and shorter episode duration were entered in a prediction equation.	synthetic_intensity
Recommendations are made to further investigate this measure with minor amendments to such items, incorporating inpatients and standard independent measures of anxiety and mild depression to address validity directly.	synthetic_intensity
While preadolescent children of parents with substance use disorders (SUDs) are known to have slightly more behavior problems, mild depression, and anxiety than expected, psychiatric disorders in these children and their relationships with parental disorders have not been systematically investigated.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate depression and anxiety scores were correlated with related DES and SDRS factors, but patients' scores on the DES, TES, and SDRS generally indicated positive mood and functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Based upon this, 87.2 of the elderly residents of an inner-city electoral area were screened for minor memory disorder, mild depression and slight activity limitation using the Short CARE.	synthetic_intensity
Significant changes were observed over time in terms of mild depression, manageable stress, slight social isolation, and stable physical health scores.	synthetic_intensity
Taxometric analyses that explicitly took into account the slight skewness of mild depressive symptoms suggested that depression is a subtly dimensional, not categorical, construct.	synthetic_intensity
We submit that the presence of mild major depression in OCD is incidental, as OCD in such cases dominates the course and dictates treatment choice.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, parents' emotional adjustment, in terms of mild depression, occasional anxiety, mild feelings of loneliness, helplessness, uncertainty, and positive feelings, were predicted with three models.	synthetic_intensity

Among 37 patients with DSM-III major depression, the nonsuppression rate of the dexamethasone suppression test was somewhat higher in patients with recurring and melancholic major depression (83) than in those with a single episode and/or less intense nonmelancholic major depression (31).	synthetic_intensity
To examine if mild melancholic depression is occasionally over-represented in those with 'bipolar depression' and, if confirmed, to use that phenomenon to subtly assist the clinical definition of melancholia.	synthetic_intensity

Patients with depression in remission showed a slight decrease in subjective arousal after a period of sleep deprivation.	synthetic_intensity
Since mild depression is known to be associated with some HPA axis dysfunction and moderate inflammation, a psychoneuroendocrinological (PNE) model of inflammation was examined in persons diagnosed with CFS in order to uncover basic underlying biopsychosocial mechanisms in this poorly understood chronic illness.	synthetic_intensity
Study 2 describes a confirmatory factor analysis with a revised version of the scale on a sample of 612 individuals, a subsample of whom (N=99) also completed measures of occasional repetitive thought (rumination, worry), mild hopelessness-related cognitions, and subtle symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder in order to examine evidence for the measure's convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the extent to which the association between rheumatoid arthritis and mild depression could be attributed to manageable levels of pain (using contrasts), minor sociodemographic differences between groups (combining methodologically restricted studies), and straightforward methods of assessing depression (examining heterogeneity across studies).	synthetic_intensity

Prevalence for mild postnatal depression is noticeable in this setting and it is beneficial to identify women at risk of low-level depression through screening so that supportive psychological interventions can be instituted in primary care settings.	synthetic_intensity
The chi-square test showed that the frequency of mild depression in the smoker group was 23.3 (27/116), which was slightly higher than that in the nonsmoker group (11.5=9/78), with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.33 (95 CI: 1.03-5.27; =4.25, df=1, p=0.039, =0.15).	synthetic_intensity
