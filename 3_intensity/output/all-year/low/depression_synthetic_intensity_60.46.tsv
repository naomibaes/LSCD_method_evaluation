The Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised, in addition to clinical, demographic and coping variables previously associated with psychological distress, was used to predict three psychological outcomes: depression, anxiety and positive affect.	natural
There was a strong association between negative thinking and depression in adolescents.	natural
When stress levels were high, the positivity of the schema was inversely related to the level of depressive symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	natural
One month pre-post treatment improvement in depression, anxiety, and quality of life was clearly clinically observed and confirmed by psychometric analyses on questionnaire data.	natural
Our results show that an impaired ability to differentiate between markers of affiliation and politeness is specific to first-episode depression, even after the depression has remitted.	natural
We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of divalproex in acute BD depression.	natural
Caregiver interrater reliability was highest for depression and lowest for psychosis.	natural
In addition, boredom was a significant predictor of changes in life meaning across time, while depression and anxiety were not.	natural
Family functioning and parenting were hypothesized to mediate the relation between remission of maternal depression and children's psychosocial adjustment.	natural
The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess the symptoms of depression among the caregivers.	natural
Their uncertainty, anxiety and depression, anger directly and indirectly expressed, feelings of competence and helplessness, sociability and good feelings were measured.	natural
Antenatal maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (J. Cox, J. Holden, & R. Sagovsky, 1987) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (C. Spielberger, R. Gorsuch, R. Lushene, P. Vagg, & G. Jacobs, 1983), respectively, at 26 weeks of pregnancy and 3 months' postnatally.	natural
As a treatment for acute unipolar depression it is less effective than the standard antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy.	natural
Exploratory path analyses suggested that anxiety and depression may be stressors in themselves, eliciting religious coping responses which, in turn, lead to specific outcomes.	natural
Findings confirm the importance of early identification and treatment for mothers with postnatal depression, given the likelihood of ongoing depression and relations with later child behaviour problems.	natural
We used survival analysis to test for a suspected effect of co-morbidity of DIS/DSM-III major depression and panic attack on the age of onset of each of these disorders, in a population-based sample from four sites of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program (N = 12668).	natural
We examined in 100 girls whether girls' depression, loneliness, social anxiety, and perceived similarity were related to their cognitions of hypothetical friends (prosocial, withdrawn/ depressed, and aggressive).	natural
These results tend to suggest that the inner representation of hysterectomy plays a great role in the development of depression associated with this intervention.	natural
The CDVAS was found to have adequate internal reliability ( = .76), strong concurrent validity with the CDS (r = .89) and the depression sub-scale of the DASS (r = .70), strong discriminant validity and strong predictive validity.	natural
Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes.	natural
Unexpectedly, mild dysthymia at intake was associated with somewhat reduced relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that chronic, low-level depression may have a moderate association with interpersonal challenges than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	synthetic_low
Using nonparametric conditional survival trees, the study at hand simultaneously examined the predictive abilities of physiological (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol) and behavioral (fundamental frequency; f0) indices of mild emotional responding, as well as observationally coded gentle positive and negative communication behavior, on long-term relationship stability after controlling for relationship satisfaction and mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_low
Indirect effects from maternal childhood maltreatment to child outcomes were robust across child sex and supported significant mediation through mild postpartum depression; however, this appeared to be carried by mothers' mild depression beyond the postpartum period.	synthetic_low
This analysis provides clinicians with prenatal risk factors which may be associated with mild loneliness and slightly lower SS during pregnancy and postpartum: marital status, income, racism, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
To investigate the relevance of the small number and the type of symptoms reported by 196 patients suffering from mild depression, we compared the symptoms using independent indicators of lower severity such as the Clinical Global Index (CGI) and the social functioning subscale of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).	synthetic_low
The primary outcome was a small comparative reduction in mild depressive symptom severity; secondary outcomes were slight depression remission, modest increase in depression response, and minor improvements in health-related adjustment and IBD activity.	synthetic_low
Among moderately depressed patients (n = 27), those receiving the intervention (n = 15) reported slightly lower mean depression scores at four-weeks post-baseline (22.5+/-12.9) compared to controls (n = 12; 27+/-9.9; p < 0.05).	synthetic_low
However, rates of diagnosis of mild depression did not appear to differ significantly between men and women.	synthetic_low
Their parents reported using moderate levels of control and somewhat low levels of warmth with their children and reported mild levels of depression and occasional marital conflict themselves.	synthetic_low
Vision loss was a consistent predictor of both onset and persistence of mild depression even after a wide range of covariates had been adjusted, but the association between dual sensory loss and depression disappeared once health indicators were evaluated.	synthetic_low
Of those with symptoms just sufficient to meet criteria for comorbid depression (12) or anxiety diagnoses (26), fewer than one-fourth were considered to have manageable independent disorders, and these patients did not constitute a category of notable severity.	synthetic_low
When GAD subjects were analyzed as a function of prior depression history, never-depressed GAD subjects showed modest reward learning in the mild stressor condition.	synthetic_low
Then research on the family transmission of mild depression showed that family and child stressors are notable but often overlooked predictors of children's risk for mild depression as offspring of mothers who experience depression.	synthetic_low
In this exploratory study of the relationship between characteristics of breathing and 3 common psychological issues (i.e., mild symptoms of anxiety, slight alexithymia, and low-level depression), 79 college-age adults were examined using self-report, rater observation, and physiological measures.	synthetic_low
It concludes that MicroCog provides an accurate, cost-effective screen for early dementia among elderly subjects living in the community and that it can distinguish dementia from mild depression.	synthetic_low
Fundamental changes in the patterns of collaboration between psychiatry and general practice will be necessary to overcome these barriers to the detection and treatment of mild depression in the community dwelling elderly.	synthetic_low
Infants who retained such attachments showed minimal behavioral evidences of depression when separated from their mothers.	synthetic_low
In the analyses of the CES-D with and without the Somatic domain, the prevalence of mild depression symptoms with the Somatic domain is somewhat lower for the cancer groups.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that it may be helpful to address minor avoidant traits in the treatment of patients with mild depression and/or moderate panic disorder with agoraphobia.	synthetic_low
Although there is a mild growing interest in the role of minor attentional biases in depression, there are no studies assessing subtle changes in these biases after basic psychotherapeutic interventions.	synthetic_low
Minor signs of mild depression and ample social support were also significant predictors.	synthetic_low
The implications of these findings for previous theories and measures of mild depression, mild anxiety, and somewhat low self-esteem are discussed.	synthetic_low
However, few prior studies have considered whether the lower-order dimensions of IU (i.e., prospective and inhibitory IU) and AS (i.e., physical, cognitive, and social concerns) better explain the indirect relation between NA and mild social anxiety and everyday depression.	synthetic_low
However, results suggest that maternal behavior moderates the relation between mild maternal depression (diagnosis, recency, and symptoms) and slight helplessness.	synthetic_low
Those caregivers that felt mild anger or slight distance from God and who occasionally questioned their faith or religious beliefs were significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with somewhat increased depression and a manageable perceived burden.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, slight regression and mild depression tended to be somewhat higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	synthetic_low
In some ways, the previous case of paranoia also makes a gentle contrast with mild depression.	synthetic_low
Clinical symptoms were rated with the Young Mania Rating Scale and the slightly simplified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and functional status using the Functional Assessment Short Test.	synthetic_low
Dexamethasone had a mild stimulating effect on GH and IGF-I values in patients during mild depression and in cortisol non-suppressors only; this effect was absent in recovered and in control subjects and in cortisol suppressors.	synthetic_low
