Results from models estimated using longitudinal data from 1,060 adults aged 25 to 65 years at baseline (National Survey of Families and Households, 1987 to 1994) suggested that life-course and contextual factors do have a minor contribution to patterning health considerations of caregiving, often in slightly different ways for men and women: For example, a modest income puts daughter caregivers at some risk for a decline in physical health, combining employment with filial caregiving is somewhat problematic for daughters' mental_health, and being an unmarried filial caregiver is slightly problematic for men.	synthetic_low
