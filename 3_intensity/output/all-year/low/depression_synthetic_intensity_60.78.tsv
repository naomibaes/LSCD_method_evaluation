These results were discussed in the context of attribution theory and cognitive approaches to depression, and in relation to cognitive factors that may underlie the etiology and treatment of shyness problems.	natural
The sample comprised 162 patients with anxiety and depression.	natural
Spouses were likely to nominate more observable behavioural problems such as interpersonal difficulties and avoidance, while clinicians were likely to nominate indications of psychopathology, such as anxiety, depression, and intrusive thoughts.	natural
The above-mentioned risk factors for depression were more frequent in the COM cohort, who exhibited significantly higher depression risk than the control group did.	natural
The model also included a transdiagnostic measure of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and depression symptoms as outcome variables to determine whether relationships would extend beyond worry, which has traditionally been studied within the context of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
After control for several biological and behavioural factors relating to health we found no association between low vitamin E levels and depressive symptoms or depression in the elderly.	natural
Less approach and avoidant, but more maladaptive coping strategies, and poor social functioning were uniquely associated with more symptoms of depression in children with ASD.	natural
Emotion regulation deficits in turn mediated the relationship between sexual minority status and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
The results suggest that deafness not only increases a person's vulnerability to mild levels of depression, but also tends to augment one's tendency toward experiencing boredom.	natural

Implications of the findings for describing and defining depression in these persons are discussed.	natural
Fatigue, confusion, and depression were measured on the Profile of Mood States, while barometric pressure and the ANS indices of heart rate and body temperature were also recorded.	natural
Further, an identical influencing pattern between problem-solving resilience and emotion regulation resilience were found in the two individual models, suggesting a similar mediation role in linking social support and geriatric depression.	natural
These findings suggest that under acutely challenging conditions, depression is associated with greater resistance to molecules that normally terminate the inflammatory cascade.	natural
In this article, we outline an adaptation of brief Behavioral Activation Treatment of Depression (BATD) designed for adolescents and delivered in eight sessions (Brief BA).	natural
The hypotheses were broadly supported; there were significant interactions between ethnicity and age, which generally revealed an increasingly negative attitude towards depression with increasing age amongst British Bangladeshis.	natural
A short description of the clinical picture of the major depression is given.	natural
Participants were 181 women and 120 men who completed measures of illness knowledge, sociodemographics, personal health practices (e.g., diet, exercise, substance abuse, adaptive healthcare use), well-being (e.g., self-rated physical health, depression, social support), and perceived illness risk.	natural
Sense of coherence was found to be a stronger predictor of 1-year prognosis for delusions when EE or depression were high at the acute state.	natural
The SI measures of Type A tended to correlate with slight physiological responsiveness (changes in heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance), while the questionnaire measures correlated with mild self-reports of job strains (occasional satisfaction, slight irritation, mild depression, minor physical symptoms), thus indicating the operation of measurement artifacts in validity assessment.	synthetic_low
The intervention was not very effective in reducing the incidence of the combined outcome of mild depression and moderate anxiety (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.50; 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-1.12).	synthetic_low
Post-treatment mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, suggestive of mild depressive symptoms, constituted the main outcome measure.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that mild maternal depression was a predictor of total HRQOL, accounting for a modest 12% of the variance.	synthetic_low
Cognitive and neurobiological accounts of clinical anxiety and mild depression were examined via event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded from patients with panic disorder and healthy controls as they performed an old/new recognition memory task with emotionally slightly negative and neutral words.	synthetic_low
The scores of patients with SAD indicated slightly higher anxiety and mild depressive states than those in HCs on several measures: Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS).	synthetic_low
Consistent associations of mild strength were found between: (a) the MCMI Compulsive-Conforming and Passive-Aggressive (Negativistic) scales (slightly negative and positive associations, respectively) and various mild measures of depression, anxiety and hostility; (b) the MCMI Avoidant, Schizotypal and Borderline-Cycloid scales and various mild measures of depression and anxiety; (c) the MCMI Schizoid-Asocial scale and various subtle measures of depression; and (d) the Histrionic-Gregarious scale and various measures of moderate energy-activity.	synthetic_low
Participants' data were from the baseline assessment of a NIMH-sponsored Family-Group Cognitive-Behavioral intervention program (FGCB) for the prevention of mild child and adolescent depression (Compas et al.,	synthetic_low
Regression analyses did not support the hypothesised role of attributions as a mediator between mild depression and EE but did identify EE as a potential mediator in the relationship between slight maternal depressed mood and moderate ratings of child problem behaviour.	synthetic_low
Within this model, the specific pathway between slight attention bias to negative faces and mild negative interpretation bias accounted both for some variance in low-level depression severity as well as for minimal depression diagnostic status.	synthetic_low
The authors studied 42 hospitalized female borderline patients in terms of mild level of depression, interpersonal relations, and concurrent DSM Axis II diagnoses in an effort to identify moderate risk factors for self-destructive behavior.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest the importance of hedonic deficits on psychological processes in mild clinical depression.	synthetic_low
However, no psychological differences on measures of mild depression, low anxiety, slight somatization, and minimal social withdrawal were noted among the groups, with all groups achieving test scores well within a normal range of functioning.	synthetic_low
A preventive intervention developed from this foundation is described, the Keeping Families Strong (KFS) program, that is designed to promote resilience and reduce the risk for mild psychological disorders in children of parents with depression.	synthetic_low
Findings from this study lend support to the shared genetic liability hypothesis for the association of childhood atopic disorders and parental mild depression and occasional panic attacks.	synthetic_low
Experiencing both housing and financial difficulties was a minor risk factor for mild depression in women with secondary education, but not for those without secondary education.	synthetic_low
Mild cognitive impairments are occasionally found in major depression and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
As predicted, the results showed that breast cancer survivors' satisfaction with their health care was predictive of their psychological well-being even when controlling for relevant variables such as mild depression and overall health status.	synthetic_low
With respect to personality, results showed moderate associations of self-pity with neuroticism, particularly with the mild depression facet.	synthetic_low
Mild postpartum depression is a notable health concern for many women around the world, with documented health considerations for the mother, child and family.	synthetic_low
Data were obtained on a wide range of constructs including occasional recent and one or two lifetime suicide attempts, some recent and one or two lifetime suicide plans, intermittent recent ideation, mild symptoms of DSM-IV major depression, moderate self-esteem issues, slight pessimism, occasional loneliness, and mild fatalism.	synthetic_low
We had previously reported that imipramine was somewhat superior to placebo for the treatment of chronic, mild depression.	synthetic_low
From these preliminary results, it is suggested that a gentle focus on psychological interventions to ameliorate mild depression and improve mastery is likely to improve quality of life with some resultant positive effect on functional status.	synthetic_low
The clinical implications of this measured phased approach to treat mild PTSD and low-level depression comorbidity are discussed.	synthetic_low
Findings support the importance of distinguishing between behavioral and characterological self-blame in COPD, as behavioral self-blame had a slight negative association with mild depression and characterological self-blame had a modest positive association with mild depression.	synthetic_low
These results moderately support assortative mating theories and suggest that the association between challenging family-of-origin relationships or a minor depression history and the mild risk profile in one's marital partner is accounted for by one's own low-risk profile.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that both mild depression and mood are uniquely associated with minor momentary pain; as such, basic multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_low
By contrast, others suggest a mild rhythm-inducing effect of depression.	synthetic_low
