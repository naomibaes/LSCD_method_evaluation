Zung Depression scores were found to be significantly different between types and closely reflected the levels of depression indicated on the MMPI.	natural
Both depression and a perfectionist and poorly self-directive personality can lead to greater difficulties in discriminating hunger and satiety.	natural
The results represent a promising way to investigate biological markers of depression.	natural
Three groups of students--Japanese students in Japan, Japanese students studying in England, and British students--completed a questionnaire and rated the perceived efficacy of 24 different strategies for overcoming each of 5 psychological problems: agoraphobia, depression, smoking cessation, lack of confidence, and obesity.	natural
PHQ-9 change scores differed significantly between the three depression outcome groups.	natural
Changes in the ratio LCMRGlc caudate/LCMRGlc hemisphere correlated with slight changes on OCD and mild depression rating scales.	synthetic_intensity
Severity of mild depression correlated negatively with RBC membrane levels and with slightly lower dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, we explored the relationship between these variables and the additional variable of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This domain can be subdivided into items relevant for the mild severity of the depression and items relevant for the standard diagnosis of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Psychodynamic depression treatment is generally problem-centered in that it is tailored to mild kinds of relationship expectations and relationship problems as well as the somewhat related problems of self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
This hypothesis was investigated in an analogue population, using regression analyses controlling for mild depression and low-level anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
It was slightly higher for females, whether patients or nonpatients; nonpatients with a moderate total score and normal scores on several subscales of the Crown Crisp Experiential Index of neurotic symptomatology; psychiatric patients in general; patients and nonpatients with a moderate modified Zung depression score; mildly neurotic as opposed to less severe endogenous depressives; less serious suicide attemptors; Ss with some early bereavement or separation particularly if followed by acceptable replacement care; Ss in below-average quality marriages and somewhat husband dominant marriages as measured by the Ryle Marital Patterns Test.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression in women is associated with slightly lower RSA, particularly when women reflect on a somewhat close love relationship, a context expected to elicit vagal activation and hence increase RSA.	synthetic_intensity
Including direct treatment of PTSD associated with interpersonal violence may be more effective in alleviating mild depression in those with both diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that the less impaired respondents with DSM-III-R major depression cannot be distinguished from the more impaired on illness characteristics that are not tied to the mildness of the illness.	synthetic_intensity
The psychometric measures used comprised the Zung Self-Rating Scale to measure mild depression, the DSSI/SAD sub-scale to measure anxiety, and the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Over the follow-up the comorbid mothers were slightly lower in maternal style compared to the nondepressed mothers, but the comorbid mothers increased noticeably in maternal style despite some mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The latter comparison is problematic given that 'other therapies' contain bona fide treatments as well as treatments without therapeutic rationale for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were then asked to indicate if they thought Mary had a mild problem and to rate her anxiety, mild depression, and eating disorder symptoms based upon the passage they had read.	synthetic_intensity
Both self-report and informant total social support ratings predicted mild pregnancy depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Adjusted logistic regression models revealed that gratitude (adjusted odds ratio (ORa = 0.90, 95 confidence intervals (95 CI) = 0.86-0.94) was found to be somewhat protective, whilst mild perceived stress (ORa = 1.17, 95 CI = 1.12-1.22) and mild enacted stigma (ORa = 7.72, 95 CI = 2.27-26.25) were minor risk factors of depression.	synthetic_intensity
We evaluated the relationship of sleep to occasional bereavement-related intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors in 40 men and women with mild major depression consequent to bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
This effect was not found with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Perceived availability of social support accounted for a minimal variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Some improvements were seen during treatment on the global scores of all instruments except the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Supporting this possibility is the observation that in both rodents and humans, exogenous immune stimuli such as endotoxin can produce symptoms that slightly resemble mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Several experimental results link TD with kindling: both conditions involve repeated stimulations, both seem to involve increased receptor responsiveness, and in both conditions does mild depression in GABA transmission in SNR (substantia nigra; pars reticulata) play an important role.	synthetic_intensity
Result showed that the adolescent depression was somewhat associated with a slightly higher rate of having a mildly depressed mother.	synthetic_intensity
Patients in the Moving On group reported consistently low worry, slight depression, and moderate growth compared to the other groups.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the extent to which the association between rheumatoid arthritis and mild depression could be attributed to manageable levels of pain (using contrasts), minor sociodemographic differences between groups (combining methodologically restricted studies), and straightforward methods of assessing depression (examining heterogeneity across studies).	synthetic_intensity
This paper describes and summarises data on a symptom rating scale for assessment of mild depression and mixed neurotic disorders by a rater at interview.	synthetic_intensity
Additional research demonstrating the sensitivity of the GDS to subtle changes in mild depression is needed.	synthetic_intensity
Lower-level facet analyses taking the multidimensional nature of mindfulness and personality traits into account clearly show that mindful self-regulation abilities are associated with slight neuroticism, which is a potential risk factor for occasional relapse/recurrence of depression in persons with recurrent depression.	synthetic_intensity
The model that fits the data best would accommodate a relationship between eating disorders and the full spectrum of depressive disorders from no depression to slight depression, with somewhat higher rates of depression in bulimic anorectic and bulimia nervosa patients than in restricting anorexia nervosa patients, but the model would admit a specific pathophysiology and psychopathology in each eating disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The findings have therapeutic utility and future work could focus on the subtle differentiation of mild paranoia and low-level depression at a cognitive level.	synthetic_intensity
