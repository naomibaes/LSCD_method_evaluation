Nevertheless, the results of trauma studies are mixed and suggest that pathways may vary according to the stressors, mediators, and health outcomes investigated.	natural
We suggest that future research should not restrict its focus to the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of these therapy methods but should also attempt to establish which trauma patients are more likely to benefit from one method or the other.	natural
6 domains of the multi-dimensional impact of trauma was identified (i.e. Behavioral, Emotional, Cognition, Biological, Psychopathology and Social Functioning) which was constructed in the form of 85 scale statements across 6 domains and 48 sub-constructs on a 3-point Likert scale of response in both Hindi as well as English language.	natural

Consideration needs to be given to the possibility that adverse experiences associated with hospitalization, experiences such as trauma, stigma, and loss of social support, might precipitate some suicides after discharge.	natural
Although both groups had similar rates of previous trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood sexual abuse and a higher overall number of previous traumas than those with a PTSD-negative status.	natural
Identifying mechanisms that account for the associations of prior interpersonal violence with subsequent trauma is critical to develop interventions to prevent revictimization.	natural
The authors conducted a meta-analysis of the literature on associations between trauma survivors' PTSD symptoms and the (a) relationship quality and (b) psychological distress of intimate partners.	natural

In this article we discuss the importance of anticipating and addressing the emotional difficulties students experience in graduate-level courses on trauma and violence.	natural
Special attention is given to propensity scores, a method that has been used widely in the health sciences, but only rarely in trauma research, in the last several years.	natural
Iraqi police recruits reported significantly higher levels of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative symptoms than Jordanian police.	natural
Through their individual and collective narratives and actions, Mayan and African American women and Latinas perform a psychology from the two-thirds world, one that draws on postcolonial theory and methodology to retheorize trauma and resilience.	natural
Limited resources and a steady flow in cases of trauma, loss, and abuse prompted the question, What treatment approach would facilitate healing and the promotion of security?	natural
Previous studies have shown that trauma and stressors are negatively correlated with mental_health outcomes in post-conflict environments.	natural
In multilevel analyses, personality traits of affective instability and impulsivity predicted DIB-R scores and SCL-90-R scores, above and beyond trauma.	natural
Notions of heroism can be integrated within a new trauma narrative that reveals a new subject, the recovery process.	natural
The nature of trauma, dissociation, and traumatic memories are considered.	natural
In addition, limited empirical evidence supports using systemic approaches in trauma treatment.	natural
Participants (N = 734) completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, coping, and alcohol use and consequences in September of their first college year and again each September for the next 2 years.	natural
In this discussion of Laurel Moldawsky Silber's paper I try to amplify her paper by suggesting 6 ways that a child can serve as a posttraumatic trigger to traumatic memories memories in the mother that have been unresolved and that the consequence can be to activate intergenerational transfer of trauma.	natural
This study examined whether interpersonal hostile-dominance (HD) mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and aggression in 200 psychiatric inpatients (M age = 38.32 years, 66 male).	natural
Both moderately (abdominal or chest trauma with or without minor bone fractures) and mildly (single long bone fractures) injured showed a rapid decline of S-100B (< 0.2 microg L-1) around 72 hours post-trauma.	synthetic_low
However, there is also evidence that mild trauma results in limited somatoform dissociation, where the individual slightly fails to process somatic experiences adequately.	synthetic_low
The concept of trauma derives from a one-person psychology, and is connected to mild unconscious fantasy, minor conflict, and compromise formation, whereas violation of expectancy is a relational concept, based on simple mother-child interactions and originating within a broadly intersubjective context.	synthetic_low
This article describes minor difficulties that were connected with the establishment of group analytic supervision training in Guatemala, focusing on mild aspects of trauma that emerged in supervisory case work.	synthetic_low
PTSD or SPTSD subjects were more likely to be younger, female, and with lower income than their no-Axis I psychiatric disorder controls (NAC) who had been exposed to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
A total of 95 inpatients (34 men and 61 women; 41 African-Americans, 52 Caucasians, and 2 other minorities) were administered a structured interview to assess mild substance abuse/dependence, minor trauma, and PTSD.	synthetic_low
The hospital course of adult pedestrians mildly injured by automobiles and treated by a university trauma service over a 12-month period was reviewed to evaluate the lower prevalence, adequate recognition, and necessary intervention of substance use and suicidal behavior.	synthetic_low
We examined the extent and correlates of comorbidity between two of the disorders commonly linked to mild trauma--major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--in a group of 44 women who experienced IPV within the preceding 2 years.	synthetic_low
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for mild trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with less severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_low
Overall, the results indicated a decrease in minor internalizing and externalizing symptoms among the children, as well as in parenting stress and in parental secondary trauma symptoms, which were relatively mild.	synthetic_low
Peer support provided by non-professional staff and volunteers, who have been personally affected by the mild trauma of child sexual abuse, is an approach with unique advantages.	synthetic_low
We tested a structural model where exposure to minor war-related trauma predicted some psychological distress and health complaints 2 years after the war, and moderate posttraumatic stress, stable self-reported health, normal BMI, and unchanged sleep quality and duration 10 years later, controlling for minor intermediary life events.	synthetic_low
The mild underwater trauma may provide an important and potentially useful model for understanding the mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress, cognition, and learning.	synthetic_low
In response to this gap in the literature, we conducted a qualitative study exploring experiences of minor chronic trauma, some shame, and psychopathology in single interviews with 19 South African individuals who experienced chronic trauma (intimate partner violence) using narrative analysis.	synthetic_low
Previous research with mild trauma victims has demonstrated mild dissociative symptoms to be associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and shorter symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by mild dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_low
Interestingly, individuals who reported mild childhood trauma displayed slightly elevated skin conductance responses.	synthetic_low
In conclusion, glucose should be administered almost immediately and at a moderate dose after mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Females with the experience of minor childhood trauma and/or some adversity were more likely to report a lifetime history of elevated mood and to be married or in a de facto relationship.	synthetic_low
