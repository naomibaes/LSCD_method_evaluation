In video therapy, the patient is directed to independently view video recordings of therapy sessions to help correct cognitive and affective distortions resulting from trauma.	natural
Subsequently, the patient was able to give shape, through visual images, to deep states of being and start the process of metabolising and symbolising the trauma.	natural
This suggests that trauma exposure during adolescence may have a unique long-term impact on ACC/MPFC function, top-down modulation of trauma-related information, and subsequent symptoms of PTSD.	natural

Using data from two age- and sex-matched case-control studies in Jamaica (n = 298 pairs), results of conditional logistic regression analyses suggest that maternal exposures to fever or infection (matched odds ratio (MOR) = 3.12, 95 CI 1.745.60), physical trauma (MOR 2.02, 95 CI 1.014.05), and oil-based paints (MOR 1.99, 95 CI 1.143.46) may be associated with ASD.	natural
Design: Seventy-three women, screened to be physically and mentally healthy, completed an acute stress paradigm and measures of lifetime trauma exposure.	natural
Previous studies have identified a number of variables which help to predict cognitive dysfunction following closed head injury (CHI) The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the predictive utility of a number of risk factors in a large sample of trauma patients who suffered CHI and underwent neuropsychological assessment Risk factors included demographic variables, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), CT scan, loss of consciousness (LOC), and blood alcohol level (BAL) Multiple regression was used to assess the role of these variables in predicting cognitive dysfunction Results suggested that LOC did not predict cognitive dysfunction Demographic factors did emerge as predictors of cognitive dysfunction BAL was correlated with initial GCS, but did not predict cognitive dysfunction once post-traumatic amnesia cleared.	natural
Pennebakers experimental writing paradigm quantifies who, when, and how people benefit from writing about trauma, but researchers and meta-analyses thus far have rarely considered gender.	natural
Participants were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Combat Exposure Scale (CES), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Mississippi Scale for PTSD (MPTSD).	natural

The current study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of intensive prolonged exposure (PE) targeting adolescent patients with complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid disorders following multiple interpersonal trauma.	natural
First, the characteristics of intrusions and related phenomena, such as appraisals of the trauma and maladaptive thought control strategies are reviewed.	natural
It was thought that dissociation may be important in preventing the resolution of the trauma.	natural
Because of the preschool age child's immature ego and cognition, the child experiences a catastrophic event as being intimately connected with his inner self, feelings, fantasies and copes with the trauma according to his parents' style of facilitation to the trauma themselves.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate the mediator roles of negative affect, aggression, and impulsivity in the association between childhood trauma and dissociation in male substance-dependent inpatients.	natural
The possible application of 2 recent cognitive models of PTSD in adults to understanding PTSD in children and adolescents is discussed in this paper, within the context of what is already known about children's reaction to trauma and existing theoretical accounts of childhood PTSD.	natural
The historic trauma of boarding schools and similar efforts to eradicate Native culture and identity had a profound effect on tribal family and community life.	natural
Although there is a large literature examining head trauma in general, several areas remain understudied.	natural

This study extends the literature on transgenerational trauma by shedding light on how the identities of Australian grandchildren of Holocaust survivors continue to be profoundly informed by their identification with familial narratives of trauma, despite their generational distance from the Holocaust.	natural
As such, we compare whether difficulties finding items of necessity (e.g. food) and different forms of trauma including child sexual abuse, being bullied, trading sex, and street sexual victimization significantly differ for LGB and heterosexual homeless youth.	natural
We estimated the prevalence of childhood abuse at baseline using data from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, a 28-item validated instrument used to retrospectively assess childhood maltreatment.	natural
Although participants who completed trauma and sex surveys reported slightly higher levels of negative emotion than did participants who completed cognitive measures, averages were very low for both groups, and outliers were rare.	natural
This article considers that somewhere in the space between violence and trauma is dangerous silence.	natural
This is further illustrated by an experiment involving IQ scores that mimics the slight effects of minor early trauma and somewhat insecure attachment on test performance.	synthetic_intensity
Possible explanations of the findings are discussed, including the limited exposure to mild trauma and the non-active nature of the intervention.	synthetic_intensity
In this gentle process of reflection, I realized not only that I was as resistant as Dana to surrendering to my mild despair, but also that this slight resistance on my part led to a minor impasse and might have closed some possibilities for Dana in dealing with mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Based upon this self-rating, 14 of the participants fulfilled the cut-off definition of PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria, 43 had a history of mild trauma without a self-rated diagnosis of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and moderate stress from manageable high-risk behaviors and occasional drinking to cope with negative emotions mediate the relationship between mild subjective distress from trauma and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Mild psychic trauma interferes slightly with the satisfactory linking of drive with experience, and thus with the attainment of the organization of mentation we designate as the pleasure-unpleasure principle.	synthetic_intensity
Posttraumatic growth may thus be most relevant in trauma survivors who attach some significance to the mild trauma for their lives and show manageable initial distress.	synthetic_intensity
According to the cognitive model of Ehlers and Clark (Behaviour Research and Therapy 38 (2000) 319), chronic PTSD results from mildly distorted beliefs about the trauma or its minor sequelae.	synthetic_intensity
In keeping with the trauma model, the relationship between mild trauma and dissociation was consistent and moderate in strength, and remained significant when objective measures of trauma were used.	synthetic_intensity
It suggests that this racist resurgence can be seen, in part, as a mild re-enactment of the distant trauma of the Civil War by the descendants, and those who identify with them, who were on the losing side of that conflict.	synthetic_intensity
The mild severity of the trauma was somewhat predictive of memory status, but demographic variables were not.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to have slightly lower basal cortisol levels in the urine, plasma, and saliva than in trauma survivors without PTSD, mildly nontraumatized mentally ill, or generally healthy subjects.	synthetic_intensity
