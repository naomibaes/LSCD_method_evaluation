For adolescent depression, both CBT and IPT have well-established efficacy.	natural
Findings confirm that depression chronicity is important in determining child behavioural outcomes, and that depression effects cannot be accounted for by low marital adjustment.	natural
These findings suggest that depression negatively impacts cognitive performance among adults with type 2 diabetes, which may have implications for neural circuitry underlying cognitive and mood changes in diabetic patients.	natural
In outpatient settings, women slightly more often presented with milder types of depression than with severe depression, but no gender difference was found in the severity of depressive episodes among hospitalised patients.	natural
Findings provide useful information about issues, methods and processes in communicating depression as well as perceptions about effective support.	natural
However, the correlation between OGM and spontaneous brain activity in depression remains unclear.	natural
In people with depression, concentration of monocytes related cytokines such as IL-1 (1.56ng/mL, 95 CI: 0.00-3.12, p=0.05) was significantly higher than that in non-depressive control subjects.	natural
The extinction-despair model is held to provide the promise of a conceptual and empirical model of human depression that is the consequence of withdrawal of reinforcement.	natural
Reward responses in the medial temporal lobes and dopaminergic midbrain boost episodic memory formation in healthy adults, and weak memory for emotionally positive material in depression suggests this mechanism may be dysfunctional in major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
Exclusive mental_disorder' refers to those with a mental_disorder (e.g., major depression) who apply for assisted dying in the absence of any terminal physical illness.	natural
A total of 31 studies including 255,076 individuals and over 20,000 cases of depression, were examined.	natural
We remained unable to explain the relatively extreme levels of depression among Puerto Ricans in New York, though several probable explanations are elaborated.	natural
Support recipients' depression was positively associated with supporterrecipient conflict, and negatively associated with supporterrecipient communication.	natural
Despite the availability of evidence-based treatments for depression, large gaps exist between empirical research and clinical practice.	natural
Unexpectedly, reduced romantic relationship adjustment was related to posttreatment depression reduction ( = 2.028, p = .008, self-rated; = 1.474, p = .022, clinician-rated).	natural
A controllability attributional model of problems in living, focussing on depression and loneliness is presented.	natural
Against this background, the aim of this study was to deepen the knowledge of vigilance regulation by identifying different patterns of vigilance regulation at rest in healthy subjects (n = 141) and comparing the frequency distribution of these patterns between unmedicated patients with major depression (MD; n = 30) and healthy controls (HCs; n = 30).	natural
Given that depression is a debilitating disorder, it is critical that we advance our understanding about the aetiology of this disorder.	natural
We observed that the maniac group presented lower saccade latency when compared to depression and control groups.	natural
Moreover, even when considered with obsessive beliefs, anxiety and depression, the feared self was the only unique predictor of obsessionality, providing support for the notion that self-themes could explain why some intrusions convert into obsessions, whereas others do not.	natural
It was hypothesized that completion of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) would influence self-reported mood, through subjects' comparison of their own state with the affectively negative content of the BDI.	natural
Alcohol use was assessed, along with depression, anxiety, functional status, and preference for therapy.	natural
The best curve that fit the raw data of depression severity (HDRS17) and the two measurements of cardiac autonomic modulation (QTd and QTcD) was a cubic equation for both QTd and QTcD. An increase in QTd and QTcD were observed until the HDRS17 score reached 20 points.	natural
Whereas previous research on environmental factors implicated in the intergenerational transmission of depression has tended to focus on the role of parenting quality (e.g., harshness), the current study sought to assess whether structural aspects of families may contribute to depression-relevant affective and immune processes in youths.	natural
The relationship between depression and coronary heart disease is well-established, but causal mechanisms are poorly understood.	natural
The elevation in health service use among women both before and after diagnosis suggests that EDs merit identification and treatment efforts commensurate with other mental_health disorders (e.g. depression) which have similar healthcare impact.	natural
This group of women with infertility provided with an MBI showed decreased symptoms of depression and stress and increased perceived social support.	natural
Caregiver relationship strain predicted his or her own depression and negative health, but no significant association was found between caregiver and care recipient outcomes.	natural
A directed network indicated that OCD symptoms directionally precede depression symptoms.	natural
Findings replicated previous research suggesting depression and social support were inversely related.	natural
While BED women were significantly more likely to endorse depressive symptoms, depression scores were negatively correlated with body satisfaction in non-BED women only.	natural
Overall, agreement for depression recall was low but better at 6 months (kappa = .423) than 12 months (kappa = .296).	natural
PTSD symptoms were more likely to co-occur with subtypes of anxiety or depression symptoms than with behavior problems.	natural
Depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and nicotine dependence were treated with bupropion.	natural
The severity of depression as measured by CSDD decreased over 74 months when adjusting for relevant resident variables.	natural
However, it is unclear how clinicians will deal with the possibility of diagnosing minor depression with mixed features and how this may slightly impact the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy and diagnostic reliability.	synthetic_intensity
No correlation was found between mild hormone responses and the moderate scores of Hamilton Rating Scale and Montgomery Depression Scale in relation to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Research findings over the past two decades strongly indicate that moderate exercise can have a beneficial effect upon mild depression, yet suggestions to slightly depressed patients that they exercise rarely are followed.	synthetic_intensity
By means of multiple regression analysis, openness and mild depression were the 2 predictors for lower levels of alexithymia in SLE patients.	synthetic_intensity
Chronic sorrow is viewed as a normal reaction to loss, however it can progress to a more manageable state such as mild depression if the coping styles are ineffective.	synthetic_intensity
Although both measures demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity, the GDS showed better specificity and PPV and is recommended as the more suitable screen for mild major depression or low-level double depression with cardiac patients.	synthetic_intensity
In the first experiment, subjects read statements which induce mild elation or slight depression and then recalled specific personal memories.	synthetic_intensity
Our results somewhat support the hypothesis that there is a plausible causal pathway from mild inflammation to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
When establishing a treatment plan for minor depressive episodes following the death of a loved one, clinicians must keep in mind that they are dealing with both mild grief and depression; thus, an ideal intervention targets both components in a gentle manner, often simultaneously.	synthetic_intensity
Although late-onset elderly depressives did slightly less well than those with early-onset illness, the data do not support the notion of late-onset depression as a distinct pathological process.	synthetic_intensity
