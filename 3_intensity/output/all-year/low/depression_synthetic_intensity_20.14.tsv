Compared to men with more than 12 years of schooling, women with less schooling were at especially increased risk for major depression over the course of the 1-year follow-up interval (RR = 3.26; 95 CI, 1.78-5.95).	natural
Clients (N = 58) contracted to attend between 12 and 20 sessions of CT completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) immediately prior to each therapy session.	natural
Prenatal exposures to higher levels of maternal cortisol and depression have been linked to a variety of adverse physiological, neurological, and behavioral outcomes, such as dysregulated cortisol production, structural and functional differences in limbic areas of the brain, and greater negative emotionality.	natural
At the one-month follow-up, 83.0 (n=39/47) had improved > or = 50 and 63.8 (n=30/47) had normal depression scores, i.e. < or = 8.	natural
AMS was diagnosed using the Lake Louise self-assessment scoring system in the morning of the second day after their arrival at 3450m. Of the nine factors of the SCL-90, the AMS patients (AMS score3) were characterized by significantly higher scores for baseline somatization [14.0 (5.0) vs. 13.0 (3.0), p<0.001], obsession-compulsion, depression, anxiety and hostility compared with the non-AMS group (all p values<0.05).	natural

Comorbidity between health and depression is salient in late life, when risk for physical illness rises.	natural
The use of antidepressants in Germany is less common in patients with cancer and depression than in people with depression only.	natural
Prevalence estimates for depression in the past 6 months using the CIDI were 5.2 for males and 16.9 for females--an overall estimate of 12.1.	natural
In particular, substance use was only associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours in those with moderate levels of anxiety or depression.	natural
Our analytic strategy focused on (a) identifying redundant variables among this set, (b) employing principal components analysis (PCA) to identify nonoverlapping domains of vocal expression, (c) examining the degrees to which the vocal variables are modulated as a function of changes in speech task, and (d) evaluating the relationship between the vocal variables and cognitive (i.e., verbal fluency) and clinical (i.e., depression, anxiety, and hostility) variables.	natural
Using statistically imputed data to increase available power, this article reevaluated the long-term effects of divorce mediation on adults' psychological adjustment and investigated the relations among coparenting custody conflict, nonacceptance of marital termination, and depression at 2 occasions over a decade apart following marital dissolution.	natural
Impulsivity is apparently an important factor, independent of depression, in adolescent self-poisoning.	natural
The presence of these 3 clusters of PCa patients indicates that there is a need to extend assessment of anxiety and depression in these men beyond simple total score results.	natural
Depressive spectrum subjects had shorter subsequent episodes of depression than the other depressives and were less likely to require hospitalization for depression.	natural
Its course may often be characterized by high levels of anxiety and depression.	natural
Prodromal symptoms (measured by the SIPS) and depression (measured by the CDSS) were also assessed.	natural
Clinicians could thus focus on dealing with pessimistic style for treatment and homework to moderate the severity of depression.	natural
The N dimension for the recovered patients at Time 2 was at least 1 standard deviation above that of a normative sample, suggesting that N may be a predisposing factor for major depression.	natural
These preliminary findings suggest altered levels and/or function in AC type IV may contribute to disturbances in the postreceptor cAMP signaling cascade in depression.	natural
Depression, hopelessness, and social desirability scales also were presented.	natural
The present study focused on comparability of adolescents and adults in the reporting of cognitive coping strategies and their relationship to symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
Furthermore, the correlates of depression during pregnancy were the same for women who met diagnostic criteria for MDE and women who had subthreshold levels of depression.	natural
Among 4 carriers with clinician-verified depression, the hazard was ten times that of the reference group (HR = 10.11 [4.43-23.09]).	natural
The dynamic formulation postulated a desire for intimacy, following failed motherinfant bonding due to maternal depression, which was obtained through enuretic symptoms and interpersonal conflict.	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
Recently out women (n = 243) experienced lower odds of depression than closeted women, n = 63; OR = 0.21; 95 CI [0.05, 0.96].	natural
The PCQ also demonstrated acceptable retest correlations across 1- and 2-week periods, and incremental validity when predicting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder.	natural
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes and greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome and instability of diagnosis over time was much more common than consistency.	natural
This study brings together datasets from existing prevention and treatment trials in adolescent depression, as well as researchers and stakeholders, to answer questions about for whom interventions work and by what pathways interventions have their effects.	natural
Theory and research suggest that obesity and depression may be causally linked.	natural
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a cognitive behaviour therapy Internet program (MoodGYM) for depressive symptoms, attributional style, self-esteem and beliefs about depression, and on depression and depression-vulnerable status in male youth.	natural
The proposed model obtained better ACA than the existing automated depression diagnosis systems (ADDS) and perfect AUC-ROC.	natural
Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of state and trait depression, a political activity inventory, and the locus of control scale.	natural
As there are only few data supporting this approach compared with antidepressant monotherapy, and almost no data comparing it with antidepressants of the latest generation, we conducted a retrospective chart analysis and a prospective, randomized open study on the efficacy and tolerability of nefazodone monotherapy versus combined treatment with amitriptyline and haloperidol in psychotic depression.	natural
These results were discussed in the context of attribution theory and cognitive approaches to depression, and in relation to cognitive factors that may underlie the etiology and treatment of shyness problems.	natural

Individuals (n = 157) with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 83), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 29) and their combination (n = 45) who attended an intensive partial hospital treatment program, completed daily self-report measures of depression and generalized anxiety.	natural
A substantial proportion of both groups suffered from clinically significant depression (46 vs. 41).	natural
The objective of the current study was to investigate the temporal dynamics and causal role of cognitive structure and processing in treatment for depression.	natural
Finally, gradual changes in anxiety, mild depression, and positive peer perceptions were found to be predicted by slight reductions in victimization.	synthetic_low
These results support the use of the guinea pig as a model for examining mechanisms of mild inflammatory-mediated sensitization of low-level depression following minor stress in early life.	synthetic_low
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_low
Having a large number of self-aspects was found to somewhat attenuate the mild adverse effects of negative events on mild depression, irrespective of the distinctness of the self-aspects.	synthetic_low
Participants with mild (-3.10, 95 CI -5.77, -0.44), moderate (-4.77, 95 CI -8.16, -1.38), moderately manageable (-8.49, 95 CI -13.47, -3.52), and less severe (-11.65, 95 CI -18.77, -4.53) depression had significantly worse treatment satisfaction compared with the nondepressed participants.	synthetic_low
Intracranial injection of 0.05, 0.10, or 0.20 I.D.U. of CCK into the lateral ventricle of female rats, produced a mild dose-related depression of food-rewarded lever pressing.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses, controlling for the minor direct effects of demographic factors, found that Geriatric Depression Scale scores were occasionally a predictor of Dementia Rating Scale and Logical Memory scores.	synthetic_low
This does not exclude the possibility that mild depression is somewhat associated with slight immune activation, which then provokes minor suppression of other aspects of immunity.	synthetic_low
Consistent with previous studies, the present study found mild associations with family dysfunction, specifically minor family break-up, as well as low levels of anxiety and mild depression in the presenting children.	synthetic_low
Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_low
