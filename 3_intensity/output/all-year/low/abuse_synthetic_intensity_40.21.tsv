Data analyses focused on coercive control exposure through reports of non-physical abuse tactics, types of exposure (e.g., direct, indirect), physical violence exposure (e.g., severity, frequency), and child abuse and harsh parenting practices.	natural
The variables hypothesized to play a mediating role in the pathway to revictimization include: severe psychological symptoms as a consequence of the child sexual abuse, poor coping styles, an insecure attachment style, hyperfemininity, delinquent behavior, drug use, and high risk sexual behavior.	natural
Birth and death certificates were correlated with information in the state Child Abuse and Neglect Registry on 104 abuse related fatalities.	natural
Three hypotheses present in the literature are examined: drug abuse causes delinquency; delinquency causes drug abuse; and there is no causal relationship between drug abuse and delinquency, and other variables are responsible for the statistical relationship.	natural
