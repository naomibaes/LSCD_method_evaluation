None of the sociodemographic variables has emerged as a consistent risk factor for MetS. Among the clinical variables, longer duration of illness, bipolar disorder-I, with a moderate number of lifetime depressive and manic episodes, and with a less severe and more manageable index affective episode, with mild depression at onset and during acute episodes, lower in the severity of mania during the index episode, later age of onset at first manic episode, later age at first treatment for both phases, less healthy diet as rated by patients themselves, absence of physical activity and family history of diabetes mellitus have been reported as clinical risk factors of MetS.
