No association of the polymorphisms was detected with depression linked to AD.	natural
A total of 158 depressed adolescents were administered the Children's Depression Rating ScaleRevised (CDRSR) and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) as part of a larger battery at baseline and at weekly visits across 6 weeks of acute fluoxetine treatment.	natural

Stress was positively associated with depression and anxiety, and negatively associated with self-esteem.	natural
Convergent validity was evaluated by testing the correlations between the QRI subscales and measures of general social support, anxiety and depression symptoms.	natural
Guided Internet-based CBT (iCBT) has been found to work for problems such as depression, panic-, social anxiety-, and generalized anxiety disorders.	natural
After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, two variables emerged as unique significant correlates of affiliation: perceived benefit for recovery of TC treatment was associated with greater TC member affiliation, whereas level of depression was inversely correlated.	natural
The abuse of methamphetamine (MA) has increased in the United States over the past 15 years and is associated with considerable negative social, psychological, and health effects, including symptoms of depression.	natural
Those individuals with more recurrent depression demonstrated significantly greater organisation of negative content and less interconnectedness of positive content than those with less recurrent depression.	natural
Interventions to ameliorate developmental risk associated with preterm birth should include repeated assessments of maternal social support and post-natal depression and be targeted towards socially disadvantaged families.	natural
For example, depression may accompany hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia.	natural
Response to treatment was evaluated retrospectively by an independent rater using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of severity and improvement of depression.	natural
We analyzed data from a 12-week trial comparing nortriptyline and paroxetine in 116 patients aged 60 and older with depression.	natural
The elderly group had higher rates of dementia, generalised anxiety disorder and past history of depression, when compared to the younger group.	natural
Current smokers showed significantly higher Anxiety and Depression scores compared to nonsmokers and former smokers, while the latter presented significantly lower Anxiety scores than nonsmokers.	natural
Self-report assessments were completed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment about hoarding behavior and related symptoms (e.g., depression).	natural
Findings regarding the relation of psychotherapy to changes in depression over the course of caregiving also are discussed.	natural
Beck and MMPI depression scores were similar in the two affective groups.	natural
In general, results from the focus groups did not require the generation of new items for depression and supported the content validity of the PROMIS hierarchical framework and item pool created originally.	natural
It is unknown if comorbid depression in patients with diabetes mellitus increases the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.	natural
Risk was greatest with acute or brief psychotic disorders (schizophreniform psychoses 50, brief psychoses 34.8, or unspecified psychoses 23.9), intermediate in major depression (15), schizophrenia (11.4) and delusional disorder (11.1), and lowest in bipolar-I (10.3) and schizoaffective disorders (8.2).	natural
Gender, duration of illness, psychosis, chronicity, severity, axis I comorbidity, melancholic features, individual atypical symptoms and other symptoms of depression were not significantly different.	natural
Those clients reaching the Feighner criteria for depression did not differ from other clients either in level of 'disengagement' or in type of engaged activity.	natural
Additionally, more than 40 of participants reported scores above the cut-off for clinically significant depression.	natural
Results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that SI was significantly related to recent psychological distress, and lifetime experience of depression for two weeks or more, serious anxiety or tension, or hallucinations.	natural
In mediation analysis, depression symptoms mediated the associations between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors.	natural
The fact that clinical pictures show substantial overlap makes it difficult, using conventional instruments, to distinguish between the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression and overlap in definitions and measurement of the two syndromes.	natural
309 outpatients with remitted recurrent MDD (SCID-I; HAM-D17 10) were included within two comparable RCTs and were assessed at baseline with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4(+) (PDQ-4(+)), the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale Version-A (DAS-A), the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (LEIDS), the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR).	natural
The present study investigated the effects of mild depression on the processing of personal information about oneself and others.	natural
Depression was chosen as it is the most common mental_health problem facing primary care physicians.	natural
Multiple regression analysis determined that depression was greatest among elderly persons who reported kidney, vision, and/or circulation problems.	natural
Perceived cancer threat significantly moderated the relationship between positive upward comparison and depression levels (p = 0.017).	natural
Depression and obesity are both important public health problems.	natural
To minimize barriers to care, ameliorate antenatal depression, and prevent postpartum depression, we conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of providing brief interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-B) to depressed, pregnant patients on low incomes in an obstetrics and gynecological (OB/GYN) clinic.	natural
Anxious depression and neuroticism also predicted the experience of life events.	natural
Deniers were less likely to suffer from mild major depression (p=0.04), mild anxiety (p=0.01), and suboptimal well-being (p=0.01) compared to non-deniers during the last six months prior to STEMI.	synthetic_low
RNT may be a potential modifiable risk factor which can be addressed in pregnancy to prevent mild depression and anxiety in new mothers.	synthetic_low
There were no significant changes in mild depression, self-esteem, or behavior over 5 years.	synthetic_low
CBT for depression produced moderate effects for cognitive processes but insignificant effects for less critical behavioral and coping variables, reflecting the mild nature of the depression.	synthetic_low
The first study is concerned with the timing (past, present, future) of negative events associated with moderate levels of anxiety and mild depression in normal participants.	synthetic_low
In later contributions, too, Abraham maintained that unconscious resentment directed at the mother, who is seen as 'bad' but remembered as 'good', was a contributing factor in the aetiology of mild depression, a view he had to defend in discussions with Freud.	synthetic_low
Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_low
Behavioral Activation (BA) is an effective treatment for mild adult depression; however, little research has focused on the use of BA with mildly depressed adolescents, particularly with less intense forms of BA.	synthetic_low
