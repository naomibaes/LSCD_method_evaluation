Of the overall sample (n = 58), 28 women were diagnosed with postpartum depression and/or anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV, and 30 were healthy controls.	natural
The very limited number of participants in randomised controlled trials means that there is inconclusive evidence for the psychological treatment of depression in children aged 12 years and below.	natural
Striatal and CMS circuit abnormalities likely contribute to the neurobiology of bipolar II depression.	natural
Depression went along with lower actual grades and with internal, stable, and global failure attributions.	natural
Depressive trends were measured by the Plutchik-van Praag Depression Inventory (PVP).	natural
Prompt actions are needed to address the burden of depression with sufficient resources for treatment and prevention.	natural
Results support a cognitive vulnerability model for depression whereby HIV-related neurocognitive deficits interfere with the ability to use acceptance and positive reframing strategies to increase the frequency of PAT and decrease NAT in adults living with symptoms of depression.	natural
Further research needs to examine the moderating effect of coping responses to depressive symptoms on treatment efficacy of PST and other psychosocial interventions for late-life depression.	natural
Parent dysfunction (depression, multiple symptom domains) and stress decline and family relations improve as well.	natural
Mean scores on the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were significantly higher among the prisoners with a history of self-harm.	natural

NE (as well as depression, hopelessness, and avoidant coping) significantly predicted a greater rate of decrease in CD4 and increase in VL.	natural
In men, experience of two events (OR=2.493) and three or more events (OR=3.199) was independently associated with increased risk of having depression.	natural
Heavier cocaine and alcohol use during IOP and low self-efficacy predicted more cocaine use during the treatment phase of the study, whereas lifetime diagnoses of alcohol dependence, major depression, and any anxiety disorder predicted less cocaine use.	natural
Each case suffered from depression and four of the five women had unplanned pregnancies and had considered a termination of pregnancy.	natural
This systematic review aimed to clarify what is already empirically known regarding in-session AE in CBT for depression and which gaps in empirical research need to be filled by future studies.	natural
Over a 6-week prospective interval, the interactions of stressful life events and variability in both SE and SSE predicted changes in depression, particularly in individuals with more severe worst lifetime episodes of depressive symptoms.	natural
Second, evidence that substance abuse and depression both contribute to, and are exacerbated by, difficulties in negotiating age-salient tasks is summarized.	natural
Published studies reporting associations between any psychosocial factor and depression were identified and retrieved from Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO, by applying optimised search strategies.	natural
A total of 21 diabetic participants with major depression, 23 diabetic participants with no depression, and 22 healthy controls were compared.	natural
Likewise, PE symptoms at the first measurement did not predict increments or decrements in anxiety, sexual distress, or depression later on.	natural
Minor depression was related to birth cohort, sex (higher in women), age (higher at age 75) and the interaction effect of birth cohort age; that is, the prevalence of minor depression increased with age in the 2000s but not in the 1970s.	natural
A clinical trial assessed the effectiveness of these two forms of psychotherapy in treating moderate and severe depression in this age group.	natural
Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between mild caregiver depression and minor perceived barriers to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate levels of depression, occasional smoking, being slightly sedentary, and having mildly elevated blood pressure were associated with treatment attrition.	synthetic_intensity
It was concluded that the data are most consonant with Brewin's (1985) symptom model, in which mild depressive attributions are a minor symptom of depression but have no causal impact on the onset or course of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Rates of lifetime depression slightly increased from 27.4 in the CFS only group to 52.3 in the CFS/FM group, 45.2 in the CFS/MCS group, and 69.2 in the CFS/FM/MCS group.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between mild depression and life events was found to depend upon the cautious way events were interpreted.	synthetic_intensity
Logistic regression examined the associations between the policy's introduction, potential confounding factors (mild depression, slight cognitive impairment, function, behavior, and characteristics) and the identification and correct recognition of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggested a minor similarity of emotional functioning for empathy, emotional responsiveness, and mild depression in the ill children.	synthetic_intensity
This profile appears somewhat different from the more internalizing pattern (i.e., mild depression, occasional self-criticism, and fleeting hopelessness) observed for the depressed adolescent inpatients who reported no history of childhood abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Shared variance with scales sampling symptom domains of interest was highest for mild anxiety, moderate for depression, and lowest for minor externalizing symptoms, indicating consistent convergent and divergent validity.	synthetic_intensity
The study consisted of 1101 Caucasian, male outpatients, who were screened for mild depression and hypertension in order to test the hypothesis that there is a minimal relationship between these two illnesses.	synthetic_intensity
