Children experienced significant improvements in CTG, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, anxiety, and behavioral problems, with PTSD symptoms improving only during the trauma-focused treatment components and CTG improving during both trauma- and grief-focused components.	natural
The mood-manipulated group had increased sensitivity for anger expressions, and trait anxiety did not moderate these effects.	natural
We used the feedback-negativity, an event-related potential sensitive to monetary gains versus losses (FN), to examine whether different forms of youth anxiety symptoms were uniquely associated with reward sensitivity as indexed by neural reactivity to the receipt of positive and negative monetary outcomes.	natural
A total of 2008 persons (mean age: 41.6 years, 64.9 women) were included, consisting of 1367 patients with a past-month DSM-diagnosis (established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview [CIDI]) of depressive disorder (major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder) and/or anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia), and 641 controls.	natural

Patient satisfaction correlated well with the patient anxiety levels.	natural
Results from structural equation modeling revealed that adult children's support partially mediated the association between attachment anxiety and subjective well-being, while the association between attachment avoidance and subjective well-being was fully mediated by adult children's support and self-esteem.	natural
