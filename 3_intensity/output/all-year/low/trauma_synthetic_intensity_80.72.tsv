This article presents an analysis of the adverse effects of mild relational trauma and various facets of minor loss on infant psychoneurobiology.	synthetic_low
These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) somewhat selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit slightly enhanced memory for material related to mild trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit some difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit minor problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling more general memories.	synthetic_low
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear somewhat arbitrary for children in the face of mild trauma exposure, especially non-severe interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would somewhat vary as a function of mild trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_low
In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients experiencing the minor psychological effects of trauma.	synthetic_low

Drugs that mildly influence arousal may have slight effects after trauma which depend on the general psychosocial context, helping to prevent the development of mild PTSD in some trauma victims, but slightly impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that the mild transmission of trauma from one generation to the next is possibly implicated in the offspring's gentle propensity for growth following subsequent moderate trauma.	synthetic_low
This mode can evolve as a reaction to an adult mild trauma, but is more likely to emerge as a result of slight early traumatization.	synthetic_low

Healthy community dwelling volunteers (N = 157, mean age 29 years) participated in the Cumulative Stress/Adversity Interview (CAI), a 140-item event interview measuring cumulative adversity including major life events, minor life trauma, recent life events and chronic stressors, and underwent 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring.	synthetic_low
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_low

The strongest effect across samples was found for slightly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with mild PTSD, and there was some evidence that mild trauma exposure is uniquely associated with slightly worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_low
