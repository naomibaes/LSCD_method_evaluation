Almost all the cognitive factors (including information-processing style during the trauma, mental defeat, qualities of unwanted memories, self-blame, negative thoughts about self, worry, safety behaviours, anomalous internal experiences and cognitive inflexibility) predicted later paranoia and PTSD, but there was little evidence of differential prediction.	natural
While they are now thought to represent different psychopathological entities, it is not clear whether both GAS and PTSS show a dose-response to trauma exposure.	natural

This article continues my journey into the clinical usefulness of bodily emotion and extends my earlier formulation of core affective experience to a consideration of what I call insidious emotional trauma, a concept that is defined as the repetitive demonization of emotionality during development and beyond.	natural
These results provide the first piece of evidence that older adolescents cognitively respond to trauma in a similar manner to adults, that the PTCI is factorially invariant between genders, and that trauma cognitions are correlated with feelings of loneliness.	natural

Eliciting narratives about families' migration to their new homes can provide professionals with important information about family experiences of mild trauma and clarify general hopes and expectations regarding service provision.	synthetic_low
High prevalence rates of both current and lifetime PTSD diagnoses were found in both groups and in a significant number of cases the mild trauma associated with the PTSD symptoms was the offence that led to the individual's admission.	synthetic_low
To assess the intervention's effectiveness, veterans with histories of mild trauma who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to a BSS group (n = 26) or a wait-list control group (n = 28).	synthetic_low

This study extends previous research on date rape by assessing mild trauma symptoms and sexual self-esteem in a college population of 41 women who had been date raped and 125 women who had not been raped.	synthetic_low
This evacuation had no precedent in Israeli history, yet the author finds it did not create a mild trauma for most Israelis, so the Israeli government was able to implement the peace process with minimal public debate or resistance.	synthetic_low
This article aims to conceptually advance current treatments for women in poverty experiencing the co-occurring effects of mild trauma and substance abuse by employing both systemic and feminist perspectives.	synthetic_low
This review will summarize recent observations as to the involvement of these inflammatory mediators in CNS injury and lay claim to the possibility that mild inhibitors of peripheral inflammation may also be of benefit in treating CNS injuries such as stroke, mild head trauma, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.	synthetic_low
The psychological variables, plus a measure of mild birth trauma, were reassessed at 1 month, and again, together with a measure of slight parenting stress, at 3 months postpartum.	synthetic_low
The findings tentatively support a minor prediction of the trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are slightly inconsistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	synthetic_low
Thus, the aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the limited empirical support for GCBT in the treatment of mild PTSD and to compare GCBT protocols that gently encourage the disclosure of trauma details via in-session exposure to GCBT protocols that do not include in-session exposure.	synthetic_low
This study was designed to determine whether people from a very different culture have milder symptoms in response to less intense traumatic experiences as do trauma survivors in the United States.	synthetic_low
Less intense postinjury pain and mild PTSD symptoms (measured within 48 hours of trauma) predicted slightly higher rates of both PTSD and MDD symptoms at 1 month.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that university health centers may screen for mild PTSD and consider basic psychoeducational programs and simple coping skills interventions for survivors of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
While some clinicians assume that traumatic intrusions are historically accurate revisualizations of distressing traumatic incidents, others have suggested that these types of intrusions may represent a slightly exaggerated version of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Results revealed that two thirds of participants reported moderate trauma symptoms that included some intrusive experiences, occasional defensive avoidance, or mild dissociation.	synthetic_low
To examine this issue, we conducted confirmatory factor analyses of interview and self-report data across three mild trauma samples.	synthetic_low
Many women in community mental health care have minor interpersonal trauma histories and mild, manageable complex depression.	synthetic_low
This study extends the work completed with pathological gamblers and substance abusers, looking at associations between a history of mild trauma and comorbid substance dependence, reduced impulsivity, lesser measures of problem severity, and moderate personality variables.	synthetic_low
The Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ; Maercker & Mueller, ) is a measure of trauma survivors' perceptions of mild social acknowledgment and gentle disapproval from others, and these factors are shown to be associated with mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilian trauma survivors.	synthetic_low

Findings provide support suggesting the limited potency of early trauma on regulatory response systems.	synthetic_low
The studies in this review indicated that informal supporters may be experiencing a moderate impact, including mild vicarious trauma and a minor risk of physical harm.	synthetic_low
All those who had experienced minor war trauma were administered questionnaires measuring war exposure, family violence, availability of leisure activities, school-related problems, interpersonal and peer problems, socialization, daily routine problems, displacement, availability of parental supervision and contact and medical needs as well as coping skills related to religious coping, denial, self-control, avoidance and problem solving.	synthetic_low
Using the DSM-IV criterion, the Trauma group (n = 70) reported slightly poorer status than the No Trauma group (n = 119) on 10 of 10 distress indices (mean ES = 0.57 SD) and somewhat better status on all 7 growth/benefit-finding indices (mean ES = 0.30 SD).	synthetic_low
With recognition of the minor effects of trauma and straightforward interventions, it is possible to help children stay on track developmentally by supporting steady positive social and emotional development and preventing the slight risk of later violence.	synthetic_low
Sutton and Clauss presented a detailed review about the effectiveness of zolpidem, discussing partial recoveries from mild brain damage due to strokes, trauma and mild hypoxia.	synthetic_low
The attachment capacities of trauma survivors were hypothesized to be somewhat related to their recovery from mildly traumatic event(s).	synthetic_low
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_low
There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of mild head trauma and parents occupation.	synthetic_low
