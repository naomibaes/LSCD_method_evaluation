Students who participated in the EI program reported better psychosocial adjustment (e.g., lower levels of depression and anxiety, less atypicality, somatization, and social stress, and higher self-esteem) compared to students in the control group.	natural
In both experiments, results revealed that anxiety resulted in a decrement in performance.	natural
These long-term neuroendocrinological effects are mediated, at least in part, by stress-induced maternal corticosterone increase during pregnancy and stress-induced maternal anxiety during the postnatal period.	natural
Imaging studies focusing on adolescents' susceptibility to anxiety suggest that the different development trajectories between the limbic system and the executive control system may play important roles in this phenomenon.	natural
Participants completed self-report measures of mindfulness, probability bias, cost bias, and social anxiety symptoms.	natural
Specifically, anxiety had a significant direct and indirect effect on suicidal ideation presence using a brief version of the RCMAS, but only an indirect effect using the full length version.	natural

We present evidence indicating that the rodent amygdala is involved in some types of fear (conditioned fear), but not all types (unconditioned fear), and may therefore have significance for a nuanced neurobiology of mild anxiety disorders in humans.	synthetic_low
Induction of worry was found to produce (a) mild degrees of both anxiety and depression, (b) emotional profiles slightly correlated with those of depression and somatic anxiety than the correlation of depression and somatic anxiety profiles with each other, and (c) a calm subjective state containing no unique emotional features separate from that induced in depression and somatic anxiety.	synthetic_low
We compared, in a prospective study on patients with acute coronary syndrome, the moderate predictive effect of a depression or mild anxiety diagnosis and of basic emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional coping strategies, as detected early after an acute event, on patients' left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a reliable prognostic index of disease severity, at a three-month follow up.	synthetic_low

Based upon a series of comparisons among students with high, moderate, or minimal levels of anxiety in which English achievement scores served as the dependent variables, students with low levels of anxiety performed consistently higher on measures of English achievement.	synthetic_low
Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had moderate associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and mild anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was slightly better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not mild levels of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Two mild components of social anxiety were measured by the ISS, the extent to which slight emotional tension or discomfort is perceived in social situations and the occasional frequency with which social responses are executed.	synthetic_low
