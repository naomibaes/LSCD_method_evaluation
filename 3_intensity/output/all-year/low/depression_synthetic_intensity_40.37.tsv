Nonreactivity and nonjudging (i.e., the mindfulness how skills) were negatively associated with neuroticism aspects, such as withdrawal (e.g., depression) and volatility (e.g., anger).	natural
Relative social position was confirmed for depression, whereas community resources were prominent only for obesity.	natural
Data from the literature suggest that neuroticism, hostility and social dysfunction seem to have a negative prognostic value only for nonendogenous depressives and bipolar disorder, thus supporting the notion that the diagnostic distinction between bipolar disorder, endogenous and nonendogenous depression is relevant to prognostic discussions.	natural
Assessment included measures of PTSD, sleep, depression, anger, guilt, and social isolation, administered at post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up.	natural
This report reviews the considerable preclinical and clinical evidence supporting this hypothesis, with particular emphasis on specific subtypes of depression.	natural
This study was designed to test the view that depression would have selective effects upon effortful but not automatic aspects of reading.	natural
Based on the present findings, we argue that impaired inhibition of negative affect could be an important construct in cognitive theories on depression linking cognitive biases to neuropsychological impairments in depression.	natural
Prospective observational data from 5,801 parents and adolescents taking part in a large UK population cohort (Avon-Longitudinal-Study-of-Parents-and-Children) were used to test associations between maternal and paternal depression and anxiety in the perinatal period, executive function (EF) at age 8, and academic achievement at the end of compulsory school at age 16.	natural
The Anxiety and Depression Short Scale, the Prolonged Grief 12 and Family Strain Questionnaire were used to measure caregivers' burden and the Coping Orientations to Problem Experiences to identify the coping strategies used by caregivers.	natural
Agreement among several depression scales was investigated as regard the relative influences of administration mode (self-rating or clinical rating) and scale content.	natural
Total CORE scores (as well as CORE retardation and agitation sub-scale scores) were negatively correlated with activity scores, with depression severity increasing the correlational strength substantively.	natural
Retardation and agitation are symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), and their presence could play a role in determining clinically meaningful depressive subtypes such as nonmelancholic depression (NMD) and melancholic depression (MD).	natural
We found a significant reduction in the level of depression, anxiety and daily stress in the TG compared to the CG and a significant improvement in QOL and somatic symptoms in the TG throughout the entire follow-up period.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a widely used psychometric component in the diagnostic process.	natural
Ninety-three (51) patients had CLBP; the SCL90R scores for somatization, depression, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and general severity were significantly higher in CLBP(+) group than in the CLBP(-) group at baseline.	natural
Stigma can still be found among those not indicating depression as well as among those with symptoms of depression.	natural
Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of psychotherapy on social functioning in patients with depression.	natural
Parenting and depression scores were significantly positively correlated, as were depression, parenting and CHAOS score.	natural
The present double-blind study administered tryptophan-depleted and taste-matched placebo challenge drinks to individuals with a past diagnosis and family history of depression (i.e. depression-vulnerable subjects) and controls in order to investigate the effect of ATD on positive affect, anxiety, anger and depressed mood following a negative mood induction.	natural
Although extensive studies demonstrate a link between infant sleep problems and parental depression, limited research explores this relation in parents of primary school aged children.	natural
Overall, results support cognitive models of depression and suggest that implicit cognition reliably predicts past, current, and future depression.	natural
This study examined mother- and teacher-rated internalizing behaviors (i.e., anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms) among young children using longitudinal data from a community sample of 661 Mexican and Dominican families and tested a conceptual model in which parenting (mother's socialization messages and parenting practices) predicted child internalizing problems 12 months later.	natural
To test the comparability of Set 2 (Lists E, F, and G) of the Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL), 74 Ss who participated in a 1-wk.	natural
Results showed a clear effect of the experience of unemployment on the unempoyed, with the unemployed group increasing their scores on depression and external locus of control, and decreasing their selfesteem scores.	natural
According to cognitive vulnerability stress models of depression, negative cognitions are supposed to be stable characteristics of depressed individuals even between depressive episodes.	natural
We examined the concurrent validity of the depression questionnaire by relating data from it to known socio-demographic and behavioral correlates of depression; its predictive capacity by relating scores from the questionnaire to the occurrence of future hospitalization for depression; and the test-retest reliability by comparing scores from its administration in 1992 to those in 1994.	natural
Furthermore, do anxiety and depression remain as distinct constructs for this population, or do they combine to represent general distress?	natural
We also found that the depression of SMA and the activation of TGF-beta in the CSF by i.p.	natural
The findings that mothers with postnatal depression rate negative infant faces more negatively indicate that appraisal bias might underlie some of the difficulties that these mothers have in responding to their own infants signals.	natural
Economic pressure was associated with lower marital quality and higher depression.	natural
Retrograde amnesia caused by mild delirium and the supportive milieu during treatment of the delirium may have a beneficial psychological effect on recovery from moderate delusional depression.	synthetic_intensity
Higher rates of disclosure predicted more positive family reactions, which in turn predicted a slight alleviation of mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
First, psychological assessment instruments for examining five important clinical areas (suicide ideation, sleep disturbances, anxiety, mild depression, and personality) are discussed in light of the most current research regarding their psychometric properties and suitability for use with older adults.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the unique predictive power of self and other-rated Big Five personality traits at ages 12 and 17 on self-rated life outcomes and personality at age 29 (e.g., educational achievement, work income, low-level depression, moral transgressions, and relationship satisfaction).	synthetic_intensity
The common and specific symptom dimensions of anxiety and mild depression proposed by the tripartite (L.A. Clark & D. Watson, 1991 c) and cognitive (A.T. Beck, 1976, 1987) models were investigated in 844 psychiatric outpatients and 420 undergraduates.	synthetic_intensity
Here we examine reinforcement learning in mild late-life depression in the theoretical framework of the vascular depression hypothesis.	synthetic_intensity
Under mild waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was somewhat blocked, but other signs of arousal were generally intact.	synthetic_intensity
The initial set of clinical variables was refined to 38 (21 mild depression, 17 anxiety) items and a cluster analysis undertaken.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the relationships between specific symptom content and varying levels of anxiety and mild depression were examined.	synthetic_intensity
In 2 studies, 245 and 234 undergraduates completed the Self-Conscious Affect and Attribution Inventory, the Symptom Checklist 90, the Beck Mild Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Scale, and the Attributional Style Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicate that correlations between mild postpartum depression and subsequent child temperament ratings were accounted for statistically by lower concurrent levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that (a) there was a significant improvement in marital adjustment after treatment, (b) this effect was not moderated by treatment type, and (c) this effect was mediated by a subtle change in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
On the individual test scores, children and adolescents with mild depression performed slightly worse on delayed verbal memory (d = .63), delayed visual memory (d = .34), measures of reaction time (d = .34-.53), and accuracy/inhibition on complex attention tasks (d = .49-.65).	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that both mild depression and mood are uniquely associated with minor momentary pain; as such, basic multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_intensity
Minor executive control and mild depression each explained distinct variance in corticostriatothalamic response to unexpected rewards.	synthetic_intensity

Support for the validity of the HSC was provided via studies with the suicide attempter group in which mild positive correlations with depression and a slightly depressive attributional style were found.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that depression is better characterized by a slight overall decrease in slow-wave activity, which is related to a mildly elevated anxious and somewhat depressed mood the following morning.	synthetic_intensity
Smoking to alleviate mild negative affect or slightly improve physiological functioning (i.e., simple self-medication) is one explanation for the association between mild depression and smoking in adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
