This study explores current expressions of past trauma among Holocaust survivors.	natural
Previous research with trauma victims has demonstrated dissociative symptoms to be associated with higher PTSD symptom severity and longer symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	natural
Since then, one major goal of research has been to identify factors associated with distress following trauma; as yet, few reliable indicators have emerged.	natural
More emotional abuse and non-intentional trauma were associated with greater internalizing symptoms.	natural
The sample of this cross-sectional study was composed of 987 Portuguese adults with sleep disturbances, who completed a self-administered questionnaire about childhood trauma, sleep disturbances, and perceived stress.	natural
Trauma symptoms were related to exposure and exposure was related to age, but age was not related to symptoms.	natural
Prolonged trauma in childhood, however, can produce severe identity disturbances that may interfere with the encoding and later retrieval of personal semantic and autobiographical event information.	natural
The study group consisted of 57 relatives of seriously ill patients admitted to the ICU of Virgen del Roco Rehabilitation and Trauma Hospital (Seville, Spain).	natural
It is suggested that physiological arousal enhances the reprocessing of trauma memories.	natural

Trauma, such as combat, may change one's decision horizon.	natural
Heart-rate (HR), skin conductance responses (SCR), and viewing time were recorded in response to - for trauma victims - idiosyncratically trauma-relevant and control pictures.	natural
The present paper addresses the effects of sexual abuse trauma on the developmental process of identification.	natural
This study explored posttraumatic growth (PTG), positive change resulting from struggling with trauma, among 7- to 10-year-olds impacted by Hurricane Katrina.	natural
Adolescents (n = 498) completed an adapted version of the Harvard Trauma Scale (HTS) and the Fortitude Questionnaire (FORQ).	natural
This study contributes to the understanding of adverse childhood experiences, and adds to existing knowledge regarding the relationship between contextual factors and childhood abuse, maltreatment, and trauma.	natural
Clinical findings showing a relationship between Cannabis use and PTSD, as well as changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and maladaptive brain changes after trauma exposure.	natural
Five Mori women from one tribal community in Aotearoa/New Zealand narrated their stories of multi-generational legacies of historical trauma.	natural
The participants in this study included 42 female victims of intimate partner violence and 30 women with no history of serious trauma.	natural
First, 50 mTBI older age patients and 58 orthopedic controls were compared to 123 community control participants to evaluate predisposition and general trauma effects on cognition.	natural
The current review summarizes and critically evaluates the existing literature to shed light on two key questions: (a) the impact of trauma exposure on alcohol use (and vice versa; the impact of alcohol use on risk for trauma exposure) in women, and (b) the nature of PTSDalcohol misuse comorbidity in women.	natural
How can trauma research studies be designed ethically, minimizing the risk to participants?	natural
We propose that cases of focal retrograde amnesia, similar to the present one, deserve to be classified separately from organic and psychogenic forms under the label of 'functional' retrograde amnesia, a syndrome in which the threshold of activation of premorbid memories is abnormally raised by the trauma, leaving the encoding and retrieval of new memories unaffected.	natural
The results have important implications for understanding complex psychopathology following trauma.	natural
Clinically, the results indicate that, appraisals, social support, and depression symptoms should be assessed in addition to trauma symptoms following single-incident traumatic events.	natural
Previous research with other trauma populations demonstrated that internalizing and externalizing personality styles are associated with different PTSD comorbidities.	natural
Investigating symptoms of PTSD during a psychological assessment even when trauma is not the presenting complaint is merited in most cases.	natural
Military sexual trauma (MST) affects approximately 2 and 36 of male and female veterans, respectively, (e.g., Allard, Gregory, Klest, & Platt, 2011).	natural
Based on a study of 681 German police officers who were violently assaulted we analyze first general pre-, peri- and post-traumatic risk factors (e.g. trauma severity, psychological adjustment, social support) of post-traumatic stress symptoms, second police-specific factors (e.g. colleague support) and third differences in the impact of these factors comparing male and female officers.	natural
More severe PTSD symptoms were predicted by greater trauma exposure (r = .43), greater sociodemographic risk (r = .22), and lower developmental competence (rs=.31 and .54 for preschool and school-age developmental competence, respectively).	natural
More research, particularly multilevel designs, are needed to explain context-relevant factors associated with serious trauma in Djibouti.	natural
A 10-year retrospective study (2003-2012) was performed at a Level 1 trauma centre.	natural
Posttraumatic stress disorder is a serious potential consequence of suffering severe trauma.	natural
Depression and trauma history may significantly influence the delivery and outcomes obtained from home visitation.	natural
Trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often experience psychosocial problems.	natural
Their third serious misfortune was trauma.	natural
This study explored the prevalence of early trauma in a sample of U.S. female sexual offenders (N = 47) using the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale.	natural
Among those exposed to trauma, PTSD risk was slightly higher among Blacks [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.22] and lower among Asians (aOR 0.67) compared with Whites, after adjustment for characteristics of trauma exposure.	natural
This study tested the proposal that impaired retrieval of specific autobiographical memories is a risk factor for psychological disturbance after trauma exposure.	natural
Awareness campaigns may aim to increase MHL of PTSD from diverse trauma sources.	natural
Trauma has become not simply a narrative of discomfort and its treatment, but a collection of sub-stories involving the subtle commodification of altruism, the mild justification of violence, the entry point into genuine experience, and the place where casual voyeurism and witnessing intersect.	synthetic_low
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for mild trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with less severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_low
Very few patients had received a working diagnosis of mild PTSD, or were receiving low-intensity trauma focussed psychological therapy.	synthetic_low
Biological stress markers were mild physiological reactivity and swift recovery in heart rate and blood pressure responses to a routine trauma interview and stable cortisol levels (morning, afternoon, and diurnal variation).	synthetic_low
I argue that it is the gentle affective re-experiencing of mildly repressed trauma in the analytic space that has a subtle therapeutic impact, leading to gradual growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_low
As confounding variables, we considered mild negative affect (measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Trait Version), sex and time elapsed since mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Sharing the mild meaning of the trauma also highlighted vital aspects in the functioning of the mind of the group, leading to a new and more gentle way of facing illness and death.	synthetic_low
Results demonstrated that participants prioritizing the longevity of loved ones experienced moderately higher levels of grief, complicated grief, and mild trauma related guilt than those who prioritized comfort.	synthetic_low

Most dissociative clients who come for counseling are not aware of either the mild trauma or their dissociative response.	synthetic_low
