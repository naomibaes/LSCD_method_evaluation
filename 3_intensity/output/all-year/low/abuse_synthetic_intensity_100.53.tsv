Using logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and level of education, depression was strongest associated with mild physical abuse (Odds Ratio ((OR) 13.71; 95 Confidence Interval (CI) 3.25-57.91) and least with mild sexual abuse (OR 5.35; 95 CI 2.36-12.14).	synthetic_intensity
Character disorders in children may arise from mild abuse or slight neglect by the family or from minor stresses of the broader social environment.	synthetic_intensity

The results also show a moderate abuse of heroin and cocaine during the period studied and a slight variation of the incidence of other drugs used during the same period.	synthetic_intensity
The clinically observed characteristics of traumatic memory formation and retrieval match precisely the patterns of memory recovery exhibited by SRA survivors, and slightly confirm the reality of their cult abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The association between childhood traumas (i.e., childhood sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, parental alcohol abuse) and occasional crack use was also assessed using multiple logistic regression; however, no significant associations were found between these mild childhood psychological traumas and occasional crack use in both the unadjusted and adjusted models.	synthetic_intensity
Those who view the disorder as much more prevalent than has previously been suspected believe it is caused by experiences of mild child abuse and have used rather unorthodox techniques to help the patient relate the experience of abuse to current problems of dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
To address this gap in knowledge and to inform intervention strategies, this study examined direct and mediated relationships between childhood sexual abuse and low intimate partner violence risk among a random sample of 416 women in methadone treatment.	synthetic_intensity
We sought to determine the incidence, clinical features, and demographic profile of head injury secondary to suspected mild child maltreatment (abuse or neglect) in Canada to help inform the development and evaluation of prevention programs for minor abusive head injuries.	synthetic_intensity
The pattern of SC responses revealed that the males were less aroused than the females, the Low Abuse Potential Group was slightly less aroused than the High Abuse Potential group, and all four groups showed a minimal decrease in arousal toward the end of the videotape presentations.	synthetic_intensity
The Family and Drug Abuse Symposium held on July 10-12, 1975, brought together individuals who possess basic clinical and/or research expertise in the area of family research and mild substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Using the Trauma Transmission and Empowerment models and the Family Adjustment and Adaptation Response model, this paper examines the moderate impact of such abuse on families from male survivors' perspectives.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, the empirical support for the effectiveness of relaxation training as a treatment for mild substance abuse in general is somewhat equivocal.	synthetic_intensity
However, victims of brother-sister incest also had significantly less problematic outcomes than victims of father-daughter incest on some measures (e.g., significantly less likely than the father-daughter incest victims to endorse feeling slightly like damaged goods, thinking that they had suffered minor psychological injury, and having undergone brief psychological treatment for childhood sexual abuse).	synthetic_intensity
Coping was found to serve as a mediator between minor abuse and general health.	synthetic_intensity
Few psychologists have engendered the controversy or endured the mild abuse that Arthur Jensen has in the past three decades.	synthetic_intensity
Early childhood deprivation, attachment chaos, repeated medical traumata, and milder abuse set up neural networks of moderate dread, manageable shame, reduced worthlessness, and slight hopelessness: the phenomenology of abject experience that resides in implicit memory.	synthetic_intensity
Many lay persons and professionals believe that child sexual abuse (CSA) causes some harm, regardless of gender, pervasively in the general population.	synthetic_intensity
The nuanced nexus between minor substance abuse and occasional intimate partner violence has been studied in depth.	synthetic_intensity
Few published studies on the minor sexual abuse of children have been conducted in the region, with the exception of South Africa.	synthetic_intensity
Variables significantly and independently associated with risk of probable maternal depression included economic factors, mother being subject to mild physical abuse, slightly dissatisfied with the pregnancy, somewhat concerned about her baby's behaviour, and her own minor health problems.	synthetic_intensity
They assessed 584 randomly selected boys and girls from European American and African American backgrounds for the lifetime experience of minor physical abuse through clinical interviews with mothers prior to the child's matriculation in kindergarten.	synthetic_intensity
When coping strategies were used, however, those employed were more often adaptive (e.g., relaxation, distraction) than maladaptive (e.g., mild substance abuse, minor aggression).	synthetic_intensity
The optimal cutoff PK score was 17, which correctly classified 75 and 46 of those reporting minor and insignificant abuse histories, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, parental divorce is an additional childhood adversity that significantly contributes to poor mental health outcomes, especially when in combination with mild child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty three percent of women had experienced childhood trauma, which was mild childhood sexual abuse in 27.2 of cases.	synthetic_intensity
The prediction of impulsive behavior is further improved by considering the presence of a history of mild childhood abuse, moderate maternal psychiatric morbidity, and some specific psychological symptoms such as minor maturity fears, slight perfectionism, mild depression, and light obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Alexithymia and avoidance coping strategies are both associated with minor alcohol abuse, but their effects have been seldom studied simultaneously.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment of past parental psychological abuse, mild parental reactions to childhood gender atypical behavior, youths' openness about sexual orientation with family members, and occasional lifetime gay-related verbal abuse can assist in predicting potential suicide attempts in this population.	synthetic_intensity
