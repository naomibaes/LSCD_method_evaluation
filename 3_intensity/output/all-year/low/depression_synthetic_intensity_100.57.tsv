Fourteen WISC subtest patterns that purport to differentiate behavioral disorders were applied to the WISC-R. Forty-one adolescent males referred as a result of conduct disorders were administered the WISC-R. In general, a group analysis showed a slight depression of verbal functions and satisfactory reliability.	synthetic_intensity

A previous episode of mild depression, significant life events, and instrumental delivery were independently related to mild depression (OR 3.5, 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) while only a history of low-level depression in first-degree relatives was independently related to subtle mood changes (OR 3.4, 95 CI 1.2-9.8).	synthetic_intensity
