The main results were: Ss often expressed mild concern over their health and death, attitudes toward euthanasia were somewhat negative, a majority of Ss (80) held that seriously ill patients should not be told about their condition since this might cause a minor trauma that could slightly shorten their days.	synthetic_low
Demographic variables, mild depression and general anxiety, personality, minor trauma characteristics, mild feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and nonspecific variables regarding therapy were not related to either treatment outcome or dropout, disconfirming generally held beliefs about these factors as inconsequential contra-indications for exposure therapy.	synthetic_low
Almost all (91) of the 89 women reported both minor childhood and adulthood trauma.	synthetic_low
The first goal was to review the various empirical studies using the concise 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and identify minor methodological issues pertaining to the use of the measure as it related to the mild emotional abuse and emotional neglect scales.	synthetic_low
We examined: (a) long-term effects of minor war-related trauma and captivity on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), physical health, and subjective age; and (b) the slight moderation effect of PTSS and health on subjective age among ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and war veterans.	synthetic_low
In order to provide such an environment carers are trained, assessed, and accredited to have a basic working understanding of the mild impact of trauma and abuse, and are provided with simple tools and strategies to therapeutically re-parent these children.	synthetic_low
A group of sexual assault victims were compared with women without past mild trauma exposure in relation to specificity of autobiographical memories, as measured by the Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT) and specificity of future-directed thoughts as measured by the Future Cueing Task (FCT).	synthetic_low
Participants with and without minor head trauma with brief LOC were compared across various measures of functioning.	synthetic_low
The lack of recognition of mild trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the less impactful traumatic experience and forces it to remain as part of the present.	synthetic_low
Despite the long interval of time since the occurrence of the mild war trauma, these youth and their parents reported these experiences in a consistent fashion.	synthetic_low
Graded slides of minor physical trauma geared towards wound identification are paired with gentle relaxation exercises.	synthetic_low
New species of claims for minor psychiatric injury will cause courts to reassess the principles governing the way the common law has compensated those slightly affected by careless exposure to trauma.	synthetic_low
Sutton and Clauss presented a detailed review about the effectiveness of zolpidem, discussing partial recoveries from mild brain damage due to strokes, trauma and mild hypoxia.	synthetic_low
Results suggested that CBLCs significantly decreased barriers to child trauma treatment and significantly increased IPC and perceived utilization of basic evidence-based child trauma treatment.	synthetic_low
Current thinking suggests that dissociation could be a significant comorbid diagnosis in a proportion of schizophrenic patients with a history of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The study explored how former trauma clients experienced the gentle inclusion of skill training in their treatment, their ways of comfortably relating to and using these skills, and how this changed slightly over time.	synthetic_low
This study aimed to investigate the emotions and thoughts contained in minor hotspots of memory for trauma, as well as their associated images.	synthetic_low
In particular, some basic considerations are offered with regard to work with mild trauma survivors from a body-centered energy therapy perspective.	synthetic_low
Understanding children's recovery after mild trauma is considered important, but existing theories are mainly based on adult research.	synthetic_low
A multivariate analysis of variance indicated differences in coherence among the mild trauma, important, and positive memories, but not between the diagnostic groups or their interaction with these memory types.	synthetic_low
Surprisingly, the prevalence of minor post-traumatic stress symptoms indicating a possible PTSD was low compared to other groups of aging, long-term survivors of mild war trauma.	synthetic_low
Pre-T1 minor trauma history and T1 mild PTS symptoms served as covariates in regression analysis.	synthetic_low
But it took 70 years and a gentle work of fiction to remind us of the beginnings of therapeutic treatment for shell shock in World War I. On the basis of extensive clinical material this paper attempts to describe some minor pathogenic effects exerted by the transmission of mild war trauma from fathers to children, speculates about the legacy of this century's war and wonders how we are handling this in our therapeutic work.	synthetic_low
History of exposure to mild trauma or minor childhood abuse most clearly discriminated higher scores within the control sample.	synthetic_low
One challenge which early interventions face is how to identify those trauma survivors who are less likely to develop chronic PTSD, as the majority of trauma survivors recover spontaneously.	synthetic_low
As is true for those who face challenges, the mild trauma of arrest and conviction for a crime and subsequent imprisonment takes the individual through a manageable series of psychological stages. In the offender, these defenses are to some extent influenced by the culture.	synthetic_low
If this is the case, then individuals with higher levels of reexperiencing symptoms might show greater generalization, even in contexts slightly related to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
We discuss that the Penn Inventory may be best used as a screening instrument or measure of change of general mental well-being after mild trauma, rather than a diagnostic tool for specific traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_low
Finally, it is suggested that the occasional experience of mild trauma contributes to the slight malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of minor illness.	synthetic_low
Of 1320 patients who were hospitalized for injuries, a total of 315 were known to be slightly intoxicated with alcohol at the time of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
About half of the reports regarding perceived trauma severity characteristics were somewhat inconsistent between the baseline to 6-week assessment due to its relatively mild impact.	synthetic_low
