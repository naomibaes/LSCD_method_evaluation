Baseline measures of attributional style, event-specific attributions, life events, and mild depression were administered to 96 adults enrolled in a cigarette-smoking cessation program who were readministered the event-specific attributions, life events, and depression measures 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_low
With pre-test differences statistically controlled, mild depression produced small post-test deficits in three measures.	synthetic_low
Differences were most evident for change scores within the minimal lower range of mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
In M2 for men, the largest contribution to pattern recognition is (N3) Mild Depression.	synthetic_low
In an attempt to address this minor trend, the present study examines the relationship of minor uplifts and hassles to mild anxiety, low-level depression, slight distress, self-restraint, perceived support from friends, perceived social competence, and general self-worth in a sample of 23 sixth graders (141 girls).	synthetic_low
Most research so far has been directed toward either characterizing mild depression by correlating various measures of subtle depressive behavior or demonstrating the straightforward relation between individual variables and slight reduction in depression.	synthetic_low
Severity scores for depression in bulimic runners were slightly lower than in earlier nonexercising samples, indicating a modest improvement with exercise.	synthetic_low
The GHQ was found to have high internal consistency as a scale and to assess 5 dimensions of mild psychopathology: mild anxiety, somewhat inadequate coping, low-level depression, occasional insomnia, and minor social dysfunctioning.	synthetic_low

Furthermore, in agreement with our hypotheses on the relationship between premorbid personality and course of the disease, the ratio of assignments to 'manic type' and 'melancholic type' slightly decreased from 'unipolar' mania, to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and to mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_low
This study tests the thesis that, during the difficult to navigate Great Depression, opportunities for blacks in the South to enter farm labor in response to urban joblessness were somewhat constrained by niche saturation, a moderate structural condition caused by an ethnic group's overrepresentation in an occupation.	synthetic_low
Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of mild depression scores was noted in cardiopulmonary patients, but there was also a uniform trend toward slightly higher mortality in somewhat depressed patients with other diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Functional imaging studies of mild depression have been widely reported in the literature, but few of these have attempted to investigate the subtle neurophysiological correlates of psychotic symptoms.	synthetic_low
Self-report measures used to assess treatment effect were the Savings Inventory-Revised (SI-R), Savings Cognition Inventory, and the Mild Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales.	synthetic_low
