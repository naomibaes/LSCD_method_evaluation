Latent Class Analysis was used to identify classes of women based on their distinctive profiles of ASA symptoms, comparisons then being made with key covariates including mild trauma domains of minor conflict, occasional intimate partner violence (IPV) and manageable ongoing stressors.	synthetic_low
This study shows that conditional rates of PTSD are similar to those reported elsewhere, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of this disorder in American Indian populations is largely due to higher rates of mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Cases of mild blunt abdominal injury (N = 927) to children ages 0 to 4 years were extracted from the National Pediatric Trauma Registry.	synthetic_low
The findings from this qualitative study support positive vicarious experiences derived from mild trauma work and expose the somewhat pathologically focused nature of the profession.	synthetic_low
Risk factors for posttyphoon psychopathology differed among disorders, but generally were related to moderate typhoon exposure, prior mild trauma exposure, and in contrast to Western populations, higher age, but not gender.	synthetic_low
Storytelling presents the therapist with an opportunity to use comforting suggestions, symbolism, and metaphor to provide the emotional distance necessary to deal with the mild trauma of abuse.	synthetic_low
Internal and test-retest reliability was excellent, and the validity of the CTI-104 as a measure of mild war trauma was supported by its high correlation with standard measures of minor outcomes of trauma.	synthetic_low
