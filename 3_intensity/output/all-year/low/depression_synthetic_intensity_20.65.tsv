In patients with primary MDD, higher treatment outcome expectations and being referred from the community (vs. inpatient hospitalization) predicted better depression response, and higher treatment outcome expectations predicted global improvement.	natural

In particular, recommendations are made for the evaluation of developmental and health factors and the effects of sexual trauma, depression, intrapsychic conflicts, and interpersonal issues.	natural
Two samples comprising adults who met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD; N=30) and adults who had no prior history or current depression (N=30) completed autobiographical memory and future event tests, and a personal goal task.	natural
Frontal Glx levels appear to be normalised after recovery from depression, but it is not known if this composite measure masks ongoing differences in glutamate or glutamine alone.	natural
Hemispheric topography of alpha band power in the electroencephalogram has been linked to approach/avoidance motivation and may index the risk for anxiety disorders and depression.	natural
Mothers with depression had a higher likelihood of drinking alcohol compared to mothers who were not depressed only at baseline and 6 months post-birth.	natural
However, Emotional Availability Scale ratings of maternal sensitivity, coded from videotapes of mothers and infants engaged in a brief play interaction, were significant predictors of infant learning, even after maternal depression, its demographic correlates, and antidepressant medication use had been taken into account.	natural
We also stress the importance of formative research and pilot testing, and warn against the potentially harmful error of assessing messages targeting people with depression on those without heightened levels of depressive symptomatology.	natural
Elevations of these cytokines and general inflammatory indicators, such as C-reactive protein, together with reductions of specific immune cells (e.g., T lymphocytes) might serve as useful biomarkers of depression or at least, certain subtypes of the disorder.	natural
The major changes were an increase in belief in genetic causes of both depression and schizophrenia, increases in beliefs about problems from childhood and the death of someone close as causes of depression, and a decrease in the belief that weakness of character is a cause of schizophrenia.	natural
Complete data of 2,801 participants from the National Mental Health Survey of Adults in Singapore were analyzed, using SCAN diagnoses of anxiety disorders and depression, self-reports of chronic medical conditions, and SF-12 measures of QOL (Mental Component Summary, MCS, and Physical Component Summary, PCS).	natural
Black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents were also significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive prescription medication for major depression, to receive treatment for major depression from a mental_health specialist or medical provider, and to receive any mental_health treatment in an outpatient setting (p < .01).	natural

In a large sample of veterans, a prior diagnosis of depression, but not PTSD, was associated with an increased risk of death over an average of 2 years after adjusting for age, demographic variables, health behaviors, and medical comorbidity.	natural
Among men depression was associated with elevated waist circumference only (OR=1.77).	natural
Although there is evidence that depression is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.	natural
No evidence was found for gene-environment correlation, i.e. the genes that influence anxious depression, neuroticism or extraversion do not overlap with the genes that increase the risk of exposure to life events.	natural
Outcomes investigated were wellbeing (depression, psychological distress, selfesteem, lifesatisfaction, guilt, anger, helplessness), attitude to work (employment expectations, employment commitment, employment value) and lifesituation (social support, financial strain, use of community resources).	natural
A relatively large number of industry-sponsored evaluations of escitalopram were identified and these found escitalopram to be potentially cost-effective in depression treatment.	natural
To exclude patients with mild unipolar disorder, subjects with mild depression were not considered for participation in the study.	synthetic_low
Early-onset chronic major depression was somewhat associated with a slightly longer index major depressive episode and moderately higher rates of recurrent major depressive episodes, some comorbid personality disorders, occasional lifetime substance use disorders, mild depressive personality traits, and a background of psychiatric hospitalization.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical linear modelling indicated that the main effects of mild depression and self-relevant cues elicited slight rAMS.	synthetic_low
Group differences in depression scores averaged across time to 18 months were slightly significant on RADS but not on BDI-II.	synthetic_low
An important suicide prophylactic measure would be to enhance the general awareness of hospital clinicians and practitioners of the existence, diagnosis, and treatment of mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low
The findings reinforce previous studies indicating an overall relationship between minor life events and mild depression, but do not suggest that the beneficial effects of maintenance treatment are specifically protective against typical life stress.	synthetic_low
Information Vigilance exerted a concurrent main effect on depression, such that higher scores were associated with slightly less depression irrespective of dialysis type.	synthetic_low
Ratings of parasuicide risk, anxiety, mild depression, social functioning and global function, positive and negative thinking, and quality of life were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.	synthetic_low
