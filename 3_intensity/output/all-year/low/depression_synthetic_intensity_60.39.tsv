Results revealed that: (a) heroin cues were more effective than boring or anxiety-eliciting cues in prompting self-reports of craving or withdrawal; (b) heroin cues produced an affective state characterized by self-reported low-pleasure and high anxiety/tension; (c) craving was not correlated with any particular affective state, but rather was associated with a variety of negative affects--anxiety, depression, fatigue, anger; (d) the coherence (intercorrelations) of affective, craving, and withdrawal measures was greatest when addicts made their self-ratings immediately after exposure to drug stimuli; and (e) while addicts routinely reported craving without withdrawal sickness, they virtually never reported withdrawal sickness without reporting craving.	natural

The BDNF val66met polymorphism had no main effect but was subtly moderated by mild maternal depression, such that children with a BDNF methionine allele had a slightly increased memory for negative self-descriptive traits when mothers had experienced depression during children's lifetimes; in contrast, children with a methionine allele had low recall of negative traits when mothers had no depression history.	synthetic_intensity
