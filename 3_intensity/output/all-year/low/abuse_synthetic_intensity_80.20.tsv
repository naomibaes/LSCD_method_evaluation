The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of a childhood history of minor physical abuse in adult male alcoholics and to determine what subtle differences may exist in the psychological profile and patterns of alcohol abuse in abused and nonabused alcoholics.	synthetic_low
Controlling for multiple factors, smoking cessation was associated with greater abstinence from drug use after completion of mild drug abuse treatment (P=.04).	synthetic_low
Other abuse-related variables (i.e., relation with offender, force, resistance, age of onset, participation, and frequency of mild abuse) were found to be somewhat related to psychological discomfort in adulthood through the mediation of various coping strategies (i.e., Accepting Responsibility, Confrontive Coping) and attributions (i.e., limited internalization of the abuse).	synthetic_low
The sample was composed of cases in which either moderate physical or minor sexual abuse was substantiated through child welfare investigation.	synthetic_low
Certain events somewhat associated with alcohol abuse (e.g., minor hepatic cirrhosis) as well as those wholly associated with alcohol abuse (e.g., moderate alcoholic cirrhosis) have been used to assess modest changes in alcoholism rates over time.	synthetic_low
Nevertheless, there is debate about whether smoking cessation has a minimal effect on substance abuse treatment outcomes.	synthetic_low

Counselors who viewed the husband and wife as equally responsible for wife abuse were the most supportive of a woman's decision to remain married and were most likely to believe that batterers are able to stop being moderately abusive.	synthetic_low
Passive perpetrators included those individuals who did not abuse children, but had knowledge of the minor abuse and allowed it to occur.	synthetic_low
Psychological maltreatment was represented as four mild subtypes of psychological abuse or neglectful behavior: Emotional Non-Responsiveness, Spurning/Terrorizing, Corrupting, and Demanding/Rigid (i.e., controlling behavior).	synthetic_low
The following statistically significant correlations were found: Length of maternal alcohol and drug abuse during pregnancy was weakly correlated negatively with the child's adjustment as were numbers of paternal criminal convictions, number of minor stress factors of the mother, and number of earlier children born to the mother.	synthetic_low

Based on the Social Information Processing model of parenting risk for child abuse, the present study examined the mild associations between mothers and fathers perception of child behavior and slight child abuse potential, as well as whether parenting stress mediates the association between these constructs.	synthetic_low
The present study investigated variables associated with minor delay of disclosure of child sexual abuse and tested a simple model of time to disclosure.	synthetic_low
These four variables were also significantly associated with respondents' own occasional substance abuse in later life, suggesting the potential for mild continuation of these patterns into successive generations.	synthetic_low
A process of achieving nonviolence was identified for most of the participants, although relationship status did not necessarily correspond to benign abuse status and there was minor violence after leaving the relationship.	synthetic_low
There was no difference on the ratings between respondent groups (citizen-social work; age groups, experience with minor child abuse, and parenthood), except for gender.	synthetic_low
The two groups did not differ in terms of their demographic characteristics, but the violent patients had a slightly higher prevalence of substance abuse and borderline personality disorder diagnoses.	synthetic_low
We performed correlational analyses between Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (sub)scores (mild physical and emotional abuse/neglect and minor sexual abuse) and anatomo-functional measurements of the limbic network (hippocampal and amygdala volumes, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity, uncinate fractional anisotropy).	synthetic_low
The two behaviors most commonly associated with occasional fatal abuse are colic and toilet training.	synthetic_low
These criteria are as follows: the minor severity of the abusive incident; the minimal presence of cumulative harm; whether the perpetrator has limited access to the child; the functioning of the parent; whether the perpetrator has been occasionally responsible for child abuse or intimate partner violence in the past; the cooperation of the parent; the unclear intent of the perpetrator; the mature age of the child; the stable functioning of the child; the voice and expressed wishes of the child; protective relationships readily available to the child and the statutory requirement to cause no further harm.	synthetic_low
The research clearly indicated that basic demographic variables were important in accounting for the moderate prevalence of alcohol abuse among veterans, although they could not explain all of the difference.	synthetic_low
The current study investigated the moderating effect of emotional awareness on the relation between minor childhood abuse and both intimate partner violence (IPV) and adult relationship quality.	synthetic_low
The legal system's use of diversion programs for referral/sentencing of batterers is also discussed as an important method for reducing minor spouse abuse.	synthetic_low
Even so, a moderate effort is needed to define and evaluate minor psychological intimate partner abuse.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that for both gender groups, sexual victimization had a primarily direct effect on drug use, whereas physical abuse had both a direct and a minor indirect effect on drug use.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that minor child abuse was associated with both individual and clustering of mild health risk behaviors among Chinese college students.	synthetic_low
High proportions of naturalized and Asian/Pacific Islander families were mildly related to the infrequent occurrences of physical abuse.	synthetic_low
There were also no significant group differences in days of employment, quality of life, or minor substance abuse treatment entry.	synthetic_low
Following assessment it was felt, on the balance of probabilities, somewhat unlikely that any child sexual abuse had occurred in either case.	synthetic_low
It was also confirmed that drug and alcohol use rarely occurs in isolation, with some links identified to neglect and low-level domestic violence, as well as other factors, including minor physical abuse and transient lifestyle.	synthetic_low
Two potential explanations are discounted as mythsâ€”that relatively few males are subtly sexually abused, and that abuse has minimal effect on males.	synthetic_low
