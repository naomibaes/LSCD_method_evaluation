This study with 499 outpatients (222 with anxiety disorders, 63 with minor affective disorders, 136 with both anxiety and mild depression, and 78 with other disorders) examines whether this difference in the correlation pattern can be replicated by simultaneously using three kinds of outcome assessment.	synthetic_low
Data from 16 studies ( = 67 318) revealed that people with subthreshold depression had a slightly increased risk of developing mild major depression (IRR = 1.95, 95 confidence interval 1.282.97).	synthetic_low

Using the SCL-90-R test, the highest mean scores in infertile women were found to be on the paranoid ideation, mild depression, and moderate interpersonal sensitivity scales, and lowest scores were found on the psychoticism and phobic anxiety scales.	synthetic_low
Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_low
The study aimed to design and evaluate a program for the prevention of mild childhood depression (Pozik-Bizi [in English, Live-Happily]), comparing its effects with a socio-emotional intervention program based on light cooperative play.	synthetic_low
They do not constitute discrete syndromes but overlap, each also being closely associated with mild anxiety and slight depression, minor sleep disturbances or mild marital disruption.	synthetic_low
Medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient's clinical diagnoses would have an effect on any relationship between mild depression and hypertension.	synthetic_low
Fifty-three normal and 56 demented subjects were administered the FVFT, the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE), and the Chinese version of the Mild Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_low
Stepwise logistic analyses of symptoms contributing to the categorization of a 'case' of mild post-natal versus low-level non-post-natal depression did not reveal any very clear divergences in self-reported psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Further, regression analyses suggested that mild depression and moderated self-esteem had a slight, direct relationship with eating problems, whereas insecure attachment and social anxiety only seemed to have indirect relations.	synthetic_low
The current study used regression analyses to examine the general relationships between family history of mood disorders and stressful life events as potential risk factors for mild depression in a preschool sample.	synthetic_low
A community sample of 397 women, half of whom had been assaulted by an intimate partner within the prior 6 months, was interviewed about their experience of intimate partner violence, injuries, mild stress, income, mild depression, and minor physical health problems.	synthetic_low
Current mild IPV, current moderate IPV and past moderate IPV were significantly and positively associated with maternal depression.	synthetic_low
The expression masked mild depression is not an ideal one.	synthetic_low
However, few prior studies have considered whether the lower-order dimensions of IU (i.e., prospective and inhibitory IU) and AS (i.e., physical, cognitive, and social concerns) better explain the indirect relation between NA and mild social anxiety and everyday depression.	synthetic_low
Thirteen (42) of 31 siblings of 29 probands with mild depression (n = 21) or anxiety disorders (n = attending a clinic met DSM-IIIR criteria for psychiatric disorder, a rate nearly three times greater than reported from community studies.	synthetic_low
The OSQ seems to be measuring mild depression, slight anxiety, and minor self-devaluation as they affect emotional tone, mastery of external problems, psychopathology, and adjustment.	synthetic_low
In contrast, mild cognitive-affective depression was most closely related to occasional anxiety, slight hypochondriasis, and the number of months since tested HIV positive.	synthetic_low
Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess the effects of mild depression and comorbidities, and the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the cumulative VTE incidence curves.	synthetic_low
The prevalence of minor ST segment depression during mental arithmetic gradually declined when a task slightly involving brief, phasic vagal activation was combined with the mental arithmetic.	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and minor symptoms of depression and anxiety in women studied in the late stages of pregnancy and the early postpartum period.	synthetic_low
Although there is noticeable evidence for the relationship between mild depressive symptoms and medical problems, few studies have directly examined the association between everyday depression and specific medical complaints.	synthetic_low
Simple self-report questionnaires were used to gently measure mild depression, nicotine dependence, smoking motives, and a basic readiness to quit.	synthetic_low
The standard intervention was based upon traditional cognitive-behaviour treatments for mild depression; the experimental intervention was based upon prevention strategies derived from the basic learned helplessness model of depression (e.g. Peterson, Maier, & Seligman, 1993).	synthetic_low
Regression and ANOVA analyses examined: the minor influence of earlier mild depression levels (baseline to 36 months) upon chronotype, and chronotype (at 36 months) upon later subtle depression (48 months).	synthetic_low
Logistic regression showed that increasing age appeared to decrease the risk for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Both groups decreased state anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was the main diagnosis (50) in the suicide group, organic brain syndrome in decreased and normals.	synthetic_low
Fifty-five of these subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, a paper-and-pencil test of mild anxiety and mild depression, and a self-esteem index.	synthetic_low

This study identified modifiable participant characteristics associated with alcohol outcomes in PWH, including mild anxiety and low depression severity, occasional tobacco use, and minor substance use.	synthetic_low
The demographic change will lead to new challenges for the German social and health system in the near future, because it will be accompanied with a moderate increase of gerontopsychiatric disorders, such as dementia or mild depression.	synthetic_low
Here, we aimed to further validate the schizotypy and sleep deprivation models and investigated, for the first time, their interactive effects on smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades, antisaccades, predictive saccades, and measures of psychotomimetic states, anxiety, mild depression, and everyday stress.	synthetic_low
Results are interpreted to suggest that mild depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a slightly altered neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	synthetic_low
However, no significant differences were found for symptoms related to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Although further studies using clinical samples are needed, these findings provide preliminary support for the use of the CDQuest in the assessment of cognitive distortions among individuals experiencing mild depression, anxiety, and minor stress-related disorders.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that a simple ratio approach can be used to explore the relation between response styles and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety in non-clinical children and adolescents.	synthetic_low
In the standard treatment of moderate bipolar depression, it is recommended to start with a mood stabilizer, and consider adding an antidepressant after 4-6 weeks in case of mild nonresponse.	synthetic_low
