Local Protestant church leaders can confront the problem of mild depression by providing parishioners with information in three sensible areas: basic symptoms of and common reasons for depression; slightly distorted understandings and uses of biblical ideas about moderation, balanced self-denial, surrender, and healthy expression of anger and grief; and principles of parenting that encourage children's self-esteem, problem-solving abilities, and faith developmentâ€”strong deterrents to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
