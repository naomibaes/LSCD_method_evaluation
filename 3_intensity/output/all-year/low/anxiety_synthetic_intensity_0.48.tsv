This feature has been consistently lacking in those paradigms we have found insensitive to the influence of anxiety.	natural
Pathological worry and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been linked with low distress tolerance (DT), although questions remain including whether this association exists independent of depression and comorbidity, the directionality of the relationship between worry and DT, and DT's nonredundancy with other worry-relevant variables (i.e., emotional reactivity, stressful life events).	natural

HCV-positive subjects showed higher scores on several psychological stress dimensions (i.e. obsessive-compulsive, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism) and lower scores on fighting spirit, hopelessness and anxious preoccupation towards illness than HIV-positive patients.	natural
Anxiety and mood disorders are common, chronic, costly, and characterized by high comorbidity.	natural
Using the 28-item general health questionnaire, the Zung self-rating depression scale (Zung-SDS), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the Spielberger state-trait-anxiety-inventory (STAI), physical and mental state of the LOW students were compared with those of 30 students who reported their parental bonding as optimal (OPT; high care and low overprotection).	natural
Self consciousness consists of three dimensions, private self consciousness, public self consciousness, and social anxiety.	natural
In this study, the nighttime problems of two girls diagnosed as having separation anxiety disorder were treated with cognitive-behavioral procedures.	natural
Additionally, the ASD group reported high levels of separation anxiety and panic in late adolescence, possibly indicating atypical development of independence.	natural
The use of cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy in treating childhood anxiety disorders has become widespread.	natural
Eligible studies included population-based studies (with a cohort, case-control or cross-sectional design) which assessed maltreatment during childhood or adolescence (18 years) and its association with major depression or generalized anxiety disorder (DSM/ICD diagnostic criteria) in adulthood (>18 years) separately for females and males.	natural
The primary NW symptom was craving (65.1); reporting of anxiety varied by psychiatric diagnosis.	natural
For most children anxiety decreased over time, although for a small number it sustained and became maladaptive.	natural
The failure to distinguish between anxiety and behavior results in conceptual confusion, measurement and methodological problems in research, and in unfocused, nonspecific treatments for communication difficulties.	natural

Comparisons between participants with high and low social anxiety levels did not yield evidence of differences in eye-tracking measures for the whole trial (latency of first fixation, first fixation direction, total dwell time), but the two groups differed in the time course of overt attention during the trial (dwell time across three successive time segments): participants with high social anxiety were slower in disengaging their attention from happy faces.	natural

In a final structural equation model, RS and withdrawal were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms, and RS, sadness, and withdrawal were uniquely associated with social anxiety.	natural
The author argues that it was Freud's ambition to discover the 'caput Nili' in neuropsychology and that his discourse of anxiety informed his early dialogues with the Zurich School at the Burghlzli as he tried to persuade Bleuler and Jung, experts in dementia praecox (paranoia), to replace their toxic theory with his psychosexual theory.	natural
