Again, the results were somewhat similar to previous studies: in each of the three versions examined here, the two most noteworthy components represented a slight disturbance of mood ('mild dysphoria')--including some aspects of anxiety, depression, and irritability--and a minor disturbance of social performance ('social function/optimism').	synthetic_intensity
The relationship of mild anxiety and slight anger to blood pressure was studied in hypertensive patients under environmental conditions by having them take their own blood pressure 4 times daily for 7 weeks and rate their anxiety and anger at those times on simple analog scales.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, this vigilance effect for masked threat faces appeared to be primarily a function of mild social anxiety and some degree of social avoidance, rather than trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We have recently described a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback protocol that can reduce mild contamination-related anxiety, a common symptom of many cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	synthetic_intensity
We found that the following preoperative measures predict freedom from cardiac symptoms 6 months after surgery: low levels of all of the following: mild angina pain, manageable shortness of breath, slight fatigue and few sleep problems, minimal lifetime cigarette usage, and limited preoperative hospitalization for cardiac treatment; low levels of anxiety, depression, and hostility, and few life change events; high levels of all of the following: self-esteem, well-being, vigor; prevalent activities and hobbies, social participation, and social support.	synthetic_intensity
Psychopathology in the children was assessed by structured diagnostic interviews (K-SADS), and pregnancy and delivery complications were assessed using the developmental history module of the DICA-P.
