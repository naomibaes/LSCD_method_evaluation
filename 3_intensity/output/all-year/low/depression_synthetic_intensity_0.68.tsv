Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is common in daily practice.	natural

Depression was found to be related to poorer health and poorer life functioning.	natural
Older youth exhibited increased occurrence of comorbid depression, and an increased occurrence of sexual, magical thinking, and somatic obsessions, as well as, checking, counting and magical thinking compulsions.	natural

This pilot, randomized controlled trial analyzed the effects of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 20) for insomnia vs a sleep hygiene (SH, n = 20) program on the three attentional networks (alertness, orienting, and executive function) and other additional outcome measures (sleep, pain, depression, anxiety, and daily functioning) of fibromyalgia patients.	natural
These findings highlight the differences between depression and paranoia.	natural
In this sample of women, life stress led to postpartum depression irrespective of the subject's past history and the high rates of recurrence of affective or schizoaffective psychosis (47) probably mainly reflected a pre-existing physiological or psychological vulnerability which may have been exacerbated by, or contributed to, marital difficulties.	natural
The results of model fitting suggested the presence of small to moderate correlations (r = +.13 to +.40) between maternal depression and maternal reporting errors, indicating the presence of a tendency for increasing maternal depression to be associated with a tendency for mothers to over-report child behavior problems.	natural
The results show that, in both groups, depression was significantly associated with past history of depression and lower education.	natural
The subjects who considered depression as a disease and who believed that weakness of personality and social problems cause depression had negative attitudes towards depression.	natural
In the first study, students from impoverished backgrounds were found to exhibit significantly greater anger and depression than students representing an average socioeconomic status.	natural
The present study investigated whether symptoms of a clinical depression are adaptive in that they facilitate disengagement from unattainable goals.	natural
There are high rates of co-occurring depression among young people with substance use disorders.	natural
MMPI-2 (Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) data from college students who were attempting to malinger depression (199 women and 171 men) were compared to MMPI-2 data from students who responded honestly (50 women and 45 men).	natural

Persons who reported a keen sense of responsibility for the welfare of another reported more depression and impairment.	natural
These results suggested the following: child-rearing behaviors in non-Western cultures can be, similarly to those in Western cultures, described with the PBI; parental styles, as measured by the PBI, may be associated with depression in non-Western subjects; and sociodemographic influences on PBI scores may be different in subjects with different cultural backgrounds.	natural
