Our results suggest that children and adolescents presenting with functional somatic symptoms represent a distinctive clinical population for which the psychological focus of most currently available questionnaires is not useful for identifying the presence of somatic illness or of comorbid anxiety and depression, and that these measures with the exception of the SPHERE are not a useful adjunct to a familybased assessment.	natural
