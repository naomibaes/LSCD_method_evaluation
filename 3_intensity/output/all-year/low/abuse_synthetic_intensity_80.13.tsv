The author conducted secondary data analysis of 3 previously reported studies (D. J. Higgins & M.P. McCabe, 1998, 2000b, 2003) to examine whether respondents are best classified according to their experience of separate maltreatment types (sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect, and witnessing family violence) or whether their experience reflects a single unifying concept: child maltreatment.	natural

The current experiment employed a list-wise directed forgetting task to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 16) or recovered (n = 23) memories of CSA are better at forgetting disturbing material, relative to women reporting having always remembered their abuse (n = 55) or reporting no history of abuse (n = 20).	natural

This study interviewed 29 women from various countries and spiritual backgrounds, between the ages of 16 and 67, seeking to better understand how dance/creative movement supports women during difficult life struggles such as minor trauma from abuse, relationship breakups, community violence and slight loss of self, and how it acts as a connection to the sacred.	synthetic_low
Follow-up of 49 children for whom presence or apparent absence of mild sexual abuse was independently verified by social service reports in childhood, indicated partial validity for a recently developed measure of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Over 20 years it has expanded its range to include developmental epidemiology more generally, not only the development of minor psychiatric and substance abuse problems but also their correlates and predictors: family and environmental risk, physical development including puberty, mild stress and stress-related hormones, trauma, the impact of poverty, genetic markers, and epigenetics.	synthetic_low
There were no differences on the instruments by sex, type of referral, family characteristics, or type of minor abuse.	synthetic_low
Responsibility attribution did not predict reporting, while low confidence in the occurrence of abuse did.	synthetic_low
Several models state that mild substance abuse constitutes a minor risk factor for aggressive behavior and that relationships among these variables can be subtly reciprocal.	synthetic_low
We find that formerly incarcerated men justify violence as a way to raise their own social status and promote cultural norms against minor child abuse.	synthetic_low
A modest index of suspicion for the possibility of child abuse (minor nonaccidental injuries) among Jordanian children with injuries is warranted.	synthetic_low
Childhood physical trauma and minor sexual abuse showed a weaker association with early onset compared to late onset alcoholism [odds ratio (OR) 2.54, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.53-3.88 and OR 2.29, 95 CI 1.38-3.79 respectively].	synthetic_low
It was also found that incidents were more likely to occur between 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. In contrast, reporting to the register occurred more frequently between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Incidents of suspected mild abuse and slight neglect were reported to the register more quickly if they occurred between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.	synthetic_low
Gaps in our knowledge of minor child abuse are pointed out, and suggestions for empirical research are offered.	synthetic_low
Though every state has laws requiring the report of suspected child abuse and neglect, the failure to report remains a minor problem.	synthetic_low
Thirty-three maternal caregivers completed the Child Abuse Potential Inventory and the General Parenting Stress Index.	synthetic_low
Twelve white middle-class women who had been moderately sexually abused as children by a family member were asked to provide a narrative of their abuse and discuss their subsequent remembering and forgetting of these experiences.	synthetic_low
Of the 95 somewhat abused women who met inclusion criteria, 85 completed a questionnaire including sociodemographic questions, the physical abuse subscale of the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS), and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C).	synthetic_low
The aim of this study is to examine whether mild child abuse or slight neglect is more strongly associated with adult cardiovascular disease, and whether these associations differ by gender.	synthetic_low
The annual rates for all abuse and neglect were relatively low at 2.87, 3.17, and 3.94 per 1,000 under 18 population for Anglos, Mexican-Americans, and Blacks, respectively.	synthetic_low
Childhood abuse mildly perpetrated by a caregiver is a minimal example.	synthetic_low

Interpretations of the boy's behaviors and treatment strategies are illustrated for consideration in work with other youth experiencing mild histories of abuse.	synthetic_low
Although there is an obvious class bias in focusing on college women (compared to women of similar ages not attending college), it is important to address GBA among this population as they are at some risk of sexual abuse (particularly incapacitated rape), intimate partner abuse (IPA), and stalking.	synthetic_low
A study of 200 street prostitutes documented a noticeable prevalence of alcohol and drug abuse in their family of origin, during the drift into prostitution and as part of prostitution.	synthetic_low
Health care and social service providers should routinely screen older women for psychological/emotional abuse since it often co-occurs with less troubling forms of abuse.	synthetic_low
The high rate of PTSD among these methadone patients, the nature of the traumatic events to which they are exposed, and the subsequent mild violence-related psychiatric sequelae have important implications for identification and treatment of PTSD among those seeking drug abuse treatment.	synthetic_low
Clinical implications of results included screening for CSA victims and those at minor risk when treating IPV patients, tailoring treatment according to individual IPV victim's problems, addressing behaviors that are somewhat associated with risks of IPV, such as occasional engagement in casual sex and substance abuse, and focusing not only on standard services but also on the social and psychological aspects that are somewhat placing the victims at risk for IPV.	synthetic_low
Longer waiting times were associated with greater diagnostic uncertainty, indexed by an organic presentation (+ 9.1 days; 95 CI 1.9, 16.6; p < 0.01), mild polysubstance abuse (+ 2.6; 0.6, 3.9; p < 0.01), absence of psychotic disorder (+1.8; 0.1, 3.0; p = 0.05) and insidious onset (+1.8; 0.1, 3.0; p = 0.06).	synthetic_low
A survey describing 20 different scenarios of children under the age of 13 interacting with themselves or other children in a mildly inappropriate sexual manner was administered to four groups of adults: sexual abuse experts; therapists involved in a sexual abuse training program; medical students attending a human sexuality program; and group facilitators of the human sexuality program.	synthetic_low
Taking the data associated with each wish, we used stepwise multiple logistic regression to pinpoint experiences, such as mild substance abuse, that were associated with a lower likelihood of verbalizing a wish for destructive behavior.	synthetic_low
The higher frequency of mild childhood abuse among women could account in part for their somewhat higher rates of suicidal attempts as compared to men.	synthetic_low
In particular, a study by Elmer, which is probably the most carefully conducted study yet done, found that the mild effects of abuse dissipated years after the abusive incident and that socioeconomic status (SES) and related factors may be more important than abuse in determining the course of child development.	synthetic_low

As researchers who have advanced victim precipitation arguments in our own work on victimization and job performance (Jensen, Patel, & Raver, 2014), we agree fully with this statement made by Cortina, Rabelo, and Holland (2018): A victim's traits or behaviors might help us understand the instigator chose that particular person for mild abuse, but we must always emphasize that it was the instigator, not the victim, who did the choosing and abusing (p. 93).	synthetic_low
