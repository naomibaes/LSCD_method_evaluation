Clinicians treating primarily those with trauma might assess for disordered eating as a potential manifestation of the sequelae of trauma and attachment insecurity.	natural
Childhood trauma was associated with poorer social cognition in both men and women.	natural
Finally, the results suggest that the quality of the attachment relationship may in part account for why some people exposed to later trauma develop dissociative symptoms and others do not.	natural
To respond to trauma and behavioral health needs of children, these states' initiatives established implementation plans for screening, functional assessment, data-driven case planning, ongoing progress monitoring, and service array reconfiguration.	natural
Multivariate analyses of covariance, adjusting for abuse characteristics (age of onset, penetration, and number of perpetrators) and other trauma exposure, revealed significant differences in psychiatric symptom severity among the three groups, Wilks' =0.	natural
Moreover, violent trauma may play a role in the etiologies of depression, substance abuse, and trauma-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
These results suggest that social support may reduce symptoms of PTSD, GAD, and depression through increased self-compassion in those who experienced a trauma.	natural
Fifteen-hour urinary cortisol samples were collected from MVA victims upon admission to the trauma unit.	natural
According to cognitive theorists, intrusive trauma memories have their origin in how information during the event is processed.	natural
Trauma exposure (TE) and numerous deployments have been associated with negative health outcomes in veterans, many of whom have military sexual trauma (MST) and combat exposure (CE).	natural
Results indicated that (a) trauma symptoms and posttraumatic growth were both significantly predictive of career adaptability and (b) posttraumatic growth moderated the relationship between trauma and career adaptability.	natural
Participants who wrote only about trauma or perceived benefits showed significantly fewer health center visits for illness 3 months after writing.	natural
Analysis indicated that the questionnaire showed good internal consistency and was significantly correlated with known measures of trauma.	natural
Because dissociation, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and catecholamine functioning have all been implicated in the development of stress disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, these data suggest that some biological differences may exist before index trauma exposure and before the development of stress-related illness.	natural
Further, trauma can lead to dissociation as a defense against stress, and multiple personality disorder is an extreme example of dissociation.	natural
Sharing the mild meaning of the trauma also highlighted vital aspects in the functioning of the mind of the group, leading to a new and more gentle way of facing illness and death.	synthetic_intensity
Deficits in memory performance were not related to intelligence quotient, length of minor trauma exposure, or time since mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of a mild trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	synthetic_intensity
Aims of the study were (a) to identify premigration correlates (e.g., mild trauma in home countries), (b) to identify migration-related correlates (e.g., stable immigration status, brief time spent separated from children during migration), and (c) to identify premigration and migration correlates that accounted for minimal variance after controlling for nonmigration-related correlates (e.g., neighborhood crime, parents' psychological discomfort).	synthetic_intensity
An alternative theory, betrayal trauma theory (BTT), proposes that dissociation slightly reduces awareness of betrayal to maintain a moderately needed relationship.	synthetic_intensity
There are 2.3 million hospitalizations each year as a result of mild trauma and 142,500 deaths.	synthetic_intensity
These results indicate that an inhibitory control deficit is specifically associated with the current PTSD symptoms but not with mild trauma exposure per se.	synthetic_intensity
A second multiple regression analysis indicated that believing that televising rape trials would slightly impact a rape victim's trauma was most highly related to women's behavioral intention to report a rape.	synthetic_intensity
The minimal number of consecutive intrusions resulting from the trauma film, the less vividness of the intrusions, and the moderate degree of distress evoked by the intrusions were assessed during the following 4 days.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that early mild trauma exposure subtly affects the development of the CC, which may play a minor role in the pathophysiology of PTSD in adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Regression models compared the number of Complex PTSD symptoms in trafficked children and non-trafficked children who had experienced mild or single trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Interest in the potential for positive adjustment following mild trauma has prompted consideration of its possible clinical utility in working with people who have been lightly traumatized.	synthetic_intensity
Age, GOAT at admission and chronicity, but not APOE genotype or initial mild trauma severity, were significant predictors of emergence from PTA.	synthetic_intensity
A case of secondary diurnal enuresis (SDE) after a minor car accident was treated with hypnosis by means of the Hypnotic Trauma Narrative, an instrument created by the authors for use with children who have been exposed to mild traumatic events and develop either subtle symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder or manifest mild psychosomatic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The relative values of imaginal and real-life exposure exercises were tested in this study by randomizing 14 patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD at least 6 months after the minor trauma to one of two groups.	synthetic_intensity
Two alternative models are presented for group treatment of mild trauma and moderate trauma-related disorders in female methadone patients; potential benefits of each in slightly reducing symptomatology and improving interpersonal functioning are examined.	synthetic_intensity
Only few studies have differentiated minor illness-related life-threatening stressors from other less intense forms of trauma, and the potentially different mechanisms connected with PTG outcome in cancer patients.	synthetic_intensity
Therapists are in a unique position to use their expertise, research, and clinical experience to become active in seeking protection for their field, as well as children and adult survivors of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Together they develop strategies and interventions that are therapeutic and address the mild impact of trauma on all aspects of the child's development and wellbeing.	synthetic_intensity
In this clinical communication, the author discusses the tendency to revisit past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the anxiety of potential breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the cautious defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_intensity
