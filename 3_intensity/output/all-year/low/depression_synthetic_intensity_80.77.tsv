Moreover, we will also describe the function of the striatum in the integration of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to produce subtle long-term changes of synaptic efficacy (slight long-term depression, gentle long-term potentiation).	synthetic_low
The results of this review suggest that across theories there is a slight relation between the vulnerability-stress interaction and minor elevations in depression among children (pr=0.15) and a somewhat larger effect (pr=0.22) among adolescents.	synthetic_low
Analyses on clinical outcomes suggested no group difference but demonstrated an overall recovery rate of 52.6% and noticeable reduction in both mild depression and general anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
Clinical symptoms were rated with the Young Mania Rating Scale and the slightly simplified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and functional status using the Functional Assessment Short Test.	synthetic_low
Moderator analyses revealed small effect sizes for slightly increased depression and some body dissatisfaction among high-risk participants.	synthetic_low
The present study aimed to investigate risk factors for the occurrence of mild postnatal depression in urban South African women.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that either the minor initial amine depletion provoked by bothersome aversive experiences or a mild dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in transient amine depletion, contributes to behavioral depression.	synthetic_low
Eighty-two newly diagnosed patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire--Revised (IPQ-R), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale (HADS), the Brief COPE and the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R).	synthetic_low
The aim of the current study was to compare the noticeable features of depressive patients with a light FH of mania (FHM), those of depressive patients with a mild FH of depression (FHD), and those of depressive patients with no FH of affective illness (FHO).	synthetic_low
95 of cases had at least one neuropsychiatric symptom, with mild depression being the most common, irrespective of subtype or manageable severity of VCI.	synthetic_low
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between mild depression and subtle quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_low
In the present study, we examine whether three aspects of childhood adversity--low socio-economic status (SES), family disruption, and residential instability--are related to increased risk of mild depression during specific stages of the life course.	synthetic_low
Outcome on mild depressive symptoms was assessed with the straightforward 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	synthetic_low
Controlled clinical studies have shown the efficacy and effectiveness of this therapeutic model for the management of mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_low
Pessimism and occasional wine consumption were slightly correlated with mild depression among women only.	synthetic_low
Fifty-one adults presenting for treatment completed measures of self-reported attentional control, light rumination, and mild depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
Coping both moderated and partially mediated the relationship between minor cognitive dysfunction and mild depression.	synthetic_low
To address the field's minimal knowledge in this area, we interviewed community-based therapists (N = 23) who had completed intensive training in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for either mild anxiety or light depression as part of a randomized effectiveness trial (Southam-Gerow et al.,	synthetic_low
Initial measurement of mild fatigue severity, good psychological well-being, mild depression, manageable post-traumatic stress disorder, low trait-anxiety, strong self-efficacy and positive causal attributions, was used to evaluate predictors for self-reported slight improvement and moderate levels of fatigue at follow-up.	synthetic_low
In conclusion, these findings provide general support for the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis of mild social anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
However, this subsensitivity was not correlated to the mild severity of depression as both mildly and moderately depressed patients exhibited the same percent of adenylate cyclase inhibition.	synthetic_low
Using logistic regression analyses, the results supported previous findings of a familial association between eating disorders and a mild form of major depression.	synthetic_low
Both drugs were found to be approximately equivalent and with no significant differences due to the overall assessment of the reduction of mild depression severity and improvement of goal symptoms.	synthetic_low
Bipolar depression has been found to be mildly associated with subtle changes in prefrontal cortex activity during the performance of simple cognitive tasks.	synthetic_low
Selective memory for moderately negative events in mild depression was assessed by a simple test of memory for personally relevant adjectives.	synthetic_low
