Previous studies have identified a number of variables which help to predict cognitive dysfunction following closed head injury (CHI) The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the predictive utility of a number of risk factors in a large sample of trauma patients who suffered CHI and underwent neuropsychological assessment Risk factors included demographic variables, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), CT scan, loss of consciousness (LOC), and blood alcohol level (BAL) Multiple regression was used to assess the role of these variables in predicting cognitive dysfunction Results suggested that LOC did not predict cognitive dysfunction Demographic factors did emerge as predictors of cognitive dysfunction BAL was correlated with initial GCS, but did not predict cognitive dysfunction once post-traumatic amnesia cleared.	natural
Pennebakers experimental writing paradigm quantifies who, when, and how people benefit from writing about trauma, but researchers and meta-analyses thus far have rarely considered gender.	natural
Participants were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Combat Exposure Scale (CES), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Mississippi Scale for PTSD (MPTSD).	natural

We estimated the prevalence of childhood abuse at baseline using data from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, a 28-item validated instrument used to retrospectively assess childhood maltreatment.	natural
Although participants who completed trauma and sex surveys reported slightly higher levels of negative emotion than did participants who completed cognitive measures, averages were very low for both groups, and outliers were rare.	natural

These data suggest that early sensitization to environmental stressors may be associated with a high prevalence of current PTSD and excess CVD risk factors in subjects exposed to mild war-time trauma and that this may lead to vital exhaustion.	synthetic_intensity

Children and youth experiencing mild sexual trauma reported some levels of avoidance symptoms that were, in turn, slightly associated with a lower likelihood of completing trauma-focused mental health treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The most commonly reported trigger to recall of the mild trauma was some form of media presentation (i.e., casual television show, light movie), whereas psychotherapy was the least commonly reported trigger.	synthetic_intensity

However, by drawing on basic psychoanalytic explanations of mild trauma, gender, and cultural fantasy, we show that these cinematic representations of masculinity are often somewhat complex, ambiguous, and transitional, and, as such, may lie somewhere in between overly defensive narcissistic modes of masculinity and those which are more fluid and open to change.	synthetic_intensity
The finding of measurement bias associated with type of trauma raises questions about the applicability of a single definition for PTSD associated with minor assaultive violence and PTSD associated with traumatic events of lesser magnitude.	synthetic_intensity
