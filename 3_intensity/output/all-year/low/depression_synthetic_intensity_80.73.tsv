We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving idealized cultural identities would slightly increase both self-esteem and some shame, with the latter leading to mild depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_low
At follow-up time points, there were slightly higher levels of clinician-rated PTSD, anxiety, and manageable depression symptoms and moderately lower social support in the nonresponders compared to the responders.	synthetic_low
Until now basic symptoms had not been studied during the intrapsychotic phase, mainly because of their transformation into first-rank symptoms; present findings suggest that basic symptoms are moderately active also at the height of the psychotic breakdown and that they are more responsive to treatment in mild Depression and Mania than in Schizophrenia.	synthetic_low
Since mild depression is known to be associated with some HPA axis dysfunction and moderate inflammation, a psychoneuroendocrinological (PNE) model of inflammation was examined in persons diagnosed with CFS in order to uncover basic underlying biopsychosocial mechanisms in this poorly understood chronic illness.	synthetic_low
Higher frequency of leisure time physical activity was weakly associated with lower levels of mild depression and anxiety, and slightly higher levels of self-esteem.	synthetic_low
However, previous studies have not controlled for the effects of mild depression levels on maternal ratings of child temperament or evaluated the accuracy of maternal reports.	synthetic_low

Minimal mood disturbances such as slight anxiety and subtle depression seemed to be uncommon in the mothers of primary school children with DS.	synthetic_low
In this community-based single blinded Phase-I, randomized controlled trial, outcomes (psychological and physiological stress, immune activation, generic and HIV-specific health-related quality of life, mild depression and quality of well-being) were assessed at baseline and at six months, and were compared using basic parametric and nonparametric tests.	synthetic_low
Results showed that parents', professors', and peers' social support were important antecedent variables that increased the students' self-esteem, that parents' and professors' social support were associated with slightly lower depression, and that moderate self-esteem was associated with greater happiness and somewhat lower depression.	synthetic_low
The mild relationship between depression, usual personality traits, common illness attitudes, routine life events and typical health history, and breast cancer risk was studied in a prospective, 6-9 year follow-up of a cohort study of 10892 Finnish women of 48-50 years of age at the baseline.	synthetic_low

Indeed, contrary to hopelessness theory, an accumulating body of research indicates that mild hopelessness moderates the subtle relationship between vulnerability factors and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Moderate anxiety and mild depression were found to be somewhat correlated with tinnitus severity, as was locus of control, with internals reporting their tinnitus to be less severe than externals.	synthetic_low
