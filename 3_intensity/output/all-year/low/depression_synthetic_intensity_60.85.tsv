Dephosphorylation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) GluA1 subunits at two sites, serine 845 (S845) and threonine 840 (T840), is thought to be involved in NMDA receptor-dependent forms of long-term depression (LTD).	natural

The current study included 51 published and unpublished studies that included a quantitative comparison between maternal depression and child ADHD.	natural
The concept of uncanny anxiety can be distinguished from other clinical entities such as occasional anxiety states, mild depression, or gentle mourning.	synthetic_low
Subjects tended to be mildly affected in the same way by the treatments regardless of their pretreatment levels of mild depression, moderate anxiety, or low hostility.	synthetic_low
The post mortem findings indicated no significant change in serotonin transporter binding in mild depression in the brainstem (p=0.64), the frontal cortex (p=0.75) and the hippocampus (p=0.32, corrected for publication bias).	synthetic_low
While there was no notable overlap between apathy and depression at index assessment (OR = 1.79, 95 CI 0.48, 6.66), the overlap was moderately significant a year later (OR = 7.75, 95 CI 2.60, 23.13).	synthetic_low
Under mild waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was somewhat blocked, but other signs of arousal were generally intact.	synthetic_low
The subtle regression of adjustment—indexed by lower measures of anxiety and mild depression on masculinity (instrumentality) and femininity (expressiveness)—as assessed by the BSRI, PRF ANDRO, and the Short BSRI was studied in 122 college men.	synthetic_low
Mild depression-proneness profiles were derived using clinician diagnosed personal and family histories of major depression, occasional depression, slight trait-anhedonia, and calmly ruminative coping styles (n=70).	synthetic_low
Verbal creativity has been linked to occasional personal and family experiences of mild bipolar depression.	synthetic_low
Assessed the moderate impact of some difficulty forming an occupational dream and normal relationship challenges with parents on mild depression among college students in their late teens and early twenties.	synthetic_low
These data also highlight the health risks of loneliness; pain, mild depression, and some fatigue often accompany illness and place people at risk for poorer health and mortality.	synthetic_low
Adequate predictive validity was supported through correlations with measures of patient functioning, after controlling for pain and process from the PF model, including: mild depression, =.15, p<.01, minor work and social adjustment, =.10, p<.05, and slight pain interference, =.11, p<.05.	synthetic_low
We have studied 2 men suffering from moderate depression and have observed that nocturnal penile tumescence was somewhat reduced while the men were depressed but returned to normal on recovery.	synthetic_low
Furthermore in the mild depression group the sex of the patients and a slight restriction of the treatment by the health insurance companies subtly influenced the treatment results and in the anxiety group the frequency of treatment and the age of the patients.	synthetic_low
However, when the constricted groups were combined and then compared with 40 Ss who did not show constriction of Bender drawings, the constricted group had mildly elevated (p less than .05) MMPI Depression scores.	synthetic_low
The persistent nature of pain and to a lesser extent mild depression and the intimate and probably reciprocal association between them highlight the need for appropriate treatment strategies.	synthetic_low
The inverse relationship between suicidal behavior and mild depression may mean that suicidal behavior is, in some ways, subtly different from that seen in other psychiatrically ill adolescents.	synthetic_low
The slight decrease of depression accompanying an increase of avoidance-oriented stress coping was somewhat greater in patients with low income and in older patients than it was in the other patients.	synthetic_low
Prior to RT, anxiety was more prevalent than mild depression (20 vs 15), but dropped following completion of RT, whereas median depression levels remained slightly elevated (17 vs. 27).	synthetic_low
The mild severity of depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and occasional binge eating behaviors were investigated using the self-report scale for bulimic behaviors.	synthetic_low
A one-way analysis of variance of sex role orientation on postpartum BDI scores showed that undifferentiated women reported slightly more mild depression than other sex role groups.	synthetic_low
The effect of readiness to change on treatment outcome was examined among 332 adolescents (46 male, 74 Caucasian), ages 12 through 17 years (M = 14.6, SD = 1.5), with mild variations of major depressive disorder who were participating in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS).	synthetic_low

This study examined patient-level factors associated with engagement in mental health treatment in a sample of medically ill patients with moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness perceptions of identity, treatment control, and timeline cyclical were predictors of anxiety while illness perceptions of identity and perceiving the cause to be related to chance were found to be significant positive predictors of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The implicit memory test was a straightforward word identification task and the explicit memory test was a simple incidental free recall with mildly depression relevant, anxiety relevant, emotionally positive, and neutral words.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with slightly deficient encoding in DAT and minor performance deficits as a function of somewhat effortful cognitive processing in mild depression.	synthetic_low

The scale included clinically relevant symptoms of both mania and mild depression in a bivariate scale.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that both mild depression and mood are uniquely associated with minor momentary pain; as such, basic multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_low
