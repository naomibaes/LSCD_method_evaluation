However, it is unknown whether changes in gray matter volume also appear in healthy individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression (CVD).	natural
Finally we discuss clinical implications of cognitive imaging in depression, and specifically the possible role for these techniques in diagnosis and treatment planning.	natural
Dependent variables included diagnoses and self-ratings of fear, depression, general anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Additionally, regression results demonstrated that self-compassion and mindfulness predicted decreases in anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and increases in life satisfaction post-intervention.	natural

This article considers 3 levels of severity of cases satisfying research diagnostic criteria for mild depression: mild, moderate, and severe.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to the reference group, mild depression and diabetes mellitus were (over time) somewhat related with a need for recovery caseness and minor restrictions in social participation but not with restrictions in work participation.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, attributions of symptom change for patients concurrently taking antidepressant medications, as well as the mild problems related to low-level chronic depression, are covered in detail.	synthetic_intensity
Recent assault, current PTSD, or mild current depression status were not associated with increased cigarette use.	synthetic_intensity
The results lend some support to the mild suggestion that there might be a slight increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a subtle decrease in depression.	synthetic_intensity
The FRI was also far more sensitive in identifying families with a member with mild levels of depression and anxiety than the General Functioning (FAD-GF) scale of the Family Assessment Device.	synthetic_intensity
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored slightly higher on total Depression but not differently than normals on total Anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the mediating effects of psychosocial factors such as mild depression, anxiety, self-esteem, manageable stress, and adequate social support on the reduced suicidal probability among 1,586 adolescents attending middle and high schools in the Kyunggi Province area of South Korea.	synthetic_intensity
The mild features of depression in young people and aspects of temperament that are somewhat relevant to low-level depression are briefly reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
Logistic regression analyses indicated fair or poor self-rated health at baseline to be predictive of a modest twofold increased risk for mild major depression at follow-up, even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle-related behaviors, disability and diabetes characteristics (OR=2.05, 95 CI 1.20-3.48).	synthetic_intensity
The original analysis of data on 100 consecutive school age children referred for evaluation of school difficulties showed no differences in IQ among the children with mild depression and those without depression.	synthetic_intensity
We measured BRS by the sequence method in 36 patients with treated mild recurrent depression, who were euthymic at the time of study and with no manifest cardiac disease or conventional cardiac risk factors, compared with 39 healthy controls.	synthetic_intensity
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	synthetic_intensity
The standard definition of depression was based on average CES-D scores, without additional corroborating clinical evaluation.	synthetic_intensity
-MPT, in doses of 100200 mg/kg, causes in septal rats a mild behavioral depression nearing a slight lethargic state and a minor lowering of the irritability scores.	synthetic_intensity
There were regular serial assessments pre-operatively and at 2 weeks and 6 months post-operatively using the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild depression, the Present State Examination (PSE), basic Newcastle Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
A goal-orientation model is proposed that integrates mild motivational and cognitive factors in attempting to explain and predict low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
This group has somewhat reduced the members' low-level depression, mild anxiety, and occasional isolation and has assisted them with anticipatory mourning and the creation of a basic support network.	synthetic_intensity
This may indicate that both the mild intensity and occasional frequency of symptoms ought to be considered to obtain a reasonable objective measure of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with predictions, relations between the number of stressful life events and posttraumatic stress symptoms, mild depression, substance use, and motivations for non-suicidal self-injury were weaker among those with more of a growth mindset relative to those with more of a fixed mindset.	synthetic_intensity
