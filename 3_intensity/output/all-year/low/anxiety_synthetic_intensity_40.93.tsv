Urban-rural classification significantly predicted poorer mental_health both before (=-.29) and after (=-.20) controlling for a large number of socio-economic variables, with more urban areas having relatively higher rates of prescription for psychotropic medication for mild anxiety, depression, and psychosis.	synthetic_intensity

These results suggest that self-monitoring of stimulus persons affects interjudge consistency of personality judgments particularly for private traits such as mild anxiety, which are most subject to moderate expressive control and inhibition.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis showed that the minor anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and mild depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had some negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and failure in previous treatment were also considered to be factors of poorer QoL. The findings indicate that the QoL was slightly worse in women with moderate depression and anxiety level, failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	synthetic_intensity
