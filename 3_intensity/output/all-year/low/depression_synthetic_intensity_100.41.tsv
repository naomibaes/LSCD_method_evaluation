The results presented, along with those from other studies of adults and children, provide evidence that DSM criteria for mild major depression are suitable for adolescents.	synthetic_low
Mild depressive symptoms and common coping strategies of 161 Chinese adolescents were assessed and described using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ).	synthetic_low
One of the most consistent findings in psychiatric research is that rates of mild major depression are at least twofold higher among women than among men.	synthetic_low
Effects were less pronounced on multivariate analysis but continued to show a significant effect on length of stay even after controlling for demographics, personal and family history, and mild anxiety and depression screening scores.	synthetic_low
Cognitive hypotheses about mild depression derived from the reformulated learned helplessness theory were tested in students' attributional analyses of the causes of their own mildly stressful life events.	synthetic_low
The role of a mild lack of perceived care in the development of slight depression is reviewed, and suggestions are made for applications of decision analytic methods to some general questions concerning the role played by judgments about the future in the development of minor vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
While as low as 10 M delta-tetrahydrocannabinol showed some reduction in both the membrane-bound ATPases, the other cannabinoids did not show such a noticeable depression in enzyme activity.	synthetic_low
Life Satisfaction Index-A. Scores on the modified Index were slightly negatively correlated with those on the mild Depression and Shyness scales and positively correlated with somewhat increased scores on the Self-esteem and Life Satisfaction scales (p< .05).	synthetic_low
Finally, it was suggested that it should be interesting to try to estimate, from available published data, the correlation between mild endogenous and mild neurotic depression in the general population.	synthetic_low
Themes of slight dependency, mild autonomy, or minor conflicts between the two are prominent in the literature on the relationship between personality and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Groups were not different in cognitive performance, after controlling for slight fatigue, pain, and mild depression; depression was minimally related to memory performance and moderate fatigue was related to psychomotor speed.	synthetic_low
Consistent with previous investigations that have revealed the EPDS to be bidimensional in late pregnancy and postpartum, the current investigation confirmed the bidimensional (anxiety and mild depression) factor structure of the instrument in early pregnancy.	synthetic_low
Consistent with evidence on risk and gender, mild depression symptoms were more gently associated with secondary control in girls and primary control in boys.	synthetic_low
Therefore, we investigated whether the relationship between body image and HRQoL in adolescent girls is mildly influenced by slight depression.	synthetic_low
The Beck Depression Inventory and Children's Depression Inventory were used to assess mild depression in adults and children, and adult and child forms of Rippere's (1977) Antidepressive Activity Questionnaire were employed to assess the occasional frequency of engagement in and moderate helpfulness of antidepressive activities.	synthetic_low
Emotional and external eating appear to co-occur and both have been shown to have some correlation to neuroticism, particularly mild depression.	synthetic_low
Although a slightly elevated stress level may have a possible impact on mild psychiatric diseases especially minor depression and some tumours, it seems that prolonged moderate stress does not appear to be harmful to other stress-related diseases.	synthetic_low
In a postal questionnaire study, 224 women with a history of an eating disorder completed measures of anorexic and bulimic symptoms, mild depression, and some shame.	synthetic_low

Correlational support for this opioidergic theory of food cravings is provided by examining various mild clinical conditions (e.g. pregnancy, menstruation, bulimia, mild stress, mild depression) which are associated with slightly altered EOP levels, intensified food cravings, and increased food intake.	synthetic_low
Multivariate meta-analysis examined the modest efficacy of preventive interventions on mild depression and low-level anxiety outcomes separately, and the combined efficacy on both conditions in a tempered manner.	synthetic_low
