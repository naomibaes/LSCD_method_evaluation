Whereas field memories afforded richer accounts of the affective reactions, somatic sensations, and psychological states that participants experienced during the focal trauma, observer memories contained more information about participants' physical appearance and actions and the spatial layout of the traumatic scene.	natural
The number of individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a small percentage of those exposed to trauma; many youth who do not meet criteria for PTSD continue to experience problematic posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptomology.	natural
Fifteen BPD patients, 14 patients with Cluster C personality disorders (PD), 19 patients with axis-I psychopathology and 21 non-patients filled out the World Assumptions Scale, the Personality Disorder Belief Questionnaire, a childhood trauma checklist (assessing physical, emotional and sexual abuse) and the BPD Checklist (severity of BPD psychopathology).	natural
Based on the existing evidence base regarding risk and protective factors for STS, six core elements targeted by the curriculum are describedappraisals, self-efficacy, emotional awareness, affect regulation, resilience, and preventionas they are implemented across three stages: pre-exposure preparation, coping in the presence of trauma, and recovery in the aftermath of exposure.	natural

Specifically, after controlling for age, occurrence of trauma and distress of trauma, attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, predicted more PTSD total severity and avoidance symptoms in the interpersonal trauma group.	natural

The psychological impact of trauma on 36 parents and spouses was examined 1 year (1989), 3 years (1991), and 5 years (1993) after a fatal school bus accident in Western Norway in 1988.	natural
The absence of intimate and specific recognition and response by the caretaker of a child can create, by their omission, a freeze version of the fight/flight/freeze trauma response.	natural
Lacking a strong sense of self and feeling blameful for what they have experienced, trauma victims may become unable to sustain intimate relationships and romantic dyads.	natural
The posttraumatic maladaptive beliefs scale (PMBS) was developed to measure maladaptive beliefs about current life circumstances that may occur following trauma exposure.	natural

This pilot, proof of concept study evaluated a computerized imaginal exposure Script-Driven Imagery Training (SDI-T) for individuals with elevated trauma reactivity.	natural
This paper suggests that phobia could be understood as an intolerance of conceiving mental states, preventing integration of psychic trauma.	natural
Overall, results suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are common in youth with ASD, and may be related to depression and trauma.	natural
The process of meaning-making and reconstructing one's inner world and sense of self are foundational in trauma resolution and may be facilitated through the use of sandtray intervention.	natural
The role of assessment, interfacing with the family and the legal system, offender treatment, trauma and sexual compulsivity treatment, residential and outpatient therapy, family and community safety are elements of a complex treatment process at various stages.	natural
Because applications of survival analysis in trauma research are scarce, this paper presents the utility of this analytical approach by contrasting it with other common methods of analysis (chi-square tests and Cox regression with covariates that do not change over time).	natural
The authors report relationships between PTSD symptoms and objective sleep measures from the early aftermath of trauma.	natural
Injury pattern data were obtained for one type of trauma, falls from children's highchairs, from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).	natural
Using a sample of African American adult female volunteers who self-reported a history of child abuse and/or sexual or physical assault in adulthood, the present study sought to examine the relationships between trauma history, locus of control, and PTSD symptom severity.	natural

A one-group pretest-posttest design was used to examine changes on 10 Trauma Symptom Inventory subscales (Anxious Arousal, Depression, Anger/Irritability, Intrusive Experiences, Defensive Avoidance, Dissociation, Sexual Concerns, Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior, Impaired Self-Reference, and Tension Reduction Behavior).	natural
Varied process elements may be more or less useful, depending on different adverse situations over time, with a major crisis, trauma, or loss; disruptive transitions; or chronic multi-stress conditions.	natural
These findings suggest that mild interference for trauma cues may provide a simple nonintrospective index of minor intrusive cognitive activity.	synthetic_intensity
A correlation network analysis showed that some types of trauma are somewhat more likely to co-occur and that slightly traumatic experiences in attachment relationships during childhood were significantly associated with other trauma in life.	synthetic_intensity
An in-depth understanding of this mild level of trauma and posttraumatic effects is instrumental in making a culturally sensitive diagnosis and in developing intervention strategies based on local knowledge that has not been entirely lost but is nonetheless being questioned.	synthetic_intensity
The goal of this cross-sectional study was to examine the effects of minor early childhood trauma, recent slightly stressful life events, and mild depression on manageable intensity and impairment of fatigue in HIV, over and above demographic factors and clinical characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, minor childhood trauma, and personality diagnosis raise a minor challenge to some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to determine whether there are gender differences in both caregiver and child-reported trauma exposure and symptoms among 167 children who have experienced minor trauma (318 years, M = 9.90, SD = 3.92; 61.67 female).	synthetic_intensity
It posits four dynamics—mild sexualization, minor betrayal, mild stigmatization, and slight powerlessness—that cause mild trauma by subtly distorting a child's self-concept, worldview, and affective capacities.	synthetic_intensity
The strong need to rescue this particular patient was fueled by Mrs. As history of early physical and minor abandonment trauma, which increased her vulnerability to identification with her mildly traumatized patient.	synthetic_intensity
For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was mildly re-experiencing the minor trauma (e.g., mumbling specific words and having slight body responses).	synthetic_intensity
Increased risk of UAI was associated with both regular drinking (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 12.6), regular drinking to intoxication (OR 2.6, 95 CI 1.0, 6.8), and reporting minor symptoms of rectal trauma resulting from anal intercourse (AI; OR 4.3, 95 CI 1.8, 10.4).	synthetic_intensity
These relationships are discussed in terms of conceptualizing objectification and self-objectification as a form of subtle trauma or minor microaggression.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we include a discussion of issues specific to various mild trauma populations and factors that may influence treatment efficacy across types of minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after moderate trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_intensity
The findings support the hypothesis that experience of mild trauma may precede psychiatric symptoms, perhaps including positive symptoms of schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
