Planning for the studies required to validate prevention strategies requires identification of subjects at moderate risk and recruitment of unbiased samples that represent the larger at-risk population (difficult because of the avoidance of many mild trauma victims).	synthetic_intensity
The findings lend support to recent cognitive and developmental models of the aetiology of mild post-traumatic stress disorder, and the possible shared cognitive vulnerability between subtle trauma symptoms and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
