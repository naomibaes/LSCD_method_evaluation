Results indicate that individuals in the mild trauma categories scored slightly higher in neuroticism and openness to new experiences than individuals in the control group.	synthetic_low
The trauma not only involves a challenging withdrawal from the drug and routine medical procedures carried out in isolation in a special care baby unit, but often also a continuing series of minor trauma due to the lack of availability of a receptive containing parent.	synthetic_low
Complex trauma is a much-debated construct and research findings are varied due to, for example, the minor lack of conceptual clarity about the core features constituting complex trauma and its limited sequalae.	synthetic_low

Further therapeutic conversations shared multiple memories of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Only the brief time elapsed since the minor trauma-not the division into type of trauma groups-was significantly correlated with severity.	synthetic_low
Civilian trauma survivors with mild ASD ( = 17) and without ASD ( = 15) and non-traumatized controls ( = 14) completed a calm hyperventilation provocation test and were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, the Physical Reactions Scale, and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
