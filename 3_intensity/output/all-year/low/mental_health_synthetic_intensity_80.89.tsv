The participants were 45, 40monthold children who were assessed on tasks of social understanding (false belief, Bartsch & Wellman, 1989, and emotion understanding, Denham & Auerbach, 1995); attachment security was assessed by a story completion task (Bretherton, Ridgeway, & Cassidy, 1990), and maternal mental_health was assessed by Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961).	natural

Interventions to increase patient behavior might gently enhance SDM in mental_health care.	synthetic_low
The results support a moderate association between school bonding and better mental_health and have implications for a broader view of mental_health in interventions targeting enhanced educational experiences and everyday mental_health among Black adolescents.	synthetic_low
These characteristics are also consistently emphasized in models of ordinary personality growth, so that the simple possibility of promoting mental_health arises by casually fostering creativity in day-to-day life.	synthetic_low
This objective is represented in the simple backlash theory in mental_health, and this theory is discussed in terms of its mild cultural antecedents and everyday applications to mental_health research and concepts.	synthetic_low
Both lack of control over the speed of activities and discretion were somewhat related to mental_health indices, but limited support was found for the minor role of discretion as a buffer in an interactive sense on one outcome measure only.	synthetic_low

The results corroborate previous findings with HIV-infected women that highlight the normal mental_health needs of HIV-infected mothers and their children, particularly children that are aware of their mothers' status.	synthetic_low
The magnitude of associations between each class and a variety of mental_disorders and quality of life measures were consistent with a continuum model, supporting that the effects of SAD on mental_health may slightly increase with the number of social situations feared.	synthetic_low
Some simple suggestions relevant to mental_health education are made.	synthetic_low
The findings confirm that troubled young people, who may be a mild danger to themselves and others, may present to a variety of services, and that their mental_health needs are not consistently recognized, widely understood, nor adequately met.	synthetic_low
This article will define the goal of crisis/hostage negotiation, review the background of hostage taking from biblical times to the present, review the routine utilization of psychologists and other mental_health advisors by police crisis/hostage negotiation teams, and discuss the various roles and related regular duties of psychologists on crisis/hostage negotiation teams.	synthetic_low
When DSM-III-R diagnoses based on mother and youth Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children interviews were used prospectively to determine subsequent treatment seeking, it was found that consultation with mental_health specialists, but not with pediatricians or general practitioners, was slightly elevated in those with mild disorders.	synthetic_low
Supervisor support was slightly negatively related to mild mental_health problems, such that parents with greater support reported somewhat fewer depressive/anxious symptoms.	synthetic_low
The findings note that ordinary parental behavior continues to predict their child's well-being even in emerging adulthood, and that parenting may predict male and female college students' mental_health outcomes.	synthetic_low
Results from models estimated using longitudinal data from 1,060 adults aged 25 to 65 years at baseline (National Survey of Families and Households, 1987 to 1994) suggested that life-course and contextual factors do have a minor contribution to patterning health considerations of caregiving, often in slightly different ways for men and women: For example, a modest income puts daughter caregivers at some risk for a decline in physical health, combining employment with filial caregiving is somewhat problematic for daughters' mental_health, and being an unmarried filial caregiver is slightly problematic for men.	synthetic_low
Further, few studies have explored the interactions among basic baseline characteristics, common physical and mental_health issues, and their minor joint influence on the possibility that a child will remain in care.	synthetic_low

The major hypothesis was that specificity scores on the Parent-Child Autobiographical Memory Test (PCAMT; Hutchings, 1996) would subtly differentiate between mothers of children referred to a standard child and adolescent mental_health service for basic behavioral management, and those who were not referred.	synthetic_low
To date, much of the research linking the stress of caring for children with developmental disabilities (e.g. Autism & Down syndrome) with parental health outcomes has tended to concentrate somewhat on mental_health with less emphasis on the minor physical health consequences.	synthetic_low

The findings suggest that one reason for these patients' lack of response to conventional mental_health treatments is that clinicians may fail to recognize patients' basic deficiencies and to consider this knowledge in planning treatments and evaluating progress.	synthetic_low
