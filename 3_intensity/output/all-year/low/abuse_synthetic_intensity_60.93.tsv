PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine public perception of factors relevant in sentencing decision making for juvenile school shooters with a history of familial abuse, peer victimization, and school intervention.	natural
Studies have linked the experience of child abuse or adversity to mental_health problems in adulthood, and researchers have long documented ethnic/race disproportionality in foster care.	natural
Internal consistency reliability was high for the Abuse scale (.91), two factor scales (Distress = .93 and Rigidity = .86) and one Validity scale (Inconsistency = .80).	natural
Negative themes such as crimes perpetrated by people with possible PTSD (18.0) and substance abuse (11.5) were prominent, substance abuse being more prevalent in articles focused on military populations (16.4 vs. 6.3, p = <.001).	natural
Records of 38 hospitalized female adolescents were analyzed to evaluate the relationship between a history of earlier physical and/or sexual abuse and borderline personality.	natural
It was hypothesized that cases where parental substance abuse was the primary reason for placement, a child would remain in care longer and recidivate with greater frequency.	natural
The findings indicate that perceived stress relating to finances, accommodation and relationships in the immediate postpartum period are associated with heightened child physical abuse potential at 7 months.	natural
The results suggest that children with documented sexual abuse victimization demonstrate a significant number of dissociative phenomena that not only are subjectively experienced but also can be observed by a non-family member.	natural
In addition, IPV is not uncommon among couples, and risk for partner violence may include depression, drug abuse, and relationship dissatisfaction, among others.	natural
Several researchers have developed typologies that describe couple-level patterns of Intimate Partner Violence and Abuse (IPV/A) behaviors; one research team suggested their typology could apply specifically to such divorcing people (Kelly & Johnson, 2008).	natural
Higher DES scores were associated with more negative overall home environment ratings and with histories of sexual abuse.	natural
More specifically, focus is given to those mechanisms that might differentiate CSA survivors who break the cycle of abuse from those who perpetuate it.	natural
This study examined an ecological model of maternal substance abuse and child neglect.	natural
This article identifies the general effects sexual abuse has on adult fantasy and how fantasy develops following the sexual abuse.	natural
Why is that some relationships, initially harmonious, tip into violence and abuse?	natural
The relations of attachment disorganization/disorientation to endogenous (e.g., maternal medical history, infant temperament) and environmental (e.g., maternal caregiving quality, infant history of abuse) antecedents and to behavioral consequences from 24 months to 19 years are examined.	natural
When public understanding of the nature and extent of child abuse is larger than five years ago, it would be good to be able to assume that teachers were more enlightened.	natural
The three groups were compared on sexual history and preference, substance abuse, mental_illness and personality, history of crime and violence, neuropsychological impairment, and endocrine abnormalities, using reliable and valid measures.	natural
Data included 161 reports of child sexual abuse.	natural
Suggestions for future study include examination of comparison samples of female veterans with and without PTSD and substance abuse across a variety of dimensions, including psychiatric symptoms, substance use, treatment utilization, and impact of treatment.	natural
A conditional process model using bootstrapping to estimate indirect effects showed a significant indirect effect of insecure attachment on the relationship between exposure to community violence and mild posttraumatic stress symptoms for adolescents with a history of mild childhood physical abuse, but not for adolescents without this history.	synthetic_low
Selfreported health (and the extent to which this was associated with minor partner abuse or psychosocial variables) was investigated in 132 women recruited from a domestic violence service.	synthetic_low
Implications for clinical practice, service delivery and service development relate to the different ways of supporting women in talking about mild abuse and also the need to recognise trauma in parents.	synthetic_low
Although researchers are not specifically identified as mandated reporters (although in certain states all members of the general population are mandated reporters), they nonetheless have a duty to report any reasonable suspicion of mild child abuse or neglect when this suspicion derives from their research study.	synthetic_low
An additional minor sexual abuse variable based on the four screening questions developed by Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis, and Smith (1990) was also included.	synthetic_low
The minor implications of the typology for both substance abuse prevention and treatment are briefly discussed.	synthetic_low
The study showed that the mothers have somewhat inadequate or limited information and approaches about preventing sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Personality differences of 71 residents in a therapeutic community drug abuse program were casually examined with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI).	synthetic_low
These findings provide some evidence for a dose-response effect of treatment in syringe exchangers and suggest that substance abuse treatment moderately expands the harm reduction benefits of SEP participation.	synthetic_low
However, the relationship between alcohol use and mild abuse and performance is unclear because students had high performance scores at both universities along with high alcohol-use scores.	synthetic_low
Across these studies, low frustration tolerance was associated with increased potential for mild physical child abuse, greater use of gentle parent-child aggression in discipline encounters, lightly dysfunctional disciplinary style, limited support for physical discipline use and physical discipline escalation, and slightly increased heart rate.	synthetic_low
Possible psychological and neurobiological pathways from minimal abuse to symptoms are discussed, along with research and clinical implications.	synthetic_low
Results indicate mild abuse and drug use are predictive of home sex offenses while alcohol use is indicative of community offending.	synthetic_low
The treatment programs yielded outcome results similar to those reported for mild alcohol and drug abuse treatment programs.	synthetic_low
Other previously recognized risk factors were not shown to have a statistically significant association with minor child abuse.	synthetic_low
Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a form of minor child abuse in which a disorder of the child is fictitiously presented by a parent.	synthetic_low
These results show a high percentage of South African males being subjected to UESE which is somewhat higher than the child sexual abuse (CSA) rates reported by the few South African studies of male university students.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that sexually exploited girls were more likely to report experiences of minor child sexual abuse, substance misuse/addiction, occasional dating violence, and gang affiliation; they were also somewhat more likely to run away from the group home facility and be identified as having an unsuccessful discharge.	synthetic_low
Young children (ages 4 and school-aged children (6 to 10) from a day-care center were randomly assigned to a mild sexual abuse prevention training group and a wait-list control group.	synthetic_low
A survey of an inner-city population of working-class and single mothers is described and the prevalence of anxiety and depression reported using two related diagnostic schemes, Bedford College caseness and DSM-III-R. This acts as an introduction to an analysis which indicates that moderate experiences in childhood and adolescence (involving parental indifference, and sexual and physical abuse) considerably raise risk of both depression and anxiety conditions (with the exception of mild agoraphobia and simple phobia) in adult life.	synthetic_low
The debate has been polarized by those who maintain the impossibility of such strong repression versus those who maintain that repressed memories of mild abuse underlie a wide variety of psychiatric dysfunctions.	synthetic_low
It appears that while minor polydrug abuse, slight psychological problems, and minor stressful life events are strong indicators of poor parenting ability, the successfully methadone maintained woman who does not feel the need to supplement her methadone with other drugs, whose life has stabilized, and who is relatively normal in her affect and mood, has a strong potential for good childrearing ability.	synthetic_low
Results confirmed the mediating role of self-control in the relations of pathological narcissism and BAS, but not BIS to occasional substance abuse.	synthetic_low
A small but growing number of studies suggest, however, that the majority of less serious child sexual abuse cases are not identified by mental_health services.	synthetic_low
Developmental differences in behavior and self-perception were examined in a group of 44 preschool and school-age children referred for evaluation of mild sexual abuse and 41 comparison children with no history of sexual abuse, matched on age and gender, and from a similar socioeconomic background.	synthetic_low
Although there is extensive theoretical and empirical evidence linking men's alcohol abuse and mild marital violence, no previous studies have assessed the substance use characteristics of women arrested for domestic violence.	synthetic_low
Hundreds of thousands of individuals each year are accused falsely of minor child abuse (Besharov, 1984; Eberle and Eberle, 1986; Pride, 1986; Renshaw, 1986).	synthetic_low
This study examined the impact of sharing one's story of childhood sexual abuse and its relationship with the survivor's self-capacities and history of minor child maltreatment.	synthetic_low
Largely consistent with the prior study, mild gender abuse was longitudinally associated with unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) with casual and commercial sex partners, and the presumed biological outcome of this behavioral risk, isolated cases of HIV/STI.	synthetic_low
Effects of childhood neglect on dissociation were slightly stronger than of mild abuse.	synthetic_low
