Mood-induction patterns for anxiety and depression also differed, with each producing an affect-specific contagion of mood and a general elevation in other negative states.	natural
The results revealed that significant amounts of the variance in participants' withdrawal, somatization, anxiety and depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior could be attributed to their exposure to both abuse and violence in childhood as well as adolescence, over and above the variance in each of these psychological states attributable to sociodemographic characteristics, parents' psychological adjustment problems, and family exposure to political stressors.	natural
Implications for the treatment of social anxiety are discussed.	natural
Using different instantiations of rituals and measures of anxiety (both physiological and self-report), we find that enacting rituals improves performance in public and private performance domains by decreasing anxiety.	natural

All three scales of the self-report version of the Ketterer Stress Symptom Frequency Checklist--Revised (KSSFCR)--AIAI (or aggravation, irritation, anger, and impatience), Depression, and Anxiety--were associated with both a positive FamHx and early AAID.	natural
Insecure attachment itself may contribute to anxiety, but insecurely attached children also are more likely to have difficulties regulating emotions and interacting competently with peers, which may further contribute to anxiety.	natural
Assessment instruments were Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, both the observer-rated (P&Ao) and self-rating (P& Asr); Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI); Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Findings showed that dyadic adjustment mediates the negative influence on parenting self-efficacy of both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.	natural
These results suggest that fluoxetine may be an effective and safe treatment for nondepressed children and adolescents with anxiety disorders other than OCD and panic disorder.	natural
In an 8-wave, 4-year longitudinal study, 787 children (Grades 3-6) completed the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (C. R. Reynolds & B. O. Richmond, 1985), a measure of the Physiological Reactivity, Worry-Oversensitivity, and Social Alienation dimensions of anxiety.	natural
The significantly higher percentages of EOP with a tendency towards pathologic anxiety and depression indicate that obesity is a clinical condition that predisposes to the development of clinically relevant affective disorders.	natural
There is a substantial literature relating the personality trait anxiety sensitivity (AS; tendency to fear anxiety-related sensations) and its lower order dimensions to the mood and anxiety (i.e., internalizing) disorders.	natural
Results are related to models of anxiety transmission.	natural
Practitioners of psychotherapy, pastoral care and counseling, mental_health counseling, and spiritual direction, who work in an age characterized by great anxiety and uncertainty about the present and the future, are obligated to find compelling narratives of hope and consolation.	natural
Identification of conflict areas appears to reduce anxiety and facilitate decision-making.	natural
Considering the importance of active dopaminergic neurotransmission, PD can serve as a prolific model for studying the neurobiological correlates of normal human emotional behavior as well as psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and apathy.	natural
Subjects who had experienced trauma reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology than nontraumatized subjects, and these symptoms were more intense in subjects who experienced multiple traumas.	natural
Results reveal an indirect effect suggesting that the effects of anxiety sensitivity on alcohol dependence are mediated by symptoms of depression.	natural
Using structural equation modeling, emotional sensitivity was indicated by depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and rejection sensitivity.	natural
Bowlby's hypothesis is supported by multiple additional lines of evidence regarding both mild triggers of separation anxiety preceding the phobia (e.g., a routine funeral, simple sibling rivalry, moving, getting his own bedroom) and background factors influencing his working model of attachment (mother's mild psychopathology, marital disagreements, family history) that would make him somewhat vulnerable to such anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with our prediction, PD subjects recalled more mild anxiety than nonanxiety words, whereas NC subjects recalled more nonanxiety than anxiety words.	synthetic_intensity
Although BI fears are a significant component of mild dental anxiety, their overall contribution is relatively minimal.	synthetic_intensity
The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) is a commonly used measure of the mild worry characteristic of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_intensity
ABM methods which encourage active goal-focused attention-search for positive/nonthreat information and flexible cognitive control across multiple processes (particularly inhibitory control, which supports a positive goal-engagement mode over processing of minor threat cues) may prove more effective in reducing mild anxiety than ABM-threat-avoidance training which targets a specific bias in spatial orienting to threat.	synthetic_intensity
Despite evidence documenting relationships between eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, mild depression, and anxiety, little is known regarding how social anxiety is related to ED symptoms in treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the present study was to assess which types of experiences are most closely associated with mild forms of dental anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, the study investigated the mild relations between Schwartz' (1992) ten value types and four different clinical variables anxiety, depression, stress, and schizotypy with its subdimensions, unusual experience, cognitive disorganization, introverted anhedonia, and impulsive nonconformity.	synthetic_intensity
In a previous randomized controlled trial, MBNT was found to slightly lessen mild anxiety and depression, improve modest functional dimensions of quality of life, and gently enhance treatment adherence.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that in-office exposure is not necessary for minimal improvement and that a primary focus on cognitions associated with mild generalized anxiety may be an effective intervention.	synthetic_intensity
This study cross-culturally evaluated Watson's (2005) simple structure of mild mood and anxiety disorders, using mainly dichotomous criteria, and explored the placement of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in this model.	synthetic_intensity
Selfregulation, mild trait depression, and low social anxiety were investigated in a group of 174 (124 female, 50 male) undergraduate university students.	synthetic_intensity
However, breath-holding duration emerged as a notable moderator of the association between anxiety sensitivity and PTSD Avoidance symptom severity, such that lower breath-holding duration slightly exacerbated the effect of moderate anxiety sensitivity with regard to PTSD Avoidance symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
Subjective verbal reports were coded discreetly for subtle evidence of perceptual distortions presumably indicative of mild denial of separation anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results may reflect a tendency of more poorly adjusted individuals to avoid volunteering for research which they perceive may cause them to experience some stress and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
240 first year Teachers' College students were allocated to one of three groups, moderate anxiety (HA), low anxiety (MA), very low anxiety (LA), on the basis of their scores on the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS).	synthetic_intensity
Many of the most problematic behaviours characteristic of severely disturbed, aggressive, conduct-disordered children can be understood in terms of developmental arrests and mild distortions which have occurred on a crucial, early developmental line related to the mastery of mild separation anxiety and the integration of autonomy.	synthetic_intensity
