Because low efficacy expectations may lead to self-harmful behaviors, such as poor personal relationships or substance abuse, health educators should consider ways to enhance adolescent appraisals of their capabilities.	natural
Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that stressful life events are associated with the perpetration of intimate partner violence among adults, but little attention has been given to the relationship between stressful life events and adolescent dating abuse, a prevalent form of violence that results in serious and long-lasting consequences.	natural
There was no depression by alcohol abuse interaction.	natural
Ninety-seven female participants were assigned to four groups: post-traumatic stress disorder following child sexual abuse with co-occurring borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder following child sexual abuse without co-occurring borderline personality disorder, borderline personality disorder without post-traumatic stress disorder, and healthy controls.	natural

Past research in this area has relied on self-report methods to discover links between affective responsiveness and caregiver abuse.	natural
In focusing our attention simultaneously on prenatal exposure, parental substance abuse and comorbid psychopathology, child temperament, and contextual factors, these studies offer a better understanding of the complex interrelated influences of risk factors on the child's cognitive and socioemotional development.	natural
Moreover, the age of maltreated patients was significantly lower than nonmaltreated patients, perhaps indicating an earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse.	natural
To explore the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and hope, a convenience sample of caregivers bringing in children for medical investigation of child abuse at a regional child advocacy center were surveyed for adverse childhood experiences and dispositional hope.	natural

The present review discusses recent findings that suggest that maladaptive recruitment of PVT Orx/Hcrt signaling by drugs of abuse may promote persistent compulsive drug-seeking behavior following a period of protracted abstinence and as such may represent a relevant target for understanding the long-term vulnerability to drug relapse after withdrawal.	natural
The rates of substance use and abuse are higher among psychotic patients and antisocial individuals than in the general population.	natural
The relative predictive significance of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and aggressive behavior for consequent substance abuse was examined in 114 juvenile offenders.	natural

Further training for both medical and non-medical professionals is needed to ensure appropriate care of minor child sexual abuse victims and to improve communication and coordination of efforts between professions.	synthetic_low
