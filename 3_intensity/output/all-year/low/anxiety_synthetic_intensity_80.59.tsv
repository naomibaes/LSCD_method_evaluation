Consistent homotypic continuities in symptoms characterized all disorders; strongest for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (r = .32.62), moderate for behavioral disorders (r = .31.48) and for mild anxiety and depression (r = .15.40), and stronger between 8 and 10 than between 4 and 6 years.	synthetic_low
The concept of balance-of-power vulnerability is proposed as a heuristic tool to understand the mild states of anxiety which occur when America's national integrity or security is slightly threatened.	synthetic_low
Further, it established a control condition where it generated mild anxiety in the participants using IAPS images with moderate negative valence and moderate arousal, which were described by phone to a loved one.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that the data fit the model well, supporting the mediating roles of internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity in the associations between experiences of mild discrimination and symptoms of depression and social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Fear of mild negative evaluation, a core feature of social anxiety disorder, has been prospectively related to eating pathology over and above other established risk factors, suggesting that it may be a contributing cognitive risk factor for eating disorders.	synthetic_low

Based on our results, mild antenatal anxiety measured by a subscale of EPDS has predicted slightly better PPD than the antenatal depressive subscale.	synthetic_low
Mild social anxiety may slightly increase the barriers to social engagement and thus serve as a potential risk factor for increased social deficits in youth with ASD.	synthetic_low
A secondary purpose was to determine whether physical self-efficacy and mild trait anxiety subtly mediate the relationship between exercise and optimism.	synthetic_low
Patients' scores on the Millon decreased on 12 of the 20 scales and increased on 8, and their Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-related symptoms of mild anxiety and dysthymia decreased significantly.	synthetic_low
Patients with fatigue reported slightly higher scores, indicating moderate severity, on measures of depression, pain, sleep difficulty, and mild anxiety (all p < 0.05).	synthetic_low

Two different diagnostic algorithms were compared targeting three selected diagnoses: mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and social phobia (SP).	synthetic_low
Our knowledge of these causal variables enables us to identify children at some risk for the development of mild anxiety problems and highlights variables that should be considered for change in prevention programs.	synthetic_low
We review the current understanding about mild anxiety comorbidity in schizophrenia, and its relative prevalence, relevance, and treatment.	synthetic_low
In contrast, spiritual support tends to slightly exacerbate the relationship between stress and mild anxiety among study participants with somewhat low extraversion scores (i.e., introverts).	synthetic_low

Identifying neural biomarkers that can predict the onset of mild anxiety in childhood may gently increase our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of anxiety, as well as inform intervention and prevention strategies.	synthetic_low
Conversely, among the tested group a modest positive correlation was found between CNV values (whenever the painful stimulus was administered before S1 as well as before S2) and the highest scores in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory X 2 test.	synthetic_low
