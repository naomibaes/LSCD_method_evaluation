The paper argues that trance is learnable; that there are specific periods in American history in which trance is encouraged in religious experience and that we are now in one such period; that in such periods, trance becomes incorporated into a complex behavioral practice in religious settings in which the boundary between the perceptually real and unreal may be blurred; and that the prevalence of this practice in religious settings may influence the symptom expression of those who struggle with the aftermath of trauma.	natural
Myriad problems are faced by the psychosomatically blind Cambodian refugee, including war-based trauma, improper diagnosis resulting in denial of claims of disability, and feelings of severe depression and isolation.	natural
Patient groups relived their trauma or panic attacks equally frequently, and reported comparable bodily reactions and distress associated with trauma or panic attack memories.	natural
A history of childhood trauma was correlated with adult depression in male alcoholics: a hostile personality dimension might be a mediating variable.	natural
We reviewed research on the relationship between (a) exposure to psychological trauma and (b) nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality (suicidal ideation [SI] and suicide attempts [SA]) in individuals with dissociative disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

Childhood trauma is known to increase risk for emotional disorders and addiction.	natural
In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) there is a need for self-rating scales that are sensitive to treatment effects and have been tested in a broad range of trauma survivors.	natural
Trauma exposure was related to more severe interpersonal chronic stressors.	natural
Etiological models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest that early childhood trauma contributes to the development of this disorder.	natural
Furthermore, traumaexposed participants with no PTS symptoms exhibited larger N1 amplitudes compared to participants with no trauma history.	natural
Findings support the use of EMDR therapy for treatment of adults with PTSD in a cross-cultural, postwar/conflict setting, and suggest that structured trauma treatments can be applied in Timor Leste.	natural
Our data support the inclusion of an ASD diagnosis in the DSM, which would allow the diagnosis of symptoms in the first month posttrauma as a psychiatric disorder but questions whether dissociation is more characteristic of the acute trauma period than the PTSD symptom clusters.	natural
Using the trauma film paradigm, which provides a prospective experimental tool for investigating analog intrusion development, the present study examines the extent to which intrusions mediate the association between AS and the development of posttraumatic stress reactions.	natural
Twenty-four patients (21 women, 3 men) with PTSD due to mixed trauma were randomly assigned to the PE group (PE with or without treatment as usual [TAU]) or the control group (TAU) only.	natural
Results from principal components analysis applied at the intraindividual level of inquiry indicate a prototypic interpersonal relationship pattern that is repetitive, thematically relates to an early trauma, and in which roles of self and others are interchanged.	natural
Early trauma and dissociative reactions have systematic effects on arousal, desire and pair-bonding, which are reviewed in this paper.	natural
Phase 3 focuses on specific trauma appraisals and here-and-now cognitions that maintain PTSD and relationship problems.	natural
Trauma severity, indicated by duration of coma, is associated with most of the visual disorders and appears to be the main risk factor conducive to their appearance.	natural
The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of vicarious trauma and provide a guide for focussing on future research.	natural
This study used an analogue design to test the hypothesis that preferential processing of visual trauma reminders in the aftermath of a stressful or traumatic event gives rise to subsequent intrusive memories.	natural
Trauma history was assessed by a semistructured interview and other adverse life events by questionnaire.	natural
However, trauma research on this population has focused primarily on maltreatment rather than the full spectrum of trauma experiences identified within the DSM-IV.	natural
How these couples approached relationship qualities of mutuality, balanced locus of control and weakness tolerance across six axes of caregiving, disability, responsibility, trauma, communication, and community impacted the couple's capacity to communicate and resolve conflict.	natural
Findings from investigations of the PTSD symptom structure in other trauma populations have been inconsistent and have not been concordant with the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal symptom clusters specified in DSM-IV.	natural
Hence, the objective of this study was to verify the relationship between childhood trauma and current suicide risk (suicidal behavior and ideation) in individuals aged 14-35 years, in the city of Pelotas, Brazil.	natural
The term peritraumatic emotional hotspot is used to describe moments of peak distress during trauma.	natural
Discourse was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview, using coherence (a marker of attachment security), unresolved trauma/loss (a marker of disorganized cognitions related to trauma or loss), and idealization (minimizing stressful experiences and their impact) scores.	natural
As a result of the absence of a human perpetrator and collectivity of experience, this trauma tends to be highly internalized.	natural
The aspects of mild anxiety, minor trauma, object relations, transference, and infant development are touched upon and brief quantitative and metapsychological considerations are adduced.	synthetic_intensity
The goal here is to persuade practitioners whose work includes a focus on mild childhood trauma to be cautious in their use of memory recovery techniques, without undermining support for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Second, an effort is made to see if current emotional support helps reduce the minor deleterious effects of trauma on meaning, and whether current levels of negative inter-personal contacts slightly exacerbate the effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_intensity
Contralateral haematoma secondary to surgical decompression in minor head trauma can lead to a manageable outcome.	synthetic_intensity
The models were then replicated in the clinical sample, with two slightly different observations: childhood mild sexual trauma replaced childhood emotional trauma as the best enduring predictor in the clinical model.	synthetic_intensity
However, the relationship between minor childhood trauma and mild obsessive-compulsive symptoms has not been well studied.	synthetic_intensity
Lastly, the impact of Freud's insights on mild trauma on historical, literary and cinematic discourse is explored through discussing a few examples in detail.	synthetic_intensity
The current pilot study examined the moderate acceptability, reasonable feasibility, and modest efficacy of a brief web-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for the treatment of mild trauma-related psychological difficulties in interpersonal trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The internal impacts of minor parental dysfunction, mild sexual trauma and geographical dislocation are examined through the lenses of attachment theory and neuroscience to illustrate how her dissociative disorder was forged in the crucible of a series of mildly unfortunate circumstances and events.	synthetic_intensity
Upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders became a minor occupational concern among sign language interpreters at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the 1988-89 academic year.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, we examined the association of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) classification of somewhat unresolved loss or trauma and mild PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
We retrospectively investigated long-term, multi-dimensional quality-of-life outcomes in 68 male patients who suffered pure head injuries and 63 male head-injured patients with associated minor multiple trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the limited influence of a mass trauma (the Virginia Tech campus shootings) on mild anxiety symptoms and slight changes in quality of life, as well as the minor vulnerability/protective roles of adjusted world assumptions and adequate social support.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-eight mothers reported whether their 1-year-old infants experienced mild trauma symptoms as a result of observing episodes of IPV during their first year of life.	synthetic_intensity
When Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) is suspected, the presence of minor extracranial lesions can be a contributing factor in confirming the diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed a significant effect of multiple minor interpersonal trauma experiences on severity of behavioral problems above and beyond all aforementioned variables (internalizing =.12, p = .019, externalizing = .11, p = .036, total = .14, p =.008).	synthetic_intensity

Based on an attachment perspective, minor interpersonal trauma exposure may slightly activate one's attachment insecurity system and subtly disrupt affect, behaviour and interpersonal function, which may in turn create some difficulties to cope with interpersonal traumas and exacerbate PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Higher levels of cannabis or mild childhood trauma may somewhat compromise connectivity over the course of the illness in patients, but not in individuals at low or higher than average genetic risk for psychotic disorder, suggesting subtle interactions between the environment and illness-related factors.	synthetic_intensity
