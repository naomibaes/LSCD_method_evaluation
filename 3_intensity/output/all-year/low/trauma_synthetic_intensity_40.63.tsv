This research examined the nature of children's trauma narrative themes and the relationship between these themes and concurrent and future trauma symptoms.	natural
The negative association between positive goal beliefs and indirect trauma may be related to the gap the individual perceives between the hoped-for ideals and the trauma-stricken reality.	natural
Childhood trauma scores were correlated with dissociation scale scores and dissociative symptom clusters, but not with core symptoms of the schizophrenic disorder.	natural
In contrast to civilian trauma, it can be more challenging to build a robust in vivo hierarchy for a combat-related index trauma.	natural
Serious trauma showed no significant association with LSA in those who did not have feelings of worthlessness.	natural
In previous publications, we criticized many of these perspectives and proposed a detailed psychobiological theory of dissociation in trauma.	natural
However, some trauma victims do not report significant symptoms until a period of time has elapsed after the event.	natural
Trauma narratives were collected at 2-3 weeks, while outcome measures (e.g. IES-15, PTSS-10, and GHQ-30) were collected at 2-3 weeks, and 4 months after the accidents.	natural
As in previous studies, no relationship between the overall degree of terror-related exposure and trauma symptoms was found for either group.	natural
More research is needed on the roles of client feedback, managing countertransference, and other therapist characteristics on treatment outcome with trauma survivors.	natural
Complex developmental trauma impacts on neurobiological development through the creation of a frightening and unpredictable environment in which the brain develops.	natural
They may convey aspects of psychological or emotional trauma associated with aphasia.	natural
In addition, secure people used relatively more support-seeking strategies in coping with the trauma, ambivalent people used more emotion-focused strategies, and avoidant people used more distancing strategies.	natural
Variables pertaining to female gender, living with a single parent, direct and indirect exposure to traumatic events, number of traumatic events, and the temporal proximity of trauma events, predicted higher PTSD levels.	natural
Drawing on research with children and adults who are refugees, as well as research into posttraumatic stress disorder and into the educational effects of trauma, the paper advocates interactionist and ecosystemic perspectives for understanding the difficulties encountered by refugee children, and considers possibilities for therapeutic intervention.	natural
In this study, the factor structure of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire short form (CTQ-SF) in a group of 123 female sex workers in the Netherlands was examined.	natural
Ninety-four participants suffering from chronic PTSD were assessed for suicidal ideation, plans and attempts since the index trauma as part of a comprehensive assessment.	natural
Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that lower resiliency and greater HIV-related stress were related to negative feelings about addressing trauma, whereas greater resiliency and higher perceived impact of sexual trauma were associated with positive feelings about addressing trauma.	natural
The roles of coping, posttraumatic growth, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity from past trauma were analyzed.	natural
This study investigated whether betrayal trauma (BT; abuse by a person close to the victim) and specific parenting attitudes and behaviors among mothers with child abuse histories predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms in their children.	natural
To understand and treat patients suffering from psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental_disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivate, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and newly emerging trauma research.	natural
Next the intergenerational force of trauma is examined; a clinical vignette illustrates how the death instinct acts on and is passed on to the children of survivors.	natural
114 psychotic disorder patients and 81 healthy control subjects were administered the Structured Clinical Interview of the DSM-IV (SCID) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
Both groups reported a high prevalence of traumatic life events although significantly more PVH reported trauma symptoms sufficient for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
This paper discusses the influence of Jean-Martin Charcot's views on Sigmund Freud's early theory of hysteria and the notion of psychical trauma.	natural
Trauma and stressor-related disorders are psychiatric conditions that are caused specifically by the experience of stress, though depression, anxiety and some other disorders may also be unleashed by stress.	natural
Approximately 47 of the variance in trauma symptoms was predicted by the model.	natural
These four criteria appear to remain clustered together in childhood trauma victims even when other diagnosis would appear more appropriate.	natural
The results are discussed in the context of the trauma research and in comparison to related disciplines.	natural
We discuss the clinical implications, including the importance of educating those who experienced TI during their trauma about the involuntary nature of this experience.	natural
Major ST techniques for trauma processing, slight emotional avoidance, and mild dysregulation are limited reparenting, empathic confrontation, and experiential techniques like chair dialogs and simple imagery rescripting.	synthetic_low
The attachment capacities of trauma survivors were hypothesized to be somewhat related to their recovery from mildly traumatic event(s).	synthetic_low
This article presents the Trauma Outcome Process, a basic treatment model for guiding clinical practice with children with minor sexually abusive behavior problems.	synthetic_low
Theoretical explanations for such associations are discussed, especially with reference to the theories for the mild systemic effects of trauma, and suggestions for further research are proposed.	synthetic_low
The participants were recruited as part of a larger study assessing a group intervention for individuals with HIV and mild symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_low
However, mild childhood trauma does not seem to be associated with a differential course of symptoms, nor does it uniquely heighten the chance of developing (subthreshold) psychotic symptomatology.	synthetic_low
The percentage of primary care patients with bipolar disorder was measured in 4 studies of patients with depression, 1 study of patients with mild trauma exposure, 1 study of patients with any common psychiatric complaint, and 1 study of patients with generally unexplained symptoms.	synthetic_low
Patients with PTSD described a moderate variety of emotions such as anger, slight humiliation, and minor guilt present at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Previous research with mild trauma victims has demonstrated mild dissociative symptoms to be associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and shorter symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by mild dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_low
Five randomized controlled trials have shown that child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) gently alleviates mild trauma symptoms in children.	synthetic_low
Results should be replicated with other mild trauma populations because the number and complexity of traumatic events may slightly impact the assessed symptoms.	synthetic_low
A total of 328 women, up to 72 hours postpartum, completed the peritraumatic dissociative experience questionnaire (PDEQ), the socio-demographic and obstetrical questionnaire, the mild pain numeric rating scale, the Trauma History Questionnaire and an SCID-I for distressing traumatic events.	synthetic_low
Increases in mild trauma exposure were more pronounced in women (33.7) than men (21.5), as well as in the younger stratum of study participants (15-24 years old; 36.1).	synthetic_low
Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and minor early trauma were associated with increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display elevated stress-reactivity.	synthetic_low
The nature of the relationships between substance use, mild trauma, and aggression is inconclusive.	synthetic_low
To assess the intervention's effectiveness, veterans with histories of mild trauma who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to a BSS group (n = 26) or a wait-list control group (n = 28).	synthetic_low
Researchers also are encouraged to employ standardized definitions of mild trauma and to investigate new areas, such as treatment outcomes and mediators of trauma and health.	synthetic_low
To understand and treat patients suffering from psychoses (especially schizophrenia) and from other primitive mental disorders, it has become increasingly important to integrate the soft science of psychoanalysis, including its derivate, psychotherapy, with the hard science findings of neurobiology, infant development research, and emerging mild trauma research.	synthetic_low
No meaningful differences were detected in comparisons between ADHD and control children, either in the low rate of minor trauma exposure or in the mild development of PTSD.	synthetic_low
Potential mechanisms and clinical vignettes are included to describe the mild and manageable systemic processes that occur with trauma couples.	synthetic_low
