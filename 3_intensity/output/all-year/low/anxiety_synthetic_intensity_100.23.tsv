The CFS group showed significantly greater impairment on measures of immediate and delayed memory, attention and visuo-constructional ability, and reported somewhat higher levels of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 mild anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a valid proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	synthetic_low
Gray's theory asserts that mild anxiety is associated with moderate sensitivity to signals of punishment and impulsivity with high sensitivity to signals of reward.	synthetic_low
Group participants had any of 5 mild anxiety disorders and described manageable related avoidance.	synthetic_low
However, there is little research exploring in more detail the possible relationship between RI expression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
A secondary purpose was to determine if reductions in the mild psychophysiological anxiety response would occur to controlled laboratory challenges as a result of any psychological changes derived from the mastery experience.	synthetic_low

Given that a slight attentional bias is a core feature of mild social anxiety, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of mortality salience (MS) on attentional bias in mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
A single-group open trial design involving 22 patients on dialysis and an established iCBT treatment for mild anxiety and depression was employed.	synthetic_low
Assessment of the characteristics of panic attacks (the minor prodromal phase immediately preceding the attack, mild peak anxiety, and the residual phase immediately afterwards) was done by an independent rater before treatment, after six sessions and at the end of therapy (12 sessions).	synthetic_low
Stressful life events in adolescents have been found to be longitudinally associated with slightly higher anxiety sensitivity (AS).	synthetic_low
Structural equation modeling was used to explore mild longitudinal relations between contextual (balanced maternal distress, manageable family adversities, and adequate social support) and temperamental (light shyness and moderated emotionality) risk factors in their moderate prediction of informant-consistent symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The minor sibship risk, due to child factors age, prior mild anxiety disorder, and prior childhood diagnosis, contributed significantly to the family prediction (P less than 0.001).	synthetic_low
Such setbacks will reinforce the negative expectations underpinning mild state social anxiety, making it slightly harder for more anxiously attached individuals to initiate and develop the satisfying relationships that might over time help them overcome their relational insecurity.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was detected in 8.14 of the sample, with an additional 29.1 classified as marginal cases needing further assessment to establish a psychiatric diagnosis.	synthetic_low
If anything, those mildly high in physical anxiety sensitivity tended to avoid positive material.	synthetic_low
Although social phobia is defined as mild anxiety in social situations, little is known about the limited range or prevalence of social situations that elicit anxiety in social phobic individuals.	synthetic_low
Consistent with Gray's biological model of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS), children with both CD and mild anxiety disorder had slightly higher levels of salivary cortisol than children with CD without comorbid anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
Also interesting was a minor curvilinear effect of mild anxiety at lower levels of belief in Study 1 and a noticeable main effect of light situational anxiety in Study 2. We discuss the valuable contribution that multilevel modeling can make to the growing literature on rumor transmission.	synthetic_low
The internal consistency (ICC) for pain patient and healthy participant samples yielded a good reliability for the total score, mild cognitive anxiety, slight fear of pain, and mild physiological anxiety.	synthetic_low
The mild Anxiety Factor had a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.81 for identifying GAD (PPV = 0.69, NPV = 0.84).	synthetic_low
The lack of significant correlations between the rigidity measure and the Taylor and the Holtzman Anxiety scales was considered in terms of general needs of further research into the relation of anxiety to perceptual flexibility.	synthetic_low
On 2 occasions, 69 patients with mild work-related stress and 62 relatively unaffected participants completed self-report instruments to measure mild alexithymia (20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale), moderate burnout complaints (Maslach Burnout Inventory) and gentle general distress complaints (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, Checklist Individual Strength).	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental_health problems in young children but there has been a dearth of studies focusing on Asian American children.	synthetic_low
The women's mild anxiety level was calmly ranked before and after delivery.	synthetic_low
Small but significant processing differences in simple addition and multiplication were found when subjects were divided by quartiles into mild anxiety groups.	synthetic_low
Anxiety is a somewhat prevalent problem with mild manifestations in young children, especially those with an intellectual disability.	synthetic_low
Findings from one crosslagged panel suggested that emotional exhaustion causes mild state anxiety.	synthetic_low
Mild depression can occur in patients with or without temporary trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Circulating catecholamines concentrations were carefully measured; all subjects were assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Anxiety, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_low
Data on individual differences in anxiety responses (i.e., low vs. slight anxiety) were obtained in both investigations and suggest that those with low levels of pre-treatment anxiety experience some disruption post-treatment.	synthetic_low
This paper reviews the relevant cognitive research on mild health anxiety and hypochondriasis, as well as research examining temperament/personality and social developmental factors relevant to health and illness cognition and associated less intense negative emotional states.	synthetic_low
The current paradigm represents an updated and helpful tool with which to study fear generalization--a central, yet understudied conditioning-correlate of mild pathologic anxiety.	synthetic_low
Diagnosis of and treatment for mild anxiety neurosis often leave both patient and physician somewhat dissatisfied.	synthetic_low
I conclude that (a) phobia theories cannot be excused from the requirement that they accurately predict phobic behavior; (b) the ethology and subtle phylogenetic history of anxiety have little relevance to helping phobic people in the here-and-now; (c) people are multidimensional, but it makes little sense to say that anxiety is multidimensional; (d) the exposure principle lacks substance and encourages gentle treatments for phobia; and (e) phobia is best understood and treated not as an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but as fundamentally a cognitive problem rooted in low perceptions of self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
The moderate stability of worry content was investigated in a sample of 27 individuals diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.	synthetic_low
A model of rumor transmission somewhat dependent upon mild anxiety was proposed.	synthetic_low
The Motor Activity Anxiety Test is proposed to assess personal attitude to meet typical motor requirements for physical education in schools and mild anxiety about the minor physical dangers linked to motor activities in particular.	synthetic_low
In order to test the specificity of the findings to depression, the results of the FD were further compared with those of a clinical but never depressed (ND) group (n = 39) diagnosed with mild anxiety and/or disruptive behaviour disorders.	synthetic_low
First, religious objects and their attributes provide an interpretative framework that generates, for the believer, an unassailable and thoroughly self-consistent experience of agentic hate and hostility and a concomitant sense of worth, power, and efficacy, which together keep mild anxiety unformulated and thus outside of awareness.	synthetic_low
Also, belief about ability and belief about computer training were mildly associated with slight computer anxiety for noncomputer users.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, they show a mild association of anxiety and pleasure unlike the control group for whom the correlation between the two emotions is negative.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the usefulness of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) as a means of screening for mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_low
The essential function of the primary objects, in helping to make the mild anxiety and mental discomfort associated with loss more bearable, is also discussed.	synthetic_low
The survey included measures of gender nonconformity, sexual orientation, trait mindfulness, self-compassion, depression, mild anxiety, and subjective well-being.	synthetic_low
Significant differences in baseline-corrected heart rate and self-reported anxiety as well as slightly rated facial anxiety all indicated that repressors exhibited a slight discrepancy between low self-reported anxiety and moderately high heart rate and facial anxiety; low-anxious subjects reported a mild level of anxiety, although they showed low heart rate and facial anxiety; high-anxious subjects had consistently moderate values on all three variables; and the defensive high-anxious group showed an intermediate level of anxious responding.	synthetic_low
The results show a linear relation between the magnitude of the discrepancy among representations of the self and moderate emotional intensity, together with a high specificity between type of discrepancy and type of emotional state: on one side, a correspondence between the actual/own:ideal/own discrepancy and mild depression and, on the other, between the ideal/own:social discrepancy and mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
Three mild emotional responses were evident when subjects were stressed: mild anxiety, low hostility, and slight depression; the former two emotions also contributed modestly to heart rate variability.	synthetic_low
Questionnaires measuring aspects of illness behaviour, depression and mild anxiety were administered before and after treatment, but did not reveal any significant differences between the treatment groups at any time.	synthetic_low
Spectral analysis of heart rate variability indicated that potential compensatory increases in spectral power in the high frequency band associated with dual-task putting in the low anxiety condition were absent in the mild anxiety tone-counting and shadowing putting conditions, partially reflecting the performance findings.	synthetic_low
