The circumstances under which empathy is altered in ASD remain unclear, as previous studies did not systematically find differences in brain activation between ASD and controls in empathy-eliciting paradigms, and did not always monitor whether differences were primarily due to ASD per se, or to conditions overlapping with ASD, such as alexithymia and anxiety.	natural
Single-factor multivariate analysis of variance indicated no significant differences between selected and nonselected players for any preperformance mood or anxiety measure.	natural

Studies that find broad associations between BI and anxiety proneness in general may be limited by the absence of information about parental psychopathology (an important potential confound associated with both BI and anxiety disorders in offspring).	natural

Using interview, self-report, and direct behavioral observation, behaviors of parents with an anxiety disorder were compared to those of parents without an anxiety disorder on a number of dimensions, but particularly with respect to whether anxious parents actively inhibited their children from engaging in normal age appropriate activities.	natural
Comparisons of the relative contributions made by depressive and anxiety symptoms to the prediction of functioning yielded some evidence for a specific relation between depressive symptoms and impairment.	natural
RF-EMFs after cranioplasty were significantly associated with the lower risk of depression and anxiety status among patients with TBI.	natural
Results suggested several revisions to prior research: (a) worry may be best modeled at the broadest structural level, rather than as an indicator of anxious-misery or fear; (b) social interaction anxiety may belong with anxious-misery, rather than fear; and (c) obsessive-compulsive disorder is generally associated with fear disorders, but hoarding is associated with both fear and anxious-misery.

In light of the link between social fear and dysfunction, individual differences in habituation may provide an important neurobiological marker for risk for psychiatric illness, such as social anxiety disorder.	natural
However, no data are available on participant goals for a task that generates social anxiety.	natural
No effects on state anxiety were observed.	natural
The present study investigated the association between level of education and self-reported levels of anxiety regarding death of self and others among undergraduate students (n = 149) and graduate students (n = 92).	natural

Quasiclinical levels of psychological distress were associated with low selfesteem and social anxiety.	natural
Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) measures were taken to assess performs' anxiety levels while they performed in front of heterogeneous and homogeneous audiences.	natural
As hypothesized, RR significantly reduced psychophysiological accomplements of panic, I IR reduced anxiety, and CM reduced cognitive distress.	natural
Previous studies have reported a higher incidence of depression and anxiety in psoriasis patients compared to the general population, which has important implications for assessment and treatment.	natural
Increased anxiety and effort possibly left few attention resources for movement self-consciousness under high anxiety.	natural
Implications for clinical practice include the utilization of LNS in individuals expressing high math anxiety.	natural
However, the significantly greater likelihood of observing anxiety among dissatisfied reflective than satisfied reflective subjects is indicative of the degree to which dissatisfaction is a source of anxiety beyond that attributable to reflection alone.	natural
Future research should study specific bipolar subgroups, focus on anxiety and panic symptoms rather than diagnosis, and look at the role of specific pharmacological treatment in patients with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders.	natural
Subjects were placed in nonoverlapping groups of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) only, disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) only, DBD plus an affective and/or anxiety disorder (DBD+Int), and controls with no diagnosis.	natural
Latent change score modelling revealed that T1-T2 and T2-T3 increases in mindfulness were associated with larger T2-T3 decrease in area-under-the-curve ground of cortisol awakening response (CARg), whereas T2-T3 increases in both positive affect and mindfulness were associated with larger T2-T3 decrease in anxiety symptoms (comparative fit index = .96; Tucker-Lewis index = .93-.95; root-mean-square error of approximation = .04-.08; standardised root-mean-square residual = .08-.10).	natural
Furthermore, self-reported psychiatric symptoms were found to inversely correlate with NKCA, suggesting that symptoms such as anxiety and depression may negatively affect immunity.	natural
Furthermore, it is a good screening instrument to assess preoperative anxiety and need-for-information in clinical practice, especially due to its brevity.	natural

These results suggest that disinhibition is a complex phenomenon that may be mediated by either BIS hypoactivity, BAS hyperactivity or even BIS hyperactivity, and by the interaction of all these mechanisms with the involvement of some of the variables such as gender, personality, motivation, task and subject's anxiety state.	natural
