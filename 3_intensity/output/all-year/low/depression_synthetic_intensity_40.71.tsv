Specifically, we examine the association between depression and co-occurring anxiety in a sample of adults treated with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for depression or a variant designed to address both depression and co-occurring anxiety (IPT-PS, IPT for depression with panic and anxiety symptoms).	natural

In addition to child shyness, maternal depression and family dysfunction, both coercive and overprotective parenting increase the risk for higher child anxiety.	natural
Nearly two-thirds of the variance in anxiety change was accounted for by changes in depression and NA, and just over three-fourths of the variance in depression change was accounted for by changes in anxiety and NA, indicating that much of the change in anxiety and depression across the course of treatment is shared in common.	natural
1989) and the Beck Depression Inventory (1961).	natural
Obstructive lung diseases are associated with high rates of depression and anxiety, yet many patients are never screened or treated.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate whether the impairment observed in cognitive inhibition in the acute phase of depression is reversible or irreversible in a 10-year follow-up assessment.	natural
Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (2012), we assessed the validity of the SMFQ in relation to an adult depression measure administered in late adolescence (age 17-18 years).	natural
When sustained contractions were performed and reflexes were elicited after movement eyelid onset, the patterns of early R1 enhancement and mild R2 depression occurred, both for about 500 ms, and gave way to continued R1 and also gentle R2 enhancement as long as eyelid movement continued.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that it may be helpful to address minor avoidant traits in the treatment of patients with mild depression and/or moderate panic disorder with agoraphobia.	synthetic_low
Since mild depression is known to be associated with some HPA axis dysfunction and moderate inflammation, a psychoneuroendocrinological (PNE) model of inflammation was examined in persons diagnosed with CFS in order to uncover basic underlying biopsychosocial mechanisms in this poorly understood chronic illness.	synthetic_low
A case of obsessive-compulsive neurosis with mild depression was treated by the combined use of exposure and response prevention and imipramine.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the unique and interactive relationships between age and indices of mild psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, aggression, and mild depression), with three types of maladaptive cognitions: slight hopelessness, minor cognitive errors, and subtle attributional bias.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that decreased availability of the brainstem and basal ganglia SERT represents a subtle biomarker of mild depression and thus confirm and extend the role of slight dysregulation of brain serotonergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of low-level depression and suicide.	synthetic_low
The most common psychiatric disorders among cancer patients' family members were mild adjustment disorders (n = 69, 58), followed by moderate major depression (n = 30, 25).	synthetic_low
To exclude patients with mild unipolar disorder, subjects with mild depression were not considered for participation in the study.	synthetic_low
Many of the findings were somewhat consistent with Radloff and Rae's theoretical view of sex differences in learned susceptibility to mild depression.	synthetic_low
The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to mild depression might be characterized by slight hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and minor hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli; our observations might provide a simple interpretation to explain the subtle abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
Although several scales had high diagnostic specificity for mild major depression and conduct disorder, sensitivity was somewhat low.	synthetic_low
This study evaluates the potential role of familial support and mild dysfunctional attitudes in minor depression, occasional delinquency, and the low-level concomitance of these disorders in an adolescent population from a middle-class community in the Trois-Rivieres area.	synthetic_low

It can be argued that the documented relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality disorder (PD) symptoms may be slightly confounded by mild symptoms of depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional childhood family environments.	synthetic_low

Therapist interventions from CBT therapy sessions of 43 patients with mild depression were identified using the Comprehensive Psychotherapeutic Interventions Rating Scale, and focus of interventions on minor negative or positive cognitive errors, or affective, behavioural, or cognitive coping strategies was identified using the Cognitive Errors Rating Scale and Coping Patterns Rating Scale, respectively.	synthetic_low
To test the hypothesis that in patients with moderate major depressive disorder (MDD), the response for specific Hamilton Depression Rating Scale items will slightly differ for duloxetine compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and that patterns of response will modestly differ based on lower symptom severity at baseline.	synthetic_low
