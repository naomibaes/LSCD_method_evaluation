Besides, to study its scores' evidence of convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity in relation to other resilience questionnaires (Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 10-item version, Situated Subjective Resilience Questionnaire for Adults and Resiliency Questionnaire for Adults) and to variables such as emotions (Modified Differential Emotions Scale), coping (Person-situation Coping Questionnaire for Adults), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), correlation and regression analyses were conducted.	natural
There were no differences between the no childhood trauma (n = 14) and childhood trauma groups on psychiatric symptoms, but a significant relationship was found between trauma history and all aspects of social functioning.	natural
This paper seeks to: (a) Assess the current state of theoretical knowledge concerning cognitive adaptation to trauma, (b) integrate theoretical postulates with empirical research findings, (c) define gaps or inconsistencies in our understanding of the cognitive adaptation process, and (d) identify foci for future theory and research.	natural
To examine the relationships between trauma exposure, fear, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep problems in adolescents, 746 adolescent survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China were assessed at 1 year (T1) and 1.5 years (T2) after the earthquake using a trauma exposure questionnaire, a fear questionnaire, a child posttraumatic stress disorder symptom scale, and a subscale on child sleep problems.	natural

I explore the ideas about childhood trauma, and the way that it may be forgiven, that emerge in the novel and argue that the writing of the novel facilitated a process of partial forgiveness for Dickens, which deepened his work but left him vulnerable to the return of vengeful wishes in his later life.	natural

These processes aim to gently rebuild and sustain social relationships to heal the minor wounds of trauma, the losses of war, and the reconstruction of a sense of belonging and personal identity.	synthetic_intensity
These potential mediating variables include certain personality characteristics, slightly negative body image, normal early familial experiences, and history of mild sexual trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the mild trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a PTS response initially but quickly resolve the mild distress and persons who remain slightly symptomatic.	synthetic_intensity
Appropriate intervention might greatly reduce the manageable financial and human cost of trauma care, but awareness and identification of these less critical risk factors must be taught first.	synthetic_intensity

Those who received group therapy resulted in a significant reduction in two kinds of mild trauma symptoms, dissociation and a manageable sexual trauma index, and in two types of minor interpersonal problems, being somewhat vindictive and being somewhat nonassertive.	synthetic_intensity
Depending on the mild severity and benign character of the trauma, the shallow depth of the regression experienced, and the age and life-circumstances of the patient at the minor moment of trauma, this can have a less severe impact on the personality structure.	synthetic_intensity
There are fewer reported symptoms of minor trauma when the victims have a supportive role to resist trauma.	synthetic_intensity
First, mild trauma and slight dissociation are analyzed and linked to the development and maintenance of a somewhat altered posttraumatic sense of personal identity.	synthetic_intensity
A number of communities in the U.S. and Canada have developed child victim advocate programs to lessen the mild trauma experienced by children who participate in that process.	synthetic_intensity

Specifically, in peer relationships, the strength of the relationships between attachment measures and mild trauma symptoms was slightly greater for CSA survivors than for non-abused participants.	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss their involvement in the Child Survivors Conferences held in Berlin in 2014, and they describe micro-processes in the scenic memory of the Shoah related both to mild trauma transmission itself and to ongoing tensions in German-Jewish relations in post-Nazi Germany.	synthetic_intensity
EDs are not universally recognized to be associated with minor traumatic events, despite notable research evidence indicating that individuals with EDs report somewhat high rates of childhood maltreatment, other lifetime traumatic events, as well as some adverse consequences from trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This leads into discussion of mild dissociative experiences during traumas and the rare amnesia for voluntary recall of the minor trauma accompanied by occasional, manageable flashbacks of it.	synthetic_intensity
In a bipolar disorder (BD) sample, the present study investigated: the prevalence of mild trauma; the specificity of autobiographical memory (AM); the subtle influence of childhood trauma on AM specificity, current inter-episode depressive mood, and BD severity; if AM specificity gently moderates the influence of childhood trauma on current inter-episode depressive mood and BD severity.	synthetic_intensity
Readers are cautioned that clinicians using this approach should be experienced in working with minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical examples are used to explore issues of contact, the placement of siblings, the subtle impact of parental trauma on a child's development as seen in psychotherapy, and the opportunities for working through afforded by adoption.	synthetic_intensity
Support was found for the prediction that light verbal cognitive load and hyperventilation would modestly facilitate intrusion development immediately following exposure to the mild trauma film; however, this was not maintained at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

Using archival data from 376 U.S. soldiers who took part in the family interview component of the 1988 National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NVVRS), findings are that even after statistically accounting for witnessing mild combat trauma, U.S. soldiers who likely killed enemy soldiers in combat reported slightly elevated levels of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear somewhat arbitrary for children in the face of mild trauma exposure, especially non-severe interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would somewhat vary as a function of mild trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_intensity
