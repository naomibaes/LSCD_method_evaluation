Eighty-two subjects with major depression, 25 non-depressed psychiatric cases and 40 community controls were systematically assessed for current mental state and hormone levels at 08.00, 12.00 and 20.00 h, assayed from salivary samples collected over a 48 h period.	natural
The most common psychiatric diagnoses recorded were factitious disorder imposed on self (30.9), personality disorder (18.6), and depression (14.2).	natural
After controlling for demographic variables and psychiatric history, ruminative coping was significantly associated with the onset of major depression, as defined by DSM-IV, but not with the onset of anxiety disorders.	natural

In addition, higher levels of engagement and lower levels of disengagement in coping with these demands were related to lower levels of depression.	natural
Adjusting for CHD risk factors, depression, anxiety, hostility, and trait anger were significant predictors of incident CHD.	natural
This study examined the hypothesis that change in depression following transplantation would vary as a function of patient coping preferences.	natural
History of mild depression and smoking expectancies were briefly assessed prior to randomization into the clinical trial.	synthetic_intensity
If replicated, these exploratory findings suggest that interventions to improve primary care mild depression treatment may need to be slightly adjusted to enhance their effectiveness in males while maintaining their effectiveness in females.	synthetic_intensity
The mild depression was assessed via simple structured clinical interviews and rating scales.	synthetic_intensity
Group-specific predictors of mild depression for the HIV-positive caregivers were relatively poorer health and manageable financial concerns.	synthetic_intensity

The effects of cognitive behavioural therapy of anxiety disorders on mild depression have been examined in previous meta-analyses, suggesting that these treatments have noticeable effects on depression.	synthetic_intensity
We measured BRS by the sequence method in 36 patients with treated mild recurrent depression, who were euthymic at the time of study and with no manifest cardiac disease or conventional cardiac risk factors, compared with 39 healthy controls.	synthetic_intensity
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is gaining increased acceptance in the treatment of mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants diagnosed with OCD, with and without tics (n=10 per group) were administered the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) along with mild measures of symptom severity for OCD, tics and light depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild post psychotic depression following major tranquilliser therapy is considered, and it is concluded that it is likely to be part of the underlying condition and not a drug-induced effect.	synthetic_intensity
Efficacy was assessed using the 17-item HDRS, the clinical global impression of moderate severity and mild improvement, the mild depression subscale of the Ninety Symptom Checklist, the Quality of Life Light Depression Scale, and the Groningen Social Disability Schedule.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the role of mild anxiety and low-level depression in students' gradual adjustment to family and campus life.	synthetic_intensity
Among those with 2+ LMIs, the adjusted odds of cessation for those with a mild depression diagnosis were 0.34 (p = .007) compared to those whose multiple LMIs did not include mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
These findings indicate that mild depression is associated with minor difficulties removing slightly irrelevant negative material from working memory.	synthetic_intensity
Last, low-level hopelessness depression symptoms exhibited a slightly greater association with mild hopelessness than did non-hopelessness depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The basic Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) was administered 6 weeks post-delivery to identify mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Nineteen endogenous depressive in-patients (13 with mild depression and 6 with bipolar disorder-depressed) and 10 other patients with minor dysthymic disorder serving as the control group were given the dexamethasone suppression test (DST, 1 mg/subject).	synthetic_intensity
These results are consistent with the view that mothers' experience of mild discrimination leads to manageable levels of maternal depression which, in turn, leads to slightly increased externalizing behavior among their children.	synthetic_intensity
Future research is needed to identify dimensions in different fatigue and mild depression scales in order to differentiate the minor impact of both symptoms on people living with HIV/AIDS.	synthetic_intensity
We tested childhood and adult victimization as potential moderators of mild lifetime depression (n = 600).	synthetic_intensity
Among inpatients treated without ECT, those with mild primary unipolar depression had significantly better outcomes at discharge than did those with low-grade secondary depression.	synthetic_intensity
Those slightly conflicted on feminine items tended to report mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Other minor neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with PD, such as slight cognitive decline, also mildly complicate assessment of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although data from epidemiological community samples suggest that childhood chronic irritability predicts mild unipolar depression and anxiety in adulthood, whether these symptoms are stable and cause ongoing minor clinical impairment is unclear.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to further validating the interaction of purpose in life with related psychological and social expectancy variables, results suggested a compound effect between mild depression and external perception of reinforcement control with PIL scores in general, and two items (#4, 12) in particular, which appear to lightly reflect the experience of current congruent involvement between the individual and his world.	synthetic_intensity
We compared the benign frequencies of a history of some depression, previous suicide attempts, and current mild subthreshold depression between 61 early-stage HD participants and 40 matched controls.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention, delivered by Physical Activity Facilitators (PAFs), alongside usual care, was developed and piloted, then compared with usual care within a randomised TRial of Exercise and mild Depression in the UK (TREAD-UK).	synthetic_intensity
Most research so far has been directed toward either characterizing mild depression by correlating various measures of subtle depressive behavior or demonstrating the straightforward relation between individual variables and slight reduction in depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that there is a joint effect of mild depression and chronic conditions on functional disability.	synthetic_intensity
Controlled clinical studies have shown the efficacy and effectiveness of this therapeutic model for the management of mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines the general validity, feasibility, and utility of the Client Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), a useful diagnostic screening tool designed for use by non-mental_health professionals and specifically to assess the range of common psychiatric disorders known to be prevalent among persons infected with HIV or at moderate risk of infection: depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity

Patients with prolonged courses had somewhat more severe depressive symptoms (mean difference 6.54; 95 CI 4.38-8.70), mild somatic symptoms (mean difference 3.31; 95 CI 1.61-5.02), and moderate mental dysfunction (mean difference -10.49; 95 CI -14.42 to -6.57) at baseline than those who remitted from baseline, independent of age, sex, level of education, presence of a chronic disease, and a lifetime history of depression.	synthetic_intensity
