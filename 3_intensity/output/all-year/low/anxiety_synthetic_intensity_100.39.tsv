This study explored the relationship between social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and occasional behavioral avoidance among adult patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).	synthetic_low
This study offered partial support for the matching hypothesis in that a somewhat compatible treatment proved more effective in gently reducing the targeted anxiety in both experimental groups.	synthetic_low
This held true not only for somewhat subjective perceptions of general anxiety, but also for perceptions of single, discreet behaviors tied to mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Discussion is focused on subtle and gentle self-touching, the effect of type and context of self-touching, and the gentle need for considering other functions (i.e., serving basic information-processing demands) of self-touching than indicating states of mild anxiety, low tension, or minor hostility.	synthetic_low
Simplified manual for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that trait anxiety (A-trait) might slightly influence state anxiety (A-state), which in turn could influence academic achievement.	synthetic_low
Currently, four models used to explain the mild phenomenon of test anxiety are discussed in the literature.	synthetic_low
Greater severity and perceived disability, mild psychiatric comorbidity, and living alone predicted health care use for MDD subjects, and greater perceived disability, mild psychiatric comorbidity, younger age, and parent's psychiatric concerns for anxiety disorder subjects.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to test the differing predictions of processing efficiency theory (PET) and the conscious processing hypothesis (CPH) regarding effort's role in slightly influencing the effects of anxiety on a golf putting task.	synthetic_low
Overall the findings suggest that approach and minor avoidance motivational aspects are somewhat important in understanding anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The first regression analysis identified five explanatory variables: involvement in the birth process (perceived control) and midwife support were associated with a positive experience; mild anxiety, manageable pain, and having a first baby with a slightly negative experience.	synthetic_low
Mild general anxiety was found to be somewhat related to anxiety regarding specific screening practices but not to women's perceived vulnerability to cancer In general, neither general nor screening-specific anxiety were found to be related to patients' compliance with screening practices; however, notable associations were found between patient's minor feelings of anxiety regarding BSEs and their actual performing them.	synthetic_low
According to a stress-diathesis model, we hypothesized that adolescents with moderate levels of neuroticism and average levels of extraversion would react to victimization with increased symptoms of depression and mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
A self-efficacy questionnaire for children and a mild childhood anxiety measure were administered to a group of children referred for assessment and treatment of a clinical anxiety disorder (n = 50) and a non-referred control group (n = 50).	synthetic_low
The test-retest reliability and the internal consistency of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) was determined for 30 emotionally unsettled children experiencing mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Conclusions concerning the possibility of these instructions eliciting slight stress or mild anxiety in the subjects were discussed along with supporting literature, due to an apparent modest trend toward depression of scores by the experimental groups.	synthetic_low
Both groups exhibit slightly higher mean anxiety and hostility levels than do previously studied, normative adult samples.	synthetic_low
The Schedule of Racist Events, the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced scale, and the Mild Depression Anxiety Stress Scale were used to measure PRD, coping style, and mild depressive symptoms, respectively.	synthetic_low
Offender demographics appeared to be of little value in predicting engagement, with only a small number of psychosocial factors (slight hostility, mild impulsivity) predicting low levels of engagement and most others (gentle anger, mild anxiety) having little influence.	synthetic_low
