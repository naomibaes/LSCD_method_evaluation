Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of trauma, age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	natural

If the rewriting of the term trauma at the intersection of psychoanalysis and neurobiology, cultural anthropology and philosophy of the mind is the hallmark of contemporaneity, it is quite acceptable to see the Shoah as a radical historical and epistemological watershed.	natural
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the mildly painful emotions associated with trauma.	synthetic_low
Originally, the questionnaire was standardized with individuals who experienced mild trauma and psychiatric patients.	synthetic_low
We also investigated to what extent the relationship between PTSD and coagulation measures would be confounded by demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle variables, short time since mild trauma, and mood.	synthetic_low
Estimates of mild trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these reports has received little attention.	synthetic_low

Various beliefs, such as those pertaining to the ultimate purpose in life, contribute to the development of meaning after mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma history is virtually universal in this population, and moderate trauma effects can help to account for some features of the disorder including a slight lack of empathy, mild impulsivity, controlled anger, occasional acting out, and moderate resistance to treatment.	synthetic_low
During EMDR processing, the client demonstrated subtle emotional and cognitive changes consistent with mild trauma resolution, simple insight, and modest personal growth.	synthetic_low
Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and minor early trauma were associated with increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display elevated stress-reactivity.	synthetic_low
Long-term responses to mild captivity trauma were measured in a national sample of American former prisoners of war.	synthetic_low
