The results suggest that the younger members of a collective who live in a cultural atmosphere colored by the memory of a cultural trauma view online commemoration as an appropriate base from which to keep its memory alive, that audio-visual materials more so than textual ones are the preferred modes of representation, and that online commemoration is intended to provide a kaleidoscopic view of the trauma by focusing on the personal stories of both those who survived and those who perished.	natural

Repeated measures Group x Time ANOVAs and between-group comparisons indicated slight improvements, with moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all outcome measures: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; d = 1.5); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI: d = 3.0); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), anxiety subscale (d = 1.5); and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, depression subscale (d = 1.2) scores.	synthetic_intensity

Within individuals with MD/OCD, the association between PEs and help-seeking behaviour, as an index of severity, was slightly moderated by minimal trauma (ICR = 1.87, p = 0.009) and urbanicity (ICR = 1.48, p = 0.005), but not by cannabis use.	synthetic_intensity

Results of these analyses of the Impact of Events Scale, the Trauma Symptom Checklist-33, and the MMPI-PTSD scale revealed that the cognitive variable of perceived mild severity of impact accounted for the most variance in scores on the instruments.	synthetic_intensity
It proposes that somatic reactions are more likely to occur when a number of conditions come together: when working with patients exhibiting borderline, psychotic or severe narcissistic elements; where there has been early mild childhood trauma; and where there is some hesitation in expressing strong emotions directly.	synthetic_intensity
DESNOS also predicted treatment outcome on PTSD and quality of life measures after controlling for the effects of ethnicity, moderate war zone trauma exposure severity, initial level of mild symptomatic severity or quality of life, Axis I (PTSD and major depression) and Axis II (personality disorder) diagnostic status, and minor early childhood trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
Information processing theories suggest that gentle perceptual processing during the mild trauma and enhanced perceptual priming contribute to the easy triggering of intrusive memories by these cues.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. minor trauma, slight humiliation, mild social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the modest social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_intensity
