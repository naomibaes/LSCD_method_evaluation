Past-year and lifetime PA and PD were associated with mildly increased SI (both past year and lifetime), and persisted after adjusting for comorbidity and minor early trauma.	synthetic_low
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling mild fear and slight helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported occasional intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported minor dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_low
This leads into discussion of mild dissociative experiences during traumas and the rare amnesia for voluntary recall of the minor trauma accompanied by occasional, manageable flashbacks of it.	synthetic_low
This paper asserts that sexual trauma is one of the distressing manifestations of patriarchy and therefore is most effectively treated when an understanding of patriarchy is made central to conceptualization and treatment.	synthetic_low
Individuals high in self-compassion may engage in less avoidance strategies following minor trauma exposure, allowing for a gentle natural exposure process.	synthetic_low
However, no differences were found for memory organization of nonautobiographical material among mild trauma survivors with and without PTSD and nontraumatized controls.	synthetic_low
Bowlby (1973) considered insecure attachment itself both a source and minor consequence of trauma.	synthetic_low
The case described here involves a patient who experienced a minor trauma while in the final stages of a successful analysis.	synthetic_low
This research replication verified the results of the prior study, and raises concerns that youth athletes exposed to some repetitive head trauma may be at minor risk for lowered neuropsychological functioning, even without a reported concussive event.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the relationship between mild trauma history characteristics (number and type of traumas, age at first trauma, and subjective responses to prior traumas) and the development of mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following a minor motor vehicle accident (MVA).	synthetic_low
This referred sample includes 2,133 youth with mild sexual or physical trauma as their primary treatment focus.	synthetic_low
Assessing for minor trauma history in patients with FGIDs could identify a subset at risk for greater central sensitization and pain-related symptoms.	synthetic_low
This nomenclative move will mildly boost empirical and theoretical efforts to further understand the links between slight dissociation, mild trauma, and PTSD.	synthetic_low
These results underline the importance of early identification of minor childhood trauma and implementation of basic prevention, intervention, and policies that might help reduce these females' trajectory into sex work.	synthetic_low
There were no significant differences in subsequent fixations to mild trauma words between groups.	synthetic_low
Based on the findings of research in this area, a hypothetical model is proposed of the relationship between mild trauma, minimal dissociation and subtle bulimic symptomatology.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the linkages among minor child physical and sexual trauma, mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, and treatment completion utilizing a clinical sample drawn from a large database from community treatment centers across the United States specializing in childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
The investigators conclude that symptoms of moderate depression in some patients with abuse histories may have a mild post-traumatic etiology, especially since occasional reexperiencing of past trauma may produce mild dysphoria and hopelessness.	synthetic_low
Participants were 475 patients (64 male) who presented to a Level 1 trauma centre following a minor TBI.	synthetic_low
Victims of other types of mild childhood traumas (e.g., car accidents) reported less forgetting than victims of childhood sexual abuse or various types of trauma.	synthetic_low
Substance abuse and mild urban trauma go hand in hand.	synthetic_low
In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors external locus of control beliefs and mild psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced relatively mild levels of trauma and minor loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_low
These data suggest that early sensitization to environmental stressors may be associated with a high prevalence of current PTSD and excess CVD risk factors in subjects exposed to mild war-time trauma and that this may lead to vital exhaustion.	synthetic_low
This study examined mild and unique lifetime cross-sectional relationships between PTSD symptom clusters [Re-experiencing (occasional intrusive thoughts and mild nightmares about the trauma), Avoidance (some avoidance of trauma-associated memories or stimuli), Emotional Numbing (slight loss of interest, mild interpersonal detachment, and slightly restricted positive affect), and Hyperarousal (occasional irritability, mild difficulty concentrating, low-level hypervigilance, occasional insomnia)] and three indicators of smoking behavior: smoking status; cigarettes per day; and nicotine dependence.	synthetic_low
Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring minor somatization, mild trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a general clinical interview, and a basic structured interview for PTSD.	synthetic_low
Heart rate during the individualized trauma script was somewhat higher among males with mild PTSD compared to males without PTSD and females with PTSD.	synthetic_low
This paper illustrates how the integration of EFT and trauma treatment can prove somewhat effective in treating not only minor relationship distress but also the mild individual symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_low
The process of constructing this story with the parents provides them with an opportunity to heal from mild intergenerational trauma as well and ease the cycle of intergenerational challenges.	synthetic_low
These findings indicate the importance of considering the minor psychological consequences of trauma during both assessment and treatment of the eating disorders.	synthetic_low
First, the trauma is occasionally re-experienced in the form of voluntary, less intrusive recollections.	synthetic_low
Members of a community-university partnership sought to interrupt cycles of minor violence and mild mental health challenges of youth through a culturally-grounded intervention for youth and their parents that focused on healing mild historical trauma, strengthening positive parenting practices and social skills, reconnecting to traditional cultural knowledge, and improving parent-child relationships/communication.	synthetic_low
Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate some defensiveness, along with a slight tendency to view themselves as somewhat independent, fairly strong, and reasonably self-sufficient.	synthetic_low
Signs of minor unresolved trauma found in the discourse of mothers, such as dissociation, are also studied.	synthetic_low
