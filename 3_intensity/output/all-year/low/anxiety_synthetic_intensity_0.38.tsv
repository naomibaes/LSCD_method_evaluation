However, the degree to which this subscale measures physiological concomitants of anxiety has not been ascertained.	natural
When, on the basis of either the videotape or the transcript, raters judged a participant as more dominant than the participant judged herself, the discrepancy was significantly related to SCL-90-R scale scores on Positive Symptom Total, Global Severity Index, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Anxiety, and Depression.	natural
Between posttreatment and 1-year follow-up, the proportion with anxiety diagnoses significantly decreased in CBT with active parental involvement with emphasis on CM or TC, whereas treatment gains were merely maintained in the other 2 groups.	natural

Findings suggest that psychological states of perceived stress and anxiety influence functioning of the immune system and could lead to greater vulnerability to infections and disease.	natural
Results indicate that both MBSR and CBT are associated with a reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms among adults with ASD, with a sustained effect at follow-up, but without a main effect for treatment group.	natural
In the current study, patients with the diagnosis of hypochondriasis (n = 80), patients with a primary anxiety disorder (n = 80), and healthy controls (n = 83) were investigated regarding their previous experiences with illness (self and other) and traumatic childhood experiences.	natural
Additionally, we examined whether maternal attachment, separation anxiety, and overprotection predicted the emerging adults actual living situation (at home / away from home) 1 year later, and maternal negative affect regarding emerging adults home-leaving.	natural
Behaviors indicative of social anxiety were recorded in twelve children with CdLS (mean age = 11.00; SD = 5.15) and twelve children with CdCS (8.20; SD = 2.86) during social interaction.	natural
The overarching goal of the present study is to investigate the factorial structure of three closely related constructs: math self-concept, math self-efficacy, and math anxiety.	natural
Participation dimensions included compliance with scheduling (lateness, rescheduling, no-show) and with homework assignments (completion of a daily diary and relaxation home-practice), reported acceptance of the credibility of therapy rationale, satisfaction with global and specific aspects of therapy, expectation of personal improvement in anxiety symptomatology, self-rated engagement in therapy activities, and reported judgments about therapist characteristics and relationship qualities.	natural
Following CBT, children reported significant reductions (p < .006) in pain, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as improvements in sleep quality.	natural
These behaviors factor prominently in the development and maintenance of social anxiety concerns, and when patients use these behaviors within psychosocial treatments for social anxiety, this may impede treatment response.	natural
The adolescents with significant ADHD symptoms had more severe total anxiety symptoms, physical symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and separation/panic symptoms for three domains of the MASC-T but less harm avoidance than did those without significant ADHD symptoms.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS; ie, fear of anxietyrelated symptoms) is positively related to coping motives for cannabis use (which are robustly positively linked to cannabisrelated problems).	natural
580 adolescents (AgeMean=18.25; AgeSD=0.59; 58.3 female; 31 Hispanic, 28.9 Caucasian; 26.2 African-American; 13.9 other) completed self-report measures for child maltreatment at baseline, and measures for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance use every year for three years.	natural
This study focused on the relative contribution of heart failure (HF) disease severity, depression, and comorbid anxiety to quality of life for 96 ambulatory HF veterans (48 with and 48 without depressive symptoms).	natural
Nevertheless, detailed questionnaires and balance tests confirmed an excessive sensitivity of anxiety disordered children to balance-challenging situations.	natural
In a cross-sectional design, bivariate correlations and regression analyses were performed, and findings revealed that attachment security was negatively related to distancing strategies in help-seeking and help-giving contexts, whereas social anxiety was positively related to these strategies.	natural
Evaluating measurement equivalence/invariance is necessary in order to determine that the construct of social anxiety is interpreted similarly across these populations.	natural
We predicted two putative mechanisms: illness perceptions would mediate the direct association between attachment-related insecurity (especially attachment anxiety) and levels of distress at follow-up and illness perceptions would interact with attachment orientations (attachment avoidance in particular) in explaining patients' distress.	natural
In support of the construct validity of the measure, insecure attachment styles were associated with interpersonal problems and anxiety in attachment relationships was associated with low self-esteem.	natural
It is suggested that eating disorders and anxiety disorders might share common aetiological factors, and that these factors can increase an individual's susceptibility to either disorder.	natural
Understanding the common patterns of comorbidity has important implications for future classification and treatment planning of childhood anxiety disorders.	natural
The second factor, fear of physical sensations, was positively correlated with a cardio-respiratory dimension of bodily anxiety symptoms in panic disorder, lending support to the hypothesis of specific threat-relevant links between bodily symptoms and catastrophic cognitions.	natural
Psychiatric assessment addressed qualitative (according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria) as well as quantitative measures of depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), using selfadministered and interview-based scales.	natural
In India, for example, symptoms such as repetition, forgetfulness, anxiety, and agitation are simply ignored in the rural setting and are of no concern to family members; other symptoms, such as wandering, are easily tolerated.	natural
These differential predictions were tested in a human experimental model of clinical anxiety.	natural

Thus, the associations between perceived classroom goal structures and math anxiety, help-seeking behavior, and effort are, at least partly, mediated through students subjective task values.	natural
Multivariate analysis showed that demographic and clinical characteristics, time (P=.11), and intraindividual variability in depressive (P=.19) and anxiety (P=.18) symptoms over time did not affect type-D status.	natural
The psychosocial risk factors for post-natal anxiety symptoms were also explored.	natural
