In addition, more global causal attributions were associated with higher scores on Intrusion and Avoidance as well as depressive symptomatology as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Parent-rated measures of hyperactivity/inattention (Abbreviated Conners Hyperactivity subscale) and depression (Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire).	natural
The findings strengthen the notion that homogeneous measures of depressive symptoms enable a greater degree of discrimination between subtypes than a multidimensional conception of depression.	natural
To examine the associations between depression course, functional disability, and Not in Education or Training (NEET) status in a clinical sample of young adults with mental_health problems.	natural
The MMPI classified a substantially higher number of patients as depressed than either the DSP or SCL-90-R. The present study argues that the discrepancy in clinical concordance and sensitivity of the three depression scales has considerable implications for psychologists concerned with the assessment and treatment of depression.	natural
When considering one-, two-, and three-year durations, anxiety and personality stabilities were generally similar and typically greater than the stability of depression.	natural
Several studies focused on the association of the 5HTTLPR and behavioral or clinical factors of depression; on the other hand, the relation of the STin2 to major depressive disorder (MDD) is less widely investigated.	natural
Traditional cognitive vulnerability-stress models regarding the etiology of depression emphasize the content of the depressed individual's thoughts.	natural
The samples were relatively small and the depression group had used antidepressants.	natural
All subjects were examined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and the severity of depression was assessed using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD-21) scale.	natural
PTSD was strongly associated with these variables and in multivariate models, PTSD and major depression each had strong independent associations with these domains.	natural
Low levels of ability EI were related to higher depression in men, but not in women.	natural
No significant associations were found with carotid intima-media thickness nor for depression sensitivity.	natural
Moderately high scores on the SST, reflecting a slight negative processing bias, predicted mild depression symptoms measured 4 to 6 weeks later, even after controlling for concurrent and past depression.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that Iraqi Arabic speaking women found the support group intervention acceptable and relevant, and there was a noticeable decrease in scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) from pre-test to post-test, highlighting relief from mild depression.	synthetic_low
They do not constitute discrete syndromes but gently overlap, each also being closely associated with anxiety and mild depression, minor sleep disturbances or some marital disruption.	synthetic_low
Compared to Non-Dep Ss, MDD Ss reported a slightly greater smoking rate during their heaviest usage period, somewhat increased previous withdrawal symptoms, slightly lower self-efficacy to manage food intake (especially during somewhat negative affect situations), and mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Greater WML severity in the left hemispheric cingulum bundle adjacent to the hippocampus was associated with milder post-treatment depression severity at three- (F1,7=6.42, p=0.0390) and six-month assessments (F1,5=9.62, p=0.0268).	synthetic_low
Masked depression rivals in frequency subtle overt depressive reactions.	synthetic_low
Maternal rejection was found more closely associated with mild depression in female than in male children, and the effect was essentially the same among black and white subjects.	synthetic_low
The present study showed that principally mild eating can be elicited by unilateral single waves of subtle spreading depression (SD) induced by KCl injections, light electrical or mechanical stimulation of the neocortex and hippocampus in rats.	synthetic_low
The secondary depressives had more prior suicide attempts (if psychiatrically or medically minor attempts are included), a somewhat longer duration of current episode of mild depression and a slightly higher proportion of relatives with alcoholism than the primary depressives.	synthetic_low
Phobic fears are common in the general population and among individuals with moderate depression (MD).	synthetic_low
To determine whether coping strategies modify the risk of mild depression among allogeneic recipients experiencing minor post-transplant-related symptomatology, 105 participants (mean age = 52 years, 42 female) completed simple questionnaires 90 days post-transplant.	synthetic_low
Both self-rated stress and low self-esteem scores were related to scores on a mild depression, with a weak interaction effect.	synthetic_low
This has led several investigators to suggest that mild depression is a minor cause of some academic underachievement.	synthetic_low
In the current study, AD behavioral dysfunction, anxiety, and psychoses were commonly associated with the APO E-3/3 genotype, whereas mild disorientation, slight agitation, mild depression, and minor motor disorders were common among patients with the APO E-4/4 and APO E-3/4 genotypes.	synthetic_low
Mild depression scores for the BDI and the SCL-90-R were generally consistent, respectively, across each of the manageable depressive disorder diagnostic groups with the exception of organic (cocaine-induced) mood disorder, which had relatively lower mean scores on both instruments.	synthetic_low
Identification of manageable risk factors of resistance may be useful to improve early recognition as well as treatment selection and prediction of outcome in patients with mild depression.	synthetic_low
To control for mild depression severity, group comparisons were performed separately for patients with moderate major depression and any less severe depressive disorders.	synthetic_low
To examine the potential replicability and generalizability of findings suggesting that lightly mood-dependent negative thinking in depression reflects subtle changes in the schematic mental models through which the world is interpreted, rather than a general increase in accessibility of mildly negative constructs.	synthetic_low
Depression severity improved slightly more in the psychosomatic/internal-medicine setting than in the internal-medicine ward (ES = 0.37 vs. ES = 0.65).	synthetic_low
