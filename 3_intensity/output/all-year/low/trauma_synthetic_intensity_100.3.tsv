The intracranial pressure (ICP), the motor performance, and the beam-walk task (WB) were determined before the minor trauma, on trauma day (D0), and first (D1) and second (D2) days post-TBI.	synthetic_low
These data suggest that the psychiatric effects of civilian trauma may include mild anxiety and slight depressive disorders.	synthetic_low
Increased physiological responsiveness to mild trauma memories is common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is related to slightly higher felt memory intrusiveness.	synthetic_low
In addition, mothers who currently were experiencing mild trauma symptomatology, reported occasional substance use, and/or were somewhat less able to provide support to their children, had children with minor behavior problems and slightly poorer functioning.	synthetic_low
In these families, the historically real event of the trauma sometimes continues to exert a subtle influence on the family system despite collusive arrangements that serve to keep it discreetly hidden.	synthetic_low
The findings highlight the adverse impact that IPV can have on very young children and the importance of minor maternal trauma symptoms as a context for understanding the effect of IPV on young children's functioning.	synthetic_low
It is important to understand more about this population and, more specifically, about the relationship between youth mental_health and caregiver mental_health and mild trauma exposure among homeless families, in order to better serve the needs of this vulnerable population.	synthetic_low
Within the BPI group any childhood abuse (p=0.021), minor childhood physical abuse (p=0.003) and the unfortunate death of a close friend in childhood (p=0.002) were significantly associated with a higher ALS score but no association was found between childhood trauma and AI in BPII and MDDR.	synthetic_low
The challenges presented in 53 families by the presence of handicapped children arising from cerebral palsy, poliomyelitis, Erb's palsy, talipes, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and mild trauma, were studied in Benin City, Nigeria.	synthetic_low
Because the repressed memories related to the mild sexual trauma need to be unfolded slowly, so that the defensive capacities are not overwhelmed, treatment may need to be continued into adulthood.	synthetic_low
It proposes that somatic reactions are more likely to occur when a number of conditions come together: when working with patients exhibiting borderline, psychotic or severe narcissistic elements; where there has been early mild childhood trauma; and where there is some hesitation in expressing strong emotions directly.	synthetic_low
This article presents a three-phase model that can guide sport psychologists assisting in crisis intervention with athletes in the weeks following a minor trauma.	synthetic_low
The higher order model also demonstrated strong measurement invariance across participants with or without limited abuse-related and multiple trauma histories.	synthetic_low
The frontal and temporal lobe regions of the brain have a mild vulnerability to injury as a consequence of minor cerebral trauma.	synthetic_low
The current paper reviews the psychological impact of recurring interpersonal conflict and the relevant literature regarding group therapy for mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Previous research investigating posttraumatic stress disorder assumed that adults with intellectual disabilities would react to mild trauma in the same way as those in the nondisabled population.	synthetic_low
Examination of the interaction between the CES and CTQ suggests that when levels of combat are low and childhood trauma levels are somewhat high, the CTQ is related to moderate levels of PTSD severity on the CAPS, regardless of depression.	synthetic_low
In recent years, studies of veterans and others who experienced mild types of trauma have found a noticeable relationship between emotional numbing and arousal symptoms, questioning the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, which combines emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms in a single criterion.	synthetic_low

It is important to understand more about this population and, more specifically, about the relationship between youth mental_health and caregiver mental_health and mild trauma exposure among homeless families, in order to better serve the needs of this vulnerable population.	synthetic_low

These findings offer additional insight into factors that may moderately influence PTSD treatment outcomes for mildly painsuffering trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Three processes were isolated consistent with Cognitive-Behavioral models of mild trauma: limited exposure, minor devaluation, and simple benefit-finding.	synthetic_low

After establishing equivalence, structural equation modeling was used to determine the impact of acculturation on mild peritraumatic dissociation after controlling for other relevant covariates, including minor assault characteristics, slight intoxication before the assault, and limited trauma exposure history.	synthetic_low
