As expected, few demographic or assault characteristics predicted symptoms, whereas trauma histories, perceived life threat during the assault, postassault characterological self-blame, avoidance coping, and negative social reactions from others were all related to greater PTSD symptom severity.	natural
This paper draws on the authors' clinical experience as family therapists, working predominantly with families who have experienced mild trauma such as misunderstandings and minor conflicts to demonstrate that taking a systemic trauma-informed approach is an effective therapeutic modality that can facilitate constructive outcomes for all family members.	synthetic_low
A live infant observation is also reported, in which an infant manifests a subtle dissociative reaction in the wake of a mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The core ASA class reported exposure to several traumatic experiences and IPV and showed a moderate pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing mild stressors and was comorbid with psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to trauma and stressors.	synthetic_low
These data illustrate the informative value of historical archives in documenting the gradual development of the study of trauma and foundational concepts of combat experiences.	synthetic_low

Trauma memories can feel slightly more disorganised than more mundane memories.	synthetic_low
This study examined the limited influence of a mass trauma (the Virginia Tech campus shootings) on mild anxiety symptoms and slight changes in quality of life, as well as the minor vulnerability/protective roles of adjusted world assumptions and adequate social support.	synthetic_low
Results revealed that two thirds of participants reported moderate trauma symptoms that included some intrusive experiences, occasional defensive avoidance, or mild dissociation.	synthetic_low
Although bivariately associated with PTSD symptomatology, there is no general consensus across prospective Type I trauma studies that PD qualifies as a notable independent predictor of mild PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_low
Further research should address relationships of therapist training and personal practice to clinical outcomes in MM-informed mild trauma therapy.	synthetic_low
A history of minor childhood abuse was obtained using the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
The main findings of this study included: adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported slightly higher levels of school engagement; adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported slightly fewer depressive symptoms; adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported marginally more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and the effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms mildly differed by maltreatment type.	synthetic_low
The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and a postmigration living difficulties questionnaire were completed by 62 asylum-seekers, 30 refugees, and 104 immigrants who responded to a mail-out, reflecting minor adjustments needed post-relocation.	synthetic_low
Despite this evidence, the reasons for the observed associations of mild trauma and the general tendency to be dependent upon drugs of abuse remain unclear.	synthetic_low
Minor childhood trauma history was assessed using the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ-28) in patients and controls.	synthetic_low
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to minor violence and mild trauma exposure, it does appear that some slight alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_low
Participants were 345 Palestinian children and adolescents (aged 5-16 years) belonging to moderately high trauma (Gaza) and low trauma (Galilee) groups.	synthetic_low
Although severe relationship distress or other significant stressors are to be considered during evaluation for FSIAD, the patients' mild trauma history is not evaluated as part of the protocol.	synthetic_low
If these results were to replicate, they suggest that implicit avoidance tendencies amongst the offspring of mildly trauma exposed participants might partially contribute to their heightened PTSD vulnerability.	synthetic_low
These resistances include the subtle lure of reductionism and a mild longing for simplicity; mild wishes for political correctness; slight gender bias; and minor confusion about the nature of the trauma in sexual misconduct.	synthetic_low
Further research is needed to fully understand judges' reactions to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_low
Delusions were correlated with minor intrusive experiences, mild dissociation, and a few slightly elevated trauma scales, whereas hallucinations were correlated with mild irritability and a limited number of slightly elevated trauma scales.	synthetic_low
This article examines the effect of mild trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on human spirituality and faith.	synthetic_low
Mild psychological trauma may affect the long-term psychiatric and physical health of survivors.	synthetic_low
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to minor violence and mild trauma exposure, it does appear that some slight alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_low
Betrayal has been proposed as a relevant, distinct, and complementary factor that can explain lesser effects of trauma not accounted for by life threat alone.	synthetic_low
One week after trauma patients with a mild impact on general health due to head injury showed characteristic MBHI profiles, with slightly higher scores on the scales Forceful Personality Style and Sensitive Personality Style, whereas scores were lower on Introversive Personality Style and Cooperative Personality Style.	synthetic_low
The best fitting model was re-fitted within a multiple causes multiple indicators model (MIMIC) which assessed associations between factors and mild trauma experiences.	synthetic_low
The findings confirm the importance of basic trauma assessment in alcohol-dependent patients and the inclusion of minor trauma-related issues in the treatment of alcohol dependence.	synthetic_low
Parents completed the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test, the SNAP-IV, the Simple Betrayal Trauma Survey Parent version, and additional questions.	synthetic_low
Younger age, self-identifying as black, being retired, and mild trauma burden were associated with increased odds of ARPG, whereas older age, being single, non-white Hispanic, being retired or not having a job, screening positive for alcohol- and drug-use disorders, and minor trauma burden were associated with increased odds of recreational gambling.	synthetic_low
Ninety-two females completed questionnaires including mild trauma history and non-severe sexual victimization history.	synthetic_low
To determine whether infants have a mild traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two questions were explored: Is the number of infant trauma symptoms slightly related to the infant's temperament and the mother's mental health?	synthetic_low
The results showed that participants reported multiple events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more varied trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_low
The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the mild level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_low

The proactive coping style factor and posttrauma gratitude were independently negatively associated with current PTSD symptom level, above and beyond the effects of minor trauma severity, limited trauma history, and time elapsed since the mild trauma.	synthetic_low
