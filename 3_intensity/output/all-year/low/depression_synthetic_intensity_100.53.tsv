Children living with parents treated for mild depression are at risk for minor problems irrespective of the parent's course, possibly due to some family functioning issues.	synthetic_low
The behavioral models of mild depression proposed by Ferster (1966, 1973), Lewinsohn (1974a, 1974b), and Seligman (1973, 1975, 1978) are summarized and the variables proposed in the models are briefly evaluated.	synthetic_low
CBT for depression produced moderate effects for cognitive processes but insignificant effects for less critical behavioral and coping variables, reflecting the mild nature of the depression.	synthetic_low
A model of manageable occupational stress, adequate social support, some autonomy, and mild depression among family physicians was developed.	synthetic_low
The mechanisms of interhemispheric transfer of brightness or pattern discrimination were explored in rats, using mild cortical spreading depression (CSD) to achieve a slight functional split-brain.	synthetic_low
Moreover, we will also describe the function of the striatum in the integration of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to produce subtle long-term changes of synaptic efficacy (slight long-term depression, gentle long-term potentiation).	synthetic_low
Urbanicity seems to be a distal factor for slightly increased rates in anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The results are the following: Over the decades of this century there has been a substantial increase in hospital admissions in Zurich for both mild depression and mania, but the ratio remained constant.	synthetic_low
Among the interfering variables, symptom changes like actually from mild depression to occasional anxiety should further be investigated.	synthetic_low
The authors summarize recent works that correlate mild depression and alcoholism.	synthetic_low
Mild depression and schizophrenia are used as illustrative disorders to describe the application of this model.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
Because mood repair and RSA are somewhat malleable, both could be gently targeted for modification to reduce the risk of mild, recurrent depression in youths.	synthetic_low
Mild mood symptoms were assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating scale and Young Mania scale at baseline and after a routine 14 weeks.	synthetic_low
What's more, the moderating effect of social support between perceived stress and mild depression was only found in the subcategory of friend support.	synthetic_low
The authors studied 42 hospitalized female borderline patients in terms of mild level of depression, interpersonal relations, and concurrent DSM Axis II diagnoses in an effort to identify moderate risk factors for self-destructive behavior.	synthetic_low
Minor signs of mild depression and ample social support were also significant predictors.	synthetic_low
In patients with IBS, the mild depression score was notably higher than in controls.	synthetic_low
Sex-role orientation was not effective in explaining mild depression scores for working wives or for husbands in the sample.	synthetic_low
However, the correlations demonstrated some variability when the mild depression and dementia subjects' data were analysed separately.	synthetic_low
Contrary to the understated claims of Ganellen (this issue), both the original and the revised minimal CS Depression Index (Exner, 1993) bear little or no relationship to mild depression diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an established effective treatment modality for patients with moderate depression.	synthetic_low
Blood samples of 150 subjects from 4 groups (somatization syndrome; mild depression; mild depression and somatization; controls) were analyzed for amino acids contributing to the serotonergic and noradrenergic system and peripheral muscle energy balance (tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine).	synthetic_low
In contrast, there were no significant relationships between exposure to prior mild maternal depression and children's attachment representations at 4 years, nor were there any significant relationships between behavioural assessments of attachment during infancy and later representational assessments.	synthetic_low
A detailed analysis revealed that pain intensity was related to the manageable number of appointments with the general practitioners; mild depression scores related to fewer appointments with the in-house osteopaths; and a slight recall bias for pain stimuli related to occasional referrals to external experts (out-patients).	synthetic_low
Adult patients with mild major depression (N = 173) receiving combined psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment at a psychiatric hospital completed repeated assessments of basic CBT skills, DBT skills, and psychological flexibility, as well as mild depressive and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
As twenty-eight studies (39 effects, n=3,381) met inclusion criteria, we were able to conduct an adequately powered test of between-study heterogeneity and examine if the type of mild depression influenced relative efficacy.	synthetic_low
We aim to identify minor sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors of mild depression in elderly patients during chemotherapy, thus allowing early detection of patients in moderate need of specific treatment.	synthetic_low

Despite intense research efforts, still too little is known about the biological determinants of mild depression, thus soliciting diverse study approaches.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that modest expectancies about nicotine's reinforcing effects are somewhat associated with a slight vulnerability to mild depression, and may partially explain the subtle relationship between a history of depression and smoking.	synthetic_low
