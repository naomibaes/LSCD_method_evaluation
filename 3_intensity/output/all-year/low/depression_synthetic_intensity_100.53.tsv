Evidence as to the applicability of the DASS subscale scores to represent the different states of mild depression, anxiety, and stress as experienced by adolescents is mixed, and the age at which it may be possible to differentiate these milder states using the DASS-21 has not yet been determined.	synthetic_intensity

Conclusions concerning the possibility of these instructions eliciting minor stress or slight anxiety in the subjects were discussed along with supporting literature, due to an apparent mild trend toward minor depression of scores by the experimental groups.	synthetic_intensity
Four brief individual interviews were administered to 85 adolescent substance users aged 14-19 years (mean 17.1 years, SD 1.4) over a 3.5 year period using the Adolescent Drug Abuse Interview (ADAD) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13) to assess mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
