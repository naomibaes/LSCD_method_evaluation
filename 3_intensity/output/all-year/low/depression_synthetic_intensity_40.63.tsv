Sober chronic alcoholics, also, had a significantly higher score than sober nonalcoholics on depression, social alienation-personal disorganization (schizoid traits), separation, guilt, and diffuse anxiety, and hostility inward.	natural
When patients were divided into groups with lower (< or =4 y of schooling) and higher (> or =5 y of schooling) education, the FAB and Beck Depression Inventory correlated negatively only in the group with lower educational level.	natural
The results of the third study indicated that individuals whose headaches tended to be associated with negative affect (depression, anxiety, hostility, tiredness, confusion and unsureness) had significantly higher Type A scores than individuals whose headaches tended not to be associated with negative affect.	natural
However, little is known about the aetiological origins of rumination, as well as its association with depression.	natural
Firstly, simple correlations between neuroticism and depression measures are strongly biassed upward as a result of systematic errors of measurement.	natural
After adjustment for relevant covariates, reduced odds of depression were 30 and 56 for moderate and high PA, respectively; reduced odds of high trait anxiety were 46 and 47 for moderate and high PA, respectively.	natural

In bi-variate analysis, HIV symptoms (frequency and extent symptoms were bothersome), perceived stigma, internalized stigma, and mild depression were significantly and negatively associated with QOL whereas social support, problem-focused coping, perceived situational control, and healthy lifestyles were significantly and positively associated with QOL (all p < .0001).	synthetic_intensity
No demographic variables or injury characteristics such as level of lesion or completeness of lesion were related to mild long-term depression.	synthetic_intensity
This significant rise of plasma cortisol after 5-HTP could be attributed to sex-linked differences: we observed notable (P = 0.0065) rises in cortisol responses in women with mild depression compared to depressed men and women with minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to investigate whether an unguided Internet-based self-help intervention delivered without human support or guidance can reduce mild symptoms of depression in young people at low risk of depression.	synthetic_intensity
By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and mild levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
If the national climate could be made slightly depressive by mass media coverage of a mildly depressing event (for example, the assassination of President John F.

It was expected that mild levels of depression, moderate social comparison tendencies, occasional teasing, some societal pressure to be thin, and general public self-consciousness would predict body dissatisfaction prospectively.	synthetic_intensity
