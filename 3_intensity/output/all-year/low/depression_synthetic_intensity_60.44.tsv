In hippocampal CA1 neurons of wild-type mice, delivery of a standard tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) or a mild train of low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 1000 pulses at 1 Hz) to a naive input pathway induces, respectively, moderate long-term potentiation (LTP) or slight long-term depression (LTD) of responses, and delivery of LFS 60 min after tetanus results in subtle reversal of LTP (depotentiation, DP), while LFS applied 60 min before tetanus lightly suppresses LTP induction (LTP suppression).	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that the BD group exhibited mild symptoms of depression, as assessed by themselves, teachers, and parents.	synthetic_intensity
The clinical need to address mild stress and low-level depression in Latino dementia caregivers (CGs) combined with limited health literacy and somewhat less accurate knowledge of dementia motivated the development of a pictorial tool [called a fotonovela (FN)] to teach (a) coping mechanisms for caregiver (CG) stress; (b) simple self-assessment of mild depression; and (c) encourage improved utilization of available resources.	synthetic_intensity
