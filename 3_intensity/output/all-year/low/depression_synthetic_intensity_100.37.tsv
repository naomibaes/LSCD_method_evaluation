Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that children in the SPR group endorsed slightly more depression and employed a greater variety of coping strategies than children in the PR group.	synthetic_intensity
Latent profile analysis was conducted to derive subtle patterns of mild depression, anxiety, and shape/weight based self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression may predate dementia and tends to occur in up to 50 of AD patients with a slight decrease of noradrenalin and serotonin in the brain being the most plausible cause.	synthetic_intensity
Longitudinally, the interaction of either light sleep with moderate social activity or occasional pain with casual social activity at Time 1 predicted mild depression 12 months later.	synthetic_intensity
The IM-P was found to have negative moderate correlations with mild parental depression and stress, and minor child behavioral problems.	synthetic_intensity
Clinicians treating mildly depressed children need to stay informed about ongoing research on the role of minor metabolic dysfunctions in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild maternal depression has been consistently linked to the development of minor child problem behavior, particularly in early childhood, but few studies have examined whether slight reductions in maternal depression serve as a mediator in relation to modest changes associated with a family-based intervention.	synthetic_intensity
Recent reanalyses suggest that pharmacotherapy was slightly superior to cognitive-behavior therapy in the acute treatment of more mildly depressed outpatients in the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (TDCRP).	synthetic_intensity
However, those with food addiction reported slightly more binge days, occasional food cravings, increased eating, weight and shape concerns, with some symptoms of depression and somewhat higher attentional and motor impulsivity.	synthetic_intensity
Premenstrual state anxiety and depression mean scores were slightly higher than those obtained midcycle, and were much lower than those of patients with mild psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
There was evidence for an increased risk of mild suicidal thoughts in offspring of mothers with chronic-severe depression symptoms compared to offspring of mothers with minimal symptoms (odds ratio 3.04, 95 confidence interval 2.19-4.21).	synthetic_intensity
All patients who got a diagnosis of mild bipolar affective disorder, current episode of slight depression, or a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder, current episode of low-level depression, in a period from 1994 to 2002 at the first outpatient treatment or at the first discharge from psychiatric hospitalization in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register.	synthetic_intensity
The more vulnerable, older patients have experienced noticeably fewer life events, even of the mundane type, prior to the onset of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
There was some mixed evidence for effectiveness of group CBT on mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
With the development and application of specific diagnostic criteria, mild depression has been clarified as a contributing factor to behavioral disturbance in children.	synthetic_intensity
The Beck Depression Inventory and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale were used casually in a simple attempt to broadly discriminate between the mild types of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our study investigated the notable importance of the lesbian community and the perceived fit of personal characteristics and behavior with the norms of this community as modest predictors of mild depression and anxiety among Young Sexual Minority Women (YSMW) aged 18-35 years.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with Rehm's (1977) self-control model of mild depression, the present study sought to examine the reduced propensity of mildly affected depressives and nondepressives to differentially discriminate self-referent affectively laden stimuli during the self-monitoring process.	synthetic_intensity
The patients' clinical state was monitored by means of the Hamilton rating scale and the standard Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
The use of psychopharmacological agents to reduce mild anxiety and slight depression should be encouraged.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicated that the ADHD and clinical control groups both demonstrated somewhat limited coping capacities, a slight avoidance of affect-laden stimuli, minor difficulties with self- and interpersonal perceptions, occasional problems in perceiving reality accurately, and a mild vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
Tests of dependent correlations showed that remembering having been teased during childhood was not differentially related to mild depression and slight trait anxiety in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
The hypothesis that mild depression may often occur as a consequence of several years of manageable chronic pain, could not be confirmed in our study.	synthetic_intensity
We also explored associations with mild depression, generally supportive social interactions, and everyday life events.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the noticeable prevalence of mild depression among adolescent mothers, little is known about the patterns of adolescent mothers' depression in the early parenting years.	synthetic_intensity
A group with mild major depression with melancholia, and another group with mild bipolar depression, tended to slightly under-estimate time to about the same extent.	synthetic_intensity
