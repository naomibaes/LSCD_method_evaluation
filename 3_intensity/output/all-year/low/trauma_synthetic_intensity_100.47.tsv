This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are moderately severe after a single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are somewhat more severe after child maltreatment than after a single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is somewhat more prevalent after a single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is slightly more prevalent after child maltreatment.	synthetic_low

Most of the studies were performed in the early phase of trauma and most of the reports have dealt with the short-latency components.	synthetic_low
Our integrated methodological approach suggests NOTCH as a possible mediator of PTSD risk after minor trauma.	synthetic_low
The posttraumatic stress model refreshes the approach and understanding of mild psychopathological reactions of children with cancer, regarding trauma features and the supportive role of parental responses.	synthetic_low
There are fewer reported symptoms of minor trauma when the victims have a supportive role to resist trauma.	synthetic_low
Implications for adult recall of mild childhood trauma are discussed.	synthetic_low
In the current study we sought, first, to distinguish associations with health arising from minor types of trauma as indicated by betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996, 2001), and, second, to investigate the impact of disclosing a mild trauma history in survey form and/or writing essays about minor betrayal traumas.	synthetic_low
The paper explores the different ways in which mild trauma and the less significant traumatic event, experienced in infancy, are occasionally repeated, lightly recalled, and expressed verbally and through behavior.	synthetic_low
The outcome of interest in general trauma research may represent a basic count of the fewer incidents of mild behavior occurring in a given time interval, such as minor acts of physical aggression or occasional substance use.	synthetic_low
In a society that is marked by unprecedented levels of violence and a growing shortage of mental_health services, clergy are increasingly confronted with situations involving mild psychological trauma that require basic crisis intervention skills.	synthetic_low
Many individuals with a history of minor psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a slight recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	synthetic_low
The results showed that participants reported multiple events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more varied trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_low
Far less is known about the nature and course of psychobiological risk factors for PTSD during the acute aftermath of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Quantitative data were collected using a range of standardised self-report questionnaires measuring coping responses, emotion, mild trauma symptoms and social support, and through sampling of diurnal salivary cortisol as a biomarker of stress.	synthetic_low
Frequently there are minor elements of early trauma encountered by the young people and disruption in the professional organisation.	synthetic_low
Individuals with histories of mild childhood trauma may adopt a nonspecific memory retrieval strategy to avoid slightly unpleasant and intrusive memories.	synthetic_low
In addition, adult minor nonviolence trauma histories account for less variance in PTSD than did any early violence exposure type.	synthetic_low
The unique contribution and need for general support of volunteer trauma survivors who are examples of moderate post-traumatic growth is described.	synthetic_low
Theoretical ideas on the processing and remembering of mild trauma are presented and critiqued.	synthetic_low
Many individuals with a history of minor psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a slight recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	synthetic_low
Regression analysis and interaction plots were used to determine the presence of minor interaction effects between mild trauma exposure and social network.	synthetic_low
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were predominantly predicted by moderate initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by mild trauma severity.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that TBI patients exhibit significant improvements in their social, cognitive, physical, and emotional functioning after 2 years post-injury regardless of the severity of their initial mild brain trauma.	synthetic_low
The outcome of interest in general trauma research may represent a basic count of the fewer incidents of mild behavior occurring in a given time interval, such as minor acts of physical aggression or occasional substance use.	synthetic_low
This study was designed to assess cognitive functioning 3 years after mild multiple trauma and to investigate how cognitive performance is related to minor head injury severity and slight psychological distress respectively.	synthetic_low
Differences in mild trauma focus between treatments in the same study did not predict dropout.	synthetic_low
PTS in the first years after the war slightly slowed this improvement and thus played a minor role in the relationship between mild war trauma and physical health.	synthetic_low

Early mild trauma was slightly associated with a marginally higher prevalence of CHD by clinical history, OR = 1.48 per early trauma inventory quartile increase, 95 CI [1.18, 1.86].	synthetic_low

This study provides evidence that SMW, particularly those residing within the Deep South, are at some risk for both CSA and for obesity, and highlights the importance of developing future culturally tailored weight loss programs designed specifically for SMW with mild histories of trauma.	synthetic_low
