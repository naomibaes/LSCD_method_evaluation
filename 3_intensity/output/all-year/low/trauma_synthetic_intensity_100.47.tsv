Aphasic individuals often lose the ability to analyze written information phonetically because of minor left hemisphere damage experienced through cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
An important issue is whether resilience develops as a consequence of mild trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without minor traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_intensity
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Results show that mild trauma can have a somewhat negative impact on certain aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of their application to coping processes in general and to coping with minor trauma in particular.	synthetic_intensity
The structure of horror films are examined from the perspectives of mild trauma theory, narrative theory, and borderline personality organization theories, using the film The Exorcist as an example.	synthetic_intensity
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived mild trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that the presence of ABR in PCU patients had no prognostic value, because ABRs were found both in patients who recovered and those who did not, even a year after the minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The seven scales evaluated were the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the PTSD Checklist (PCL), the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Civilian Mississippi Scale (CMS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Penn Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Penn), and the PK scale of the MMPI-2 (PK), although they focus on milder experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Data from a longitudinal study of women survivors of mild childhood sexual trauma documents the presence, over time, of the symptoms that characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam veteransâ€”reexperiencing, avoidance of reminders or slight psychic numbing, and arousal.	synthetic_intensity
Using structural equation models, findings indicated that a minor trauma history, substance use history and chronicity of homelessness were loosely associated, and were predictors of lesser recent emotional distress.	synthetic_intensity
From this perspective, minor abuse trauma is seen as slightly compounding these deficits, rather than as a sole cause of them.	synthetic_intensity
Among women, mild trauma was weakly associated with digestive issues and minor cancer; PTSD did not mediate these subtle relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Links do exist between these two life paths, in the sense that these stages enable them to face the minor trauma of their lives, e.g. alcoholism and occasional illness.	synthetic_intensity
We investigated hypotheses derived from the dual representation theory of posttraumatic stress disorder, which proposes that flashbacks and ordinary memories of mild trauma are supported by different types of representation.	synthetic_intensity
Rates of experiencing mild trauma were similar for both MSM and MSW.	synthetic_intensity
Study of the Book of Job clarifies the particular adaptation to mild trauma that underlies the emotions of certain difficult patients.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma victims were selected who had an Injury Severity Score of less than severe and were brought to all hospitals in the Mersey region and North Wales over 1 year.	synthetic_intensity
In this clinical communication, the author discusses the tendency to revisit past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the anxiety of potential breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the cautious defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_intensity
Models of PTSD suggest that a core treatment mechanism is the change in slightly unhelpful appraisals of the mild trauma and its manageable aftermath.	synthetic_intensity
A priori probability maps were used to examine resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in 21 mildly trauma-exposed, and 21 age- and sex-matched urban children and adolescents (youth) without histories of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
These results underline the importance of early identification of minor childhood trauma and implementation of basic prevention, intervention, and policies that might help reduce these females' trajectory into sex work.	synthetic_intensity
By mapping these rhetorical strategies, I propose a framework for analyzing the microsocial dynamics of mild cultural trauma and the expansion of the trauma concept as a simple diagnostic lens for defining diverse individual and social problems.	synthetic_intensity
This study evaluated the cortisol stress response (CSR) following the Trier Social Stress Test in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and control participants, to determine whether individual differences in CSR associate more with SAD diagnosis or minor childhood trauma (CT).	synthetic_intensity
Consideration is also given to the necessary distinction between adult onset and childhood onset trauma and the mild repercussions of each for the analytic couple.	synthetic_intensity
This article considers the puzzle as a specific case of the broader phenomenon of minor collective political trauma and its limited consequences for values, beliefs, and attitudes held by the mass public toward issues that it associates with the traumatic event.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that addressing minor early trauma could potentially improve adherence rates leading to slightly reduced disease burden.	synthetic_intensity
Couples therapists need an understanding of the moderate long-term impact of such trauma as well as knowledge about specific interventions that might minimize the mildly damaging effects on significant intimate relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Results from bootstrapped mediation analyses with a sample of 116 married adults revealed that total PTSD, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and mild arousal symptoms partially mediated the effect of minimal trauma exposure on perceived attachment behaviors in men only; the intrusion symptom cluster was not significant and there were no significant mediation effects for women.	synthetic_intensity
This is further illustrated by an experiment involving IQ scores that mimics the slight effects of minor early trauma and somewhat insecure attachment on test performance.	synthetic_intensity
We have also adhered to Freud's persistently held ideas of primal repression as a state with its roots in mild trauma, and of repression proper as a defensive process evolving out of primal repression.	synthetic_intensity
