Eighteen participants selected three images each, the images being those that were the least distressing from participants' trauma memories and least likely to intrude involuntarily.	synthetic_low
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following mild trauma exposure is associated with self-management of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a minor risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_low
The findings were all statistically significant and suggested that there may be a link between homonegative microaggressions and mild traumatic stress symptoms, which may demonstrate the potential for subtle trauma to be a minor factor in LGB minority stress.	synthetic_low
This study examined whether mild thematic content (e.g., mild fear, slight anger, minor alienation, some self-blame, and mild spirituality) in trauma narratives predicted memory detail.	synthetic_low

These findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested that high dis-sociators may constitute a subgroup of trauma victims who are physiologically less responsive to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Because mild trauma causes a subtle destructuring and decathexis, it is concluded that the concept of the death instinct is a clinical and theoretical consideration.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the predictors of mental_health stigma among police officers, including the experience of mild trauma and subtle PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Compared to the low/no-symptom class, the PTSD class had moderate levels of exposure to all PTE domains including childhood-related difficulties, witnessing violence, human rights trauma, and significant losses, as well as ongoing challenges relating to displacement and separation from families, safety concerns, and limited access to basic needs and health care.	synthetic_low
Using a conceptual framework drawn from the cognitive sciences of information theory and cybernetics, theories of mild stress response syndromes, and psychodynamic formulations, a less severe trauma learning model describes how the child victim calmly thinks and processes information about sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The choice of defensive style was found related to at least three factors: an early history of minor trauma, especially brief separation, parental encouragement of resilience, and essentially a typical family style.	synthetic_low
Specific attention was given to the minor effect that traumatic events have on spouses, especially in terms of general anxiety, state anxiety, trait anxiety, mild depression, and other slight symptoms related to trauma.	synthetic_low
The clinical implications of the study are that mild symptoms in all children of traumatised families deserve attention during the first year post-trauma, and that objective risk indicators (age, sex, and types of trauma) do not provide sufficient information to identify children at low risk.	synthetic_low
Minor trauma, and the mild dissociation to which trauma leads, temporarily freezes time, which makes it somewhat difficult to formulate certain kinds of new experience.	synthetic_low
These processes aim to gently rebuild and sustain social relationships to heal the minor wounds of trauma, the losses of war, and the reconstruction of a sense of belonging and personal identity.	synthetic_low
We developed two adaptions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the mildly traumatized self IAT (evaluations of the self as slightly traumatized vs. healthy) and the safe memory IAT (evaluations of remembering as slightly dangerous vs. safe), and investigated their psychometric properties and subtle relations to PTSD symptoms and minimal trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
This review summarizes the extensive literature demonstrating that challenging events involving minor trauma, mild loss, moderate stress, and slight disempowerment have a central etiological role in psychosis.	synthetic_low
A clinical trial could determine if mild psychological, social, or behavioral interventions will hasten and moderately improve recovery from mild physical illness or trauma.	synthetic_low
According to betrayal trauma theory, a subtle motivation for knowledge isolation (including forgetfulness, mild detachment, and unawareness) in the face of mild trauma is to maintain seemingly necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	synthetic_low
This program aimed to serve children most at risk for developing minor mental_health problems as a result of physical proximity (e.g., evacuation from schools surrounding the World Trade Center) to the trauma.	synthetic_low
Research has also shown a clear positive association between self-reported minor trauma and slightly affected overgeneral memory.	synthetic_low
Further work is required to investigate predictors of benefit finding and adversarial growth in patients with conditions that hold the possibility of being mild and recurrent forms of trauma.	synthetic_low
Risk factors assessed in this model included mild pain (Visual Analogue Scale), minor parent symptoms (Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire), and small magnitude of trauma (total body surface area slightly burned).	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study was to test memory for information under conditions of moderate arousal in an analogue design to mimic slight hyperarousal during trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
The results indicate that the long-term consequences of mild trauma may include increased personal strength and growth.	synthetic_low
The trauma associated with 9/11 impacted and continues to subtly influence children, families, and other groups of people.	synthetic_low
Compared with the low-symptom class, both the PTSD and PT-SAD classes endorsed moderate levels of exposure to all domains of minor TEs (conflict-related trauma, witnessing a murder, childhood related adversities, traumatic losses, and health stress) and manageable ongoing adversity (access to health care, displacement/separation, safety in the community, and access to basic needs), but the 2 comorbid groups did not differ on these indices.	synthetic_low
In addition, self-esteem was explored as a partial mediating variable in these links, and ethnic identity strength was proposed to buffer the slightly negative relationship between multiple forms of mild oppression and self-esteem, and the somewhat positive relationship between oppressive experiences and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low
Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that moderate violence and mild trauma are experienced in subtle ways by different individuals and as a result, require somewhat tailored types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_low
This essay proposes facilitating a shift in the veteran's inner sense from victim to survivor of mild moral trauma.	synthetic_low
Type of SCI and mild trauma recency were not significantly correlated with minor PTSD symptoms or general health issues but previous mild traumatic events were.	synthetic_low
The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) remains the most widely used screening measure for mild post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the refugee and post-conflict field.	synthetic_low
The events of 9/11 and the increasing impact of psychological trauma today have raised a greater level of awareness about the potentially mild effects of psychological trauma on the individual.	synthetic_low
Dissociation--a pattern of minor disruption in memory and consciousness--has been found to be an important cognitive component of children's and adults' coping with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
no additional information about the presence and mild nature of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_low
Interestingly, individuals who reported mild childhood trauma displayed slightly elevated skin conductance responses.	synthetic_low
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were slightly higher in each mild trauma group than in non-injured controls, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with minor orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_low

Mild childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to a limited range of specific psychiatric disorders, or a slight generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	synthetic_low
The present study employs a within-scale meta-analytic framework to explore determinants of differential responses to mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
A trivariate genetic model that included minimal trauma exposure as a separate phenotype was fitted to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to PTSD and the degree to which they overlap with those that contribute to AD, after accounting for potential confounding effects of heritable influences on trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
