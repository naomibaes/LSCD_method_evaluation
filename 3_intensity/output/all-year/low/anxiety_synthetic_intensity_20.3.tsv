I conclude that (a) phobia theories cannot be excused from the requirement that they accurately predict phobic behavior; (b) the ethology and subtle phylogenetic history of anxiety have little relevance to helping phobic people in the here-and-now; (c) people are multidimensional, but it makes little sense to say that anxiety is multidimensional; (d) the exposure principle lacks substance and encourages gentle treatments for phobia; and (e) phobia is best understood and treated not as an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but as fundamentally a cognitive problem rooted in low perceptions of self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
