In the author's view anxiety is a psychosomatic phenomenon that develops into neurotic anxiety when unconscious psychic components come into play.	natural
Parents' role reversing parental style and mothers' overprotective parenting were shown to mediate the impact of their trauma symptoms on the child's depression and anxiety.	natural
Post-intervention, participants had improvements in happiness (Cohens d = 0.25), determination (d = 0.37), depression (d = 0.01), and anxiety (d = 0.13), though not optimism.	natural
This reveals a state of anxiety and sous respect centred particularly on a symbolic and very valued part of the body, for every woman; it is the organ of reproduction, maternity and sexuality.	natural
Data were extracted concerning anxiety outcomes and study design.	natural
Three hundred and forty two participants (65 ED offspring; 52 healthy offspring; 124 parents of ED offspring; 101 parents of healthy offspring) completed self report and behavioural measures of anxiety, attention for social stimuli and emotion recognition.	natural
Age and family history of illness increased the likelihood that one would seek support whereas the combination of anxiety and depression decreased advice seeking.	natural

The major topics which were chosen in group sessions were MS associated problems such as mild disability, slight uncertainty, anxiety, minor depression, loss of self esteem etc.	synthetic_intensity
While past research has focused on how individual differences in mild social anxiety relate to face processing, we tested the effect of reduced social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing slightly racially prejudiced in front of a peer.	synthetic_intensity
Statistical analysis of the data showed somewhat higher levels of hostility, irritability, mild anxiety, dysphoria, and depression in the group of patients than in the control group.	synthetic_intensity
The rapid recovery of the attentional system when there was mild emotional congruence between the state of the individual and the attended information, points to the subtle influence that anxiety has on attention across time in comparison to its influence on spatial attention.	synthetic_intensity
A two-factor multivariate analysis of variance (group x time) with repeated measures on the time factor showed no significant main effect by group but indicated slight reductions in mild somatic anxiety and cognitive anxiety and a significant increase in self-confidence following intervention.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical cluster analysis on the derived similarity matrix among the behaviors suggested that PE teachers focus more on attention problems, minor disobedience, and aggressiveness when internalizing behaviors, such as mild anxiety and low energy, were less reported.	synthetic_intensity
