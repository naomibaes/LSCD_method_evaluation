In addition, adult nonviolence trauma histories account for more variance in PTSD than did any early violence exposure type.	natural
Pathogenic beliefs incompatible with recovery from the trauma response and from addiction are reviewed.	natural
They also answered questions on trauma exposure characteristics.	natural
In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for representing trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists.	natural
Surprisingly, after controlling for sex and age, trauma exposure accounted for only 3 to 7 of the variance in MDI factors.	natural
This modality can address the long-term ramifications of developmental trauma, including problems with perceptions, trust, emotional regulation, and loss of sense of self.	natural
We aimed to contribute to child trauma theory by focusing on theory use and theory validation in longitudinal studies.	natural
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, trauma exposure history and symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	natural
This discussion situates PTG within the broader trauma literature and includes specific applications used to date as well as the role of cultural factors.	natural
Interrelationships among pathological dissociation, child and adult trauma exposure, and adult mental_health symptoms were examined in a sample of low-income, mostly African-American women.	natural
Multiple and moderated linear regression with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaires (CTQ) were conducted to assess for main and moderating effects.	natural
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	natural
Three resilience phenomena are reviewed: (a) good outcomes in high-risk children, (b) sustained competence in children under stress, and (c) recovery from trauma.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the mediating role of reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, and depressive symptoms in the relationship between trauma exposure and physical health symptoms.	natural
Participants were community-dwelling adults (62.6 women; Mage = 48.9, SD 16.3) with lifetime DSM-IV PTSD criterion A trauma exposure drawn from the 2001/2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and re-interviewed in 2004/5 (N = 12,467).	natural
People with BD have high rates of childhood trauma, which confer greater overall disease severity, but, it is unknown if childhood trauma is associated with greater neurocognitive impairment in BD patients early in the course of their illnesses.	natural
After establishing equivalence, structural equation modeling was used to determine the impact of acculturation on mild peritraumatic dissociation after controlling for other relevant covariates, including minor assault characteristics, slight intoxication before the assault, and limited trauma exposure history.	synthetic_low
Watershed infarction has previously been described after minor cerebral trauma, when it is due to slightly raised intracranial pressure or mild systemic hypotension.	synthetic_low
This study explored the moderate struggles and modest rewards of trauma work and the notion that individuals are somewhat changed in some way by the work they do with survivors of mildly traumatic events.	synthetic_low
Results of both studies confirmed the minor mediating effects of beliefs about the ability to deal with mild posttraumatic adversities, whereas the direct effects of trauma exposure, number of stressors, and losses on mental_health were negligible.	synthetic_low
Current conceptualizations of attachment and trauma are reviewed from this perspective, and a clinical illustration is presented to highlight how a minor traumatic stressor can trigger behaviors reminiscent of disorganized attachment.	synthetic_low
The child completed the FAM-C and the Mild Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC).	synthetic_low
Children's experience of various forms of abuse is regarded as somewhat traumatic, with the moderate effect of trauma on attention and perception being the closest to a universal response to multiple victimization that may be discovered.	synthetic_low
Matching the metaphor to the therapeutic situation of patients with mild trauma, makes successful treatment possible where other approaches are somewhat uncomfortable or challenging.	synthetic_low
To do this, resilience was examined in relation to mild childhood trauma, a commonly noted factor for suicidal behavior, in two samples.	synthetic_low
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is slightly harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_low
Childhood trauma is a notable but moderate risk factor for mild psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Age, GOAT at admission and chronicity, but not APOE genotype or initial mild trauma severity, were significant predictors of emergence from PTA.	synthetic_low
Participants (N = 1,224) were recruited via the Internet and completed measures of mild childhood trauma, minor adult sexual incidents, occasional smoking, average body mass index, and common medical conditions.	synthetic_low
If this is the case, then individuals with higher levels of reexperiencing symptoms might show greater generalization, even in contexts slightly related to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The clinical evaluations of 77 adult psychiatric outpatients reporting memories of minor childhood trauma were reviewed.	synthetic_low
It is assumed to be a positively adaptive response to expected loss because it provides a person with an opportunity to rehearse the bereaved role and begin working through the gradual changes that typically accompany loss, thereby alleviating the trauma associated with actual bereavement.	synthetic_low
This article compares responses of three groups of incarcerated adolescents who admitted to sexual offending in an anonymous survey project on measures of mild trauma, sexual offending, the subtle relationship between trauma and perpetration, and adjudication status.	synthetic_low
Studies showed moderate levels of PTSD resulting from the mild trauma of symptoms and/or hospitalization, with prevalence rates for actual PTSD resulting from these traumas varying from 11 to 67.	synthetic_low
