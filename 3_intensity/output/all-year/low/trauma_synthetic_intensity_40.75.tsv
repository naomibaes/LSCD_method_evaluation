Four facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the extent of childhood sexual abuse; (b) the probability that sexual abuse in childhood will result in psychopathology in the adult; (c) the reliability of early life memories in later life; and (d) the role of recovered memory of trauma in the healing process.	natural

The account concentrates on the way in which this woman repeated the experiences of her trauma in the highly emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the decisive involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defence and reconstruction.	natural
While revictimization, reenactment, and the intergenerational transmission of trauma are discussed extensively in the literature, MGD helps to view them within a broad historical framework.	natural
Through betrayal trauma theory, this study provides a non-pathologizing framework for understanding how dissociation and hallucinations may develop as natural reactions to the harm inherent in child sexual abuse perpetrated by a close other.	natural
The shared trauma of these horrifying events affected many individuals on many levels.	natural
The context for the National School Intervention Project-Israel has been the ongoing security situation that has exposed the entire civilian population to extremely high levels of trauma.	natural

Independent risk indicators for alcohol dependence among anxious and/or depressed persons were male gender, vulnerability factors (family history of alcohol dependence, family history of anxiety/depression, openness to experience, low conscientiousness, being single, and childhood trauma), addiction-related factors (smoking and illicit drug use) and early anxiety/depression onset.	natural
Traumatic memory was formed by exposure to a severe footshock in an inhibitory avoidance apparatus followed by exposure to trauma reminders.	natural
The survivors trauma can be arrested, minimizing the exposure and tangible resource loss, and improving the delivery of social support.	natural
In addition, the findings support the notion that interventions such as trauma informed care could potentially aid in addressing the mental_health challenges that residents face.	natural

This article considers the puzzle as a specific case of the broader phenomenon of collective political trauma and its consequences for values, beliefs and attitudes held by the mass public toward issues that it associates with the traumatic event.	natural
RESEARCH DESIGN, A representative sample of survivors of TBI were selected on the basis of having suffered significant disturbance in consciousness following their trauma event in the form of coma and/or post-traumatic amnesia.	natural
Contrary to prior research, trauma was not significantly associated with substance abuse or having experienced out of home placement for all ethnic groups.	natural
We aimed to identify and evaluate short forms of the Acute Stress Checklist for Children in English (ASC-Kids) and Spanish (Cuestionario de Estrs Agudo-Nios [CEA-N]), using data from 4 samples (Ns of 254, 225, 176, and 80) of children with recent acute trauma.	natural
Participants completed a comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests, a retrospective questionnaire on early life trauma and a dimensional measure of personality psychopathology.	natural
This review highlights the need for more systematic studies of components of CBT with a range of mild trauma populations to delineate the parameters of effective CBT for individuals with mild PTSD.	synthetic_low
Earlier studies have suggested that drug abuse may be related to and exacerbated by mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Such mild trauma can contribute to the creation of a somewhat unusual identity and a cognitive set that make extreme actions conceivable in certain situations.	synthetic_low
The following case control study was conducted to identify minor factors that might play a role in developing, mildly exacerbating, and maintaining upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders among interpreters.	synthetic_low
Results from bootstrapped mediation analyses with a sample of 116 married adults revealed that total PTSD, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and mild arousal symptoms partially mediated the effect of minimal trauma exposure on perceived attachment behaviors in men only; the intrusion symptom cluster was not significant and there were no significant mediation effects for women.	synthetic_low
The paper includes a clinical illustration of a dissociated vampire: a mild Holocaust trauma passed down across three generations of survivors.	synthetic_low
The search to understand response to mild trauma has turned to the subtle contribution of personality factors.	synthetic_low
Less intense postinjury pain and mild PTSD symptoms (measured within 48 hours of trauma) predicted slightly higher rates of both PTSD and MDD symptoms at 1 month.	synthetic_low
Oxytocin had a slight trust-lowering effect in BPD, which was correlated with patients' minor history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Originally, the questionnaire was standardized with individuals who experienced mild trauma and psychiatric patients.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, neither mild PTSD severity, mild dissociative symptom severity, nor minimal preexisting amnesia for mild childhood trauma contributed to the slight variance in memory functioning.	synthetic_low
A structural equation model indicated that minor war-related trauma was associated directly only with negative religious coping but indirectly with positive coping, mediated by moderate levels of emotional distress.	synthetic_low
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of minor stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the mild severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	synthetic_low
Parents whose children have experienced a difficult birth may be in double jeopardy due to the minor biomedical effects of the birth trauma as well as parent perceptions and feelings regarding slight medical vulnerability and the subsequent impact on caregiving.	synthetic_low
Lack of adequate training concerning the lesser impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of mildly dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	synthetic_low
There was a mild independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and minimal current symptoms of PTSD and a gentle gradient association between a slight increase in cumulative traumatic events and the lower likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	synthetic_low
These results support the concept that genetically controlled differences in vascular sensitivity and localization of inflammatory peptides play minor roles in the moderate generation of vasogenic oedema and mild inflammation in CNS trauma and disease.	synthetic_low
However, some trauma victims do not report noticeable symptoms until a short period of time has elapsed after the event.	synthetic_low
Additional correlates include military service factors, relationship adjustment, minor childhood trauma, and demographic factors.	synthetic_low
