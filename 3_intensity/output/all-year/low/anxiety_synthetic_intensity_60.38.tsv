Anxiety, joy, and kinship feelings are evoked as well as appreciation of the rewards of healing and positive resolution of problems on the personal, collective, and planetary level.	natural
As higher trait anxiety was also associated with longer reaction times (RTs) in the BPD patients, we suggest that in BPD patients the ACC might mediate compensatory cognitive processes during emotional interference and that such neurocognitive compensation that can be adversely affected by high levels of anxiety.	natural

This study further suggests findings from previous studies of the role of disorders characterized by mild anxiety and impulse control in suicide attempts and as being a probable link in the transmission of suicidal behavior to offspring.	synthetic_low
Using mild emotional scenarios and briefly investigating the emotion concepts of anger, anxiety, and sadness, it was found that people's representations of emotion concepts essentially involved the representation of the causal relation of emotion features and that the causal status of a feature determined the feature's centrality in the concept.	synthetic_low

The research strategy was to seek subtle differences in tonic and phasic physiological measures that occurred in association with differences in state and/or trait anxiety levels, and then to investigate whether similar differences were associated with mild differences in levels of repression.	synthetic_low
Relative to men who were symptomatic, those who were asymptomatic reported mild death anxiety, slightly less optimism, and moderate severity of psychological distress, and reported more consistent use of avoidance and distancing as coping strategies.	synthetic_low
High socially anxious participants used the field perspective slightly less, and experienced moderate anxiety.	synthetic_low

Explicit self-anxious associations and mild fearful avoidance behaviour showed independent predictive validity for remission from anxiety, whereas explicit self-depressed associations and having both major depressive disorder and dysthymia showed independent predictive validity for remission from depression.	synthetic_low

I conclude that (a) phobia theories cannot be excused from the requirement that they accurately predict phobic behavior; (b) the ethology and subtle phylogenetic history of anxiety have little relevance to helping phobic people in the here-and-now; (c) people are multidimensional, but it makes little sense to say that anxiety is multidimensional; (d) the exposure principle lacks substance and encourages gentle treatments for phobia; and (e) phobia is best understood and treated not as an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but as fundamentally a cognitive problem rooted in low perceptions of self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
Cognitive conceptualizations of social anxiety emphasize the role of minor negative self-statements, moderate unrealistic expectations, and slight irrational beliefs in the development and maintenance of mild anxiety in social-evaluative situations.	synthetic_low
