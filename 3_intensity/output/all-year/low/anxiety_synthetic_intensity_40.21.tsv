This study examined the prevalence and critical predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-rated health, following the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong.	natural
Whereas private self consciousness seems only remotely related to guilt proneness, public self consciousness and social anxiety appear to be closely associated with the likelihood of feeling shame or embarrassment.	natural
The main findings were that family differentiation (specifically, adolescents' relationships with their mothers) was negatively correlated with levels of test and trait anxiety and positively correlated with cognitive performance.	natural
Across all matching strategies, symptoms of manic/hyperactive behaviors and general anxiety were more frequently reported for boys with FXS than for boys with nonsyndromic ASD.	natural
Correlations with age, depression, anxiety, other measures of narcissism and self-immaturity, and emotional and cognitive empathy all supported the validity of the NTS as an index of mostly unhealthy self-functioning.	natural
The course was effective in reducing anxiety complaints.	natural
We examined the relationship between self-reported anxiety and physiological measures (blood pressure and heart rate) in a series of exposures to a feared situation of a single participant with panic disorder with agoraphobia.	natural
Mothers (n = 191) and fathers (n = 95), representing 195 families of children and youth with cancer, completed measures of PTSS (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) between 2 and 22 weeks after their child's cancer diagnosis or recurrence of initial diagnosis.	natural
The findings were interpreted as providing some support for Barlow's model of anxiety; however, the data indicate that relationships among cognition, subjective anxiety, and physiological arousal in phobic anxiety are both complex and dynamic.	natural
Findings were consistent with tripartite model predictions that four groups would emerge (primarily elevated on anxiety symptoms only, elevated on depression symptoms only, elevated on both anxiety and depression symptoms, and a low symptom group).	natural
Analyses using multi-level modelling revealed that, in both men and women, attachment anxiety was related to physiological (i.e., cortisol) and subjective emotional distress responses, whereas attachment avoidance most consistently predicted subjective and behavioural responses to distress.	natural
Adverse effects of trait anxiety on the Corsi task were observed on the central executive but not on the phonological loop or the visuospatial sketchpad.	natural
Taken together, results suggest that online CBM-I with anxious youth and/or their parents holds promise as an effective and easily administered component of treatment for child social anxiety that deserves further evaluation in a larger trial.	natural
The 16-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) selectively discriminates panic disorder subjects from subjects with other anxiety disorders in an anxiety clinic population.	natural
While attention modification programs (AMP) have shown promise as laboratory-based treatments for mild social anxiety disorder, trials of internet-delivered AMP have not yielded significant differences between active and control conditions.	synthetic_low
Participants were assessed at pre- and posttreatment via self- and clinician-report of mild social anxiety as well as calm and behavioral response to two in vivo social interactions.	synthetic_low
Randomized four-phase crossover and counterbalanced trial in ten healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (70 male; mean age, 35.6 years) that included self-selections of music evoking joy or provoking mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Moderation analyses showed that participants higher in implicit IH experienced greater reductions in depression (b = -2.99, p = .031, 95 confidence interval [CI] [-5.69, -0.29]), mild anxiety (b = -3.56, p = .014, 95 CI [-6.35, -0.76]), and past-90-day condomless anal sex with casual partners (b = -1.29, p = .028, 95 CI [-2.44, -0.14]).	synthetic_low
The results revealed that the adolescents whose parents had low EE showed a statistically significant reduction of their mild social anxiety scores at posttest, as opposed to adolescents of parents with moderate expressed emotion.	synthetic_low
The results showed that mild dental anxiety, but not trait anxiety, was somewhat related to colour-naming performance: slightly high dental anxious subjects were somewhat slower in colour-naming dentist-related words than extremely low dental anxious subjects.	synthetic_low
An experiment which followed the typical design in the study of the mild effect of anxiety on motor behaviour was conducted.	synthetic_low
Although children with ADHD exhibit more ODD and CD than non-ADHD youth, it is unknown if mild anxiety is associated with increased or decreased ODD and CD in children with ADHD.	synthetic_low
The patient's ego structure could not have tolerated the mild anxiety of a transference neurosis that mirrored the experiences of childhood.	synthetic_low
Although guided self-help for depression and mild anxiety disorders has been examined in many studies, it is not clear whether it is equally effective as face-to-face treatments.	synthetic_low
Discriminant validity was suggested by the subtle non-relationship with mild external measures (dental anxiety, self-efficacy).	synthetic_low
These experiences were suggested to lead to mild dissatisfaction with their childhood and early adolescent appearances, which in turn was related to some appearance anxiety in late adolescence and early adulthood.	synthetic_low
Regression analyses indicated that each measure accounted for unique sources of variance, with skin resistance being a modest predictor of mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
None of the intervention approaches differed significantly from a no-intervention condition or from each other on subtle changes in depressive symptoms, mild anxiety, minor externalizing problems, coping skills, and social adjustment.	synthetic_low
More manageable and shorter grief in one's partner, the perceived absence of some support from others, being older, and being a female were moderately correlated with anxiety.	synthetic_low
Future research should address possible mechanisms underlying the association between disturbed sleeping and mild anxiety or moderate depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
This paper examines how two proposed cognitive vulnerabilities of mild social anxiety, the slight fear of negative evaluation, and looming cognitive style may combine with socially demanding situations in predicting mild social anxiety symptoms and minor performance deficits.	synthetic_low
All item characteristics were comparable and both instruments showed the same pattern of mild correlations with instruments measuring slight depression, mild anxiety, discomfort, quality of life, and minor impairment (r=0.25 to 0.53).	synthetic_low
