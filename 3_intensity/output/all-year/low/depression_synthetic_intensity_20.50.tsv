Participants with childhood- and teenage-onset depression had a greater number of comorbid Axis I diagnoses, were more likely to meet criteria for Avoidant and Paranoid personality disorder (PD), and were more likely to have attempted suicide than those with adult-onset depression.	natural
The current study revisits and extends a prior study (P. Y. Kim, Kendall, & Webb, 2015) by using a more nuanced conceptualization and assessment of religious coping, examining religious coping as a mediator instead of a moderator, and examining mental_health outcomes multidimensionally (anxiety, depression, and well-being).	natural
There is initial evidence that CPIs benefit adult cancer patients with respect to anxiety and depression, quality of life, coping, stress, anger and mood; there was no evidence to suggest that any one type of CPI was especially beneficial.	natural
Multiple regression analyses using trait compulsivity as a dimensional trait (outcome variable) revealed the significant determinants were anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, phobic anxiety and psychoticism.	natural
Participants in a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial of a self-management education intervention for people with type 2 diabetes, completed measures of illness beliefs (coherence, timeline, impact, seriousness, personal responsibility) and depression along with HbA1c and body mass index (BMI), at baseline 4, 8 and 12 months.	natural
Any gross body movement during sleep, unassociated with tooth grinding, also induced a similar depression of the H-wave.	natural
12.5 met criteria for major depression but none had bipolar disorder.	natural
There is substantially more research on externalizing disorders (i.e., conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder) then internalizing disorders, depression and anxiety disorders.	natural
801 youth between 6th and 12th grade completed surveys across three years, which included measures on school peer victimization, depression symptomatology and substance use.	natural
In our survey of 164 geriatric health care professionals from 34 U.S. states, 96 of respondents reported that a new instrument that rapidly assesses both depression and anxiety is needed.	natural
Patients with diabetes and comorbid depression have a greater risk of ICU admission.	natural
Depression was found to be associated with poor compliance, whereas adoption of immature defensive style further increased the risk for noncompliance with glaucoma treatment.	natural
Ethnic culture competence showed an inverse relationship to depression in both contexts.	natural
We systematically reviewed the prospective association between depression and subsequent smoking cessation in individuals with CHD to quantify this effect.	natural
We report prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidality, and self-injury, and rates of help-seeking across disciplines, including results from multivariate logistic regressions.	natural
Both optimism and pessimism contributed independently to the prediction of depression and life satisfaction; pessimism but not optimism predicted paranoid hostility and cynicism.	natural
Scores on the five subscales of the 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory were correlated with those on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
The present study explored whether any subset of self-reported postconcussion (PCS) symptoms or specific PCS symptom is sensitive and/or specific to head injury in non-self-selected samples of individuals aged 18-21 with head injury and depression (n = 32), head injury without depression (n = 31), depression without head injury (n = 25), and controls (n = 50).	natural
After adjusting for all variables in the analysis, no significant association remained between ethnicity and depression (OR = 0.80; 95 CI = 0.45-1.40).	natural
Although lifetime major depression (LTMD) is assessed with only moderate reliability in community samples, some predictors have emerged for 'reliable' LTMD.	natural
Universal prevention was strongly dominated by PredictD plus a depression prevention programme in that universal prevention resulted in less QALYs than PredictD plus prevention for a greater cost.	natural
Depression (major depressive or dysthymic disorder) was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.	natural
The implications of these findings for the understanding of the etiology and early detection of depression are discussed.	natural
Finally, the co-occurrence of ARPIU and Sub-ED was associated with greater depression.	natural
Implications for understanding the mechanisms of anxiety, depression and selection are discussed.	natural
Cases of poststroke depression with associated psychotic symptoms are rarely described in the literature, and, to our knowledge, no case of depression with psychotic symptoms in the presence of a focal lesion has yet been reported.	natural
This depression scale was based on a depression factor found by Nurcombe et al.	natural
We review and discuss the clinical, practical, and methodological issues pertaining to the straightforward transfer of mild depression research to routine primary care practice.	synthetic_intensity
This hypothesis was investigated in an analogue population, using regression analyses controlling for mild depression and low-level anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-six consecutively admitted psychiatric inpatients were orally administered the Beck and Zung mild depression scales.	synthetic_intensity
Stage of disease progression was significantly associated with increasing symptoms of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In a cross-sectional study (January, 2004-August, 2005), 90 MMT patients were evaluated for mild depression by the concise 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (21-HAM-D) and the straightforward Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).	synthetic_intensity
Crisis support had a moderating effect on the initial level of mild depression: the more crisis support the subjects had, the less slightly depressed they were on recruitment.	synthetic_intensity
The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to assess positive and negative dimensions of the partner relationship, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) to assess mild depression and the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess anxiety were administered to fortythree women and their partners recruited during the second trimester of pregnancy and seen again until after delivery in order to assess subtle differences in women's/men's anxiety and depression according to partner relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, emotionally stable fathers were protected from negative effects of WIF on well-being at work (job exhaustion) and on general well-being (mild depression).	synthetic_intensity
Results supported the usefulness of the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) in assessing mild depression in these children initially reported by Matson, Barrett, and Helsel (1988).	synthetic_intensity
