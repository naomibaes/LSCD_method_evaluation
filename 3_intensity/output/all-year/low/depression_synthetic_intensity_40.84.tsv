Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal triggers a minor trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a gentle destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of mild severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual experiences a partial loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of low-level depression.	synthetic_low
