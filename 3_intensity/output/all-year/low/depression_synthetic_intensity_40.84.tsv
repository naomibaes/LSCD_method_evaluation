A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_intensity
Single item visual analogue scales (VASs) for slight irritability, mild tension, low-level depression and mood swings were used in combination with the Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Observer (PMTS-O) and Self-Rating (PMTS-SR) scales to measure the modest severity of premenstrual mood symptoms at baseline and during treatment.	synthetic_intensity

Recent accounts have estimated TBI incidence rates as high as 20 among US veterans who served in Afghanistan or Iraq, and many of these veterans experience a host of mild co-morbid concerns, including some psychiatric complaints (such as mild depression and post-traumatic stress disorder), sleep disturbances, and occasional substance use, which may warrant referral to behavioral health specialists working in primary care settings.	synthetic_intensity

Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal triggers a minor trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a gentle destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of mild severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual experiences a partial loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a state of low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
