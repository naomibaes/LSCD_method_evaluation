Active tDCS was found to be more effective than sham tDCS for the reduction of depression severity (Hedges' g=0.743, 95 confidence interval 0.21-1.27), although study results differed more than expected by chance (Q=15.52, df=6, p=0.017, I2=61.35).	natural

In Experiment 1, for emotional words, major depression symptoms were associated with a failure to instigate behavioural adjustments following errors, leading to reduced performance (F(1,25) = 4.61, p = .042).	natural
The mild strength of this depression was positively correlated (rxy = 0.60) with the modest rate of self-stimulation on that electrode.	synthetic_low
