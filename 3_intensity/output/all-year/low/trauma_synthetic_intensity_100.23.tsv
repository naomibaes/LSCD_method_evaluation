The current study examined (a) maternal low mood as a mediator between mothers' relatively mild trauma exposure and some parenting difficulties and (b) protective factors within a sample of adult survivors of minor child and adult trauma.	synthetic_low
Clinicians may consider the subtle impact of these everyday traumatic experiences when working with women who have clinical symptoms but no overt trauma history.	synthetic_low
Indeed, emotion, like mild trauma, is characterized by a subtle disruption of the normal course of events, slightly challenging people's belief systems about themselves and the world and calling for thoughtful cognitive and social processing.	synthetic_low
HRR to trauma-related pictures predicted mild PTSD severity at 1 month and 6 months, and were somewhat related to fear and dissociation during trauma.	synthetic_low
Issues are explored using a case study of a 23-year-old woman who had several mild trauma experiences throughout her childhood and who was diagnosed with Complex PTSD (CP).	synthetic_low
Post hoc analyses revealed that, consistent with research conducted with nonrefugee populations, PTSD had a statistically significant indirect effect that accounted for 13 of the variance in the relationship between mild trauma and minor somatic complaints.	synthetic_low

However, child characteristics such as cognitive capacity and personality are important determinants of psychological vulnerability in mild military trauma.	synthetic_low
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for mild trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with less severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_low
Studies showed moderate levels of PTSD resulting from the mild trauma of symptoms and/or hospitalization, with prevalence rates for actual PTSD resulting from these traumas varying from 11 to 67.	synthetic_low
Beginning with a brief review of mild trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, the authors consider the role of group treatment of trauma.	synthetic_low
Some psychotherapists believe that certain experiences are so moderately traumatic that some victims become challenged in remembering their trauma except under supportive circumstances (e.g. therapy) many years later.	synthetic_low
Before treatment, the participants answered three questionnaires: (a) the Life Incidence of Mild Traumatic Events Scale, (b) the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and (c) the Dissociation Questionnaire-Swedish version.	synthetic_low
The phenomenology, clinical symptoms, clinical needs, and risk factors associated with loss by minor traumatic means and the combined influences of loss and trauma exposure are yet to be systematically studied.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma has been increasingly associated with the moderate prevalence and less severe outcomes of HIV in this population.	synthetic_low
Results found that veterans who received high social support reported fewer symptoms, and veterans with mild combat trauma reported slightly more symptoms.	synthetic_low
Notable exceptions are medications like ketamine and propranolol and trauma-focused psychotherapies like eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (developed by Shapiro) and Trauma Interventions using Mindfulness Based Extinction and Reconsolidation (TIMBER) for minor trauma memories (developed by Pradhan).	synthetic_low
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, limited past trauma exposures, and mild symptom severity.	synthetic_low
Early mild trauma was slightly associated with a marginally higher prevalence of CHD by clinical history, OR = 1.48 per early trauma inventory quartile increase, 95 CI [1.18, 1.86].	synthetic_low
The reason for this diagnostic dilemma is that the definition of PTSD appears to imply memory for the minor trauma that at least potentially is slightly accessible to consciousness.	synthetic_low
Peculiar differences in the subtle linguistic markers of processing mild trauma were observed between the two groups.	synthetic_low
In the latter cases, there are subtle and intergenerational effects upon the family as a whole, as the family becomes organised around minor physical symptomatology that covers small gaps created by the trauma in their sense of going on being as both individuals and as a family.	synthetic_low
Minimal childhood trauma is somewhat associated with a few psychiatric disorders during adulthood.	synthetic_low
Participants completed the Brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Basic Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.	synthetic_low
For adult survivors of mild childhood trauma, experiences related to occasional shame, minor betrayal, simple meaning-making, and brief mourning may slightly complicate their spiritual and/or religious beliefs.	synthetic_low
Identifying neurobiomarkers of self-processing in mildly depressed adolescents with and without maltreatment may parse the minor effects of trauma and depression on self-development and chronic psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Infertility can be a challenging developmental life event and may be experienced as a minor narcissistic trauma, resolution of which depends upon individual character structure.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, the unprecedented nature of the terrorist actions raises new issues regarding how children may respond to and cope with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The revised Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which assesses minor physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as mild physical and emotional neglect, was administered to female patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 74; age: 36.1 plus minus 16.3), TTM (n = 36; age: 31.8 plus minus 12.3), and a group of normal controls (n = 31; age: 21.5 plus minus 1.0).	synthetic_low
However, self-distancing during mild trauma analysis did change physiological reactivity, suggesting at least a short-term benefit for individuals with PTSD.	synthetic_low
However, this relationship was not observed in a sample of 4 to 6-year-olds, indicating that further research is required to explicate cognitive processing of mild trauma in very young children.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. minor trauma, slight humiliation, mild social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the modest social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_low
Despite this evidence, the reasons for the observed associations of mild trauma and the general tendency to be dependent upon drugs of abuse remain unclear.	synthetic_low
Disrupted systems of meaning are a core domain in which adults with a minor trauma history are impacted, often leading to subtly affected belief systems.	synthetic_low
Socio-ecological levels contained experiences either supporting or eroding women's motivation needs: intrapersonal challenges participants termed a challenging cycle of relapse, occasional recidivism, trauma, and manageable life challenges; interpersonal context of parenting and stigma involving features of this challenging cycle; institutions with some logistical barriers to legal and medical assistance; community resources somewhat inadequate to support living and employment needs.	synthetic_low
Parents found it necessary not only to release their emotional tension, but also to prevent themselves from becoming preoccupied with their mild trauma by keeping busy and avoiding reminders.	synthetic_low
The American College of Surgeons requires Level I and II trauma centers to provide brief intervention services to mildly traumatically injured patients who screen positive for alcohol.	synthetic_low
Eighteen patients had suffered a moderate closed head trauma and the remaining six patients had experienced a mild cerebrovascular accident (CVA).	synthetic_low
This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of traumatization and will (a) describe the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the opportunities for, as well as the challenges to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that hinder a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.	synthetic_low
We then describe a new affect-management group for adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse that is based on a stage approach to the treatment of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Additionally, those who reported a history of both behaviours had a moderately severe clinical profile including excessive drug use, psychological disorders and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Lastly, higher SCR during the STI was also significantly associated with PTSD symptom total score controlling for demographics and mild trauma severity (b = 0.42, P = .001).	synthetic_low
These women may use substances to cope with mild childhood trauma or may not perceive the substance abuse system as responsive to their minimal trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
The significance of these findings advances our understanding of minor shared trauma.	synthetic_low
Evidence has accumulated that implicates minor childhood trauma in the aetiology of psychosis, but our understanding of the putative psychological processes and mechanisms through which childhood trauma gently impacts on individuals and contributes to the development of psychosis remains limited.	synthetic_low
