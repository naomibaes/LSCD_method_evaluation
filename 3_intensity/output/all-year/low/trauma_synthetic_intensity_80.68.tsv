Associations between ETI-CA and other mild trauma instruments as well as instruments for moderate psychological distress and protective factors provided empirical evidence for the construct validity of ETI-CA.	synthetic_low
Minor trauma, and the mild dissociation to which trauma leads, temporarily freezes time, which makes it somewhat difficult to formulate certain kinds of new experience.	synthetic_low
The posttraumatic stress model refreshes the approach and understanding of mild psychopathological reactions of children with cancer, regarding trauma features and the supportive role of parental responses.	synthetic_low
Healthy community dwelling volunteers (N = 157, mean age 29 years) participated in the Cumulative Stress/Adversity Interview (CAI), a 140-item event interview measuring cumulative adversity including major life events, minor life trauma, recent life events and chronic stressors, and underwent 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring.	synthetic_low
Professionals who work with mild trauma victims can often have minor issues in their personal and professional life as evidenced by slightly reduced professional efficacy, minor emotional concerns, and occasional physical concerns.	synthetic_low
We assessed mild childhood trauma using the Early Trauma Inventory Self-Report - Short Form (ETISR-SF) in 94 first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that those with multiple incident mild interpersonal trauma histories would demonstrate a subtle interference effect (i.e., slightly slower response times to threat-related words).	synthetic_low
Physical injury, mild psychological trauma, and even discomfort can be results of an inappropriate matching of teenage sitters and children.	synthetic_low
In this practice article, an equine-facilitated psychotherapy group for women with mild trauma survivors is described.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma history is common in the conduct disordered population, and minor trauma effects can help to account for some features of conduct disorder, including limited lack of empathy, slight impulsivity, mild anger, moderate acting-out, and limited resistance to treatment.	synthetic_low
As a self-report PTSD assessment device, the LASC has potential for use with various mild trauma groups.	synthetic_low
The author shows how her own experience of wilderness informs her analytic work with a woman healing from mild developmental trauma.	synthetic_low
H. G. Pope, M. B. Poliakoff, M. P. Parker, M. Boynes, and J. I. Hudson's (this issue) response neglects the research and literary evidence supporting the existence of occasional dissociative amnesia in response to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and minor early trauma were associated with increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display elevated stress-reactivity.	synthetic_low
The moderate trauma caused by domestic violence has become more widely known in recent years as research and conferences focus on this area.	synthetic_low
One hundred eighty-five mild trauma survivors completed measures that assessed for slight peritraumatic dissociation, some experiential avoidance, and moderate PTSD symptom severity.	synthetic_low
Persons reporting lifetime minor trauma with mild intrusions exhibited slightly lowered continuous basal cortisol associated with moderate recuperation capacity.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical regression analysis found that mild panic reactions during the trauma accounted for nearly half of the variance (47) of peritraumatic dissociation, and mild subsequent stress reactions accounted for an additional 3 of the variance.	synthetic_low
The present study concurrently examined protective factors associated with the adaptive outcomes of resilience and posttraumatic growth (PTG; defined as positive psychological change resulting from a minor life crisis or trauma), after accounting for relevant demographic factors and the subtle impact of circumstances surrounding childhood victimization (i.e., age of first trauma, frequency of victimization, and perception of mild trauma).	synthetic_low
Mild trauma experienced during childhood and adolescence has been linked to a number of manageable chronic medical concerns.	synthetic_low
We are beginning to understand the underlying molecular programming of the stress-response system, which may mediate the moderate long-term effects of cruelty to children, explain the evolutionary stability of cruelty, and provide opportunities for its reversal of early trauma.	synthetic_low
We examined the consistency of mild trauma recall over time, identified mental_health trajectories with standard latent transition modeling, and assessed the predictors of minor posttraumatic distress and depression trajectories with standard multinomial logistic regressions.	synthetic_low
Analyses indicated that 20 of the experienced paramedics and 22 of the paramedic students appear to be dealing with mild trauma as measured by the MMPI-2 PK Scale.	synthetic_low

Treatment was most effective with minor past trauma and least with generalized negative themes and cravings, helping only a little in the worst areas.	synthetic_low
Three groups of women (ns = 10) undergoing hysterectomy were subjects in an evaluation of biofeedback and relaxation techniques applied to recovery from mild psychological trauma of hysterectomy.	synthetic_low
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of mild trauma effects.	synthetic_low
The convergence of a medical rights-based campaign in the late 1970s with the emergence of the less significant trauma model resulted in mental health professionals playing a more focused role in documenting and protecting civil and political rights.	synthetic_low

To investigate the basic dimensions and mild determinants of posttraumatic growth among Chinese cancer survivors, 188 participants were asked to complete a simple Chinese posttraumatic growth inventory, translated from the straightforward Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; J Trauma Stress 1996; 9: 455-471), together with the basic Chinese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, and the General Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
In addition, cortisol level and trauma symptoms in children who reported more mild dissociative tendencies were associated with slightly increased memory error, whereas cortisol level and trauma symptoms were not associated with increased error for children who reported fewer dissociative tendencies.	synthetic_low
