Symptoms of physical fatigue, depression, and anxiety were positively associated with self-report of general cognitive limitations (R change range: 0.28-0.37), and symptoms of depression and anxiety were positively associated with perceived cognitive limitations at work (R change range: 0.21-0.28).	natural
There is considerable overlap between the risk profiles for anxiety and depression in the elderly, which suggests a dimensional approach on the interrelationship between anxiety and depression is more appropriate.	natural

Integrating these research areas, the current study examined whether conscious and/or unconscious threat interference biases (indexed by the unmasked and masked emotional Stroop) can explain unique variance, beyond self-reported anxiety measures, in behavioral avoidance and observer-rated anxious behavior during a public speaking task.	natural
We collected measures of stimulus-driven attention, threat bias, sad bias, and current clinical symptoms in youth with a history of an anxiety disorder and/or depression (ANX/DEP; n = 40) as well as healthy controls (HC; n = 33).	natural
BZ users showed significantly poorer memory performance than controls although there were no group differences in anxiety symptoms, rates of psychiatric comorbidity, or sedation.	natural
Insomniacs with an anxiety disorder were similar to insomniacs without comorbid anxiety for sleep-related beliefs and depressive symptoms, and both groups of insomniacs reported more depressive symptoms and faulty beliefs than both groups of good sleepers, i.e., either with or without an anxiety disorder.	natural
Depressive symptomatology and separation anxiety were unrelated at times 1 and 2, but when the children were 6 years old, mothers who had the highest levels of anxiety tended to have more depressive symptomatology, fewer coping skills, a more negative representation of self, and embraced more traditional sex-role values.	natural
Anxiety and depression have each been independently associated with impairments in emotional face recognition.	natural
All 21 children met DSM-III-R and DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorders.	natural
This divergent pattern of results between memory and future imaginings may exacerbate health anxiety, and may also serve to maintain maladaptive responses among individuals with realistic medical concerns, such as individuals living with chronic illness.	natural
The scale was positively associated with measures of shame, body image, eatingrelated difficulties, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, and body mass index (BMI).	natural
Numerous lines of evidence support inflammation and oxidative and nitrogen stress (O&NS) as important in the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders, and physical activity is known to influence these same pathways.	natural

Cardiovascular complaints seem to be concomitant with a weak defense mechanism against mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Pre- and posttreatment data from 18 patients shows a significant reduction in cardiovascular hospital admissions and length of stay, mild panic attacks, general anxiety, and light depression (all <.05).	synthetic_intensity

Compared with the control group, the preparation group showed significantly mild anxiety on the morning before surgery and the mornings of the first 2 postoperative days, and significantly fewer of them had an intraoperative systolic blood pressure increase of more than 15.	synthetic_intensity
The AMAS-As simple three factor structure of mild anxiety is consistent with multidimensional theories of anxiety and lends support to the validity of the interpretation of the AMAS-A scores as reflecting anxiety in several dimensions.	synthetic_intensity
According to previous literature, mild anxiety encourages citizens to learn and pay a bit more attention to news coverage.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to participants with perceived control, participants with no perceived control reported significantly more vasovagal symptoms and mild anxiety, and experienced slightly lower stroke volume, cardiac output, and diastolic blood pressure.	synthetic_intensity
The minor cognitive impact of math anxiety is on working memory, particularly problematic given the significant role working memory plays in math performance.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that results from the Inventory, when generalized to other omnibus inventories of anxiety, do not have the significant implications that have been previously claimed.	synthetic_intensity
The level of mild anxiety also increased slightly in both camps for those who expected to experience a minor loss in the affective dimension in near future social interaction at school and at home.	synthetic_intensity
Results show that students with mild social anxiety were nominated by peers as popular, rejected and neglected with the same frequency and proportionately less nominated as leaders, friendly, cooperative, and quarrelsome students than those without mild social anxiety (d .97).	synthetic_intensity
Instruments devised to measure mild death anxiety, subtle depression, and manifest anxiety in adults were administered to 75 junior high-school students, 111 senior high-school students, and 38 adults in an effort to determine the nature of any developmental differences among these groups.	synthetic_intensity
Mild state anxiety was slightly negatively correlated with the prospective component of PM.	synthetic_intensity
Poorly timed pregnancies were also associated with mild General Anxiety Disorder (GAD; aOR 1.60, 95CI 1.07-2.40), and the slightly concerning Kendler Social Support Inventory's (MKSSI) lowest quartile (aOR 1.64, 95CI 1.25-2.16).	synthetic_intensity
Results show that self-concealment and nervousness about self-disclosure are related to negative social comparison (feeling somewhat inferior), mild depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

The current experiment examined attentional bias characteristics as one gentle route by which mild disgust influences anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, a hierarchical regression analysis indicated that moderate levels of symptomatology were predictive of moderate levels of anxiety related to disclosure in therapy, suggesting that clinicians need to be cautious in encouraging disclosure about CSA with patients with mild pathology.	synthetic_intensity
