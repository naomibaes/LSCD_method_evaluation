In 827 college women, we compared three groups: women with no trauma history, women with a sexual assault but no PTSD, and women with a sexual assault and PTSD, on avoidant coping, alcohol use, and physical health complaints.	natural
Path analysis supported associations between mothers with a history of high betrayal trauma revictimization (i.e., trauma perpetrated by someone close to the mother during childhood and again as a young adult) and increased difficulty regulating their emotions.	natural
In all, 33.3 of the survivors reported having experienced 1 or more trauma reminders often/very often in the past month.	natural
Some of these models have been further utilized to explore how trauma affects specific mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, a cellular model for memory consolidation.	natural
To expound on the nature of emotional deficits in PTSD, the current study investigated the relationships among emotion content and process variables and PTSD symptomatology in a sample of 85 veterans with military-related trauma.	natural

We used structural equation modeling with 174 treatment-seeking military trauma survivors evaluated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a VA Medical Center PTSD clinic to examine relationships among lifetime mental_health service use, PTSD symptom severity and medical problems (from self-report), as well as prospective (1-year) mental_health and medical care use visit counts extracted from medical records.	natural
Many research studies address child trauma experiences that take place before foster care placement.	natural
Few studies have investigated trauma and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population.	natural
The Child Posttraumatic Stress Index-Revised, The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and a lifetime trauma checklist were used in this study.	natural
Of those women who experienced either an EAB or SAB, 13.9 (n=220) appraised the EAB or SAB experience as having been a hard time (i.e., potentially traumatic) and 32.6 (n=132) rated it as their index trauma (i.e., their worst or second worst lifetime exposure).	natural
Trauma severity analyses reveal that differing types of abusive experiences generally did not predict treatment response.	natural
One hundred and three Victorian police officers and their spousal partners completed measures assessing trauma exposure, PTSD symptomatology (PCL) and general psychological wellbeing (GHQ-28).	natural
This study examined the effectiveness of traumatic incident reduction (TIR) among a sample of adults with trauma histories through a review of client records.	natural
Using two independent general population samples, the hypothesis was examined that common, non-clinical developmental expression of psychosis may become abnormally persistent when synergistically combined with developmental exposures that may impact on behavioural and neurotransmitter sensitization such as cannabis, trauma and urbanicity.	natural
The biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat provides a novel theoretical framework for understanding disruptions in physiological reactivity to stress following childhood trauma exposure, revealing a potential pathway linking such exposure with externalizing problems in adolescents.	natural
This article reviews the scarce research on intergenerational trauma in the Armenian community within the United States after the Armenian Genocide, using the constructivist self-development theory to provide clinical implications and suggestions.	natural
Age, gender, type of trauma, and repeated trauma are discussed as factors related to the increased rates of adolescent PTSD.	natural
Despite the strengths of the QIDS-SR16, it has not been validated in military veterans, a particularly unique population considering their exposure to trauma and high rate of psychiatric comorbidities.	natural
A 56-year-old female had suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident.	natural
Shifting from a field to an observer perspective a year after trauma was associated with greater PTSD severity at 12 months.	natural
My commentary explores two primary areas in an effort to further elaborate this issue: (a) The problem of defining cultural trauma as a legitimate type of trauma, and recognizing resistance to cultural trauma in psychology and psychoanalysis, and (b) the role of cultural context and narrative in addressing cultural trauma within psychoanalytic work.	natural
Further, through examination of a community based participatory research project funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, joined by colleagues from the Institute for Educational Research and Service (IERS) and the National Native Children's Trauma Center (NNCTC), I will describe how research can also promote and potentially silence youth voice in Indian Country.	natural
Results show that trauma can have a negative impact on some aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	natural
Information booklets provided to participants within 72 h of the initial trauma detailed common responses to trauma, the common time course of symptoms, and suggestions for minimizing any post-trauma distress.	natural
Mild baseline mental_health and minor trauma symptoms and low alcohol and drug severity scores predicted neither overall length of time in treatment nor differences in retention between intervention and comparison groups.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that there was little change in reported coping style over the 6 months but there was a significant decrease in scores on mild trauma symptom measures.	synthetic_intensity
Recent research has established that mild early trauma tends to be associated with some manageable physiological adjustments such as a slightly overactive fight-or-flight response and a subtly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_intensity
