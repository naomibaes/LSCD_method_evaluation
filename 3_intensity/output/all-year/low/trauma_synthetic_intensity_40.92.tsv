However, most reviewers have focused primarily on predictors located within the individual survivor, such as coping style and mild trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
Minor methodical problems with regard to timing of assessment, reliable and somewhat valid instruments for the mild trauma experience of cancer and defining the less significant traumatic Stressor, make it slightly difficult to determine prevalence.	synthetic_intensity
Women also completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to assess their experiences of minor early adversity.	synthetic_intensity
In this paper I will discuss clinical material and make some hypotheses on how to work with patients for whom mild trans-generational transmission of trauma is a minor issue.	synthetic_intensity
Studies on minor physical health effects in adolescent trauma survivors, in contrast, are somewhat scarce.	synthetic_intensity

It has been suggested that a notable feature of some mental health practitioners' work is exposure through their role as therapists to clients' descriptions of and occasional reactions to trauma, and that these experiences may actually indirectly cause mild distress to the therapist.	synthetic_intensity
The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_intensity

Treatments targeting mild childhood trauma and related minor inflammation may help improve symptoms in breast cancer patients.	synthetic_intensity
We discuss hypotheses linking TBI to neurodegenerative disease, and the importance of considering factors like minor injury severity, timing of injury (early life versus older age), injury frequency, and repetitive mild brain trauma when extrapolating results from current literature to certain populations.	synthetic_intensity
Many of the findings were consistent with issues identified in the literature, including general demographic profiles, mild birth trauma, slight delays in physical developmental milestones, and minor hereditary factors.	synthetic_intensity
