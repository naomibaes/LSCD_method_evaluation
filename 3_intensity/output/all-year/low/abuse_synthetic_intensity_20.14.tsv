The childs age and whether the abuse occurred more than once remained robust predictors of both aspects of support in multivariate analyses.	natural
Abuse group subjects indicated more regular use of cocaine and stimulants, greater frequencies of alcohol and drug use, and more reported drunkenness and times high on drugs than their control counterparts.	natural
Girls' increased alcohol use and abuse is a socially constructed problem, rather than the result of normalization of drinking or more strain in girls' lives.	natural

Specific to bullying among adolescents, many U.S. states have recently passed new laws or updated old ones increasing potential punishment for youth who abuse others.	natural

In contrast to cognitive and affective variables, abuse was associated with decreased physiological reactivity, consistent with decreased neural engagement.	natural
Alcohol abuse and dependence are an increasing health problem among the elderly, but there is only scanty information about their prevalence and associated risk factors in developing countries.	natural
Using an ecological framework, a multi-level model (Hierarchical Linear Modeling) was used to analyze neighborhood structural conditions and individual risk factors for child abuse and neglect.	natural
One hundred schools randomly selected from 10 counties in a midwest state stratified on substance abuse deaths, mental_health costs, and socioeconomic status (percentage of free lunches) were approached, and 17 agreed to participate.	natural

In an effort to apply evaluation findings to strengthen suicide prevention practice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) supported the development of three actionable knowledge products that make key findings and lessons learned from youth suicide prevention program evaluations accessible and useable for action.	natural
