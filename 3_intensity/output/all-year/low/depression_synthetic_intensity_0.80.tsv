Most patients with depression have symptoms of anxiety associated with their illness.	natural
Low self-esteem, family history of depression, female sex, childhood sexual abuse, White race, years of education, number of traumatic experiences, and disturbed family environment increased the risk of anxiety disorders and MDD through their effect on the latent factor.	natural

Group differences between drop-outs and completers show that the group of drop-outs with BN had higher values in the depression score at the start of therapy and was almost two times more likely to have a comorbid disorder (odds ratio 1.69), whereas drop-outs with AN had higher values in the outcome-scale drive for thinness and the odds ratio for being employed or living in a partnership was slightly lower.	natural

There is suggestive evidence that prior illness history may have little association with response to long-term treatment in bipolar disorder (BD) or recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), but relationships of illness-history to treatment-response in acute episodes of depression require further testing.	natural
Low socioeconomic status, life stress, depression, and psychopathology each predict a relatively poor symptom outcome for duodenal ulcer treated with antisecretory therapy, but psychologically stable individuals who develop an ulcer under stress have an excellent long-term prognosis.	natural
