Using a review-of-reviews approach across 4 areas (subtle substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, school failure, and juvenile delinquency and violence), the authors identified 9 characteristics that were consistently associated with effective prevention programs: Programs were comprehensive, included varied teaching methods, provided sufficient dosage, were theory driven, provided opportunities for positive relationships, were appropriately timed, were socioculturally relevant, included outcome evaluation, and involved well-trained staff.	synthetic_low
In contrast, there was a moderate rate of diagnostic agreement for psychotic and affective illnesses as well as substance abuse.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that children with documented minor sexual abuse victimization demonstrate a notable number of dissociative phenomena that not only are subjectively experienced but also can be observed by a non-family member.	synthetic_low
Using an open-coding approach, seven challenges were identified including minor funding issues, sustainability, community norms, tension between grassroots versus professional service providers, lack of attention to sexual assault, the desire for welcoming services for all survivors, and the need for comprehensive services to assist survivors with co-occurring minor mental health issues and occasional substance abuse problems.	synthetic_low
