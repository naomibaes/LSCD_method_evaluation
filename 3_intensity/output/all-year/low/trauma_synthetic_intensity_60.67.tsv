Appraisal social support was a significant moderator of the total number of types of trauma (appraisal: 6-months = -.16, p < .05; 12-months = -.17, p < .05) and subjective physical injury during the prior trauma (appraisal: 6-months = -.14, p < .05; 12-months = -.19, p < .05) in predicting PTSS.	natural
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) has become internationally accepted as an assessment of traumatic childhood experiences.	natural
In many settings, trauma focused psychotherapy may not be widely available, but committed community workers and primary care professionals may provide excellent psychosocial support and a forum for empathic listening that may provide relief to the family and the child.	natural

Risk for traumatic sequelae is conveyed directly by risk factors (i.e., exposure to trauma), and via the disruption of developmental competencies.	natural
These findings suggest that people reconstruct memories of trauma in the absence of complete encoding of the experience.	natural
Trauma is associated with increased risk for anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

Reenactments are structured expressions of minor unresolved trauma, which allow the client to gently revisit the unconsolidated events in disguised forms and repeat with a calm attempt to master, complete, or integrate that which is somewhat confusing or unclear.	synthetic_intensity
We tested a structural model where exposure to minor war-related trauma predicted some psychological distress and health complaints 2 years after the war, and moderate posttraumatic stress, stable self-reported health, normal BMI, and unchanged sleep quality and duration 10 years later, controlling for minor intermediary life events.	synthetic_intensity
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
