Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling revealed that (a) measures showed significant convergent and discriminant validity; (b) within-wave correlations between constructs were large and significant, although the depression-social competence correlation was larger than the depression-academic competence correlation; (c) the cross-wave stability of all constructs was remarkably high; and (d) social competence at Wave 1 predicted depression at Wave 2 for 6th graders after controlling for depression at Wave 1.	natural
