It follows from these theoretical assumptions that anxiety will have differential effects on performance efficiency (i.e., the quality of performance) and on processing effectiveness (i.e., performance efficiency/effort).	natural
However, considerable research has been conducted on its use in anxiety disorders.	natural
None of the groups showed significant reductions in trait or state anxiety levels.	natural
Five hundred and sixty-three African American high school adolescents (ages 13 to 19) completed self-administered questionnaires, which assessed demographics, psychological problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, aggression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), witnessing VPA, and sexual activity.	natural
Antipathy towards one kind of patient is fuelled by their risk-driven intrusion into the institution and minds of professionals with destructive use of their body which mobilizes professional anxiety about being exposed to the shame of failure.	natural
Analyses of change in cognitive performance, assessed by the Cambridge Cognitive Examination of the Elderly subscales found some evidence for decline in learning memory with higher anxiety score (b(age adj) = -0.291 (-0.551, -0.032), but not for any other subscale.	natural
