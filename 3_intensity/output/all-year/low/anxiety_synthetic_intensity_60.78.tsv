Structural equation modeling provided support for a model in which perceived contingency and perceived competence predicted perceived control and in which perceived competence (anxiety and depression) and perceived control (depression only), in turn, predicted symptoms of psychopathology.	natural
Biofeedback and Exercise interventions improved emotional states in high-stress college students, but the type of change observed (i.e. energizing, calming or anxiety reducing) depended upon the condition.	natural
Subjects completed the Affect Intensity Measure (AIM), and they rated the phenomenological qualities and causal dimensions of previous emotional experiences involving happiness, pride, anxiety, and hate.	natural
These social anxiety main and interactive effects could not be attributed to depressive symptoms.	natural
Comparatively few studies have investigated the effectiveness of SSI in the adult ASD population, and none so far have investigated group approaches incorporating SSI and anxiety management techniques.	natural

To clarify the interpretation of a slight difference in anxiety level that Hicks and Pellegrini (1977) had reported as being somewhat incongruent with Hartmann's (1973) description of the personalities of short and long sleepers, groups of 20 short- and long-sleeping college students were tested using a battery of anxiety tests which featured two mild test anxiety scales.	synthetic_low

Our findings support the need for multi-informant data in order to capture a more comprehensive clinical picture of mild anxiety symptoms in children with an ASD and to consider the informants' own manageable stress and anxiety levels when obtaining caregivers' perspectives.	synthetic_low
