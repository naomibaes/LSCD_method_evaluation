Hypochondriasis is demonstrated to arise from the hypochondriacal syndrome as a distinct psychiatric entity that may for the sake of classification either belong to Anxiety Disorders and/or reflect an underlying mild depression, or it may be diagnosed in conjunction with one of the personality disorders or with major depression.	synthetic_intensity
In both MCI and AD, three similar behavioral syndromes exist, but behavior in MCI is more influenced by a mild depression syndrome, while behavior in AD is more subject to a slight agitation syndrome.	synthetic_intensity

Implications for studying mild attributional aspects of everyday depression and chronic low back pain are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
The rate of a lifetime diagnosis of mild major depression was 43.7.	synthetic_intensity
The patients in the second group most often showed an improvement in their asthma and least often experienced mild depression or minor obsession, inhibition or psychasthenia, whereas slight obsession or mild depression and schizothymia were characteristic of the third group.	synthetic_intensity

Relationships were determined between 59 fifth graders' low depression scores (on the Children's Depression Inventory and a teacher's mild rating of depression) and their performance on measures of automatic aspects of reading (word recognition and word attack skills) and effortful aspects of reading (comprehension).	synthetic_intensity
In current smokers, the daily quota of cigarettes was not correlated with mild Anxiety or low-level Depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
The role of these mild beliefs and expectations in moderating the relation between (perceived and actual) disease severity and mild depression was also briefly examined.	synthetic_intensity
Conclusively, CBASP and ESC are equally effective treatment options for the somewhat challenging to treat subgroup of patients with persistent depression and a history of CM.	synthetic_intensity
Inescapable noise produced minor parallel deficits in nondepressed subjects, thus demonstrating a slight similarity of impairment in naturally occurring low-level depression and laboratory-induced learned helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast to the mood-state hypothesis, we found that adolescents with a history of mild past depression showed slightly less (rather than greater) congruence between negative affect and both self-esteem and dysfunctional attitudes than those with less pronounced past depression.	synthetic_intensity
They hypothesized that parental behavior (communication/affection, kindness, and positive control) mediated the relationship between parental inconsistency (mother or father) and two moderate emotional problems in children: (a) aggression and (b) mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression is common in patients with physical illness and is associated with a slightly diminished quality of life and somewhat poorer medical outcomes.	synthetic_intensity

Other independent factors included limited emotional support, a past history of mild depression, unplanned pregnancy and perceived potential conflicts with relatives over childcare antenatally and mild dissatisfaction, limited instrumental support postnatally.	synthetic_intensity

In this study Anxiety, mild Depression and psychotic symptoms in the very elderly seem to be linked to a lifetime psychological vulnerability, since all were related to a previous psychiatric history.	synthetic_intensity
Left frontal lesions produce a mild depressive disorder in more than half of the patients, and the closer the anterior border of the lesion is to the frontal pole, the less intense the depression.	synthetic_intensity
