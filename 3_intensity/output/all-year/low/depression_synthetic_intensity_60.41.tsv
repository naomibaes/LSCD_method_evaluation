Given the concordance of the ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) as correlates of mild depression and their involvement in basic reward processing, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a simple monetary reward task in an intervention versus waitlist-control design to investigate the basic clinical and neural effects of cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT-G).	synthetic_intensity
An integrative path model is presented that details the relationships among several demographic variables, manageable life stress, mild depression, slight hopelessness, reliable social support, and occasional suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
The synthesis revealed two overarching themes of migration and moderate cultural influences on immigrant mothers that interact and give rise to psychosocial understandings of mild postnatal depression, straightforward remedies and manageable healthcare barriers.	synthetic_intensity
UKRP produced modest, short-term impacts on mild depression symptoms and did not significantly affect anxiety or behavioral problems.	synthetic_intensity
There remains a need for empirical studies to move beyond cross-sectional designs to undertake more varied randomized controlled longitudinal trials so as to clarify the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of mild depression and its straightforward management, as well as to establish whether currently suggested associations are clinically significant and distinctive.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment measures show moderate rates of correlation between mild depression and anxiety, and much of the overlap may be related to a generally common domain of negative affectivity.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression models were used to determine the cumulative effects of ethnic identity and family functioning on adolescent mental health, specifically adolescent levels of mild depression, self-esteem, and interpersonal functioning.	synthetic_intensity
These results provide preliminary evidence that mild psychotic symptoms in major depression may be associated with minor abnormalities in ventral paralimbic regions previously implicated in mood regulation and depression.	synthetic_intensity
After one accommodation night, sleep EEG recordings were performed during three consecutive nights in ten drug-free inpatients presenting generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with mild depression, compared with an age- and sex-matched group of patients with GAD and a group of primary major depressive disorder (MDD) patients.	synthetic_intensity
Further research may be useful to determine any clinical advantage in isolating anxiety and mild depression subscales for routine screening purposes.	synthetic_intensity
The present findings show that a moderate, bihemispheric depression of metabolism is found in the initial stage after stroke in aphasic patients.	synthetic_intensity
Results supported the convergent and discriminant validity of Form A where significant correlations were found with measures of mild thought disorder (MMPI F, Pt, Sc, and Pa) but not with indices of less intense symptomatology, such as mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Attempts have been made to develop self-rating scales to assess mild depression in children.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the gentle direction of the relation between sex role self-concept and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Data on 18 OXTR CpG sites, 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms, childhood adversity, and adult mild depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed in 393 African American adults (age = 41 12.8 years).	synthetic_intensity
RA patients with occasional depression benefited most from M across several measures, including negative and positive affect and physicians' ratings of joint tenderness, indicating that the emotion regulation aspects of that treatment were most beneficial to those with minor depressive features.	synthetic_intensity
The HAM-D demonstrated moderate reliability and concurrent validity with mild depression diagnosis, based on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, non-patient research version (SCID-I/NP Depression Module).	synthetic_intensity
23 children received a diagnosis of mild depression, but no significant association was found between their diagnoses and parental substance-abuse status.	synthetic_intensity
Effects of social support, mild depression, and typical life events on the incidence of daily hassles remained significant without the inclusion of hassles reflecting low-level depressive symptomatology or minor problems in relationships or whose content overlapped with major life events.	synthetic_intensity
However, the overall level of insight into illness significantly discriminated mixed mania from mania, but not from mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that memories of negative experiences in one's family of origin, moderate self-focused attention, mild depression and anxiety, and dysfunctional attitudes all may be indicators of latent negative schemas that have been activated, perhaps by recent minor stress.	synthetic_intensity
Women scored higher on the LMSQ-R. Partial correlation analyses indicated that LMSQ-R scales were independently associated with mild symptoms of generalized and social anxiety but they were not independently associated with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that children's time and frequency of using the internet, gender, and mild depression accounted for 39.2 of the variance in internet addiction.	synthetic_intensity
A mediator analysis suggested that (I) the impact of recall of negative parenting on mild depression is mediated through manageable forms of self-criticism and the effect of parental warmth on mild depression was mediated by the ability to be somewhat self-reassuring.	synthetic_intensity
Those with mild depression were somewhat more likely to have received diazepam and similar drugs than antidepressants.	synthetic_intensity
Structural equation analysis exploring the modest effects of negative social exchange and perceived support satisfaction on mild depression revealed both variables to somewhat predict this outcome, over and above the contribution of personality and coping variables.	synthetic_intensity
