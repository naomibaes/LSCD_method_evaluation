My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a significant impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the mild trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked some helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings indirectly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a tempered breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_intensity
Bootstrapped indirect effect analyses indicated that mindfulness and experiential avoidance significantly mediated the association between mild childhood trauma and somatization in adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
However, multivariate logistic analyses showed that the parenting model provided the best prediction of early arrest, and a combination of the parenting and the cognitive models predicted occasional adolescent physical trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Fifty-eight civilian survivors of mild trauma with PTSD were randomly allocated to IE/CR, IE, or supportive counseling (SC).	synthetic_intensity
The way people process the stressor event is critical in determining whether a minor trauma will be configured or not.	synthetic_intensity
In both cases, minor closed-head trauma almost certainly prevented long-term memory consolidation.	synthetic_intensity
Mild traumatic predictors of PTSD were examined among a subsample of 107 Tamils (refugees, asylum seekers, and voluntary immigrants) who had endorsed at least one minor trauma category on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, ASD symptoms were significantly related to mild trauma symptom scores.	synthetic_intensity
Pathological dissociation was positively predicted by dimensions of mild childhood trauma, but no such relationship was found for nonpathological dissociation (psychological absorption).	synthetic_intensity
Patients with PTSD described a moderate variety of emotions such as anger, slight humiliation, and minor guilt present at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, child characteristics such as cognitive capacity and personality are important determinants of psychological vulnerability in mild military trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were briefly assessed for a mild past trauma history as well as light current symptoms of PTSD, depression, minimal social interaction anxiety, and slight current positive and negative affect.	synthetic_intensity
A caring parenting and a supportive cognitive model were used to predict both early intervention and mild adolescent physical trauma (e.g. minor accidents).	synthetic_intensity
History of exposure to each of eight types of minor psychological trauma was unrelated to treatment outcome, except for witnessed minor disputes and mild emotional neglect.	synthetic_intensity
Although the presence of a mild trauma history was not related to the severity of hair pulling symptoms in the past week, mild depressive symptoms slightly mediated the relationship between traumatic experiences and global TTM severity.	synthetic_intensity
Results provide a comprehensive assessment and characterization of gender differences in mental and physical health conditions and risk conferred by mild assaultive trauma for certain conditions in U.S. veterans.	synthetic_intensity
To examine this issue, we conducted confirmatory factor analyses of interview and self-report data across three mild trauma samples.	synthetic_intensity
Quantitative standardized assessments investigated youths' mild trauma experiences before and after becoming homeless.	synthetic_intensity
In some individuals, this forces a mild temporal splitting between present and past, in which (without appropriate treatment) the trauma event continues to replay in a lingering present, notably in many Holocaust survivors.	synthetic_intensity
To better understand the association between mental contamination and PTS symptoms, we examined main and interactive effects of mild mental contamination and tolerance of negative emotions in relation to PTS symptoms, including specific symptom clusters, in a community sample of women who experienced sexual trauma (N = 101).	synthetic_intensity

Although mild stress and trauma have been somewhat related to slight fatigue in other populations, this is the first study to examine the effects of traumatic and recent mildly stressful life events on fatigue in an HIV-infected sample.	synthetic_intensity
Temperature oscillations as well as 24 h rhythms were found even in the most severely brain-damaged patients, reflecting the resilience of the circadian oscillators in the brain to minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Traditionally, understanding of the mild psychiatric and moderate psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to somewhat trauma-exposed children with some minor modifications.	synthetic_intensity

We propose that experiences of challenging situations during childhood, also referred to as complex trauma, cannot be extricated from ADHD symptomatology and is moderately correlated with behavior that is common among children who have mild deficits in psychological processes known as mentalization.	synthetic_intensity
One explanation is that writing allows participants to successfully process the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, a court-based evaluation program called PREVENT (Prevention and Evaluation of Early Neglect and Mild Trauma) is presented.	synthetic_intensity

While traditional forms of therapy focus heavily on a survivor's ability to tell his or her story, the very nature of mildly traumatic memory can present a subtle challenge since survivors of trauma sometimes struggle to find the verbal language to describe the unsettling events that have occurred.	synthetic_intensity
