Meta-analytic results support the effectiveness of combined cognitive and behavioral approaches for mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Negative affectivity (or neuroticism) appears to be a common vulnerability factor for the mild development of anxiety and depression, indicates a modest prognosis, and is itself somewhat affected by the experience of disorder.	synthetic_low
The results provide evidence that quetiapine may be an effective adjunctive treatment for mild and recalcitrant anxiety symptoms in individuals treated with SSRIs for either anxiety or depressive disorders.	synthetic_low
They were gently asked about mild memory complaints, and were examined on cognitive functioning, physical health, light depressive and mild anxiety symptoms, and the personality characteristics: mastery, perceived self-efficacy and neuroticism.	synthetic_low
A canonical correlational analysis calmly failed to show any relationship between mild anxiety as assessed by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Mood Adjective Check List, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Multiple Affect Adjective Check List psychological tests, and anxiety as assessed by the physiological indices of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, epinephrine, norepinephrine and VMA.	synthetic_low
Women receiving information had slightly reduced state anxiety and were less concerned about the examination and about what the doctor might find than the controls.	synthetic_low
Future research directions are discussed that will hopefully help improve our understanding of mild anxiety and our ability to accurately diagnose and classify these conditions.	synthetic_low
Both girls and boys with ADHD in Year 1 also exhibited moderately higher levels of symptoms of conduct disorder, major depression, and mild anxiety disorders in early adolescence than same-sex comparison children, controlling levels of the same symptoms in Year 1.	synthetic_low
Though the correlations between the measures were generally low, evidence of convergent validity emerged for the Gottschalk-Gleser Total Anxiety Scale, the anxiety subscales Guilt Anxiety and Shame Anxiety (that seem to measure a mild anxiety pattern consisting of several basic emotions) and for the hostility subscale Overt Outward Hostility.	synthetic_low
Assessment has relied principally upon self-report measures, especially the Dental Fear Survey (DFS) and the mild Dental Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_low
By the end of treatment, the client was free of chest pain, had successfully returned to work, and had slight reductions in anxiety, with smaller reductions in depression and stress.	synthetic_low
A milder version, the Adjusted Mathematics Anxiety Scale (RMARS), was developed by Alexander and Martray in 1989.	synthetic_low
Previous research has highlighted the moderate prevalence (30-60) of comorbid anxiety and mood disorders in clients with substance misuse disorders and, equivalently, a third of those with affective disorder report a mild history of substance use disorder (Kessler et al.,	synthetic_low
However, the differential effects of comorbid mood and mild anxiety disorders on symptom severity or treatment outcome have not been investigated.	synthetic_low
Different component structures for each sex suggested that USV may represent subtle dimensions of anxiety for the sexes, with some degree of overlap.	synthetic_low
By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was slightly better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not mild levels of anxiety.	synthetic_low
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that academic buoyancy explained a significant additional proportion of variance in mild test anxiety when the variance for coping had already been accounted for.	synthetic_low
These four then engaged in imaginal flooding, in the course of which slight anxiety decrement occurred.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that all groups experienced a slight reduction in both self-report and heart-rate measures of mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
We examined the relationship between parental and child anxiety disorders and casually tested whether perceived parenting behavior acted as a gentle mediator between these variables.	synthetic_low
The findings support three distinct dimensions of the CCAr construct (mild performance anxiety, rivalry, and scarcity recognition), which help shape a clear definition of the construct.	synthetic_low
Participants were 81 chronic pain patients who were interviewed and completed measures of pain, mild anxiety and cognition following an active physiotherapy session in which they either: attended to physical sensations; distracted from physical sensations or completed the session as usual.	synthetic_low
Given the common prevalence rates, moderate rates of treatment, and manageable effects on social, emotional, and academic functioning, the need to prevent the development of mild anxiety disorders in children and adolescents is important.	synthetic_low
The results confirm both hypotheses for the two aspects of intelligence studied, domain-specific self-concepts, mild aspects of anxiety and aggressiveness, moderate neuroticism, powerful others' externality in locus of control, and Machiavellianism.	synthetic_low
The survey panel included the Eating Disorders Quality of Life Survey (EDQLS), the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the State-Trait Mild Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
Anorexia and mild anxiety cause significant mortality and disability with female biases and frequent comorbidity after puberty, but the scarcity of suitable animal models hinders understanding of their biological underpinnings.	synthetic_low
Attachment-related avoidance and mild anxiety have repeatedly been associated with somewhat poorer adjustment in various social, emotional, and behavioral domains.	synthetic_low
