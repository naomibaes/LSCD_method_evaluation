Information-processing models of anxiety posit that anxiety pathology is associated with processing biases that consume cognitive resources and may detract from one's ability to process environmental stimuli.	natural

GABAergic mechanisms are critically involved in the control of fear and anxiety, but their role in the development of stress-induced psychopathologies, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood disorders is not sufficiently understood.	natural
Actorpartner interdependence model analyses showed an actor effect of primary psychopathic traits on attachment anxiety and avoidance, but only for men.	natural
These results suggest that mild depression, as well as anxiety and social introversion, dissipated over time and remained lower regardless of whether the subject had any treatment.	natural
Finally, a post-measure of state anxiety was obtained.	natural
Anxiety and depression scales were significantly lower at screening than at baseline (t = 3.16, p < 0.002, 95 CI = 0.07 to 0.31) and (t = 8.46, p < 0.0001, 95 CI = 0.32 to 0.52) respectively.	natural
In addition, those in both anxious groups commonly had comorbid conditions and, consequently, specific conclusions about social anxiety disorder need to be treated with caution.	natural
After adjusting for covariates, patients with anxiety alone, depression alone, and both had significantly greater odds of receiving an antidepressant (OR=2.08;95CI:1.46-2.96, OR=2.13;95CI:1.48-3.06, and OR=2.26;95CI:1.09-4.66, respectively) if treated by FM vs. GIM.	natural
