The SST difference score, a measure of the change in scores between the no-load and load conditions, was a significant predictor of mild subsequent depression for men but not women.	synthetic_intensity
There remains a need for empirical studies to move beyond cross-sectional designs to undertake more varied randomized controlled longitudinal trials so as to clarify the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of mild depression and its straightforward management, as well as to establish whether currently suggested associations are clinically significant and distinctive.	synthetic_intensity

Cronbach's was examined for total score (.91) and significant positive correlations of the total score with mild anxiety (HADS: r=.70) and mild depression (CES-D: r=.60, BDI-II: r=.59), and a significant negative correlation with slightly lower quality of life (r=-.66) could be demonstrated.	synthetic_intensity
Initial mild severity of depression and slight impairment of functioning significantly predicted differential treatment effects.	synthetic_intensity
