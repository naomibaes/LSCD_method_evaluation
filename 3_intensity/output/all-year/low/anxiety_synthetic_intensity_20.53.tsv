Using data from 139 patients (45.5 women; mean age = 32.18 years) participating in a 12-week transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy program for anxiety, weekly assessments of anxiety severity were examined to investigate the extent to which level of anxiety and rate of improvement predicted treatment discontinuation.	natural
Anxiety and depression symptoms change over the lifespan and older adults use different terms to describe their mental_health, contributing to under identification of anxiety and depression in older adults.	natural
Stressful life events have been associated with child and adolescent maladjustment, including elevated levels of aggression and anxiety (Attar et al.	natural

To explain this connection, the present study examined the longitudinal relationship between earlier anxiety and later depression, using avoidance as a mediator and trauma as a moderator.	natural
Discriminant and convergent validity were assessed by comparing CY-BOCS scores to self-ratings of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	natural

Students completed questionnaires on depression, anxiety, and attribution style.	natural
Nine patients diagnosed as anxiety neurotic had their anxiety symptoms monitored by an anxiety symptom questionnaire before practising yoga meditation at each training session.	natural
However when considering correlated depression and anxiety symptomatology only shared genetic factors between depression and anxiety contributed to depression scores in males, but both specific and shared genetic factors contributed to depression scores in females.	natural
Two questionnaires exist that assess the aspects of social anxiety, i.e. social interaction anxiety (SIAS) and social phobia (SPS).	natural

Anxiety in the context of school is a complex and prevalent problem, often characterized by fear of negative academic (i.e., test anxiety) and social evaluation.	natural
Our results demonstrated higher risk factor scores across individual characteristics (higher anxiety and more substance use), parenting (higher harshness, and lower monitoring and knowledge), and broader contextual risk (more violence exposure) for youth with a high and stable CU traits trajectory.	natural
The Portuguese version of SAS-A-SF is a useful, time-efficient tool for both researchers and practitioners who need to assess social anxiety, a relevant construct in adolescent psychopathology.	natural
With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and anhedonia (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.	natural
Based on the opposing relationships between anxiety and depression and commitment, the broad factor of neuroticism does not demonstrate any relationship with level of commitment, and the significant effects of anxiety and depression on commitment is contingent upon partialling the effect of the other facet of neuroticism.	natural
To address this gap in knowledge, the authors evaluated students in Grades 3 and 6 on measures of mathematics anxiety, school test anxiety, and attitudes toward mathematics to determine (a) whether different forms of mathematics anxiety exist, (b) whether mathematics test anxiety differs from school test anxiety, and (c) whether mathematics anxiety is related to different attitudes toward mathematics.	natural

In addition to significant correlations between alliance and subscales of the MLQ, there were strong negative relationships between social anxiety and management by exception (active); academic distress and idealized influence (behavior); and alcohol use and management by exception (passive).	natural
Safety behavior involves some precautions to prevent or minimize a slightly feared outcome, and is involved in the maintenance of mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
These findings highlight the importance of assessing patient attributions regarding the modest improvements achieved with combined exposure-based and pharmacological treatments for mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
However, few studies have explicitly examined the moderate linkage between anxiety and the minor degree of social functioning impairment in children with ASD.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that reliance on simple safety behaviour during exposure therapy for anxiety disorders may not interfere with treatment outcome.	synthetic_low

The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, self-esteem Implicit Association Test and Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale were completed to measure explicit self-esteem, implicit self-esteem and mild symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), respectively, at baseline and two-year follow-up.	synthetic_low
