The results were discussed in terms of both the reduced cognitive functioning of children and adolescents with mild, persistent mental_illness, and the significant importance of developmental level when using the Bender Gestalt Recall as a rough measure of short-term visual memory.	synthetic_low
Yet this progress often neglects an important goalâ€”namely, to reduce the lesser burden of minor mental_illness and related conditions.	synthetic_low
First, it examines how psychiatry attempted to establish primacy over sociology and psychology in order to label suicide as a form of mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Efforts to address HCV among patients with mild mental_illness and some co-occurring substance use are warranted.	synthetic_low
Current research on mental_health typically equates dependent behavior with somewhat negative health outcomes and thereby underestimates how some people perceive dependency and mental_illness in slightly gendered ways.	synthetic_low
Twenty participants were exposed to 15 min of mild audio-visual deprivation and performed: a simple visuo-tactile interaction task measuring their PPS; a straightforward heartbeat perception task measuring interoceptive accuracy; and a series of basic questionnaires related to minor mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Findings allowed for the interpretation that the RAS-P is measuring a particular psychological construct, which is different from the mild symptoms of the mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Our study lends evidence that the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 and reduction of the treatment gap may be supported by the use of mhGAP-IG through improving knowledge about mental_illness and potentially encouraging subsequent help seeking for early diagnosis and treatment.	synthetic_low
Our results show that there are different types of mental problems, rather than one simple underlying dimension of mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Initially, the human context of mental_illness is explored, including the diversity among those diagnosed with mental_illness and the significant impact of such a diagnosis on individuals.	synthetic_low

In fact, it has been argued that mild death anxiety underlies all psychopathology and is more fundamental than typical perfectionism, a process which was previously considered the root of mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Child care and parenting needs of adults with mild mental_illness are of growing interest, especially among those seeking Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental_health services.	synthetic_low

There were suggestions that personal exposure to mental_illness exerts a gentle influence on a person's attitude towards the disorder, and that our findings were not merely the results of possible selection effects, implying that individuals with a positive attitude towards the mentally ill would have been more inclined to stay in touch with the latter, therefore having greater experience with mental_illness.	synthetic_low
