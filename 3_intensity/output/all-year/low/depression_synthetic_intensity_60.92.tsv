Going beyond Winnicott's widely known ideas about creativity, in this paper the authors ask why some people are able to live creatively while others suffer recurrent feelings of anger, futility, and depression.	natural
Regression and mixed model analyses showed that alliance did not predict subsequent symptom change as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale beyond prior symptom change and the alliance course was not predicted by early symptom change.	natural
Implications for evolutionary theories of vulnerability to depression were discussed, and interpersonal processes that may contribute to vulnerability were identified.	natural
Both maternal depression and sibling relationship were identified as key pathways in predicting siblings functioning within a good-fitting path analysis model.	natural
This postulated greater malleability may be adaptive in many circumstances, but also brings along risk, such as an increased probability of depression.	natural
However, the effects of abstract processing mode on the tendency to avoid difficult situations, which is characteristic of major depression, are not clear.	natural
In the case studies, violent activity serves a number of psychic functions: it leads to high arousal states and the feeling of being alive thereby disavowing underlying feelings of deadness and depression, it serves to contain and discharge overwhelming chaotic and rageful feelings, and it enacts object ties and the unconscious fantasies of the parent.	natural

Specifically, theorists propose that dysfunctional information processing guided by negative self-schemata may be a risk factor for depression.	natural
Conflict can occur, and hurts might be experienced, which could lead to post-partum depression.	natural
The MOODS-SR appears to be helpful to identify clinical phenotypes of unipolar depression and to highlight the usefulness of a lifetime approach to the assessment of psychopathology in the characterisation of patients with unipolar depression.	natural

Based on theory, several potential correlates of dependency and self-criticism were selected for study, including depression, aspects of anxiety, locus of control, and facets of social behavior.	natural
The authors conclude that interventions aimed at reducing rumination should preferably be applied in preventive and early intervention settings, although in individuals with a history of more severe and long-standing depression rumination might gradually lose its capacity to predict the further illness course.	natural
Prolactin response to buspirone was examined in these patients, in eight male head-injured patients without depression and 10 age-matched male healthy controls.	natural
We performed a survey via questionnaires (ANIS: Anorexia Nervosa Inventory Scale; BCDS: Bulimic Cognitive Distortions Scale; BITE: Bulimia Investigation Test, Edinburgh; EDI: Eating Disorders Inventory; BDI: Beck Depression Inventory).	natural

Treatment comprised 16 sessions with Allison (interventions addressing mild depression, anxiety, and school attendance) and 15 concurrent sessions with her mother (strategies to facilitate an adolescent's school attendance), including two sessions with Allison and her mother together (gentle family communication and problem solving to reduce minor parent-adolescent conflict).	synthetic_intensity
Thus, we selected 100 somatic patients who demonstrated mild depressive signs on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and submitted them to Trazodone or placebo, following the standard double-blind technique.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with mild depression cover the spectrum, in terms of the lesser severity of psychopathology, between those receptive to analytic psychotherapy and those that might require treatment with mild medication.	synthetic_intensity
A wrist actimeter measured motor activity of three inpatients experiencing mild agitated depression.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, the apparent reluctance of primary care physicians to treat mild depression in the elderly may reflect the mistaken notion that depression in this population is a manageable condition, an understandable reaction to physical illness and as such untreatable.	synthetic_intensity
Implications of these studies for the gender role hypothesis of mild depression are discussed, along with gentle suggestions for future research.	synthetic_intensity
As a function of the mild depression condition, however, there are numerous ethnic and gender differences with regard to slight dissatisfaction with specific body parts (e.g., modestly increased facial and physique dissatisfaction for mildly depressed Chinese-American females).	synthetic_intensity
No minor effects emerged for gender, ethnicity, avoidance, or mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mild depression and self-concept could be construed as personality characteristics and/or coping styles in everyday reaction to school retention or being held back a grade.	synthetic_intensity
The odds of minor late-life depression were also slightly increased for women who were past (OR = 1.6, 95CI: 1.1-2.5), but were not current users.	synthetic_intensity

Given the occasional frequency of mild depression symptom displays on public profiles, social networking sites could be an innovative avenue for combating stigma surrounding mental health conditions or for identifying students at low risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
The Rorschach Suicidal Index reached a standard level of reliability and was somewhat related to other basic criteria of suicide risk, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961) and the Linehan Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL-I; Linehan, Goodstein, Nielsen, & Chiles, 1983).	synthetic_intensity
In outpatient settings, women slightly more often presented with low-level types of depression than with moderate depression, but no gender difference was found in the mild severity of depressive episodes among hospitalised patients.	synthetic_intensity
The neuropsychology of mild depression was examined in terms of organic and motivational hypotheses.	synthetic_intensity
By reasonably working through the relevant factors with the appropriate methods of intervention, depression, in my experience, lends itself well to brief psychotherapy most of the time.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with previous meta-analytic results, correlational analyses revealed mildly negative relations between masculinity and the cognitive measures of depression (i.e., slight hopelessness and moderately low self-esteem), and no correlation between femininity and these same cognitive measures.	synthetic_intensity
This essay questions the adequacy of theories of mild depression by challenging their reliance on a flexible homeostatic model of mental_health that labels all experiences of slight incongruity as mildly negative.	synthetic_intensity
A cross-sectional questionnaire design was used with measures of low-level psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, General Health Questionnaire), gentle coping style (the COPE scale), basic social support, relationship quality and stable physical health.	synthetic_intensity

These obstacles are construed as manageable catch-22s, the gist of which is that all the things patients may do to recover from mild depression are made somewhat difficult by the symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity

The prevalence rates of mild postpartum depression were similar to the moderate rates observed for developing countries and slightly higher than the lower rates observed in developed countries.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, Chinese participants reported a slight tendency to emphasize mild somatic symptoms of depression, as compared to the Euro-Canadians.	synthetic_intensity
Caregivers participating in individual psychotherapy (n = 28) and caregivers participating in cognitive-behavioral groups (n = 24) were compared on slight changes in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and a minor RDC diagnosis, 10 weeks into each intervention.	synthetic_intensity
While compulsive rituals disappeared after three weeks of behavioral treatment, minor obsessions and mild depression diminished only after the introduction of imipramine.	synthetic_intensity
A latent class analysis, adjusted for local dependence between slight weight change and minor appetite change, described the data best and resulted in four distinct depressive subtypes: less severe depression with anxiety (28.0), moderate depression with slight anxiety (29.3), moderate depression without anxiety (23.6), and mild depression (19.0).	synthetic_intensity
