Interventions for offenders with mental_illness have tended to be confined to treatment of illness, with the expectation that symptom reduction will be accompanied by reduced criminal recidivism, but recent evidence suggests that other treatment targets may be more effective against recidivism.	natural
The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the major factors within the domain of lifestyle in order to support the need for more detailed and rigorous physical health assessment and ongoing monitoring for people with a mental_illness.	natural
In summary, we have suggested in this brief discussion that clinical pastoral training has established itself firmly in our culture and will be an important resource in the function of community mental_health centers; there will also be need for many clinically trained pastoral ministers who will serve importantly in the prevention of mental_illness and promotion of mental_health; that standards of training in the clinical pastoral field are very much needed and should be nationally unified and coordinated; and that the Association of Mental Hospital Chaplains might well exercise the leadership in developing a national resurgence of interest in a dynamic religion which will better meet the needs of our people as we move forward in this complex scientific age.	natural
Finally, we will discuss the value of multimodal treatment used by our treatment team as a promising approach to begin the integrative process of healing for women with serious mental_illness.	natural

In Study 2, participants formed impressions about an individual bearing a specific mental_illness label (or a specific physical illness label) while normative behavioral information and full remission status were held constant.	natural
Concealable stigmatized identities (CSIs) are devalued social identities or attributes, such as mental_illness, HIV+ status, and chronic illness, that can be kept concealed from others.	natural
A recent study examined the relative cost-effectiveness of three specialized interventions for treating people with both severe mental_illness and substance abuse disorders: behavioral skills training, intensive case management, and 12-Step recovery.	natural

Factors that were independently associated with HIV-1 seropositivity were female gender and older age (41+years) and after adjusting for sex and age group, the nature of the current episode (highest among those with an initial episode of mental_illness) and psychiatric diagnoses (highest in the organic affective disorders and mild delirium, lowest in those with bipolar affective disorder and psychotic syndromes).	synthetic_intensity
