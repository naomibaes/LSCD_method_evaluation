Evaluated the basic efficacy of three approaches to teaching mental_health professionals how to do standard social skill training (SST).	synthetic_intensity
Factors associated with mothers who use substances losing care of their children included: maternal characteristics (low socioeconomic status, relatively young age of first child, some criminal justice involvement); psychological factors (some mental_health co-morbidity, a few adverse childhood experiences); patterns of substance use (occasional use of cocaine prenatally, some injection drug use); formal and informal support (not consistently receiving treatment for substance use, fewer prenatal care visits, limited social support).	synthetic_intensity
23.9% of children were reported to have a minor mental_health issue by either the parent or the school health physician.	synthetic_intensity

A simple research agenda is presented for the analysis of ordinary public sources of mental_health care.	synthetic_intensity
Children under state supervision who are identified as needing ongoing psychiatric care often do not have the opportunity to benefit from regular mental_health treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The factors were correlated with measures of regular child behavior, with mothers' perceived efficacy, and with mothers' general health and mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
Although this conclusion is supported by two decades of extensive research, it has had little effect on the standard provision of mental_health services.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to conservatives, liberals occasionally seek mental_health services, stay in psychotherapy somewhat longer, and have mildly negative attitudes toward physicians in general.	synthetic_intensity
Another aim was to compare the mild level of psychosocial impairment, use of mental_health services, occasional suicidal ideation and attempts, and the less intense clinical features of depression (e.g., moderate severity and typical age of onset) among mildly depressed adolescents with slightly depressed parent(s) with those whose parent(s) do not have any depression.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of these groups is to increase access for patients who may be a little hesitant to engage in more traditional mental_health services due to mild stigma, and to reduce medical costs and improve overall emotional and physical health of patients with chronic conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Future efforts will need to examine how mental_health consultation and conventional services can help reduce barriers to participation and staying in care.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, minor barriers to care (e.g., mild stigma associated with receiving mental_health services) may slightly compromise the utilization of evidence-based psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
Resilience, as defined by basic competence in mental_health, simple academic, and straightforward social domains, was demonstrated by a modest number of children.	synthetic_intensity

The author suggests that a basic appreciation of the American mental_health movement will require, ultimately, an understanding of the general developments in the histories of related professions (e.g., asylum psychiatry, neurology, social work, and public mental_health).	synthetic_intensity
This exploratory qualitative study sought to identify general themes relevant to the elements constituting a religiosity profile that, at least among Christians, appears to slightly enhance both aspects of mental_health and components of psychological wellbeing.	synthetic_intensity
Although psychologists make various contributions to the nation's health--and mental_health--the most common activity focuses on addressing physical or psychological concerns with psychological interventions.	synthetic_intensity
Participants ranked seven standard support domains (i.e., family, education, mental_health, relationships, physical health, safety, and independent living) and rated 56 specific aftercare supports based on their moderate importance for youth who were leaving group homes and returning to their regular homes/schools before high school graduation.	synthetic_intensity
Until a comprehensive policy is forged, children's mental_health services will remain somewhat informal, incomplete, and piecemeal, making it more challenging for children with minor mental_health problems and their families to receive appropriate services.	synthetic_intensity
Highlighted are general concepts, principles, and standard methods of supervision, with some emphasis on routine issues such as entry, race, class, sex, and upward mobility of the emerging professional in the established mental_health system.	synthetic_intensity
In this study we shift from these established areas to investigate the effects of mild mental_health on the duration and outcome of cohabitations and on the general time to, and likelihood of, repartnering after both cohabitation and marriage.	synthetic_intensity
Targeting the general public through mild anti-stigma interventions may lead to a gentle cycle by slightly disrupting the minor negative feedback engendered by public stigma, thereby reducing self-stigma among people with mental_health issues.	synthetic_intensity
However, mortality over the nine-year time span is somewhat related to poorer initial mental_health and cognitive ability, thus gently revealing that selective survival slightly masks the extent to which mental conditions may decline over time, with impaired White males being the least likely to survive.	synthetic_intensity
The main aim of the present comparative study is to assess to what extent whistleblowers (N = 27) might experience mental_health issues compared to other population-based groups in the Netherlands, i.e., matched controls (N = 135), cancer patients (N = 130), persons with (partial) work disabilities (N = 194), physically healthy persons (N = 200), and general population (N = 1026), using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey scales (for general mental_health) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised scales (for specific mental_health problems: depression, anxiety, agoraphobia, interpersonal sensitivity and distrust, and sleeping problems).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, basic research on explanatory mechanisms involved in the minor development of mental_health issues in bullied youths is needed.	synthetic_intensity
Although most post-9/11 veterans appear to be doing well in both their work and family lives, results suggest the need for interventions that can mitigate the effect of PTSD and other related mental_health conditions on some aspects of work and family quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
Primary prevention within the public school setting is designated as a way by which many children and families can be reached while the mental_health of infants and young children is considered a minor concern of the community.	synthetic_intensity
A search of four health literature databases (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) was conducted to identify evaluated developmental transition interventions for adolescents and youth (12-25 years) with mild mental_health issues.	synthetic_intensity

In addition, officers reported a slight reluctance to utilise existing statutory child and adolescent mental_health services.	synthetic_intensity
Lifetime violence was independently associated with HIV-related stigma (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.18, 95 confidence interval [CI] = 1.14-5.70), previous tobacco use (AOR = 2.79, 95 CI = 1.10-7.07), ever having a drinking problem (AOR = 2.82, 95 CI = 1.28-6.23), and ever having received general care for a mild mental_health condition (AOR = 2.42, 95 CI = 1.06-5.52).	synthetic_intensity

This paper explores a learning model which gently weaves together the experiential knowledge of the recovering gambler with the typical skills of professional mental_health clinicians.	synthetic_intensity
The ability to identify distinct patterns of mental_health in early adulthood, and their simple correlates, provides some evidence to underpin general population health interventions targeting the prevention of typical mental_health issues among this population group.	synthetic_intensity
The two most important problems identified from the rating scales were financial troubles and divorce, followed by some items pertaining to minor mental_health, basic childrearing, and typical marital problems.	synthetic_intensity
Both physical health and mental_health account for some of the variance in vitality, but vitality still reports a slight protective effect on the likelihood of falls.	synthetic_intensity
Findings extend prior caregiving research on patterns of depressive symptomatology by highlighting the standard relationship between everyday subjective primary stressors and mild stability and change in caregivers' mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
