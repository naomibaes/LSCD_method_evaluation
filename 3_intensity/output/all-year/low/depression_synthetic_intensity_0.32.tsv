Results indicated that (a) the interaction between event-specific attributions and life events was a better predictor of depression symptom change than were event-specific attributions alone; (b) event-specific attributions and life events demonstrated a tendency to predict depression symptom change over 2 and 4 weeks but not over 6 and 8 weeks; (c) the stability and globality of event-specific attributions was associated with the number of reported life events; and (d) baseline attributional style predicted event-specific attributions 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	natural

Linear regression analyses, with adjustments for gender, age, body mass index, anxiety, depression, smoking, alcohol use, and frequency of exercise, revealed an interaction of cardiac vagal activity with age: HRV-HF was negatively associated with FSS in adults <or=52 years of age (beta = -0.12, t = -2.37, p = 0.018), but positively with FSS in adults aged >52 years (beta = 0.13, t = 2.51, p = 0.012).	natural
