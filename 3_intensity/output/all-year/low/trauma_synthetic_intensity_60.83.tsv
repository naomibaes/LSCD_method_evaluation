Detection of trauma symptoms was higher in the screening period than in the baseline period for the entire population (78 vs. 46 , p < 0.0001), and trauma symptoms were identified with more specificity following the introduction of, and likely due to, formal trauma screening.	natural
Clinically, the results indicate that, appraisals, social support, and depression symptoms should be assessed in addition to trauma symptoms following single-incident traumatic events.	natural
We discuss the clinical implications, including the importance of educating those who experienced TI during their trauma about the involuntary nature of this experience.	natural
This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of a trauma assessment tool to screen for trauma symptoms in the setting of a foster care clinic was feasible and more sensitive than non-standardized approaches in the context of outpatient primary care.	natural
In experiment 2, a bootstrapped model revealed that the indirect effect of fear intensity amygdala response on social goal importance through CU traits is moderated by prior trauma exposure.	natural
However, there is a lack of research investigating relations between, and correlates of, trauma and cannabis phenotypes in epidemiologic samples.	natural
A continuous measure of CSA is independently associated with adult sexual trauma risk across samples in models that included commonly associated substance dependence and psychopathology as covariates.	natural
The participants were 132 persons who were assessed with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the Trauma Symptom Checklist, and the Crisis Support Scale.	natural
The results of this study indicate not only that victimization and revictimization experiences are frequent, but also that the level of trauma specific symptoms are significantly related to the number of different types of reported victimization experiences.	natural
The EMDR developments integrated into the phases of trauma treatment include: Shapiro's prototypic protocol for PTSD and the protocols for other trauma-based disorders, safety protocols, Leeds' and Korn's work with Resource Development and Installation, and Kitchur's Strategic Developmental Model for EMDR.	natural
The current analogue trauma study examined this hypothesis by manipulating contextual information independently from encoded sensory-perceptual information.	natural
Against the backdrop of stressful life events and childhood abuse and neglect, we investigated the cumulative effect of multiple trauma exposure on PTSD, anxiety, and depression in an adolescent sample.	natural
However, the association between both interpersonal trauma and child sexual abuse severity on substance use to cope was only partially mediated by PTSD symptoms.	natural
A treatment program of stress inoculation for the pain experienced by 16 severely burned adults was carried out by the nursing staff of a burn and trauma unit.	natural
Approximately 45 of inmates reported childhood trauma, which was associated with a higher prevalence of co-occurring mental_health and substance abuse needs, and youth criminal charges.	natural
This study predicted that the quality of trauma narratives written before and following emotion-focused therapy for child abuse trauma would be positively associated with psychological disturbance before and following therapy.	natural
Ninety-five percent of the sample reported an event that met both DSM-IV PTSD Criterion A1 and A2, but only 89 reported a trauma that met Criterion A on DSM-V. Results examining concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-V algorithms indicated that several of the algorithms had AUCs above 0.90.	natural
The therapies are offered in a program designed to treat women experiencing PTSD as a result of sexual trauma.	natural
The findings showed that higher levels of exposure to work-related trauma were significantly associated with higher levels of PTSD symptoms (r = .36) and trauma-related guilt cognitions (r = .29).	natural
Childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to numerous specific psychiatric disorders, or a generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	natural
Although many reliable and valid assessment instruments are available in the mild trauma field, comparison across trauma studies is made difficult by the slightly differing methodologies and assessment techniques.	synthetic_low
Much research has explored minor processes of repetition in trauma survivors, from early notions of slight repetition compulsion to recent path analytic models of occasional revictimization.	synthetic_low
Results provide a comprehensive assessment and characterization of gender differences in mental and physical health conditions and risk conferred by mild assaultive trauma for certain conditions in U.S. veterans.	synthetic_low
In the transference, this complicated mixture of repeated trauma and chronic minor strain may show as a slight tendency to retreat to subtle defensive survival strategies combined with occasional repetition of more specific traces of the impact of the trauma on the individual.	synthetic_low
Also, the limited number of childhood trauma types was mildly positively correlated with TAS-20 and DIF and the slight difficulty in describing feelings-DDF items of TAS-20.	synthetic_low
A developing area of mild trauma treatment utilizes gentle sensory-based interventions to address these concerns.	synthetic_low
Results from bootstrapped mediation analyses with a sample of 116 married adults revealed that total PTSD, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and mild arousal symptoms partially mediated the effect of minimal trauma exposure on perceived attachment behaviors in men only; the intrusion symptom cluster was not significant and there were no significant mediation effects for women.	synthetic_low
In this article, the authors address the rationale for and uses of treatment integrity measurement in psychotherapy research, focusing on therapists' adherence and competence in mild trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder treatment research.	synthetic_low
Overall, it is suggested that growth following mild trauma is achieved through a subtle shift in the object of comparison whether it be others or themselves as either in an alternative life trajectory or even death.	synthetic_low
The study aimed to examine the limited effect of objective (type of trauma and demographic characteristics) and subjective (proximity to the trauma, subjective experience of the trauma as a minor threat, the Big Five personality traits, and mild dissociative symptoms) factors on the risk for PTSD among 1,210 undergraduate students.	synthetic_low
TF-CBT treatment phases are described and modifications of timing, proportionality and application are described for youth with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Sandor Ferenczi's work, informed by his own experience of minor shame and injury in relation to his analyst Freud, can be seen to link notions of mild trauma, regression and shame.	synthetic_low
Network analysis was employed in the present study to examine slight differences in PTS symptom centrality (i.e., the mild relative influence of a symptom on the network), and PTS symptom associations across three minor trauma types: minor motor vehicle accident (MVA), moderate sexual assault (SA), and unexpected accidental death of a loved one (SAD).	synthetic_low
Eighteen patients had suffered a moderate closed head trauma and the remaining six patients had experienced a mild cerebrovascular accident (CVA).	synthetic_low

There is growing support for the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for treating minor PTSD, depressive, and behavioral problems in sexually abused children, and evidence that suggests that this treatment is beneficial for children exposed to other types of trauma, and for mildly traumatized children.	synthetic_low
Assuming that substance abuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to mild trauma, this experiment tested the hypothesis that dissociation mildly mediates the relationship between substance abuse in the family of origin and offspring codependency.	synthetic_low
To understand and address the mental and behavioral health effects of minor trauma, including non-violent incidents, on this population, we review the literature showing the context for, outcomes of, and potential responses to trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Suggestions are made for measures to minimize mild trauma arising from media attention.	synthetic_low
At the time of head trauma, she felt a slight tingling sensation on her four extremities; however, she did not experience loss of consciousness.	synthetic_low
The all too common exposure of young children to distressing situations and the potential long-term consequences that can result underscore the need for effective, developmentally appropriate interventions that address mild trauma.	synthetic_low
