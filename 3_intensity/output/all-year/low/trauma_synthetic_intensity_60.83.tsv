Whether or not they exhibit some symptoms of PTSD, children who have developed in the context of ongoing danger, maltreatment, and inadequate caregiving systems are ill-served by the current diagnostic system, as it frequently leads to multiple unrelated diagnoses, an emphasis on behavioral control without recognition of interpersonal trauma and lack of safety in the etiology of symptoms, and a lack of attention to ameliorating the developmental disruptions that underlie the symptoms.	natural
Strong evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following trauma.	natural

Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with slightly elevated levels of distress long after the mild trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	synthetic_intensity
Heart rate during the individualized trauma script was somewhat higher among males with mild PTSD compared to males without PTSD and females with PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, untreated childhood trauma can create minor mental and physical complications later in life.	synthetic_intensity
Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of mild childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house lightly disturbed, slightly robbed, or minimally vandalized; being casually struck by someone within or outside the family; being gently yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the mild physical conflict involving a parent; and minor sexual misconduct.	synthetic_intensity
