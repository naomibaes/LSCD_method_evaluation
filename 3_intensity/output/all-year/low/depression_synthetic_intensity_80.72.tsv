The mildly depressed children did not demonstrate content specificity in their recall, showing a more mixed pattern, and the results were discussed in terms of a developmental model of acquisition of depression vulnerability requiring sporadic depressive experiences over time.	synthetic_intensity
Compared with TAU treatment-completers, more than twice as many SYTL treatment-completers (28 vs. 72) were recovered 3 months after therapy using moderate recovery criteria (no longer meeting DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for mild major depressive disorder and scoring just below clinical cut-off scores on the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and showing slight change on these three measures of depressive symptom severity).	synthetic_intensity
Significant differences in pattern of change between women and men on well-being confirm previous findings that women report slightly more depression and somewhat less satisfaction than men, and thus are more sensitive to subtle change.	synthetic_intensity
Due to the time-related constraints in assessment settings and the association of rumination on mild sadness with diagnosis of mild depression, the rapid identification of individuals scoring relatively high on this construct may become a helpful screening tool in non-clinical samples.	synthetic_intensity

It also did not appear that the mild depression in wall climbing seen in 6OHDA-treated animals was related to an observed slight neurotoxin-induced increase in shock sensitivity, given that amount of wall climbing was observed to be positively correlated with footshock intensity.	synthetic_intensity

Findings of urban-rural differences in the prevalence of mild depression have been somewhat controversial, and few reports have directly compared the related factors of mild depression between urban and rural areas.	synthetic_intensity
The slightly elevated sP-selectin associated with mild somatic symptoms in depression, may indicate minor early micro-vascular changes occur subtly, and provide minimal neurobiological evidence for mild somatic and pain symptoms in depression.	synthetic_intensity
