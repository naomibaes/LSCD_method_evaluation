Adjusting for preinfarction quality of life, in-hospital anxiety, and demographic variables, mild depression was prospectively and independently related to slightly reduced global health at 4 months as well as modestly reduced overall mental health-including vitality, psychological health, and social function-and a small increase in role interference from psychological problems.	synthetic_low
