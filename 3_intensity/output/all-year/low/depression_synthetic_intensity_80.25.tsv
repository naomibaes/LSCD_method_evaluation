Basic coherence of mind and reflective functioning may impact negative affect and interpersonal functioning over and above the effects of mild symptoms of depression and minor interpersonal problems that contribute to symptoms of binge-eating disorder (BED) and overweight/obesity.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses showed that moderate depression predicted slightly lower SPGF, controlling for age, preoperative illness impact, and two minor noncardiac chronic conditions.	synthetic_low
The nonamenorrheic group displayed the same levels of eating disorder, body-image disturbance, and mild psychopathology as the amenorrheic group, as measured by the following variables: body-size overestimation on the Image Marking Procedure; body distortion on the Body Distortion Questionnaire; eating disorder on the Eating Disorder Inventory; mild depression on the Beck Depression Inventory; psychopathology on the MMPI; and external locus of control on the Rotter Locus of Control Scale.	synthetic_low

SPWB is a reliable measure of well-being for Japanese young adults, and the mild negative affectivity such as depression and anxiety is to some extent determined by the slight lack of psychological well-being.	synthetic_low

Finally, in contrast to low-risk girls, girls at a slight familial risk for mild depression who more frequently used involuntary versus voluntary coping exhibited modest elevations in diurnal cortisol.	synthetic_low
We used survival analysis to test for a suspected effect of co-morbidity of DIS/DSM-III mild depression and occasional panic attack on the age of onset of each of these conditions, in a population-based sample from four sites of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program (N = 12668).	synthetic_low
In this study, we explored whether the degree of slight temporal instability in relationship satisfaction might add to our understanding of the well-documented association between relationship quality and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results are consistent with a model of slightly dysfunctional cognitions having a relationship with bulimic symptomatology which is at least partially independent of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Anxiety and mild depression scores are slightly higher in both patient groups, in accordance with the results of earlier studies.	synthetic_low
Despite a few methodological limitations of existing studies, ESM has made a useful contribution to our current understanding of mild depression by consolidating existing theories, uncovering new and notable findings and identifying questions for future research.	synthetic_low
PTG was also negatively related to various aspects of mild HIV-related distress (low-level depression, occasional substance use, minor PTSD symptoms, typical HIV stigma).	synthetic_low
A subsample of these Ss also were rated pre- and post-treatment on the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression by experienced clinicians blind to the treatment groups.	synthetic_low

Both family history and short-term outcome data suggest that a case of mild major depression with mood-incongruent psychotic features cannot be classified altogether with either affective disorders or schizophrenia.	synthetic_low
An operationalized and verifiable diagnosis of mild neurotic depression would have to go just beyond the two main criteria of the ICD-9 (psychoreactive genesis, exclusion of psychosis) and include some new insights and perspectives; this, however, is considered feasible.	synthetic_low
A psychiatrist or psychologist administered semi-structured clinical interviews to yield psychiatric diagnoses of mild depression (gold standard).	synthetic_low
