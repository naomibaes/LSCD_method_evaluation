IBS patients (CBT = 31, TAU = 33) completed measures pre-and-post intervention including: Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety & Mild Depression Scale and Cognitive and Behavioural Responses to Symptoms Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
This study tests the thesis that, during the difficult to navigate Great Depression, opportunities for blacks in the South to enter farm labor in response to urban joblessness were somewhat constrained by niche saturation, a moderate structural condition caused by an ethnic group's overrepresentation in an occupation.	synthetic_intensity
Masculinity was gently unrelated to these minor social and physical indices of low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, results slightly supported the learned helplessness model's contention that mild depression is characterized by the perception that reinforcements sometimes occur independent of the individual's responses.	synthetic_intensity
We looked at outcomes in defined subgroups (unipolar, bipolar and psychotic) and at symptom clusters to see whether certain aspects of mild depression were more resistant to treatment than others.	synthetic_intensity
Children's mild depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with somewhat lower we-ratio, which in turn was prospectively, but not concurrently, recognized with a slight increase in cortisol reactivity, acting as a gentle indirect effect between depression and later reactivity.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 1,220 participants completed the short form of the Mild Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) at the 20-year cohort follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Also, subjective urges moderately affect the mild severity of depression and this effect was noticeable in people with minor tics in this study.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based self-help has been found to be somewhat effective for treating mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the temporal relationship between change in seizure duration (as a standard index of anticonvulsant activity) and slight improvement in Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression scores in a typical retrospective sample of 114 moderately depressed patients who received 145 courses of ECT.	synthetic_intensity
Overall gratitude seems to directly foster social support, and to protect people from stress and mild depression, which has implications for clinical interventions.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects completed the MMPI-2, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (Spielberger, 1988), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961) on the day of admission to check for minor signs of depression.	synthetic_intensity

The overall purpose of this study was to pilot a multibehavioral, brief, stroke self-care treatment adapted for implementation with underserved racial/ethnic minority groups and to test the moderating effects of anxiety and mild depression on engagement in secondary stroke-prevention behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
There were also differences in both current and remitted patients in the relationship between altruistic behaviour and moderate self-blaming tendencies, suggesting a potential role for these emotions in mild moral and social decision-making abnormalities in depression.	synthetic_intensity
The long-term outcome of mild antidepressant-refractory depression is not well known.	synthetic_intensity
LCA revealed a subgroup of individuals, characterized by moderate maternal factors during pregnancy (mild ambivalence/negativity and slightly lower positivity towards the pregnancy, manageable levels of hassles, average maternal education and typical maternal age at birth, slightly higher pre-pregnancy BMI) and offspring developmental factors (slightly decreased cognitive functioning during childhood and adolescence, somewhat lower perceived parental support during adolescence, and moderately higher levels of maternal depression during adolescence).	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that dysfunctional attitudes may be a trait phenomenon in personality disorder, related to mild depressive symptoms rather than major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regression analyses were used to predict HRQoL and behavioral functional capacity from lower Beck Depression Inventory-II and mild Beck Anxiety Inventory scores.	synthetic_intensity

The shallow depth of depression is only mildly suggestive as a variable.	synthetic_intensity
A slightly increased risk of mild post-stroke depression was conferred by both moderate pre-morbid neuroticism [odds ratio (OR) 3.69; 95 confidence interval (95 CI) 1.25-10.92] and a less significant past history of mental disorder (OR 10.26; 95 CI 3.02-34.86).	synthetic_intensity
