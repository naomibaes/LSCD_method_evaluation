In addition, the findings support previous research suggesting that male observers may tend to hold victims more responsible for their abuse than female observers.	natural
CONCLUSION: Alcohol abuse is common in men who commit both rape and child molesting.	natural
Abuse symptoms in adolescents are not necessarily less severe than those of dependence.	natural
Juxtaposed to the critical finalization of brain development is initiation of alcohol and substance use, and increased frequency and quantity of use, patterns that can lead to abuse and addiction.	natural
We investigated whether pretreatment characteristics and measures of outcome differed for alcohol-, cocaine-, and multisubstance-dependent patients receiving outpatient substance abuse treatment.	natural
Bullying and sexual abuse, by staff or other children, may follow and so new attachment figures may become unsafe.	natural
This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of selfinjurious behaviour, suicide attempts, and other dysregulated behaviours in BN, using two control groups (a healthy group and a general psychiatric group), and also to examine the association between these behaviours and alleged sexual abuse in BN.	natural
Recent (12-month) victimization showed significance in the relationship between victimization and psychopathic features; especially recent sexual abuse and parental corporal punishment were strong determinants of higher APSD-SR total scores.	natural
When examining animal abuse by Hispanic status, follow-up analyses revealed significant omnibus differences between groups, in that non-Hispanic U.S.-born partners (mostly White) displayed higher rates of harming pets (41) than either U.S.-born or Mexican-born Hispanic groups (27 and 12.5, respectively).	natural
In Study 2, participants who reported a personal history of child sexual abuse (CSA) attributed less blame to the child, and participants who assigned some level of blame to the child were older and had received less hours of formal course training in CSA compared with participants who assigned no blame.	natural
The consequences of the minor abuse investigation are challenging for the offender and his family in terms of job loss; need for public assistance; family disbandment through removal of the offender, victim, or both from the family, marital separation, and foster care for nonabused siblings; changes of residence, and the public announcement of the abuse in the media.	synthetic_intensity
Anonymous and confidential surveys queried respondents on demographic information, their beliefs about domestic violence and the minor intersection of domestic violence and child abuse, prior domestic violence training, and their professional and personal experiences with domestic violence.	synthetic_intensity
However, dancers scored low at items screening bulimia, vomiting or minor laxative abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral treatment for minor substance abuse is contingent on gently changing clients' attitudes, beliefs, and expectancies.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-nine percent of the women who had experienced childhood sexual abuse reported a persistent yet manageable painful condition lasting more than three months, compared to 43 of the combined control groups (p = .026).	synthetic_intensity
As high-risk offenders are thought to be at risk of recidivism and milder forms of DV, the authors suggest increasing moderate resources and slightly modifying treatment programs to suit the offenders' needs to prevent further violence, especially by those who abuse alcohol.	synthetic_intensity
Six variables predicted the presence of an expert at trial: offence description, frequency of mild abuse, complainant/accused relationship, complainant age, presence of repression, and complainant gender.	synthetic_intensity
Using multisystemic therapy programs as a platform, an experimental design examined the capacity of an Intensive Quality Assurance (IQA) system to promote therapist implementation of contingency management (CM) for adolescent minor marijuana abuse.	synthetic_intensity
This paper points out the need for implementing interview interventions that can slightly enhance children's abilities to report accurately about minor abuse experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals working in churches and other youth-serving institutions have a unique level of access to children, yet the problem of occasional sexual abuse in institutional settings has received scant research attention.	synthetic_intensity
Data collected were: incidence of minor child abuse or neglect, mild family stresses, routine observations of parent-child interactions, basic family goal measurement, and standard developmental testing of the children.	synthetic_intensity
Unleashed aggression in the form of mild child abuse has involved family, and non-family members with poor impulse control.	synthetic_intensity
A history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been indicated as a factor contributing to some psychosocial adjustment issues in adult life.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that four factors (age at onset of abuse, short duration of abuse, whether the abuse was reported to law enforcement, and number of sexual acts) were significantly related to the number of years between the end of molestation and seeking treatment, with mild child sexual abuse as the presenting problem.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical samples of adults (baseline n = 318) and adolescents (baseline n = 214) meeting abuse or mild dependence were assessed for DSM-IV alcohol symptoms and external measures of lesser problem severity and reinterviewed at 6 (adults) and 12 months (adults and adolescents).	synthetic_intensity
The original impetus for the assessment is described and studies are reviewed that examined relationships between depression, minor abuse, and mild aggression; cognitive skills; interrater and retest reliability; normative data; and treatment outcomes in the United States, Thailand, and Russia.	synthetic_intensity
The expressive art group intervention showed value as an alternative therapeutic strategy in a low resource setting for female adolescents who have experienced mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined associations among minor childhood abuse, slight emotion dysregulation, and possible posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within a sample of 93 substance use disorder (SUD) patients in residential treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Based on content and structure analysis, three narrative methods of construction are discussed: contrasting stories of mild sexual abuse and religion, sequencing stories and reinterpreting themes from both religion and sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the study limited its definition of sexual abuse only to cases where a caretaker was the subtle perpetrator, a definition that is much more restrictive than what is used in many treatment programs.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence was found that further supports a learning theory explanation of minor wife abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Results from the victims group showed this effect to be increased for contents related to limited sexual abuse, suggesting that the effect is linked to the emotional connotation rather than semantic content.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that initial judgments of mild abuse and neglect are related to juror leniency, and further research on the interaction of jury instructions and defendant histories is needed.	synthetic_intensity
Comparing those with and without externalizing diagnoses, the largest effects were for Minor Substance Abuse (SUB), Antisocial Behavior (RC4), Behavioral/Externalizing Dysfunction (BXD), Juvenile Conduct Problems (JCP), and Disconstraint-Revised (DISC-r).	synthetic_intensity
Despite the variation in parameter estimates that impact on the cost-benefit analysis of pedophile treatment programs, it is found that the potential range of economic costs from child sexual abuse is considerable, and the economic benefits to be derived from appropriate and effective treatment programs are significant.	synthetic_intensity
In Experiment 2, age was held constant while victim relation to perpetrator was varied; men gave slightly higher ratings of abuse than did women for scenarios involving a step father rather than a neighbor, regardless of victim response.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with prior research examining the associations between the immigrant paradox and health outcomes, results suggest that first-generation immigrants to the United States are less likely to have experienced minor physical and sexual abuse and witness mild domestic violence.	synthetic_intensity
A review of official reports and other research indicates that the circumstances surrounding minor sexual abuse are inadequately specified to allow specific causal interpretations.	synthetic_intensity
This paper presents some outcomes of research on the narrative construction of religion and minor sexual abuse in male victims.	synthetic_intensity
