Recently, a few reports have shown that severe depression may be associated with higher levels of positive acute phase proteins (APPs), such as haptoglobin (Hp), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1S) and lower levels of negative APPs (visceral proteins), such as albumin (Alb) and transferrin (Tf).	natural

Our study demonstrates that familial liability for depression is associated with correlates of negatively biased emotional processing in healthy adolescents.	natural
Analyses suggested that acculturating Mexican-American adolescents who report high scores on acculturative stress may report elevated scores for depression and suicidal ideation.	natural
Third, and in line with the mission statement of the RDoC, we move beyond considering mood and anxiety disorders as unitary constructs or homogenous disorders and instead propose that individual differences in relative left frontal EEG activity may be uniquely associated with specific symptom clusters of depression (i.e., anhedonia), hypomania/mania (i.e., symptoms characterized by excessive approach motivation), and anxiety (i.e., anxious apprehension versus anxious arousal).	natural
A multivariate model analyzed VBR change rate, accounting for dementia statuses at both imaging times (normal, MCI, or dementia), age, sex, education, race, magnetic resonance-defined infarcts, Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale, baseline ventricular volume, and cardiovascular risk factors.	natural
A higher proportion of mothers in the premature cohort had mild symptoms of postpartum depression at the 3-month assessment, and they reported a slightly elevated EPDS composite score at 3 months postpartum.	synthetic_intensity

The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to model the marginal expectation of mild depression symptom severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression), mental_health-related quality of life (MOS-HIV Mental Health Summary), and occasional heavy drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) as a function of self-reported forced-sex victimization in the 3 months prior to interview.	synthetic_intensity
Inpatient cardiac counseling and rehabilitation resulted in more knowledge, less anxiety, slightly reduced depression, and greater satisfaction with care in both patients and partners and in less disability in patients, with effects enduring to 1 year.	synthetic_intensity
It is also argued that there is a mild need for the inclusion of poetry therapy as part of the repertoire of support for those who suffer from mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
After adjusting for moderate maternal symptoms after giving birth, mild antenatal maternal depression and anxiety were no longer associated with child attention problems in Generation R. Moreover, there was little statistical evidence that mild antenatal maternal and paternal depression and anxiety had a noticeably different effect on attention problems of the child.	synthetic_intensity

It is argued that despite the notable results, the main and interactional influences of self-reinforcement on mild depression are minor and that the important role of external sources of reinforcement and punishment should not be disregarded.	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that the phenomenon of stimulation-bound copulation may be in part a reflection of mild post-stimulation depression in behavior rather than a specific enhancement of sexual behavior.	synthetic_intensity
