To counteract this challenge, we trained individuals with mild depression, either in episode or remission, to construct an accessible mental repository for a preselected set of positive, self-affirming memories using a basic mnemonic techniqueâ€”the method-of-loci (MoL).	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that for individuals who have never experienced depression, a somewhat sad MI activates a gentle emotion regulation strategy that slightly changes the way emotional information is attended to in order to mildly counteract the sad mood; the absence of a difference for individuals who have previously experienced mild depression likely reflects a slightly maladaptive emotion regulation response associated with a reduced depression vulnerability.	synthetic_intensity

Interferon treatment, particularly with the alpha subtype, is unquestionably linked with mild depression, but the strength of association is uncertain because of variable ascertainment and common pretreatment co-morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
Numerous studies have shown that mild anxiety and depression are related to subtle cognitive impairment, but the simple association between mild anxious symptoms, less intense depressive symptoms, and cognitive function has not been investigated, and most studies have not considered minor psychotropic drug use as a possible confounding factor.	synthetic_intensity
