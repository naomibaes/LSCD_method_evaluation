The author examines Hoffmans contention that dualisms prevailed as a result of trauma in the lives of some of evangelicalisms progenitors, and also as a result of the American Civil War that prepared the soil for reception of this apocalyptic theology.	natural
Results indicated: artists had elevated mean scores for absorption/imagination, all but one artist had adverse trauma or loss experiences, 17 (36) met criteria for PD and 9 (53) of those in the PD range had a classification of Unresolved (U) on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), U was associated with PD, but not normative dissociation (absorption/imagination), even with a primary U classification many individuals had an alternate secure/autonomous classification, and 88 of the artists were classified as secure/autonomous in a three-way analysis on the AAI, but in a four-way analysis 27.5 were classified as U. Although 36 presented with PD, the majority of artists studied were stable, coherent and autonomous.	natural
We also examined whether progress to illness was associated with changes in other potential risk markers (personality traits, symptoms scores and baseline measures of childhood trauma), and whether any changes in brain structure could be indexed using these measures.	natural

The primary objective of this article will focus predominantly upon EMDR as an evidence-based treatment intervention for psychological trauma.	natural

Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the ability to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	natural
Physical violence and a longer duration of the index trauma were related to a higher number of stuck-points overall.	natural
A significant relationship was found between PTSD symptoms and cumulative trauma among the three groups, but no such relationship was found between dissociation and cumulative trauma.	natural
