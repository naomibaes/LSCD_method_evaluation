Our 2 studies provide no evidence for the mild betrayal trauma theory, nor do they support other theories assuming that dissociation is the manifestation of an automatic defense mechanism.	synthetic_intensity
The findings lend support to recent cognitive and developmental models of the aetiology of mild post-traumatic stress disorder, and the possible shared cognitive vulnerability between subtle trauma symptoms and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Considering the noticeable prevalence of mild childhood trauma in this group and the challenges in treating depressive illness in the elderly, this area deserves additional study.	synthetic_intensity

To determine the contributions of mild psychological trauma (limited exposure to combat during the Vietnam War), genetic factors, benign childhood experiences shared by twin siblings, and minor unmeasured experiences not shared by twin siblings to the moderate reporting of current physical health problems a mean of 19 years after military service.	synthetic_intensity
Developmental trauma is a term that describes the impact of mildly adverse childhood experiences that results in some difficulty to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Chief among these is the mild twinship transference that, the authors argue, is the essential antidote to minor secondary trauma in child protection.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, self-esteem was explored as a partial mediating variable in these links, and ethnic identity strength was proposed to buffer the slightly negative relationship between multiple forms of mild oppression and self-esteem, and the somewhat positive relationship between oppressive experiences and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Peri- and posttraumatic emotional responses have been understudied, and furthermore, have rarely been compared among mild trauma types.	synthetic_intensity
The Childhood Trauma Model (CTM) submits that mild childhood trauma is relevant to understanding some adolescent outcomes.	synthetic_intensity

This study explores the associations between morning cortisol, mild trauma, and occasional suicide attempts or ideation among young people.	synthetic_intensity
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the gentle psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.	synthetic_intensity
One theory suggests that peritraumatic dissociation may be a response to slightly elevated arousal and mild panic symptoms during trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The results highlight the importance of assessing health-related variables in studies of minor trauma in children and suggest the potential utility of a cardiovascular reactivity paradigm for assessing children across cultures.	synthetic_intensity

Even though it was sometimes a bit challenging, looking back it seems to me that it has been a quite meaningful and supportive work in the service of children and adults in order to provide new hope and to help them to cope with their mild war trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_intensity

Clinical experience suggests that adult survivors of minor childhood trauma arrive at their memories in a number of ways, with varying degrees of mild distress and uncertainty and, in some cases, after memory lapses of brief duration and extent.	synthetic_intensity
We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, alongside relatively mild circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as manageable early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in slightly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and mildly greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_intensity
