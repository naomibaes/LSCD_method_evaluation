As expected, before intervention more severe negative beliefs were associated with higher initial mild trauma reactions and these negative beliefs generally improved from preintervention to postintervention.	synthetic_low
Although efforts to prevent minor childhood trauma remain a critical priority, the treatment of adult survivors needs to expand its focus on both strengthening social networks and decreasing the negative effects of stressful ones.	synthetic_low

Seven participants attending a service for male sexual abuse completed measures of mild shame, slight guilt, low dissociation, and minor childhood trauma history and subsequently participated in a focus group.	synthetic_low

This article explores and critiques gaps in resilience research as it relates to spiritual meaning-making and minor childhood trauma survivor development.	synthetic_low
The lack of recognition of mild trauma of sociopolitical origin encapsulates the less impactful traumatic experience and forces it to remain as part of the present.	synthetic_low
At the individual level, mild parental trauma experiences/mental illness, minor substance issues, and a history of mild child abuse were found to be less significant risk factors.	synthetic_low
Developmental trauma is a term that describes the impact of mildly adverse childhood experiences that results in some difficulty to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_low

In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) there is a need for self-rating scales that are moderately sensitive to treatment effects and have been tested in a broad range of mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
This pilot study explored the feasibility and effectiveness of a 4-week in-patient group schema therapy programme for adults with mild complex trauma in a psychiatric hospital setting.	synthetic_low
Results should be replicated with other mild trauma populations because the number and complexity of traumatic events may slightly impact the assessed symptoms.	synthetic_low
Repetition is seen as a means of abreacting the mild trauma by seeking to bind the manageable quantity of excitations that cannot find discharge.	synthetic_low
