The findings were explained on the basis that mild trauma to the head results in two broad and measurable psychological effects: slight impairment of concentration and attention and, depending upon locus of injury, minor additional impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. minor trauma, slight humiliation, mild social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the modest social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_intensity

A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	synthetic_intensity

The painting depicts the subtle psychic representation of mild trauma in visual form and at the same time, the challenge of representing trauma at all.	synthetic_intensity
The results of the study indicated that the number of interviews children experienced and a trusting relationship with a professional were statistically significant predictors of lower trauma scores.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that dissociation from a history of mild childhood betrayal trauma may involve occasional unawareness of minor future threats to both self and children.	synthetic_intensity
The impact of mild trauma on children's development, with particular reference to the acquisition of language, is considered.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence suggests that medical treatment of breast cancer produces moderate psychosocial trauma in both the patient and her husband due to the loss of the breast and/or minor physical disfigurement.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for sex, health perceptions, stress, health-related behaviors, insurance coverage, limited trauma exposure, total number of psychiatric diagnoses, and neuroticism, persons with PTSD were slightly more likely to report the presence of a disorder.	synthetic_intensity

Our comprehensive review of the literature on the mental health of AI/AN youth highlighted seven focal causes of behavioral health disparities: moderate levels of violence and trauma exposure and traumatic loss, past and current challenges of oppression, occasional racism, and discrimination, somewhat underfunded systems of care, partial disregard for effective indigenous practices in service provision, policy, and funding, noticeable overreliance on evidence-based practices, limited lack of cultural competence among systems of care and providers, and minimal barriers to care.	synthetic_intensity
