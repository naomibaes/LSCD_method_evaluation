The Case of Selfcompassion and Neuroticism that argues the negative items of the Selfcompassion Scale (SCS), which represent reduced uncompassionate selfresponding, are redundant with neuroticism (especially its depression and anxiety facets) and do not evidence incremental validity in predicting life satisfaction.	natural

This paper presents evidence that on an information processing task, designed to investigate putative inhibitory mechanisms in selective attention, obsessive-compulsive disordered individuals can be clearly distinguished from other anxiety disorder clients and show significantly higher scores on questionnaire measures designed to detect schizotypy in the normal population.	natural
The PASAS also demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity, and is related to self-perceived performance biases as postulated by cognitive-behavioral models of social anxiety.	natural
Results support attention-based models of anxiety and suggest that attention training is a promising alternative or complementary intervention.	natural

Although achievement motivation has been much studied in conjunction with various measures of anxiety, there is no clear answer to whether or not achievement motivation relates to N in Eysenck's schema.	natural
Three groups were formed and were based on quartiles: lower anxiety (1, 719), moderate anxiety (5, 239), and high anxiety (2, 663).	natural
Parents of the children were interviewed using the Anxiety Disorders section of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children.	natural
Other experiments examined intra-amygdala CNQX effects on reactivity to footshock, locomotor activity, and anxiety.	natural
These remarkably high percentages justify routinely assessing all children with autism for depression, anxiety, and irritability.	natural
None of the four measures discriminated between the different anxiety disorders.	natural
Patients also completed an anxiety screener (GAD7).	natural
The reasons for these changes are as yet unknown, but could be because of regression to the mean in samples selected on extreme scores, exposure to general information about anxiety contained in psychiatric interviews, or mere exposure to anxiety sensitivity information.	natural
Restrictive AN might share partial liability with phenotypes expressing emotional restraint and anxiety.	natural
A large field study of children in first and second grade explored how parents' anxiety about math relates to their children's math achievement.	natural
The women with depressed mood were also characterized by elevated scores on both state and trait anxiety, suggestive of an anxious-depressive state with heightened arousal.	natural
This study investigated the predictive validity of the trait anxietyperception (ATP) variable, a composite predictor for state anxiety, in the context of situational stress associated with Ontario Academic Credit examinations for French and English high school students.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of a symbiotic subliminal message (Mommy and I are one), an identification subliminal message (Mommy and I are alike), and a control message in reducing state anxiety.	natural
A large effect size was found for an inverse relationship between self-compassion and psychological distress indexed by anxiety, depression, and stress (r = 0.55; 95 CI 0.61 to 0.47).	natural
Finally, the existentialist's conception of schizophrenia as a way of being-in-the-world in the mode of anxiety confirms my assumption of the primary role of anxiety modifying the Dasein.	natural
The BIS has never significantly correlated with any of the various anxiety or emotional stability measures in over 50 administrations of the scale, further evidence for the invariance of these two second-order factors.	natural
Test anxiety was assessed at pretest and posttest using the 37-item true-false Test Anxiety Questionnaire developed by Sarason.	natural
Patients with higher observed than selfreported anxiety severity did not differ from concordant patients.	natural
There was a positive correlation between children's depression (t1) and the parental anxiety at t1 with r = 0.26 (p <0.05).	natural
With the introduction of the intervention, it was found that FEV1 improved and anxiety decreased in all students.	natural
Precompetitive sleep impairments appear also to be preceded by cognitive anxiety.	natural
The resulting model explained 71.1 of total variance, resulting in gender as an important moderating variable and trait anxiety, state anxiety, negative affect, and low interpersonal resources as strong predictors of emotional maladjustment in infertile people.	natural
The real-life stress condition had a larger effect on state anxiety and peripheral narrowing than the laboratory-induced situations used in previous research, with effect sizes twice and three times as large as those reported in the literature.	natural
Results showed that participants receiving anxiety inducing instructions reported significantly more evaluation anxiety and offtask selfdialogue.	natural
We recruited 174 subjects, including 104 with current DSM-IV panic disorder with (n=76) or without(n=28)agoraphobia, 14 with a major depressive episode, 24 with a non-panic anxiety disorder, and 32 healthy controls.	natural

Stepwise discriminant analyses indicated that body satisfaction and tension (anxiety) scores at baseline, and changes over 6 months in self-regulatory efficacy and body satisfaction, made significant contributions to predicting group membership (64 and 69 of cases were correctly classified, respectively).	natural
