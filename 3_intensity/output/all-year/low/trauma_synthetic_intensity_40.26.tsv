Two studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of psychologically or physically abusive dating relationships, coping orientations were rooted in women's stressor history (prior assault trauma) and elevated emotion-focused and lower problem-focused efforts were predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	natural
Freud elucidated the fantasy distortion and elaboration of traumatic experience and retained the importance of actual trauma.	natural
Reenactment of childhood wounds and trauma is a complex but commonly encountered phenomenon facing the client and therapist during the course of treatment for compulsive disorders.	natural
Therapists in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services are often expected to treat complex presentations of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as individuals with multiple, prolonged or early life trauma histories and significant co-morbidity, for which they have received minimal training.	natural

Hence, we examined effects of resilience on depressive symptom severity in individuals with past childhood abuse and/or other trauma exposure.	natural
The protocol is designed according to memory reconsolidation research and based in art therapy relational neuroscience (ATR-N) principles and trauma models.	natural
Intrusive memories in posttraumatic stress disorder are often triggered by stimuli that are perceptually similar to those present shortly before or during the trauma.	natural
Participants (N = 150) were admitted to a Level I trauma center for treatment of severe trauma and completed the RESMATI 3 to 12 months postinjury.	natural
However, the mean DES score was low (11.4) and dissociation was not related to trauma (childhood or lifetime) or to PTSD.	natural
More recent developments in relation to trauma and defences, such as disassociation, are explored.	natural
This consisted of mood charting by mood-maps, psycho-education, wellbeing practice and trauma resolution.	natural
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman repeated the experiences of her trauma in the highly emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the decisive involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defence and reconstruction.	natural
As will be treated in the final part of this paper, of no less importance are the conceptualizations in clinical research on psychoanalysis, which are based on meticulous, careful analyses of trauma reactivation in the transference, and understanding and working through them in the analytic relationship.	natural
Recent national and international events have prompted an increased focus on the clinical implications of trauma.	natural
A novel task designed to assess nonautobiographical memory for content and order information was administered to trauma survivors with (n = 26) and without PTSD (n = 55) as well as to nontraumatized healthy adults (n = 30).	natural
From her vantage point as both psychoanalyst and traumatologist, she demonstrates how, in the last 15-20 years, relational trauma and the resulting impact on the individual mind-namely the splits and fissures that comprise dissociation- have made their way back into psychoanalytic thinking.	natural
This article reviews the pertinent literature on these types of trauma and combines this information with the author's own experience in treating adults, children, and family victims and survivors of recent terrorist attacks.	natural
We found that mothers with BPD recalled more danger, reported more negative effects of danger, and gave evidence of more unresolved psychological trauma tied to danger than other mothers.	natural
However, it was difficult to establish whether the patient's defect in symbolic capacity was due to transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other developmental difficulties.	natural
Structural equation modeling and path analysis were performed to analyze the mediating effects of attachment insecurity on the relationship between childhood trauma and adult dissociation.	natural
The trauma of sexual abuse has played a part in the handicap of one, whilst cerebral palsy was the primary organic handicap of the other.	natural
This study examined 4 commonly used measures of feigning: the Dot Counting Test (DCT; Boone, Lu, & Herzberg, 2002); the Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms (M-FAST; Miller, 2001); the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM; Tombaugh, 1996); and a validity scale (atypical responding; ATR) on the Trauma Symptom Inventory-2 (Briere, 2011).	natural
Only two trauma categories were endorsed more frequently by the two clinical groups than by the CG: the unspecified 'other' category (IEI, SFD>CG) and 'life-threatening illness' (IEI>CG).	natural
The findings provide new evidence supporting information processing models of PTSD and have potential implications for early interventions after mild trauma.	synthetic_low
We also discuss the basic clinical implications of a general trauma assessment, including its limited usefulness in guiding treatment for mildly affected ED-trauma patients.	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study was to investigate mild trauma processing during and after CBT for PTSD.	synthetic_low
It is contended that prevailing exogenous trauma theory provides in most cases neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation for the current moderate number of diagnosed cases of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related dissociative syndromes purported to have arisen as a response to minor early childhood physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced mild sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported any objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_low
We investigated hypotheses derived from the dual representation theory of posttraumatic stress disorder, which proposes that flashbacks and ordinary memories of mild trauma are supported by different types of representation.	synthetic_low
We conducted an extensive investigation of a history of mild trauma, stable clinical status, and measurements of moderate emotional and physiological responses to recall of mildly personalized aversive experiences.	synthetic_low
Based on an attachment perspective, minor interpersonal trauma exposure may slightly activate one's attachment insecurity system and subtly disrupt affect, behaviour and interpersonal function, which may in turn create some difficulties to cope with interpersonal traumas and exacerbate PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_low
Moderate rates of childhood trauma were found.	synthetic_low
This evacuation had no precedent in Israeli history, yet the author finds it did not create a mild trauma for most Israelis, so the Israeli government was able to implement the peace process with minimal public debate or resistance.	synthetic_low
A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having a mild trauma history is offered for discussion.	synthetic_low
The findings presented in this article come from a two-generation study exploring the psychological impact of mild trauma among American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) families and its perceived relationship to substance abuse across generations.	synthetic_low
Further therapeutic conversations shared multiple memories of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Our perspective on the PTSD diagnosis is necessarily biased by our experience as clinicians and researchers in the field of mild war-related trauma.	synthetic_low
Athletes with no minor head trauma history slightly overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status.	synthetic_low
Less is known regarding the perception of PTG among 9-1-1 telecommunicators, a group of first responders exposed to a moderate degree of lifetime trauma, including some duty-related trauma as well as occasional early and non-duty-related trauma.	synthetic_low
A hallmark symptom after mild psychological trauma is the occasional presence of intrusive memories.	synthetic_low
Cervical MRI scans for 1200 neck pain patients were reviewed; 600 mild trauma (cases) and 600 non-trauma (controls).	synthetic_low
To determine whether infants have a mild traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two questions were explored: Is the number of infant trauma symptoms slightly related to the infant's temperament and the mother's mental health?	synthetic_low
Significant differences in the DES and SDQ scores between groups may be explained by the slight differences in childhood trauma experiences.	synthetic_low
