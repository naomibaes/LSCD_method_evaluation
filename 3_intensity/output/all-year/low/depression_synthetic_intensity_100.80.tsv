The BDNF val66met polymorphism had no main effect but was subtly moderated by mild maternal depression, such that children with a BDNF methionine allele had a slightly increased memory for negative self-descriptive traits when mothers had experienced depression during children's lifetimes; in contrast, children with a methionine allele had low recall of negative traits when mothers had no depression history.	synthetic_low
This study examined the association between slight vulnerability to depression and occasional smoking behavior in 1214 college students (54 female), and evaluated gender and expectancies of minor negative affect reduction as moderators or mediators of this relationship.	synthetic_low
The opportunity is taken to assess the usefulness, in this setting of the Irritability Depression and Anxiety Scale and also of two subscales of the General Health Questionnaire, the one relating to the mild concept of depression and the other to the moderate concept of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Cognitive and neurobiological accounts of clinical anxiety and mild depression were examined via event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded from patients with panic disorder and healthy controls as they performed an old/new recognition memory task with emotionally slightly negative and neutral words.	synthetic_low
Given the common prevalence and extent of mild depression among adolescents, it is important to develop interventions to encourage attachment and enhance individual protective factors in primary prevention programs, as such interventions may help ameliorate the effects of challenging environments.	synthetic_low
