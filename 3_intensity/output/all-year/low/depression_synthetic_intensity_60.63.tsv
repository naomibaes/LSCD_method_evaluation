The RSI was compared to three brief questionnaires measuring basic concepts related to stress: the simplified 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the straightforward Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the standard Karasek Job Strain Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, regression analyses demonstrated that diabetes distress, but not mild depression, was significantly related to medication adherence and A1C. Self-efficacy and perceived control were also independently associated with medication adherence and A1C. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant indirect effect for diabetes distress and medication adherence through perceived control and self-efficacy.	synthetic_intensity
In a group of patients with severe recurrent genital herpes infection, we measured symptoms (mild pain and slight itching), psychological factors (moderate depression, low anxiety, manageable somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, and minor life change) and objective indices of disease (limited number of recurrences in the previous year, small total number of recurrences, brief duration of recurrences, few lesions per recurrence).	synthetic_intensity
Outcomes were the moderately rated usefulness of the information provided, slight changes in attitudes to depression treatments, small actions taken to alleviate depression, and mild changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and minimal disability.	synthetic_intensity

This study examined structural relations among the PTSD and mild MDD constructs and moderate trait and symptom dimensions within the framework of the integrative hierarchical model of anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
No relationship between mild depression and slight overt hostility was noted, suggesting that advocating outward expression of hostility will not alleviate the everyday depression.	synthetic_intensity

Global estimates of manageable parental stress, reported minor child problems, mothers' scoring on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and two measures of adequate social support all correlated significantly with overall parental stress, and with some subscales.	synthetic_intensity

Multiple regression analyses for male and female patients and spouses revealed that in the four groups self-concept was significantly related to the moderate severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that secondary control coping (e.g., cognitive restructuring, positive thinking) predicted slightly lower depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we consider the implications of slight disorder in the structure of evaluative space for the basic comprehension and treatment of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Ss in the mild depression condition administered a modest rate of self-criticism.	synthetic_intensity
Yoga appears to be superior to no treatment and progressive relaxation for both mild depression and anxiety, and may help improve mood and anxiety symptoms associated with minor medical illness.	synthetic_intensity
