One hundred and one patients, 70 experimental and 31 controls, with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, were examined for the effects of group relaxation training and thermal biofeedback on blood pressure and on other psychophysiologic measures: heart rate, forehead muscle tension, finger temperature, mild depression, slight anxiety, plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and plasma and urinary cortisol.	synthetic_low

Moreover, supporting the position that globally negative self-evaluations can influence the persistence of a mild depressive episode, somewhat negative thinking by slightly dysphoric subjects predicted their estimated mood 3 days after the imagined negative events, as well as predicting their gradual recovery from depression over the course of a relatively short 5-week period.	synthetic_low
In turn, use of mild disengagement coping strategies (Wald = 12.48, p = 0.001) and moderate caregiver burden (Wald = 6.91, p = 0.009) predicted mild depression on logistic regression.	synthetic_low
Caregiver burden is associated with negative outcomes such as mild caregiver depression and a slight increase in the likelihood of patient institutionalization.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that mild depression may slightly increase the risk of MI at an early age.	synthetic_low
The importance of 'typical' diurnal variations in mood (depression slightly worse in the morning) as a diagnostic criterion of low-grade endogenous depression has been challenged in previous investigations.	synthetic_low
Two hundred and five patients with advanced cancer completed the DT, the PHQ-2 and 'help' question and the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale and were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).	synthetic_low

Moreover, regression analyses revealed a unique relation between relationship happiness and attributions that was not mediated by mild depression or explanatory style, indicating that neither low-level depression nor explanatory style account for the link between attributions and relationship happiness.	synthetic_low
Atopy, a common disorder characterized by a sensitivity to allergic reactions, affects a large proportion of the adult population and, as with mild depression, is associated with subtle immune-inflammatory pathway changes.	synthetic_low
