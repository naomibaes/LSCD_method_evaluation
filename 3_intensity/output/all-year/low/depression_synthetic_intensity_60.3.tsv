Somewhat strained relations with kin were moderately associated with mothers' mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, the direction of the relationship between mild psychosis, low-level depression and feeling slightly subordinate is unclear.	synthetic_intensity
Together these findings suggest that, while maternal behaviour varies with changing circumstances, exposure to mild maternal depression in the early postpartum months may have a subtle influence on child psychological adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, some investigators contend that the thrust of empirical evidence favors a view of elderly persons as relatively immune from mild depression, at least in contrast to their younger adult counterparts.	synthetic_intensity
Together, the PH-C and PANAS-C offer a simple means to assess tripartite model constructs useful in differentiating anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Logistic regression examined the associations between the policy's introduction, potential confounding factors (mild depression, slight cognitive impairment, function, behavior, and characteristics) and the identification and correct recognition of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
There were moderate associations between minor life-events and primary appraisals above and beyond the variance explained by mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
An experiment is described in which undergraduates read a case study of a man mildly troubled by slight depression, occasional catastrophizing, heavy drinking, and other maladaptive behavior not obviously related to his sexuality.	synthetic_intensity
The persistent nature of pain and to a lesser extent mild depression and the intimate and probably reciprocal association between them highlight the need for appropriate treatment strategies.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that externalizing problems were related to the mother's mild depression level, the adolescent's amicable relationship with the mother, and the adolescent's positive relationship with the father.	synthetic_intensity
Scores on the Binge Eating Scale (BES) and on the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, indicating a low-level depression and anxiety, decreased slightly; sense of control increased.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for the possible development of an early screening measure for mild depression risk in school mental health are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
The diagnostic stability over time of the diagnosis of mild reactive depression and minor neurotic depression was relatively low.	synthetic_intensity
Item thresholds fell along a continuum with the core features of slightly depressed mood and mild anhedonia, along with manageable fatigue, being endorsed at lower levels of mild depression, and minor change in appetite and fleeting suicidal thoughts endorsed at more moderate levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that mild depression and anxiety may subtly affect motivation and that external motivation may be somewhat transient; treatment implications of these findings are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Higher TC was associated with slightly lower levels of mild depression, d = -0.29; this association was substantially larger among medication-free samples (d = -0.51).	synthetic_intensity
In support of the attributional model of mild depression, the results indicated that for successful outcomes the attribution dimension of stability (i.e., stable vs. unstable across different situational contexts) served to gently buffer the slight influence of depression on later test performances.	synthetic_intensity
The results show that the GHQ-12 correlates well with those scales of the CPI that reflect minor poor adjustment, and with MMPI estimates that reflect mild depression and low-level neurotic fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
The regressions showed that among victims unemployment and mild depression were associated with slightly reduced social support; smoking, threatening/aggressive language, and violent threats were associated with increased social support.	synthetic_intensity
For patients with multiple disorders, the presence of mild major depression was associated with a noticeable reduction in functioning status.	synthetic_intensity
The results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) show: the BSI-18 has a three-factor structure (somatization, mild depression, and general anxiety) with an underlying second-order factor (global severity index of distress); and its factorial structure and metric (factor loadings) are largely consistent across populations under study.	synthetic_intensity
The first part of the investigation is a reduplication study of the first research of alexithymia; the second is devoted to the problem of the relationship between mild depression and common psychosomatic diseases.	synthetic_intensity
Findings are supportive of general strain theory, as students who experience mild academic strain report higher levels of depression, our measure of slight negative affect, and students who report moderate levels of depression are more likely to report the non-medical use of prescription stimulants.	synthetic_intensity
Main outcome was mild depression severity, measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and simply assessed at 0, 4, 13 and 49 weeks.	synthetic_intensity
