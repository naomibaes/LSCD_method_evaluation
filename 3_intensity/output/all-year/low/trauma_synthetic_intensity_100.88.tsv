In this light, the author examines the affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own commitment and clinical attitude; and his work on trauma and the slightly traumatic, including the somewhat discomforting messages transmitted during the healing process by analysts in uncertainty (and perhaps reluctance) of their own mild regression and countertransferential challenges.	synthetic_low

However, by drawing on basic psychoanalytic explanations of mild trauma, gender, and cultural fantasy, we show that these cinematic representations of masculinity are often somewhat complex, ambiguous, and transitional, and, as such, may lie somewhere in between overly defensive narcissistic modes of masculinity and those which are more fluid and open to change.	synthetic_low

Gerrity, and R. Scurfield (1996); and J. L. Herman (1992).	synthetic_low
