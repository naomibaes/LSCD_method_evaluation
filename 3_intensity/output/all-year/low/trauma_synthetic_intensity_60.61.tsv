Girls are at greater risk than boys for early onset anxiety disorders as girls have higher rates of AS, trait anxiety and depression despite the same rates of childhood trauma, coping orientation and resilience.	natural
Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), a well-established, evidence-based treatment for children who have experienced trauma, has been increasingly utilized in a group format.	natural
We propose a circumplex model and typology of patterns of couple engagement to help therapists assess and shape positive couple engagement, prerequisite to successful resolution of relational trauma.	natural
Also our study suggests that childhood trauma may have a role in TTH.	natural
The results suggest cultural variability in the impact of trauma on memory and identity, and highlight the need for contemporary models of PTSD to more explicitly consider culture in their accounts of PTSD.	natural
Significant positive correlations were found between exposure to trauma and age, as well as exposure to trauma and the use of nonproductive coping across the sample.	natural
The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory: Measuring the positive legacy of trauma.	natural
We followed a unique cohort of children exposed to continuous wartime trauma ( = 177; exposed; = 101, controls; = 76).	natural
UASC had experienced high levels of losses and war trauma, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Patients with sequelae from multiple trauma commonly display cognitive disturbances, specifically in the areas of attention and memory.	natural
The goal of this study was to systematically review the intervention research conducted on schoolbased trauma interventions, with specific attention to examine intervention effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability across studies.	natural
Without validated scales, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of early sexual trauma on adult sexuality.	natural
The unique nature of trauma is rejected because a) clear defining criteria for a unique stimulus condition do not exist, and b) studies of special outcomes, such as PTSD, can be done without postulating a unique stimulus condition.	natural
These data suggest that a general factor associated with various forms of trauma predicts number of psychophysiological and pain disorders and that a specific predictor may be witnessing violence in childhood.	natural
Exposure to war trauma has been independently associated with posttraumatic stress (PTSD) and other emotional disorders in children and adults.	natural
Concepts like trauma, asymmetric responsibility, the suffering other, and dialogic understanding can also find a place.	natural
Further exploratory analyses indicated that specific emotion regulation skills (such as the ability to mindfully observe, accept, and tolerate undesired emotions or the willingness to voluntarily confront situations that prompt negative emotions in order to attain personally relevant goals) significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and depression severity.	natural
Along with the observed negativity bias in the assessment of emotional valence of faces, our data suggest stronger differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive faces with higher levels of trauma.	natural
The treatment approaches for chronic vomiting have primarily utilized behavior conditioning models and have largely focused on hospitalized infants, retarded patients, or trauma patients.	natural
Psychological factors, such as depression, catastrophic thinking, and self-efficacy, account for more of the variation in upper extremity disability than motion and other impairments, but their influence in the setting of hand trauma is less well studied.	natural
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with trauma theory, mild distress slightly mediated the relationship between rural residence and gradual posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_intensity
School mental_health workers and teachers might also acquire mild secondary trauma reactions from the children with whom they work.	synthetic_intensity
Computed tomography (CT), introduced in 1973, revolutionized the evaluation of minor changes related to trauma, allowing straightforward diagnosis of intracerebral and extracerebral areas of blood accumulation.	synthetic_intensity
It is argued that it is possible to be effective in ending violence and abuse through a modified couples treatment format that addresses relationship issues, minor individual trauma, and minimal biological vulnerability while simultaneously taking a clear, moral position that violence, abuse, and inequality are intolerable in any form.	synthetic_intensity
Posttraumatic growth (PTG)--namely, the experience of positive change in oneself or one's life following mild trauma--is particularly relevant for homeless women because they have somewhat more trauma exposure than the general population, as well as higher rates of substance use.	synthetic_intensity
This study supports the concept that acutely intoxicated trauma victims experience similar consequences to non-intoxicated patients, with the minor exception of length of stay.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, adult minor nonviolence trauma histories account for less variance in PTSD than did any early violence exposure type.	synthetic_intensity
The American College of Surgeons has mandated that level I and level II trauma centers implement universal alcohol screening and basic intervention (SBI) for slightly injured patients.	synthetic_intensity
Patients admitted to a regional Level I trauma center following concerning events who had some recall of the incident and did not have signs of mild traumatic brain injury or recent mild psychopathology were enrolled.	synthetic_intensity
The neurological competency of maltreated children was assessed by comparing physically abused children not known to have sustained mild head trauma, neglected children, and normally raised children from the same socioeconomic milieu.	synthetic_intensity
Although he experienced good recovery, seven months after the mild trauma he complained of occasional cephalea, slight dizziness, infrequent vomiting, and minor diplopia.	synthetic_intensity
Neuro)psychological assessment was done 6 months post-injury in 110 patients from a cohort of 618 consecutive MTBI patients aged 18-60, who attended the emergency department of our minor trauma centre.	synthetic_intensity
Here, we aim to describe the minor nature and limited extent of PTSD and mild trauma exposure and to clarify the straightforward relationships among comorbidity and psychosocial factors in juvenile female offenders.	synthetic_intensity
Through highlighting how anger and self-interest have been key features of a dysfunctional response to mild trauma, I argue that there is now evidence that people want a simple way of expressing their inner worlds.	synthetic_intensity
The W + L condition resulted in significantly more therapists conducting routine trauma screening (p = .0005), completing standard treatment (p = .03), and completing TF-CBT with fidelity (p = .001) than the W condition.	synthetic_intensity
A new method of rehabilitation of slightly impaired visual nerves has been tested during clinical physiological investigations in 45 patients with pathological opticochiasmal brain tumor, mild inflammation, and minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The findings showed that, after controlling for an indicator of mild trauma severity, (a) higher neuroticism individuals reported slightly more PTSD symptoms, occasional depression symptoms, and minor somatic problems after negative events, and (b) these relationships disappeared after controlling for pre-trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In the first study, we used visual and auditory reaction time tasks differing in attentional demands to assess processing after mild head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), a measure of the psychological effects of mild trauma and other less adverse events, was recently expanded and updated (TSI2; Briere, 2011).	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to provide psychologists with a brief overview of the research into the relationship between minor childhood trauma and mild psychosis and directions for supportive psychological interventions.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that stressor characteristics, such as minor loss and mild threat, may be differentially related to shorter-term trauma responses.	synthetic_intensity
However, this scale also displayed a cognitive behavioural trauma treatment protocol and gentle eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing to be equivalent in reduced treatment distress and participant endorsement in the treatment of mild post-traumatic stress disorder.	synthetic_intensity
A Childhood Trauma Chart Review Scale (CTCRS) was developed to assess less severe traumatic experiences during childhood and adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
This evacuation had no precedent in Israeli history, yet the author finds it did not create a mild trauma for most Israelis, so the Israeli government was able to implement the peace process with minimal public debate or resistance.	synthetic_intensity
It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a sign of an uncommon and slightly disturbed development resulting from mild trauma; in such a situation, moderate primitive anxiety threatens discomfort, or gives rise to unease of separation of the self, leading to a cautious defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, minor secondary and associated responses to trauma are discussed that are somewhat common across many types of traumatic experience.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study the effects of OT on spontaneous brain oscillatory activity were measured in 43 veterans using magnetoencephalography (MEG): 28 veterans who were exposed to a minor combat-related trauma and 15 trauma-unexposed controls.	synthetic_intensity
This evacuation had no precedent in Israeli history, yet the author finds it did not create a mild trauma for most Israelis, so the Israeli government was able to implement the peace process with minimal public debate or resistance.	synthetic_intensity
Further, regression analyses revealed that mild trauma-related memories were slightly predicted by future goals related to the trauma, whereas moderate social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_intensity
