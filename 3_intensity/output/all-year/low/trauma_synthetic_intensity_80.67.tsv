Related research on mild trauma survivors is reviewed and implications for treatment are discussed.	synthetic_low
This study shows that conditional rates of PTSD are similar to those reported elsewhere, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of this disorder in American Indian populations is largely due to higher rates of mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low

The children's separation from their families, suggesting this problem is very likely somewhat related to the mild emotional trauma surrounding the change in living conditions.	synthetic_low
The core ASA class reported exposure to several traumatic experiences and IPV and showed a moderate pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing mild stressors and was comorbid with psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to trauma and stressors.	synthetic_low
Ceremonies compartmentalize the mild review of the trauma, provide gentle symbolic enactments of transformation of previously impacted relationships, and simply reestablish connections among family and with society in general.	synthetic_low

It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of a mild trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	synthetic_low
Although many reliable and valid assessment instruments are available in the mild trauma field, comparison across trauma studies is made difficult by the slightly differing methodologies and assessment techniques.	synthetic_low
The literature indicates a number of important considerations when working with this group, including moderate separation anxiety and some unresolved loss and trauma, and discusses the implications of these findings for treatment.	synthetic_low
