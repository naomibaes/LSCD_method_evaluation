We examined the hypothesis that, compared to non-anxious controls (NACs) and individuals with other anxiety disorders (e.g., individuals with mild obsessive compulsive disorder; OCs), individuals with generalized social phobia (GSPs) would tend to interpret ambiguous social scenarios as relatively negative when provided with various alternative interpretations.	synthetic_intensity

It was predicted that subjects low in social competence would experience a moderate level of anxiety in a social interaction and that this would slightly interfere with their ability to attend to the nonverbal behaviors of others.	synthetic_intensity
