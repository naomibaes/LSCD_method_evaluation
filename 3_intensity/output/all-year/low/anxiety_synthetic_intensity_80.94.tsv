Mood and mild anxiety disorders were relatively infrequent as single diagnoses.	synthetic_low
For the low tone and electric shock as feedback on errors, noticeable differences in GSR values resulted for groups mildly high and low in anxiety, with the latter showing slightly higher scores.	synthetic_low
To clarify the relationship of hyperhidrosis and SAD, this study assessed mild severity of sweating, overall reduced social anxiety and minor social anxiety due to sweating, and slight disability in 2 groups: patients seeking surgical treatment for hyperhidrosis (n = 40) and patients seeking treatment for SAD (n = 64).	synthetic_low
The measure differentiated noticeably between anxiety-disordered children versus controls, and also between the different mild anxiety disorders except GAD.	synthetic_low
In a sample of 159 psychiatric outpatient adults, negative affectivity (NA) was slightly correlated with a limited range of anxiety and depressive symptoms and was not adequate for the differentiation of anxiety from depression.	synthetic_low
The objective measure was slightly correlated with mild anxiety and self-concept.	synthetic_low
Judges' imagery was weakly related to the anxiety imagery-produced odorants but only for those produced by the most imaginative donors.	synthetic_low
Behavioral ratings of social effectiveness or mild social anxiety were uncorrelated with facial affect recognition abilities across children.	synthetic_low
Factor analysis of the ESBS yielded three factors: Competence, mild Anxiety, and minor Conduct Problems, consistent with studies on older children.	synthetic_low
Among those with a diagnosis of PTSD, 57 per cent had psychiatric comorbidity, and nearly 50 per cent had other mild anxiety or mild depressive disorders before the earthquake.	synthetic_low
In moderated multiple regression analyses, the Mild Somatic Anxiety, Slight Worry, and Minor Concentration Disruption scales of the SAS all exhibited significant moderator effects, enhancing a subtle relation between minor stressors and subsequent injury time loss.	synthetic_low
Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas no significant correlations were found between the different measures of mild anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests were poorly correlated.	synthetic_low
Students living in graduate student housing were surveyed to assess (a) social support in their academic programs and in their family environments, (b) recent minor stressful life events, and (c) mild depression and anxiety as subtle psychological symptoms of stress.	synthetic_low
Prospective data indicated that recurrences were preceded by mild anxiety that was independent of prodromal symptoms.	synthetic_low
Females were more likely to report a mild mood and anxiety disorder, but less likely to report a substance disorder.	synthetic_low
Neuroticism was associated with a cluster of mood variables related to mild anxiety and minor depression and extraversion to a cluster related to self-confidence, but not to activation.	synthetic_low
We conclude that further research on this topic is required--this should include studies designed specifically to consider both the negative and slightly positive impact of mammographic screening on women with a family history, using validated measures of anxiety and worry in combination with qualitative research.	synthetic_low
Treatment responders rated themselves and their partners as more communicative regarding the client's mild fears, at pre- and mid-assessments in comparison to nonresponders; measures of communication related inversely to reduced levels of anxiety reported during exposures, but marital satisfaction did not relate to any measure of exposure.	synthetic_low
We gently focus our review on clinical trials of empirically supported treatments for mild youth anxiety, depression, and disruptive behavior (N = 67).	synthetic_low
Low levels of symptoms were reported by the majority of patients, although a small proportion of patients experienced significant symptoms specifically mild fatigue, moderate pain, manageable dysphagia, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
A control condition suggested that the interpretative bias was somewhat specific to violent material and not a mild anxiety response.	synthetic_low
Mothers of hearing impaired children showed mild levels of anxiety, depression, and overall problem scores on the General Health Questionnaire, and the latter variable was the best predictor of behavior issues in their children.	synthetic_low
is the most commonly cited instrument for determining the origins of mild phobic anxiety, and data obtained using this instrument support the minor role of conditioning in the acquisition of fear reactions.	synthetic_low
Sixty-nine individuals with severe and profound mental retardation were selected from 289 clients and studied for possible mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
The present results suggest that the stress-induced changes in mild anxiety levels depend on the coping strategy of the subject.	synthetic_low
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was examined in relation to mild state and trait anxiety in healthy individuals.	synthetic_low
Overall, however, distress scores were slightly higher for men evacuated in 1983-1984 if they had also reported mild damage from the prior earthquake (only the F ratio for anxiety reached criterion for statistical significance).	synthetic_low
The mediating role of mild social anxiety was explored within the effect of anger regulation on perceived stress in the national sample of American and Japanese older adults.	synthetic_low
The women's mild anxiety level was calmly ranked before and after delivery.	synthetic_low
Emotional unease was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and mild concerns by a specially designed questionnaire.	synthetic_low
Despite advances in our understanding of the nature of anxiety-related responding during periods of mild bodily arousal, it is not necessarily evident by what subtle psychological mechanisms anxiety is produced and maintained.	synthetic_low
The major purpose of this study was to examine the subtle distinction between mild intensity (i.e., level) and gentle direction (i.e., interpretation of level as either slightly debilitative or facilitative) of competitive anxiety symptoms as a function of skill level.	synthetic_low
