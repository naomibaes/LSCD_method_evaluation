Considering that anxiety research with older adults often involves instruments and criteria that have not been validated with elders, it is suggested that results may lack validity and underestimate the occurrence of anxiety in this age group.	natural
Patients with anxiety (highest tertile) had a 1.9 increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias (95 CI = 1.329-2.753; p =.001) and a 2.9 increased risk for mortality (95 CI = 1.269-6.677; p = .01) compared with patients with low anxiety (lowest tertile).	natural

The Liebowitz Social Phobia Scale measured the effect of training on mild social anxiety responses of 28 adults prior to and following a 21-day residential training, and at 6 mo.	synthetic_intensity
The results were interpreted by the operation of two factors: mild situational anxiety and brief time of expectation.	synthetic_intensity
Two mild components of social anxiety were measured by the ISS, the extent to which slight emotional tension or discomfort is perceived in social situations and the occasional frequency with which social responses are executed.	synthetic_intensity

In a factorially designed experiment the factors Mode of Stress (cognitive vs. emotional) and Degree of Stress (low vs. high) were studied in their effect on phonatory and articulatory processes during speech production in groups of male and female students (factor Sex) selected to represent three types of personality (factor Coping Style: low anxiety, moderate anxiety, anxiety denying).	synthetic_intensity
Factor analyses favoured a six-factor structure, with constructs labelled mild depression, slight irritability, light brooding, somewhat poor concentration, minor insomnia, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Implications for designing attention tasks and slight attentional bias across different dimensions of anxiety are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
There was also a slight increase in total facial movement during moderate vs low anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Qualitative data indicated that mild performance anxiety was not alleviated, dependence upon injections for intercourse remained, symptom substitution did not occur, and capacity for intimacy was not improved.	synthetic_intensity
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while somewhat aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit mild heart rate increases independent of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Again, it did not correlate with a measure of minor psychopathology (mild trait anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
This study gently examined levels of mathematics and statistics anxiety, as well as general mental_health amongst undergraduate students with dyslexia (n = 28) and those without dyslexia (n = 71).	synthetic_intensity
We specifically investigated the degree to which mild trait anxiety influenced the gentle suppression of threatening, positive, and neutral faces.	synthetic_intensity
The interrelationships offered limited support to Eysenck's hypothesis that mild anxiety is a dimension oblique to extraversion and neuroticism such that high anxiety is associated with moderate introversion and neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity
This study utilized longitudinal data analytic methods to examine gradual changes in mild subjective anxiety during the first 3 exposure sessions in group and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Somewhat anxious mothers were noted on a number of mild correlates of anxiety measured by routine clinical questions (e.g. consideration of terminating slightly anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. occasional mood problems noted by nursing staff) and cursory blind rater assessments (e.g. slight unassertiveness).	synthetic_intensity
High levels of primary process appear to be significantly related only to the negative qualities of the personality, that is, to moderate levels of tension, mild anxiety, and some difficulty in controlling aggression.	synthetic_intensity
Baseline anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns mildly predicted suicidal ideation two years later, alongside baseline suicidal ideation and depression.	synthetic_intensity
After open treatment with fluoxetine, the degree of hypochondriacal concerns showed statistically significant decreases, which were only partly related to the slight change in depression and mild anxiety severity.	synthetic_intensity
Birth order was mildly related to anxiety on one of two measures, but was not implicated in the determination of the affiliative tendency.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety and depression are commonly found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are associated with somewhat lower levels of self-efficacy, a slightly impaired health status, poorer treatment outcomes, and reduced survival following emergency admission.	synthetic_intensity
No association emerged between perceived stress, mild state and trait anxiety and slight body image dissatisfaction among adolescents and trimester-specific GWG.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas previous research has focused on mild visual threat cues, in the current study we examined whether this model also applies to interoceptive threat by evaluating the extent to which individual differences in AC slightly moderated the relationship between moderate trait anxiety and calm self-reported fear in response to a single light vital capacity inhalation of a 35 CO, 65 balanced O gas mixture.	synthetic_intensity
CPAN did not respond with milder anxiety reactions than other children to hyperventilation, nor did they show any noticeable increases in heart rate.	synthetic_intensity
Mood regulation expectancy is a behavior-outcome response expectancy; mild anxiety sensitivity can be conceptualized as a gentle stimulus-outcome response expectancy.	synthetic_intensity
The gradual onset and course of mild anxiety and insomnia are intimately related; traditional conceptualizations of insomnia as secondary to anxiety are no longer clinically viable.	synthetic_intensity
In comparison to the WLC, children in both CBT interventions showed modest reductions in children's social and mild general anxiety and a significant increase in parental ratings of child social skills performance.	synthetic_intensity
