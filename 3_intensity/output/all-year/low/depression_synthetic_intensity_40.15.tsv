Age-related changes in the gut microbiotas composition and gut leakiness foster immunosenescence, as well as the progression of inflamm-aging; these age-related risks may be altered by stress and depression, diet, sleep, exercise habits, and developmental shifts in emotion regulation strategies.	natural

In the short marriages, half the variance in marital satisfaction was predicted by the partner's marital questionnaire score, but when this variable was eliminated from the regression equation, mild psychological symptoms (occasional phobic anxiety in wives and mild depression in husbands) were the main predictors of marital satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Subjects (102 females and 63 males) completed measures of mild state and low-level trait depression, a brief political activity inventory, and the simple locus of control scale.	synthetic_low

Data for the married sub-group suggested that an affectionate husband largely corrected any diathesis to slight depression exerted by uncaring parenting, while the protective effects of caring parenting on adult depressive experience were somewhat undone by marriage to an unaffectionate husband.	synthetic_low

However, minor spreading depression appears irrelevant to the subtle behavioral effects of isotonic KCl and glutamate on memory formation.	synthetic_low
In the first and the second experiment, participants were induced to experience either a mild mood state of elation or a mood state of slight depression.	synthetic_low
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not mild depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted increased self-esteem whereas minor improvements in depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_low
