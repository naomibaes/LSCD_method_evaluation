The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is an important relay for multiple cortical and subcortical regions involved in processing anxiety as well as neuroendocrine and autonomic responses to stress, and it is thought to play a role in the dysregulation of these functions as well as in addictive behavior.	natural
