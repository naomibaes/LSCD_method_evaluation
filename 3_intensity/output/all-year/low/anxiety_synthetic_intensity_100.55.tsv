The three models were all a reasonable fit of the data, and supported conclusions that: children's modest threat and distress cognitions were stable over time and were significantly associated with mild anxiety, parents' manageable threat and distress cognitions and expectancies significantly predicted child threat cognitions at some time points, and parental mild anxiety significantly predicted parents' cognitions, which predicted parental expectancies at some time points.	synthetic_intensity

When controlling for the amount of experience with computers, clinical psychology students reported slight anxiety compared to industrial-organizational psychology students, but men and women did not differ significantly in anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Results at follow-up highlighted a notable decrease of the mean Neuroticism and mild Anxiety scores and a slight increase in Extroversion scores in the group as a whole.	synthetic_intensity

For Step 1, maltreatment characteristics, taken together, predicted some variance in four of five mild symptoms: anger, anxiety, dissociation, and posttraumatic stress (PTS).	synthetic_intensity
Although mild stomachaches and occasional headaches are considered characteristic of children with anxiety disorders, there is some evidence that a broader range of somatic symptoms may be associated with children's expressions of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Results reveal that: for abused women, the stages fall along a continuum (versus discreet and linear stages); abused women are primarily in the Contemplation stage; and several factors (perception of current abuse, number of children in her home, mild symptoms of general anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], substance use, spiritual well-being, self-esteem, and steady social support) affect women's overall readiness to change intimate partner violence (IPV).	synthetic_intensity
