A correlation was drawn between higher levels of education and slightly lower scores on the Brief Symptom Inventory, which gently measures characteristics such as mild somatization, minor obsessive compulsive behaviors, modest interpersonal sensitivity, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The results demonstrated reductions in overall symptoms (large effect size and reasonable clinically significant change), and also in depression and mild anxiety (medium effect sizes and clinically significant change).	synthetic_low
In a pilot study, we surveyed 88 outpatients in an internal medicine clinic and explored the prevalence of mild anxiety symptoms based on four measures of anxiety and slight worry.	synthetic_low

Fibrinogen reactivity showed inverse relationships with mild negative affectivity (r = -0.59, p = 0.002) and mild anxiety (r = -0.54, p = 0.005); negative affectivity emerged as an independent predictor of fibrinogen reactivity explaining 35% of its variance.	synthetic_low
Partially consistent with prediction, the motivation to smoke to slightly reduce negative affect was somewhat related to mild anxiety sensitivity and reduced negative affectivity, but not anxious arousal; the observed effects were above and beyond other theoretically relevant factors (e.g., smoking rate, years smoked, age, gender).	synthetic_low
However, a simple examination of normalized residuals, total direct effects, and minor modification indexes reveals the slight inadequacy of some items from the anxiety and cognitive problems subscales.	synthetic_low
