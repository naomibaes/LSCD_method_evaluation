Subjects in whom depressed mood was induced showed a pattern of recall similar to that previously found for depressed patients, suggesting that at least some of the effects observed in depressed patients were a function of transient mood state, rather than persistent characteristics, and that these effects of depressed mood also occur in individuals who have not been selected for vulnerability to clinical depression.	natural
Duloxetine was superior to placebo in achieving remission (OR: 1.78, 95 CI: 1.20-2.65; NNT=9, 95 CI: 6-20; three trials) and response (OR: 1.83, 95 CI: 1.96-4.08; two trials) in recurrent major depression after 8 weeks, but increased the risk of adverse events that can be problematic in the elderly.	natural

Depressive patients were classified into four different groups by SCAN 2.1 (schedules for clinical assessment in Neuropsychiatry): moderate major depression disorder (n: 34), mild dysthymia disorder (n: 29), light subsyndromal depression (n: 28), and depression due to mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (n: 18).	synthetic_low
Controls include moderate religiosity, mild depression, slight burdensomeness, and basic demographics.	synthetic_low
Mild depressive symptoms affected viral suppression in YB-GBMSM with lower vs. higher social capital (p = 0.046, test for subtle statistical interaction between depression and social capital).	synthetic_low

As predicted, there was a significant relationship linking a pattern of high internality and low belief in powerful others with mild depression in the elderly, but not in the young.	synthetic_low
The Child Behaviour Checklist and Child Depression Inventory were used to assess the presence of mild depression.	synthetic_low
First, the depression classification as institutionalized by the DSM-III is a somewhat unfocused and slightly confusing one.	synthetic_low
In the present study, we focus on mild exposure to parental negative emotions in the first postnatal year as a possible developmental pathway to the early parent-to-child transmission of moderate depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Depression during the teenage period is differentiated from a slightly depressed mood, replete with mild discomfort and unease, and depression proper, i.e., a recognized illness with specific but less impactful symptoms which are mild depressive equivalents.	synthetic_low
Sixteen cases of clients with mild depression (305 sessions) were analysed.	synthetic_low
Symptoms of mild sexual dysfunction were slightly correlated with symptoms of mild depression in diabetic women but not in diabetic men.	synthetic_low
Cognitive content was partially determined by mild depression, domain, and construct; slightly depressed subjects generated some negative content using own constructs to describe themselves.	synthetic_low
Results are discussed with reference to feelings of occasional learned helplessness and mild depression in learning-disabled children, and to the importance of psychological management of the dyslexic child.	synthetic_low
This moderate excess risk remained significant after adjustment for current socioeconomic status, the baseline HPL depression score, the energy-adjusted daily intake of fiber and vitamin C, and the total fat intake.	synthetic_low
Our results illustrate the relevance of depression in adolescents, underscoring the need for mental_health policies targeting this population, with the objective of minimizing the manageable short- and long-term effects of early-onset depression.	synthetic_low
Far from confirming the hypothesis of a blunted PRL response in mildly depressed patients, our results suggest: that the short duration and minimal treatment resistance of depression may affect the PRL secretion, and that TRD and major depression may somewhat differ in biological relationship to suicidal behavior.	synthetic_low
Examining the sexes separately, or restricting comparisons to patients with mild melancholic depression, did not lead to any differences between the groups.	synthetic_low
The pooled mean effect size from 11 studies (n = 1602) was moderate, suggesting that CBT appears helpful in treating mild depression in impoverished contexts.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
The present investigation was designed to measure the self-report and tonic psychophysiological response to mildly induced mood states of anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The Childhood Version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and the Beck Depression Inventory were administered to adolescents presenting for evaluation at an outpatient clinic (n=383; dealing with minor emotional concerns; ages 11.9 to 20.0).	synthetic_low
Self-esteem was somewhat related to mild depression in both groups but was negatively related to theory of mind only for youth with ASD.	synthetic_low
Pain also was related to moderately higher depression scores indirectly through its association with some helplessness and passive coping.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to compare adolescents for whom the onset of mild depression was first versus those for whom the onset of substance use disorder was first or in the same year as mild depression.	synthetic_low
Additional evidence for such a possible connection may be the moderate efficacy of mood-stabilizing drugs in the support of antidepressants in mild treatment-resistant depression.	synthetic_low
The present study evaluated the role of expressed emotion (EE) as a predictor of minor child symptomatology and slight functional impairment in a sample of nearly 800 adolescent children of mothers with mild histories of depression or who were nondepressed.	synthetic_low
More than 200 published studies from most medical settings worldwide have reported general experiences with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) which was specifically developed by Zigmond and Snaith for use with mildly physically ill patients.	synthetic_low
This paper presents a two-phase cross-sectional study aimed at examining the possible mitigating role of perceived meaning of life and representation of death on mild psychological distress, reduced anxiety, and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Among the interfering variables, symptom changes like actually from mild depression to occasional anxiety should further be investigated.	synthetic_low
These contributions lead to a better understanding of the minor importance of depressive affect in milder phallic-oedipal conflicts, similarities and differences between such conflicts in boys and girls, depression as a mild symptom in adult life, and some surface aspects of narcissism.	synthetic_low
The strongest predictor of a slight worsening of psychiatric symptoms over the month was a mild increase in depression in the previous month.	synthetic_low
All three components of spouse's minor hostility were somewhat related to one's own mild symptoms of depression for women.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous research and compatible with the view that a state of alexithymia can result from moderate anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and the BHS (Beck Hopelessness Scale) are used in both routine clinical practice and general research focusing broadly on depression.	synthetic_low

Those women who each completed the analogue scales during pregnancy at 12 and 23 weeks and at 1 week and 5 months after childbirth (N = 230) showed no association between mild depression or low anxiety and either the gravidity or method of delivery on any of the four occasions.	synthetic_low
