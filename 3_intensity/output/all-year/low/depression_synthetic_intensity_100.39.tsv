Using a neuropsychologically based definition of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in patients with mild geriatric depression, we hypothesized that patients with aMCI, compared with those without it, would have increased incidence of both dementia and AD.	synthetic_intensity
We also examined potential mediators (maternal functioning and family cohesion), and moderators (subtle maternal depression).	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive complexity was significantly affected by mild depression and domain; slightly depressed subjects attained the greatest complexity in describing persons in roles.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 435 Chinese adolescents who experienced a tornado in Yancheng city reported their low level of depressive symptoms (The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children; CES-DC), minor posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory; PTGI), and some dispositional mindfulness (Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale; MAAS).	synthetic_intensity
From a multivariable analysis, both child-intrinsic factors (chronic physical morbidity, occasional sleeplessness, and mild anxiety-depressive symptoms) and factors that slightly impinge upon the child (poor maternal health and mild maternal depression and anxiety) independently contributed to somewhat irregular eating status at age 2-4 years.	synthetic_intensity
It is unclear how cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is influenced by moderate physical disability, mild fatigue, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study of 21 chronically infected HCV patients, we assessed mild subjective cognitive dysfunction, slight depression, moderate anxiety, and general fatigue and compared these symptom areas to basic cognitive tests assessing visuoconstruction, basic learning, memory, visual attention, psychomotor speed, and mental flexibility.	synthetic_intensity
The authors also use a straightforward nonrecursive model to establish the causal relationship between mild depression and moderate commitment.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment non-completers reported somewhat higher pre-treatment levels of mild depression and moderate weight concern, along with slightly lower levels of general health and vitality.	synthetic_intensity
At low levels of life stress, moderate levels of thought suppression were associated with mild levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The negative impacts of parental mental_health problems on children and adolescents are well known, but the relationship between a child's mild depression and their parents' health is not so well understood.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive therapies were thought most appropriate for delusional disorders, and behavior therapies for mild depression and physical therapies for anorexia.	synthetic_intensity
The present article provides an overview of the best-developed interventions for child and adolescent internalizing disorders characterized by mild anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Hence the internalist must explain how reasons can remain if minor depression reduces motivation.	synthetic_intensity
In a psychiatry residency outpatient clinic, an elderly woman with mild dementia and minor depression is successively treated with careful medication management, supportive cognitive behavioral therapy, and gentle psychodynamic psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
This paper examined slight sex differences in the manageable short-term course of depression and assessed the impact of potentially outcome-affecting factors, including sex-specific recall artefacts and some demographic and clinical characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
Cardiac rehabilitation and prevention programs should thus include not only the assessment and treatment of mild depression but also a helpful component on the family and social contexts of patients.	synthetic_intensity
The maternal attitudes, measured on the Mother-Child Questionnaire, were regarded as somewhat conflictual when modest low difference scores were found between eating well and eating badly: autonomy and dependency, and between cheerfulness and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
To examine the proposed moderating effect of mild depression, participants were separated into a No-depression group of 133 and a Slightly Depressed Mood group of 62.	synthetic_intensity
Measures of minor negative life change events, daily hassles, and relative self-efficacy were used to predict mild depression, minimal psychosomatic symptoms, and slightly negative wellbeing both in concurrent and timelag designs.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were rated on scales for severity of mild depression and slight speech deviations.	synthetic_intensity
Self-rated current mood was also measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Low Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity
Dimensions related to the strict ventilation model such as validation, a slight numbness, and subtle expression were not significantly related to mild depression or anxiety, although acceptance of feelings was related to somewhat less anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Twentynine men with mild depression completed a Q sort by ranking a set of statements about depression and helpseeking according to their relative agreement with each statement.	synthetic_intensity
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with moderate bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with mild nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall mild severity of illness alone.	synthetic_intensity
Self-report measures used to assess treatment effect were the Savings Inventory-Revised (SI-R), Savings Cognition Inventory, and the Mild Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales.	synthetic_intensity
50 patients with panic disorder (30 without and 20 with mild concomitant depression) were enrolled in a controlled treatment study using either imipramine or doxepin in addition to supportive psychotherapy and were then studied under naturalistic treatment conditions over a 5-year period.	synthetic_intensity
