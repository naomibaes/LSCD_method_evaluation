Minor inhibition deficits at preschool were associated with slightly greater depression severity scores at each subsequent assessment wave (up until 7.5 years later).	synthetic_low
These results suggest that for individuals who have never experienced depression, a somewhat sad MI activates a gentle emotion regulation strategy that slightly changes the way emotional information is attended to in order to mildly counteract the sad mood; the absence of a difference for individuals who have previously experienced mild depression likely reflects a slightly maladaptive emotion regulation response associated with a reduced depression vulnerability.	synthetic_low
Gifted adolescents reported degree of loneliness to be a function of mild anger, everyday depression, and minor life changes.	synthetic_low
It was slightly higher for females, whether patients or nonpatients; nonpatients with a moderate total score and normal scores on several subscales of the Crown Crisp Experiential Index of neurotic symptomatology; psychiatric patients in general; patients and nonpatients with a moderate modified Zung depression score; mildly neurotic as opposed to less severe endogenous depressives; less serious suicide attemptors; Ss with some early bereavement or separation particularly if followed by acceptable replacement care; Ss in below-average quality marriages and somewhat husband dominant marriages as measured by the Ryle Marital Patterns Test.	synthetic_low

This paper reviews evidence relating to ordinary patterns of marital interaction related to the co-occurrence of mild marital discord and three common psychological disorders: mild depression, occasional alcohol misuse, and minor childhood conduct disorders.	synthetic_low
The behavior of the new Cardiac Depression Scale suggests that it will be an excellent measure for studies of outcome in patients experiencing mild cardiac depression.	synthetic_low
Using the stress-social support-functioning model and the social network model of child development, this paper examined the impact of child abuse, increased maternal perceived social support, improved competence, and mild depression, child perceived social support, and sociodemographic characteristics on child academic functioning.	synthetic_low
Consistent with the tripartite model of anxiety and mild depression, hemispheric asymmetries may be differentially associated with lightly depressive and anxious symptoms.	synthetic_low
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are somewhat correlated with the slight depth of depression as assessed by a simple rating scale, and also with the minor degree of memory impairment during mild depression.	synthetic_low
Our results modestly extend into the sensory realm the slight reduction in the repeatability of subjective pleasure already established for mildly depressed subjects in the social realm; this is discussed in terms of a minimal positive reinforcement reduction associated with depression.	synthetic_low
The differences between somatic psychiatrists and mental hygienists, already apparent earlier, became somewhat more pronounced during the Depression, or the economic downturn, years, partly as a consequence of their varied perspectives on this social issue.	synthetic_low
Most symptom trajectories remained somewhat static, suggesting that depression, as it presents in primary care, may not always follow a typical episodic pattern.	synthetic_low
Outcome measures included the Crown-Crisp Experiential Inventory anxiety scale, a basic assessment using the Beck Depression Inventory, and Derriford Appearance Scale-24, a valid and reliable measure of slight distress and dysfunction in relation to self-consciousness of appearance.	synthetic_low
Previous research has found a modest positive relationship between dependency and a mild level of depression.	synthetic_low
This study highlights the importance of considering parental bonding and adolescent depression in pediatric CP, suggesting that high paternal control and moderate maternal care contribute to increased pain in adolescents through mildly heightened adolescent depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Findings provide helpful information about issues, methods and processes in discussing depression as well as perceptions about supportive measures.	synthetic_low
The first model included current mild symptoms; current slight body dissatisfaction (ab=0.04, 95 CI [0.01, 0.06]) and moderate fasting (ab=0.12, 95 CI [0.01, 0.22]) were indirectly related to increased suicidal ideation through a sense of burdensomeness, controlling for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Studies of cognitive vulnerability to mild depression in young children have, in the main, relied on straightforward self-report questionnaires (e.g. of self-esteem, attributional style).	synthetic_low
Following a rigorous translation and adaptation process, an Italian version of the commonly-used Depression Anxiety Stress Scales was administered to a sample of 103 Italian-born men and women over the age of 55 years, and the results were subjected to exploratory factor analysis.	synthetic_low
25 patients with mild primary depression receiving therapeutic doses of imipramine showed no noticeable increase in chromosome abnormalities (either breaks or aneuploidy) when frequencies before and after initiation of imipramine therapy were compared.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that: the PSI was a reliable instrument for use with Black South African students, and that self-appraised ineffective problem-solvers reported slightly lower self-esteem and personal competence, and moderately higher levels of mild depression and anxiety than self-appraised effective problem-solvers.	synthetic_low
Four groups comprised our study sample: relatives who had never experienced a psychiatric episode of depression; relatives who had experienced a minor psychiatric episode of depression but were currently well; relatives who had never experienced a psychiatric episode of depression but were currently experiencing mild depression; and relatives who had experienced a past history of light depression and were currently experiencing mild depression.	synthetic_low
Paternal mental_health screening during pregnancy is necessary in order to identify and prevent mild depression subtly impacting offspring functioning.	synthetic_low
The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicated that 30 of the variation in suicide ideation scores could be accounted for by the linear combination of mild negative life stress, slight depression, occasional loneliness, and fewer reasons for living.	synthetic_low
Significant advantages for duloxetine over placebo were observed on 17-item Hamilton depression scale subscales (core, Maier, anxiety, retardation, and sleep), in addition to the Clinical Global Impression severity and Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, the Quality of Life in Mild Depression Scale, and Visual Analog Scales assessing moderate pain severity.	synthetic_low

Personality has been associated with mild clinical depression in general.	synthetic_low
More than 50 of the participants treated showed gradual change and clinically significant improvement after treatment for avoidance and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Significant relationships were identified between certain meaning-making themes (e.g., identity integration positively related to positive growth), and certain themes were also significantly related to postinjury psychological health and distress separately (e.g., perceived burden on others was significantly related to slightly increased depression scores).	synthetic_low
