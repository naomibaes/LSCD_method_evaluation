From these data, it appears that while a large minority of the chemotherapy patients who completed the questionnaire experienced distress associated with blood and injections, in the majority of cases the onset of these fears was not attributable to trauma associated with chemotherapy.	natural
Degree of adult or childhood trauma exposure, and depression severity were not associated with fear load.	natural

In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on certain unsettling abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current mild trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with moderate reported use of worry and punishment strategies and a bit less use of social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with slight levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with somewhat lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as modest mediators between CSA severity and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
