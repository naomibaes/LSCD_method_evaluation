Acute bouts of aerobic exercise have been associated with slight reductions in self-reported state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The interference hypothesis predicts that mild trait test anxiety induces slight measurement bias in items of intermediate difficulty, while the deficit hypothesis claims that test anxiety has no causal effect on test performance.	synthetic_intensity
