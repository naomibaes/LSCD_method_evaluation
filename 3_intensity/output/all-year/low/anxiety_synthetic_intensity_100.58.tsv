Finally, HR response interacted with mild cognitive bias in predicting minor childhood anxiety disorder symptoms in a manner consistent with theories of the etiology of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
These findings are discussed in relation to previous studies on attentional and executive control in mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Some association was shown between the clinical components of personality disorder traits in the anxious-fearful group and mild anxiety symptoms, although not as clearly as expected.	synthetic_low
The rationale behind these predictions inheres in the notion that the neurotic components of moderately expressed death anxiety derive from its minimal lack of anchoring in real external threats.	synthetic_low
The MGRS factors predicted somatic complaint and mild anxiety, whereas the FGRS factors predicted some social dysfunction.	synthetic_low
Autonomic nervous system dysfunction may partially explain the mild association between depression and anxiety with concerning cardiac outcomes in vulnerable patients.	synthetic_low
Previous research has shown that a modest proportion of CFS patients have mild anxiety and/or depression.	synthetic_low
Prominent structural models of depression and anxiety arise from 2 traditions: (a) the mild tripartite/integrative hierarchical model based on symptom dimensions, and (b) the moderate fear/anxious-misery model based on diagnostic comorbidity data.	synthetic_low
The experimental findings suggest that basal or resting anxiety might be mildly maintained by peripheral afferent autonomic biofeedback, and the latter can be effectively reduced by -adrenergic blocking agents; whereas, the magnitude of acutely aroused anxiety is gently mediated more through the central nervous system.	synthetic_low
Children and adolescents in the treatment group experienced slight anxiety (p = 0.05) and nausea (p = 0.03) one hour post-infusion.	synthetic_low
Women attending the clinic completed questionnaires assessing mild anxiety and slight worries, knowledge, locus of control, and satisfaction with information.	synthetic_low
Converging lines of research highlight the significance of cognitive and behavioral flexibility in the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of fear and mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Child characteristics and mild maternal anxiety did not predict treatment effect.	synthetic_low
The aims of the present study were therefore to evaluate the prevalence of mild grief in a population-based cohort, examine the slight overlap between anxiety and depression, and identify common bereavement-related and socio-demographic characteristics.	synthetic_low
A multivariate analysis of covariance demonstrated that subscales of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were somewhat related to minor alexithymia and mild trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Importantly, a recent line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to slight changes in anxiety.	synthetic_low
This increased risk was independent of conventional CHD risk factors, markers of underlying CHD, or measures of reporting bias, and it was related to anxiety items and minor sleep disturbance rather than depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the study also examined the role of stress-reactive rumination as a potential moderator between the stress and mild anxiety mediational pathway.	synthetic_low
The results are discussed in terms of the hypotheses that mild distracting stimuli may produce moderate increases in arousal during difficult tasks and that these smaller increments may either slightly compromise or slightly improve performance, depending upon the level of test anxiety which is viewed as a factor of the initial arousal level of the subject.	synthetic_low
There was however more support for a bifactor model, with four orthogonal factors: a general factor on which all the depression, mild anxiety and stress items load, and specific independent factors for depression, anxiety and stress items.	synthetic_low
These findings are calmly discussed in the context of the mild diathesis-stress model of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful.	synthetic_low
Path analyses indicated that instrumentality and mastery were both significant mediators of the relationship between gender and mild anxiety after controlling for social desirability and hassles.	synthetic_low
In addition, slight avoidance mediated the effect of mild emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and acceptance-resignation gently mediated the effects of both minor consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression.	synthetic_low
The results demonstrated that the emotive imagery group showed significantly greater reductions in mild darkness fears and mild anxiety according to child and parent reports and a straightforward behavioural darkness probe task, in comparison to the waiting-list group.	synthetic_low
Clinician ratings of impairment and self-report levels of mild anxiety were significantly lower at posttreatment in CBT compared with AS-Control.	synthetic_low
Females were more likely to report a mild mood and anxiety disorder, but less likely to report a substance disorder.	synthetic_low
This transcript is taken from the initial interview with a 24-year-old woman presenting with the problems of depression related to occasional binge eating, and mild anxiety concerning her difficulty to control her weight.	synthetic_low
Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV, the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children, and the Screen for Child Mild Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders.	synthetic_low
Adolescents with eating disorders were expected to have higher levels of depression, mild anxiety, and trauma-related symptoms.	synthetic_low
Prior slight body dissatisfaction significantly predicted a somewhat negative response to Body Shape Liking and Anxiety VAS.	synthetic_low
A simple retrospective study of the learning history origins of mild anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_low
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, minimal anxiety, and less urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_low
In addition, patients reported increased rates of psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives: mild anxiety disorders (58), mild affective disorders (35), and mild substance use disorders (35).	synthetic_low
In conclusion, for individuals who have high LCS and low shifting ability, content of and mild distress coming from looming images is experienced in a less intense manner due to some difficulty in shifting to another (perhaps less anxiety provoking) content more flexibly.	synthetic_low
Members of a high risk cohort, defined by moderate levels of anxiety sensitivity and current daily smoking (n=96), were randomly assigned to either a one session intervention focused on proximally increasing motivation to quit smoking and gently reducing anxiety sensitivity to distally prevent the development of panic or a health information control condition of comparable length.	synthetic_low
Information-processing models of anxiety posit that mild anxiety pathology is associated with subtle processing biases that slightly consume cognitive resources and may minimally detract from one's ability to process environmental stimuli.	synthetic_low
A correlational investigation was undertaken examining the relationships between irrational beliefs, as measured by the Rational Behavior Inventory, and mild phobic anxiety, as measured by the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia.	synthetic_low
Comparisons by family type revealed noticeable differences in maternal depression, social support, life events, and children's mild anxiety, depression, and problem behaviors.	synthetic_low
Girls reported a somewhat higher frequency of mild anxiety dreams than boys, although they could not remember their dreams more often.	synthetic_low
