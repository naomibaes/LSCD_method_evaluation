All three questionnaires performed adequately in mild depression screening, but minor differences in criterion validity existed.	synthetic_low
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_low
Greater WML severity in the left hemispheric cingulum bundle adjacent to the hippocampus was associated with milder post-treatment depression severity at three- (F1,7=6.42, p=0.0390) and six-month assessments (F1,5=9.62, p=0.0268).	synthetic_low

These findings indicate that certain eating disorder symptoms uniquely account for impairment and that mild depression is a noticeable contributor.	synthetic_low
In a longitudinal study of college students, B. S. Gershuny and K. J. Sher (1998) found that high neuroticism and low extraversion had a modest synergistic effect in predicting some anxiety and mild depression 3 years later.	synthetic_low
Findings further indicate that minor symptoms of depression and anxiety and mental_health quality of life either remained stable or improved in those participants who received the brief telephone intervention, while those receiving usual care showed slight declines in mood and mental_health quality of life.	synthetic_low
For mild major/double depression, a BDI-II cut-score of 10 produced satisfactory sensitivity = 100, reasonable specificity = 75, and modest PPV = 21 whereas a GDS cut-score of 13 produced satisfactory sensitivity = 100, high specificity = 91, and reasonable PPV = 41.	synthetic_low
Independent assessments of mild depression, occasional suicidality, and reasonable psychosocial adjustment were conducted using well-validated instruments.	synthetic_low
Ethnic identity was related positively to measures of psychological well-being such as coping ability, mastery, self-esteem and optimism, and negatively to mild feelings of loneliness and subtle depression.	synthetic_low
The gradual timing of this transition had no effect on mild depression rates.	synthetic_low
The association between mild depression and parenting was manifest most strongly for negative maternal behavior and was evident to a somewhat lesser degree in occasional disengagement from the child.	synthetic_low
In another study of 196 private patients with mild depression, 116 (59) also had recurring mild discomfort.	synthetic_low
Findings from this study lend support to the shared genetic liability hypothesis for the association of childhood atopic disorders and parental mild depression and occasional panic attacks.	synthetic_low
A search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE identified a range of RCTs evaluating psychological treatments for mild depression published through June 2009.	synthetic_low
Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that 3 of 19 variables predicted time to response: higher baseline anxiety was associated with a slightly delayed response (median of 5 weeks vs. 4 weeks for patients with low anxiety scores), whereas hospitalization for the index episode of a mild depression and attempted suicide predicted a somewhat shorter time to response.	synthetic_low
This pattern of results appears to be specific to mild depression: The presence during adolescence of a nonaffective psychiatric disorder was unrelated to subsequent marital functioning.	synthetic_low
The distribution of depression scores indicated that 34.5 were mildly depressed.	synthetic_low
Findings highlight the need to consider various components of EF and to integrate motivational and executive dysfunction models to the study of mild depression.	synthetic_low
36 clinical out-patients primarily presenting as mildly anxious, experiencing low-level depression or both, and 46 normal controls were tested on the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control together with self-rating scales of mild anxiety and slight depression.	synthetic_low
This study examined minor and cancer-related stressors of mild depression that are common to African-American cancer patients.	synthetic_low
The present study addressed these issues by comparing neural activation during emotion-word and color-word Stroop tasks in participants with varying levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Second, data from humans has demonstrated that minor HPAA dysregulation is associated with a slightly increased risk of future depression onset in healthy individuals, and routine pharmacological correction of HPAA dysregulation moderately reduces depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Children of problem-drinking parents were somewhat at risk of mild depression, lower self-esteem, and increased drinking compared to their peers in the general high school population.	synthetic_low
Personality characteristics were assessed for the same patients when they had markedly improved from their mild depression.	synthetic_low
Severity scores for depression in bulimic runners were slightly lower than in earlier nonexercising samples, indicating a modest improvement with exercise.	synthetic_low
Prior to RT, anxiety was more prevalent than mild depression (20 vs 15), but dropped following completion of RT, whereas median depression levels remained slightly elevated (17 vs. 27).	synthetic_low
As expected, a somewhat stronger alliance was associated with a slight reduction in symptoms of both mild depression and PTSD, through the supportive mechanism of empowerment in the domain of safety.	synthetic_low
Persons with mild major depression are somewhat more likely to smoke and to find it challenging when they try to stop.	synthetic_low
