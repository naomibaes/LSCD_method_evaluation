The relationship between attributions for actual life events and PTSD was not trauma specific, suggesting that these attributional tendencies which are associated with heightened distress following trauma may be fairly pervasive.	natural
Results suggest an important link between multiple types of past trauma exposure and OCS symptoms.	natural
The main findings of this study included: adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported slightly higher levels of school engagement; adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported slightly fewer depressive symptoms; adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported marginally more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and the effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms mildly differed by maltreatment type.	synthetic_low
The findings from the current study have implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the mild impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be impacted by their memory for the trauma.	synthetic_low

Civilian trauma survivors with mild ASD ( = 17) and without ASD ( = 15) and non-traumatized controls ( = 14) completed a calm hyperventilation provocation test and were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, the Physical Reactions Scale, and the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
