Anxiety disorders are common psychiatric disorders of childhood, generating some distress in the individual and a noticeable economic burden to society.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate statistics revealed a moderate level of outcome predictability; continued emotional unease (depression, anxiety, and mild sleep problems) posttreatment was modestly related to failure among the psychiatric MMPI group.	synthetic_intensity
To address these issues, 64 participants completed a handgrip endurance task during relaxed time-trial, one-on-one, two-on-two, and four-on-four competitions while self-report and possible corroborative physiological measures of enjoyment, mild anxiety, and effort were assessed.	synthetic_intensity

All patients are somewhat overtaxed by their situation; the conversion reaction is used as a subtle means to express mild anxiety and maintain self-assertion at the same time.	synthetic_intensity
As hunger sensation was found not to correlate with either mild anxiety or mild depression in OP, the opinion is expressed that the minor impairment of anxio-depressive integrity is a corollary of obesity rather than a primary affective disorder leading to obesity via an enhanced food intake.	synthetic_intensity
