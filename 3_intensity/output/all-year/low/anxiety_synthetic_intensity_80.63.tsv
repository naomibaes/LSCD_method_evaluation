74 young adults with type 1 diabetes and 201 demographically similar control participants completed an online survey containing the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Diabetes Eating Problems Survey- Revised (DEPS-R), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function- Adult version, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, and 3 subscales of the Family Environment Scale (independence, control, and cohesion).	natural
Scores on the BES were most highly correlated with a measure of negative perfectionism (r=0.59) and also showed significant correlations with measures of dysfunctional attitudes, self-sacrifice, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.	natural
Correlations with effect size were calculated for many variables, e.g., population, age, sex, experimental design, duration and hours of treatment, pretest anxiety, demand characteristics, experimenter attitude, type of publication, attrition, etc.	natural
We discuss the implications of these findings in light of recent models of anxiety, in particular the importance of interpersonal factors and assertiveness in an integrated model of decision making.	natural

Demographic and gynecological data were assessed and women completed questionnaires measuring mild anxiety, depression, narcissistic traits, moderate over-dependency, self-esteem, hostility, and alexithymia.	synthetic_low
This subtle expression consisted of two mild environmental-scanning behaviors (gentle eye darts and slow head swivels) and was quietly labeled as anxiety, not fear.	synthetic_low
These behavioral effects were in parallel with neural responses associated with social conflict in the N400 signal, showing slightly higher conformity to peers-higher feedback compared with peers-lower or peers-agree feedback among social anxiety disorder patients.	synthetic_low

Comparisons between women with moderate and low levels of weight anxiety revealed that those with moderate levels were somewhat more likely to engage in dieting behaviour.	synthetic_low
The results showed that three schema domains (moderately impaired autonomy and performance, somewhat impaired limits, and mildly other-directedness) predicted the increase in mild social anxiety and that LCS for social threat acted as a mediator between other-directedness and mild social anxiety at T3.	synthetic_low
The current study examined the effects of differing intensities of frame-of-reference (FOR) rater training on observers' ratings of mild anxiety, social skills, and alcohol-specific coping skills in community volunteers with and without social anxiety and alcohol use disorders.	synthetic_low
Maximum heart rate and mild anxiety were significantly greater at Step 10 in the naltrexone group, but no differences were found for self-efficacy or cognitions.	synthetic_low
All the participants were assessed using the Decentering Scale, the Self-Acceptance Scale, and the mild Depression and Anxiety Mood Scale before and after the intervention.	synthetic_low
An experimental and a control group of domiciled veterans showed a slight increase in state anxiety over a period of approximately 4 mo.	synthetic_low
The assessment of mild state anxiety was calmly repeated after the routine failed treatment.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, this slight reduction of mild anxiety achieved by the experimental condition was comfortably maintained at an average four-week follow-up conducted at the completion of examinations.	synthetic_low
The Cues program combined training to slightly reduce anxiety and enhance sensitivity.	synthetic_low
Some principal concepts are then elaborated more fully such as the mild cycle of awareness, desensitization, relaxed excitation anxiety and the five defense mechanisms: retroflection, introjection, projection, deflection, and confluence.	synthetic_low
In addition, slight avoidance mediated the effect of mild emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and acceptance-resignation gently mediated the effects of both minor consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression.	synthetic_low
Because ABA in adolescent females results in slight anxiety-like behavior in adulthood and the estrogen signaling system has been shown to play a role in mild anxiety and food intake, we investigated the role of ovarian hormones in adolescent ABA-treated rats, and moderate long-term effects of mid- and late adolescent ABA exposure on behavior and estrogen signaling.	synthetic_low
Path analyses indicated that instrumentality and mastery were both significant mediators of the relationship between gender and mild anxiety after controlling for social desirability and hassles.	synthetic_low
To determine whether the selectively bred alcohol preferring P rat displays impulsive and mild anxiety-related behaviors, as have been noted in Type 2 human alcoholics, P rats were compared with outbred Wistar rats, the strain from which P rats were derived, on a series of behaviors reflecting impulsivity and anxiety.	synthetic_low
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was designed for gentle detection and basic assessment of those mood disorders in the routine setting of hospital medical and surgical clinics.	synthetic_low
Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related to different OCD symptom dimensions in a meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 failed to support the hypothesis that OCD patients (n = 30) would endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with mild generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_low
Furthermore, these improvements were not accompanied by slight increases in symptoms such as mild staring, minor social withdrawal, or mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Groups were compared on five personality traits (slight trait anxiety, mild death anxiety, and three locus of control variables), two mental_health indices (psychological wellbeing and outlook for future goal attainment), five nuclear war-related attitudinal measures, nine nuclear threat orientations, nine strategies for coping with the threat, and a single behavioral measure of approach toward information about nuclear war.	synthetic_low

In an open label clinical trial, three patients with alcohol dependence and a mild co-morbid anxiety disorder were treated with levetiracetam in doses up to 1500 mg twice daily for up to 8 weeks.	synthetic_low
