Our findings do not provide conclusive evidence in favor of the hypothesis that higher BMI leads to higher levels of phobic anxiety, but rather suggest that genes that influence obesity, in particular FTO, may have direct effects on phobic anxiety, and hence that obesity and phobic anxiety may share common genetic determinants.	natural

Starting from the apparent paradox between the adaptive nature of fear conditioning and the dysfunctional nature of pathological anxiety, we present a critique of the human fear conditioning paradigm as an experimental model for psychopathology.	natural
There is a bidirectional interplay between mental_health and obesity; with higher depression and anxiety in the obese population as well as significant effects on weight loss for people with mental_health disorders.	natural
Mothers of women with AN reported higher levels of anxiety during the index pregnancy (p < .01), compared to when pregnant with the healthy daughter.	natural
Anxiety symptoms, positive and negative peer interactions, and social skills were assessed using youth and parent ratings.	natural
Results indicate that the SBS shows high reliability and convergent validity and that its relation to death anxiety depends on participants' religious identification: religious participants fear death less the stronger their religious beliefs, whereas nonreligious participants are more inclined towards religious belief the more they fear death.	natural
Finally, both family expectation and gender also had direct effects on test anxiety.	natural
Metacognitive therapy has a large effect on depression, anxiety, other psychopathological symptoms, and all outcomes together.	natural
This study examines whether improvements in probability and cost biases following cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder endure over the long-term.	natural
Although mothers in the Cues group demonstrated greater knowledge of the content of the experimental intervention than mothers in the Care group, the groups did not differ in levels of anxiety, depression, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress.	natural
A higher olfactory score but a similar psychophysical trend was found in the patient control with cognitive delay, while the two other control participants showed a selective increase of the anxiety state depending on the odour presented.	natural
Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with Diffuse Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety.	natural
Pregabalin is a -aminobutyric acid analogue that is primarily prescribed in psychiatry for management of generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
In this study we demonstrated for the first time marked immunological changes in patients with anxiety disorders.	natural
The PSAS-13 and the subscales demonstrated convergent validity with measures on sleep-related worry, sleep-related beliefs, anxiety, and depression.	natural
Patients with anxiety disorder (AD) are more likely to be concurrently comorbid with other ADs or major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, cognitions about environmental threat, trait anxiety, focus on autonomic sensations, and general environmental sensitivity predicted MCS symptoms in the total sample, explaining 53 of the variance.	natural
Depression, mania, anxiety, delirium, dementia and schizophreniform psychoses are well known to have medical causes.	natural
Among the 3,025 respondents, the probable prevalence of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbidity (>1 condition) was 23.3, 14.0, 10.4, 12.4, respectively.	natural
In the present study, this subscale and its self-reflectiveness (SR) factor predicted greater shame, guilt, other-directedness, and social anxiety; but the internal state awareness (ISA) factor displayed relationships that were in the opposite direction.	natural
Loose associations were related to autism communication symptoms and to parent reports of stress and anxiety.	natural
Performance anxiety has long been recognized as a problem for musicians.	natural
Study 2 used structural equation modeling of the relations between AI and AOO discrepancy and social anxiety versus depression as measured weeks later.	natural
In addition, the genetic and environmental mechanisms that link mathematical anxiety with math cognition and general anxiety were also explored.	natural
Enhanced sense of sacredness appeared useful in broadening attentional focus, interrupting dysfunctional thought patterns, and generating behaviors incompatible with social anxiety.	natural
Anxiety and EMG levels did not differ between groups.	natural
The possibility that the videotape effects on anxiety were mediated by self-efficacy beliefs was also examined.	natural
The two stable factors could be identified as Cattell's inviaexvia and anxiety or Eysenck's introversionextraversion and neuroticism.	natural
Induced test anxiety was found to operate similar to mild predispositional test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Independent evaluators blind to study condition assessed mild anxiety severity, normal functioning, and positive treatment response.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects reported slightly higher levels of disordered eating attitudes (EAT-26, p=0.01), somewhat elevated levels of anxiety (p=0.000) and somewhat lower levels of self-esteem (p=0.016) during the examination stress period compared to the control period.	synthetic_intensity
It was possible to distinguish subpopulations of dysphoric patients as well as depressed patients (discriminant analysis, analysis of variance), which served as a basis for answering our questions to the effect that a clearly defined group of dysphoric patients - all diagnosed as bipolar manic depressives - predominantly employs somewhat rigid repressive coping strategies, i.e. defensively denying mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Correlation and regression analyses showed a moderate and stable association between symptoms of depression, mild anxiety and stress, and appraisals of low coping potential and future expectancy across the three assessment times.	synthetic_intensity
Cumulative incidence and adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to calculate the low risk of mild anxiety disorders and the weak predictive association with moderate mood disorders.	synthetic_intensity
All correlations for the total group were found to be significant at the .05 level, those with mild anxiety slightly higher than those with curiosity.	synthetic_intensity
Scores on locus of control, social desirability, and mild test anxiety measures were unrelated to suicidal and depressive thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 72, 2004, 176) indicate that although there is a slight trend for early change in attachment-related anxiety and avoidance to predict a later change in marital satisfaction, early change in marital satisfaction gently predicts change in attachment-related anxiety through the end of treatment and 2-year follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Anticipatory processing (AP) is a repetitive negative thinking (RNT) style gently associated with mild social anxiety that has been excluded in studies of repetitive thought (e.g., worry and rumination).	synthetic_intensity
