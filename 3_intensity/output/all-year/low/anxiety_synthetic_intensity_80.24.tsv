The present study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between type of living environment (urban versus rural) and anxiety, depression and psychosis in the Scottish population.	natural
Mixed-effect regression models examining symptom and impairment measures at preworkshop, 1-week follow-up, and 4-week follow-up showed a significant effect for time on anxious arousal, general anxiety symptoms, and social anxiety, but no significant effect for time on impairment.	natural
Therefore, another aim of this study was to examine the effect of voluntary exercise on the anxiety profile in both morphine-dependent animals and animals experiencing withdrawal.	natural
Overall, however, distress scores tended to be higher for men evacuated in 1983-1984 if they had also reported damage from the prior earthquake (only the F ratio for anxiety reached criterion for statistical significance).	natural
Evidence is reviewed to evaluate the effects of wheel running, an experimental mode of exercise in rodents, on behavior in tests of anxiety and on norepinephrine and galanin systems in neural circuits that regulate stress.	natural
The factor-structure of the BPRS in inpatients with bipolar I disorder with an acute episode of any type is pentafactorial; one factor identified is the mixity factor, which is independent from other factors and characterized by anxiety and motor hyperactivity and by the absence of motor retardation.	natural
Participants with primary DSM-IV diagnoses of social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/A), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) completed diagnosis specific symptom measures before attending group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specific to their diagnosis.	natural
The 20-session intervention appeared effective with decreases in anxiety (on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and event impact (on the Impact of Events Scale) from clinical to sub-clinical levels.	natural
This study examines whether objectively obtained socioeconomic, physical and social aspects of the neighbourhood in which persons live are associated with the presence and severity of depressive and anxiety disorders.	natural
These findings suggest that elevated anxiety scores at pretreatment subside with time, do not require clinical management of associated anxiety symptoms, and may be a temporary by-product of experiencing negative consequences due to recent cocaine use.	natural
Overall, there were notable reductions across time on almost all measures (except self-report anxiety), and moreover, a considerable portion of the sample (80) were considered reliably improved and meeting clinically significant change.	synthetic_intensity
Depression, mild anxiety disorders, and disorders related to substance use were identified as key role-players influencing adherence.	synthetic_intensity
Adult ADHD is associated with psychiatric co-morbidities including mild anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and somatoform disorders as well as some role impairment.	synthetic_intensity
Based on our results, mild antenatal anxiety measured by a subscale of EPDS has predicted slightly better PPD than the antenatal depressive subscale.	synthetic_intensity
One of the five subscales on this instrument assesses evaluation anxiety, the degree to which the individual feels slightly anxious in situations where he/she is being evaluated.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, we discuss the measurement and assessment topics related to improving the childhood anxiety disorder diagnostic system and show how these subjects can be addressed by employing the nomological net of mild childhood anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Before tumor operation, the patients with a tumor in the right hemisphere had slightly higher somatic anxiety scores than those with a tumor located in the left hemisphere.	synthetic_intensity
Dabrowski's (1972) theory of positive disintegration argues that mild anxiety appears to be the dynamic of self-actualization.	synthetic_intensity
Those receiving either BT or CT alone showed more improvement on mild anxiety than CBT or WLC.	synthetic_intensity
All scales showed high splithalf reliability, and the construct validity of arousal and mild anxiety was generally supported.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined situational antecedents of multidimensional competitive state anxiety and steady self-confidence in a sample of 125 elite intercollegiate middle-distance runners.	synthetic_intensity
This style also functioned as a moderate influencer and predicted subtle changes in OCD symptoms among participants already high on this mild anxiety outcome.	synthetic_intensity
A moderate correlation was found between the psychometric and physiological measures of mild state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This phenomenon, emotional cushioning, appears to be a complex selfprotective mechanism and is proposed here as a unique combination of circumstances and responses used by women to cope with the mild anxiety, uncertainty, and sense of vulnerability experienced in these subsequent pregnancies.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of viewing depression and mild anxiety as distinct constructs with overlapping features.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, and psychosis frequently report occasional visual intrusions corresponding to a small number of real or imaginary events, usually somewhat vivid, detailed, and with moderately distressing content.	synthetic_intensity
The examined predictor variables were selected on the basis of previous research and theories of depression, and included mild symptoms of depression and anxiety, moderate negative affect, balanced automatic thoughts, less dysfunctional beliefs, occasional rumination, stable self-concept, and infrequent occurrence and perceived unpleasantness of recent negative events.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety, transient depression, and a minimal history of substance misuse were not associated with cognitive impairment.	synthetic_intensity
However, mild self-rated anxiety correlated moderately with misrecognition of somewhat fearful facial affect in high-risk children.	synthetic_intensity
Although this effect fades away, the role of the SIB is overstressed in its ability to increase well being and compliance, and slightly reduce anxiety and panic attacks.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with respiratory diseases or mild anxiety occasionally complain about dyspnea, which may be partly related to chronic tension of respiratory muscles and/or dynamic hyperinflation.	synthetic_intensity
Subsequent mediational analyses demonstrated that the relationship between skin picking severity and mild symptoms of anxiety and depression was partially mediated by some experiential avoidance.	synthetic_intensity
Physicians experience mild parental displeasure and anxiety in the form of requests for investigations and treatment, and feel some pressure to comply with parental requests.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that manageable anxiety can function as a measure of S's ego strength in predicting workshop attendance.	synthetic_intensity
However, they did not differ in memory performance, mild anxiety, depression or physical health.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety, mood, alertness, and calmness were gently assessed while patients waited in a relaxed manner for dental treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The subtle interplay between mild anxiety pathology and substance use disorders is increasingly recognized in empirical and clinical work.	synthetic_intensity
Given the potential for worry as a mechanism, and/or mild moderator between IU and symptoms of depression and anxiety, adults with a slight tendency to use this negative repetitive thought process (e.g. worry) may be at a slightly higher risk to develop psychological symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
We used a novel paradigm to assess fear conditioning in mild pediatric anxiety patients.	synthetic_intensity
Major depressive syndrome (15.6 ), panic syndrome (4.8 ), and mild anxiety syndromes (19.7 ) frequently occurred among persons with FSS.	synthetic_intensity
Correlations of mild trait anxiety and field dependence measures with movement frequencies varied slightly with task differences.	synthetic_intensity
Emotion regulation struggles and symptomatology (mild depression, light anxiety, aggressive behavior, and eating concerns) were assessed in a large, diverse sample of adolescents (N=1065) at two time points separated by seven months.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between mild social anxiety and moderate measures of trait anxiety, self-concept, locus of control, repression-sensitization, and depression was examined in volunteer college student (39 males and 53 females) and homosexual (51 males and 11 females) samples.	synthetic_intensity
The mild implications of these results for Beck's anxiety schema theory are calmly discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Other birth related variables were not significantly associated with either depression or mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We measured subjectively evaluated mild depression and anxiety, and objectively measured daily sleep-activity patterns in inpatients and outpatients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and determined whether cancer-associated depression and mild anxiety are accompanied by characteristic circadian rhythm changes.	synthetic_intensity
Gender differences were found in the majority of measures with females displaying slightly higher levels of anxiety and mild negative affect immediately before the examinations, whereas males reported higher positive affect and self-esteem and slightly lower depression and anxiety, even within the week prior to the examinations.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological distress data from 302 patients who completed an online CBT course for depression and 361 patients who completed an online CBT course for mild generalised anxiety disorder were subjected to growth mixture analysis.	synthetic_intensity
These results indicate that the Drawn Stories Technique shows construct validity for use with children and is sensitive enough to detect their subtle psychological distress, in terms of mild anxiety and slight depression.	synthetic_intensity
Caution is urged, however, in its use with other measures which are not so well validated as this and with affective states not so well researched as mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
