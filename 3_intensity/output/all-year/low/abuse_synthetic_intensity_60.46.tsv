The implication is that victims of sexual abuse perpetrated by a woman may be less likely to receive the protection afforded victims of male-perpetrated abuse.	natural
To address this gap in knowledge and to inform intervention strategies, this study examined direct and mediated relationships between childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence risk among a random sample of 416 women in methadone treatment.	natural
This paper explores the phenomenon of therapist sexual abuse (TSA).	natural
Approximately 600 participants completed measures that assessed for a childhood sexual abuse (CSA) history, alcohol consumption, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and overall psychological functioning.	natural
Participants watched a simulated sexual abuse trial in which the child witness had been prepared for her testimony (i.e., she was calm, composed, and confident) or unprepared (i.e., emotional, confused, and uncertain).	natural
Finally, those families not notified post-PCIT showed greater reductions in child abuse potential and improvements in observed sensitivity during treatment.	natural
Although childhood abuse, BPD traits, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms were all correlated, the discordant twin analyses and biometric modeling showed little to no evidence that was consistent with a causal effect of childhood abuse on BPD traits.	natural
This eventually results in avoidance of managing problems and emotions and substance abuse relapse, which culminates in recidivism.	natural
Theoretical conceptualizations of child sexual abuse are considered, in the three main categories of cognitivepsychodynamic theories, neuropsychological conceptualizations, and contributions from the emerging field of evolutionary psychology.	natural
Male and female participants reported abuse at high rates, with 61.9 of men and 58.2 of women reporting abuse as children and 63.7 of men and 68.2 of women reporting abuse as adults.	natural
Individuals with bipolar disorder are at risk of having a history of child sexual abuse, although such risk seems to be neither more specific to nor stronger for these individuals, compared to people with other psychiatric disorders.	natural
This study's primary aims were to examine whether a sample of young adults, aged 23 to 31, who had been documented as physically abused by their parent(s) during adolescence would be more likely to aggress, both physically and verbally, against their intimate partners compared with nonabused young adults and whether abuse history was (along with other risk factors) a significant predictor of intimate partner physical and emotional violence perpetration or victimization.	natural
Several risk factors for juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include mild mental illness, minor substance use, minimal trauma and abuse, slight family dysfunction, some poor parenting, minor school problems, and some aggressive behavior.	synthetic_intensity
The current study explores the connection between reported mild sexual abuse and minor physical maltreatment during childhood and immature defense styles as affecting the 1-year follow-up of inpatients who had undergone psychodynamic group therapy.	synthetic_intensity
The probability of men's work-related IPV substantially impacting their own job performance was nearly 4 times greater among those in the moderate abuse cluster than those in the low-level tactics cluster.	synthetic_intensity
For clinical syndromes (CLS), the factors were general psychopathology and mild substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
However, as expected, multiple regression analyses showed that parental warmth strongly influenced or mediated the relationship of minor intrafamilial child abuse to depression and self-esteem levels.	synthetic_intensity
The study comprised a crosssectional, retrospective investigation using wellestablished, standardized, selfreport questionnaires and a semistructured interview. Results revealed that, within the total sample, childhood sexual, physical, and psychological abuse were mildly correlated.	synthetic_intensity
The authors report on a study of psychiatric diagnoses in parents whose children had been removed from their custody by court order because of minor child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, the authors examined the role of parentification (children assuming adult-like roles in the family) as it relates to family risk (parental psychopathology, parental illness, and domestic violence), minor child sexual abuse (CSA), and psychosocial adjustment in 499 college women.	synthetic_intensity
Our ability to predict the outcome of psychological treatments, particularly for drug dependence, is examined by new data on a VA sample, a review of studies predicting the outcome of minor drug abuse treatment, and a review of predicting the outcome of psychotherapy for other types of patients.	synthetic_intensity
With a few exceptions, these factors are specific to the minor type, low frequency, and minimal comorbidity of abuse experienced.	synthetic_intensity
The probability of men's work-related IPV substantially impacting their own job performance was nearly 4 times greater among those in the moderate abuse cluster than those in the low-level tactics cluster.	synthetic_intensity
The present study reviews the field of disclosure and examines factors affecting disclosure among a service population of mildly abused children who were placed in residential care due to mild forms of abuse (e.g., physical, sexual, emotional, neglect and witnessing domestic violence).	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses suggested that mild abuse histories were somewhat predictive of internalizing problems while family characteristics were more predictive of externalizing problems.	synthetic_intensity
Only systematic reviews were included in which the primary studies evaluated the effectiveness of targeted or indicated interventions for minor child physical abuse or neglect.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in binge and purge behavior by gender and type of minor abuse across mild abuse characteristics were subtle.	synthetic_intensity
Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a mild sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are common problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be a primary focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are infrequently prepared to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' adherence to genderrole stereotypes may contribute to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires some attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have affected children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will influence the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	synthetic_intensity
Touching was the most frequently used term in describing minor sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
We evaluated mild childhood abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Early Trauma Inventory and SPD with the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality.	synthetic_intensity
Emotional awareness did not moderate the relation between minor child abuse and relationship quality.	synthetic_intensity
Although PIO failed to alter the minor abuse liability of OXY, the interaction between glia and opioid receptors is not well understood so the possibility remains that medications that interact with glia in other ways may show more promise.	synthetic_intensity
Comprehensive chart review and autopsy findings revealed a non-SIDS diagnosis in 54 and confirmed or suspicious mild child abuse in 37 of these deaths.	synthetic_intensity
Another area that has been extensively researched, with a noticeable increase in the literature base in recent history, is that of occasional child sexual abuse (CSA).	synthetic_intensity
Distortions in representation of an abusing parent may play a minor role in the perpetuation of child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Also, a dimension of severity was measured by tallying, for sexual and physical abuse scales separately, the number of items meeting minor abuse criteria.	synthetic_intensity
Although not all hypotheses are supported, this study demonstrates that the IAT has much promise as a tool with which to study cognitions associated with mild cases of sexual abuse of children.	synthetic_intensity
The complex patient population included children with permanent mental and/or physical handicaps who had survived due to advances in medical technology, those with traumatic or congenital brain injury, failure to thrive, feeding problems, apnea, tracheostomy, minor child abuse, and psychosomatic disorders.	synthetic_intensity
