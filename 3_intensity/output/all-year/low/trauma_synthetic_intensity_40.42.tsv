Failure to recognize mild brain injury may be due to insensitivity of neuroradiologic procedures, coding limitations, patient denial, lack of obvious head trauma, or focus of attention toward more obvious physical injuries.	natural
As expected, higher levels of experiential avoidance were associated with higher levels of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, a variety of specific fears, trauma, and a lower quality of life.	natural

Research regarding the influence of race on outcomes after trauma has been mixed, and we aimed to identify potential moderators of the relation between race and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)related outcomes.	natural
Findings suggest that survey questions about trauma pose minimal risk to adolescents.	natural
This article conceptualizes the treatment of men survivors of trauma at 2 levels: redefining masculinity and its legacies and confronting trauma and its legacies.	natural
While childhood PTSD was only significantly predicted by child trauma score and the duration of captivity, it was neither predicted by maternal PTSD nor did it disappear after the reunion with the PTSD-free father.	natural
These results appear to have application to the cumulative trauma disorder problem.	natural
War trauma involved 42 events.	natural
Our results indicate that a history of sexual trauma and anxiety sensitivity can increase the probability of developing PTSD after childbirth.	natural
This study examined the trauma experiences of a sample of maltreated children and whether their child welfare workers were effective screeners of traumatic stress symptoms.	natural
While these horrific events are believed to imprint themselves in implicit memory in fragmented forms, and thus be a veridical representation of the trauma, narrative recall can be in error due to the reconstructive processes which govern it.	natural
Trauma reported at baseline, however, was not predictive of 1-year outcomes, suggesting type and frequency of trauma does not negatively affect the housing gains homeless women veterans can achieve through homeless services.	natural
High treatment responders collapsed across treatments showed nominally higher cortisol levels measured at pretreatment 30 min after trauma script exposure compared to low responders (P = .08).	natural
The differences in psychological sequelae among those who have experienced sexual trauma as children, and those whose sexual trauma exposure is limited to adulthood are relatively understudied.	natural
Individuals serving in Iraq and Afghanistan sustain injuries associated with physical and psychological trauma.	natural
The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD), through its members, professional literature, trainings, and meetings, provides expertise in this area of mental_health.	natural
Greater male rape myth acceptance and greater devaluation of emotions were directly associated with lower self-efficacy, but these beliefs did not moderate associations between sexual trauma and self-efficacy.	natural
Only polygenic mutation-selection balance seems consistent with the data on mental_disorder prevalence rates, fitness costs, the likely rarity of susceptibility alleles, and the increased risks of mental_disorders with brain trauma, inbreeding, and paternal age.	natural
Ninety-six post-traumatic patients, ranging from 0-18 years, underwent a complete psychological evaluation protocol at I year from trauma.	natural
The purpose of this research was to examine reports of and pathways to posttraumatic growth (PTG) by emerging adults who have experienced minor trauma during adolescence compared with a comparison group recruited from the same sample frame.	synthetic_intensity
While this method has been employed by mental_health professionals to treat individuals affected by trauma, there is scant documentation of its use with combat veterans.	synthetic_intensity
School mental_health workers and teachers might also acquire mild secondary trauma reactions from the children with whom they work.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment modules for mild trauma spectrum disorders in a sample of Rwandan genocide orphans.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest use of prospective studies with mild orthopedic trauma controls in future investigations of mTBI to control for these confounding factors.	synthetic_intensity
dACC activation observed in prior studies of PTSD may be attributable to the minor cumulative effects of childhood and adult trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
A review of the last 20 years of research on CSA does not support the view that the majority of children known to have been sexually abused exhibit mild signs or symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We also found that the mild stress and trauma inherent in our occasionally using surgery to assess testicular size acted as a minor risk factor influencing the lifespan of these animals.	synthetic_intensity
Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, mild trauma exposure history and minor symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures.	synthetic_intensity
Using analysis of variance procedures, results showed differences in onset of first alcohol use and heaviest drinking between those who experienced mild childhood and adulthood trauma victims.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that while children born subsequently to a cot death are not inevitably at risk, there may be some relationship between mild maternal anxiety produced by an earlier trauma and slight infant insecurity.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, mothers who experienced mild betrayal trauma in childhood and were subsequently interpersonally affected in adulthood were shown to have slightly higher levels of dissociation than non-revictimized mothers.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, clients with some level of sexual abuse scored significantly higher than clients known not to be sexually abused on Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content index (TC/R), with an effect size greater than 1 SD.	synthetic_intensity
Prior anxiety disorder, high neuroticism, low conscientiousness, more somatic conditions, and more minor childhood trauma all predicted greater functional impairment.	synthetic_intensity
The results described in the present investigation are first to demonstrate a subtle neuroradiographic difference between neck pain patients with and without a recent history of minor whiplash trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_intensity
Following viewing a mild analogue trauma film, low frequency of film-related intrusions and minimal associated distress levels were measured and at 1-week follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
We developed two adaptions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the mildly traumatized self IAT (evaluations of the self as slightly traumatized vs. healthy) and the safe memory IAT (evaluations of remembering as slightly dangerous vs. safe), and investigated their psychometric properties and subtle relations to PTSD symptoms and minimal trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity

Patients who sustained MTBI following a motor vehicle accident (n = 48) were assessed with a structured interview within 18 days of the minor trauma for the presence of ASD and administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Coping Style Questionnaire, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
