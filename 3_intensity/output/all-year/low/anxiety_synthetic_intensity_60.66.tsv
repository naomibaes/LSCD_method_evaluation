These group differences were specific to the task of calmly associating to phrases of mixed (sexual, aggressive, neutral) content (but not to other experimental situations) and to self-reported mild anxiety (but not to other self-rated emotions or task difficulty), indicating that they reflect subtle individual differences in coping with anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
