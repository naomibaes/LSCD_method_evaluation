If clinicians can identify patients at greatest risk for mild anxiety after AMI, they can institute early treatment.	synthetic_low
Studies testing the association between birth weight and mild anxiety have found inconsistent results and there has been a lack of research on the possible relationship between birth weight and mild comorbid anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The human capacity for self-awareness allows people to consider their eventual death and thus creates the potential for manageable anxiety.	synthetic_low
