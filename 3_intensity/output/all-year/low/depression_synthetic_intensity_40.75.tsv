A past history of depression was elicited using key symptoms such as persistent tearfulness and depressed mood, already enquired after in the course of the PSE, to identify potential episodes, followed by questions to determine accessory symptoms, duration, and degree of social impairment.	natural

We assessed the following as potential predictors of self-reported anginal pain: sensory-biological factors (-endorphin reactivity, hot pain threshold, and maximal ST-segment depression), cognitive-emotional factors (negative affect and symptom perception), and cognitive-interpretational factors (self-reported history of exercise-induced angina).	natural
18.5 of patients met the criteria for atypical depression.	natural
Our research outcomes add great strength to the relationship between depression and cytokine changes and suggest that childhood trauma may play a vital role in the co-appearance of cytokine changes and depression.	natural
The association between depression and anxiety, on the one hand, and the MetSyn as a cluster or its individual components, on the other hand, is equivocal.	natural
The anxiety subscale of the HADS appears to measure depression at least as well as the depressive subscale.	natural
The relation of self-supporting personality, Big Five personality, and depression was examined in a sample of 439 Chinese undergraduate students using the Self-Supporting Personality Scale for Adolescent Students (SSPS-AS), the Mandarin Chinese version of Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), and the Chinese Version of Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS).	natural
There was also a history of mild depression and anxiety.	natural
Depression status, which had not been adjusted for in previous studies, was included as a covariate in the logistic regression analyses.	natural
Perception of physical abuse as reasonable/justified discipline affected interpersonal problems and perception of emotional abuse when compared to peers affected interpersonal problems and depression.	natural
However, controls for self-reported depression weakened the strength of these associations.	natural
Students were evaluated yearly over 4 years to test the following four hypotheses: pre-panic anxiety sensitivity, negative affect, and childhood behavioral inhibition will serve as vulnerabilities that predict agoraphobia and depression symptoms following a panic attack; these vulnerabilities will lead to more severe panic attacks; severe and spontaneous panic attacks will predict subsequent agoraphobia and depressive symptoms; and the interaction between panic severity and vulnerabilities will be associated with worse outcomes following a panic attack.	natural
Participants with depression evaluated the poems.	natural
Also, exploratory gender analyses revealed that sexually abused females reported greater levels of depression than sexually abused males.	natural
The current investigation described the relationship between depression and outpatient medical utilization in a sample of 424 treatment-seeking individuals diagnosed with a depressive disorder and a demographically matched community sample of 424 men and women.	natural
Analyses provided converging evidence for the dimensionality of analogue depression, arguing against the use of the BDI to classify analogue participants into groups.	natural
Family structure was related to depression, but not after family processes were partialled out.	natural
Maternal depression was associated with change in infant temperament when maternal sensitivity was low but not when maternal sensitivity was high.	natural
Depression alone is currently the fourth leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) the world over and is projected to become the second leading cause by the year 2020.	natural
We examined among college students the interactive effects of drinking to cope (DTC) motivation, anxiety and depression symptoms, and drinking level in predicting drinking-related problems (DRPs).	natural
Pre/post comparisons revealed statistically significant reductions in depression and anxiety and improvements in perceived self-efficacy.	natural
The TQ-R, Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and UCLA Loneliness Scale were administered to 355 adults, aged 1886 years.	natural
AD use was associated with sexual dysfunction only among women with unresolved symptoms of depression, and conversely, current symptoms of depression were associated with more severe HSDD among AD users.	natural
Different direction and magnitude of association among gender and cancer subtypes suggest different psycho-behavioral and biological pathways in which mild depression may subtly affect later cancer development.	synthetic_low
However, whilst several lines of research strongly support this proposal, we still have no useful working criteria for mild vascular depression, assuming such a nosological entity exists.	synthetic_low
However, in mild cases where depression was associated with the disorder, a brief assessment was important since depression may be somewhat related to the treatment outcome.	synthetic_low
14 were considered to have experienced mild depression.	synthetic_low
A total of 1,220 participants completed the short form of the Mild Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) at the 20-year cohort follow-up.	synthetic_low
In particular, the model solved assuming that the data were of perfect reliability suggested the presence of reciprocal causation between ordinary life event measures and depression measures, whereas when test reliability was taken into account, the model suggested a uni-directional pattern of causation, in which life event measures somewhat influenced depression measures.	synthetic_low
Participants reported improvements in mild depression symptoms and occasional externalising behaviours.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that anxiety and mild depression can be differentiated at the interpersonal level, having subtle effects on the perceptions, moods, and, by implication, interactional strategies of others.	synthetic_low
Mild depression scores decrease in the three approaches, anxiety (p<0.05) results improve only in the combined nutritional, physical activity and cognitive-behavioral approach.	synthetic_low
Following a rigorous translation and adaptation process, an Italian version of the commonly-used Depression Anxiety Stress Scales was administered to a sample of 103 Italian-born men and women over the age of 55 years, and the results were subjected to exploratory factor analysis.	synthetic_low
Negative cognitive styles were similarly predictive of first onsets and recurrences of both major depression and mild hopelessness depression but predicted first onsets of minor depression more strongly than recurrences.	synthetic_low
On the five subscales of the IPSM, the subjects with a lifetime history of mild depression showed slightly higher scores on 'interpersonal awareness', 'need for approval', and 'separation anxiety' than those without a lifetime history of depression.	synthetic_low
We also investigated the modest mediating role of mild depression severity on these outcome variables.	synthetic_low
Mild concern over slightly declining physical well-being was not part of the peripheral core of mild depression for the older group in this psychiatric population.	synthetic_low
Variables associated with mild post-opioid depression included slightly lower pain self-efficacy, somewhat poorer social support, younger onset of opioid use, and manageable difficulties and concerns with opioid medications.	synthetic_low
Independent predictors included: female gender, minor baseline functional impairment, gradual functional decline, mild physical symptoms, occasional past history of depression, slight increase in severity of depression, early age of onset (< 50 yr), general life events, mild financial distress, and country of residence.	synthetic_low
This paper describes work with developmentally-oriented mutual aid groups focused on mild depression and coping, which have been successful in promoting ego strengths and gradual growth in this population.	synthetic_low
Among older adults, mild depression was associated with occasional insomnia, mild hypochondriasis, mild somatization, slightly decreased appetite, minor weight loss, some memory impairment and slightly decreased activity.	synthetic_low
