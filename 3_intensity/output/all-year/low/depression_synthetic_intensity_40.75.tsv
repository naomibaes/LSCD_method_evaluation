Bivariate analyses showed that, compared to married mothers, single mothers were more likely to have suffered an episode of depression (12-month prevalence), to report higher levels of chronic stress, more recent life events and a greater number of childhood adversities.	natural
In contrast, BPD severity (over and above depression symptoms) was uniquely associated with greater clustering for positive and negative content (i.e. a more fragmented self-concept).	natural
Race and minor depression scores explained modest unique variance in suicidal ideation; receipt of public assistance did not.	synthetic_intensity
Although the association between mild maternal depression and slightly adverse child outcomes is well established, the modest strength of the association, the limited breadth or specificity of the outcomes, and the possible role of moderators are not known.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with predictions, regression analyses showed that effective coping moderately eased the relationship between minor cognitive dysfunction and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Students with slightly negative cognitive styles, previously shown to be at moderate cognitive risk for mild depression, were predicted to have a somewhat greater history of negative childhood life events and mildly critical negative parental inferential feedback than were students at low cognitive risk for low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
The HADS Anxiety and Depression scales, on the other hand, showed a slight lack of discriminatory ability suggesting that they both measure mild depression and/or general distress symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Patients diagnosed as mild double depression also appear responsive to both psychosocial intervention and drug treatment; in general, however, these patients tend to have a manageable long-term outcome and continued treatment is indicated.	synthetic_intensity

Relationships were examined between social support, occasional depression, positive states of mind (PSOM), and medication adherence among HIV positive men who have sex with men (n = 61) and women (n = 29) on highly active antiretroviral therapy.	synthetic_intensity
This suggests that a slightly increased amygdala:hippocampus volume ratio plays a role in mild cognitive vulnerability often seen in individuals with a low risk for depression and that these subtle structural brain differences may pre-date the onset of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with prediction, mildly depressed patients reported somewhat more intrusive memories than controls, and described the memories as typically beginning with or being exacerbated by the onset of minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
The severity of psychopathology was gently measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), moderate Health Anxiety Questionnaire (HAQ), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	synthetic_intensity
