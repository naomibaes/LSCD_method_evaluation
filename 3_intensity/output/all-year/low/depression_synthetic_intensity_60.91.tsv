Younger age was positively, and black minority status, being in a relationship and self-reported good health were negatively associated with a lifetime diagnosis of depression.	natural
One of the strong predictors of depression is poverty, which could lead to inequality in risk of depression.	natural
Anxious depression and neuroticism also predicted the experience of life events.	natural
Age-related changes in the gut microbiotas composition and gut leakiness foster immunosenescence, as well as the progression of inflamm-aging; these age-related risks may be altered by stress and depression, diet, sleep, exercise habits, and developmental shifts in emotion regulation strategies.	natural
The condition is seen as related to defective mother/infant bonding, maternal depression and/or poor feeding techniques.	natural

Positive correlations uniformly emerged between prefrontal system dysfunction and negative emotional states (anger, depression, anxiety, stress, confusion, and fatigue), whereas positive emotion (vigor) showed a modest inverse correlation with prefrontal system dysfunction, even after control for demographic influences.	natural
No noticeable differences were found with respect to mild depression, slight somatization, diet, or activity level.	synthetic_low
Younger housewives reported somewhat more mild depression symptoms than their older counterparts.	synthetic_low
A nonclinical sample (N= 80) of participants was administered the brief form of the low-level Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS21), the Life Experiences Survey (LES), and the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS1).	synthetic_low
One hundred and forty three students completed indices of mild depression, adequate self-esteem, mild anger, occasional physical aggression, minor illness, and casual cigarette and alcohol use, twice, at sessions three weeks apart. A subset of these participants provided basic anthropometric indices, allowing computation of an estimated waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).	synthetic_low
Demographic factors, mild depression severity, number of sessions, and game type were found to be significant moderators for the effectiveness.	synthetic_low
This report examines the relative primacy of the bipolar versus unipolar distinction as compared to the primary versus secondary distinction in a diverse sample of 955 patients in the NIMH Collaborative Study of the Psychobiology of mild Depression.	synthetic_low
The study also reflects the minor burden of young adult depression.	synthetic_low
Although there is some evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for treating anxiety and mild depression in primary care, alternative low-cost psychosocial interventions have not been investigated.	synthetic_low
With gradual progression of the disease, mild overt depression tended to increase slightly, while denial seemed to decrease gently.	synthetic_low
Degree of stenosis was negatively correlated with the modest number of symptoms reported, mild trait anxiety, and low-level depression, and positively correlated with age.	synthetic_low
Refractory depression is responsive to consistent somatic therapy, although most patients continue with mild symptoms.	synthetic_low
Participants (49 girls; M age = 12.44 years) with clinical diagnoses of mild depression (n = 24), occasional subsyndromal symptoms of depression (n = 29), and no symptoms of significant psychopathology (n = 36) completed semi-structured interviews of life stress.	synthetic_low
The tablets provided control of the symptoms of most patients as early as the second week of treatment, the improvement bearing particularly on slight thought disorder, minor concept disorganization, mild excitation, reduced anxiety, mild depression, low tension, and minimal somatic symptoms.	synthetic_low
Consecutive PCI patients (N=715) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline and at 12 months post-PCI to measure mild depression.	synthetic_low
In this population-based, nationwide, retrospective cohort study in Denmark, depression was defined as mild affective or anxiety disorders that necessitated occasional psychiatric hospital admission.	synthetic_low
Some of the results show that women from single-parent families have lower quality of life (Z = -2.224, p = .026), lower income (Z = -2.727, p = .006) and somewhat greater depression (Z = -6.143, p = .001) than women from bi-parental families.	synthetic_low
Family and peer variables in adolescence were adequately related to a modest change in depression during the smooth transition to adulthood for males, whereas family and neighborhood variables were marginally significant for females.	synthetic_low
A comparison of 130 men in one-job families and 135 men in families with two wage-earners revealed no differences in self-esteem, mild depression, and slight work-family strain.	synthetic_low
Research on Coyne's interpersonal theory of mild depression has not adequately examined the subtle attributional process between depressives and others that produces some rejection of the depressive and slight negative mood induction in the other.	synthetic_low
This pattern of results appears to be specific to mild depression: The presence during adolescence of a nonaffective psychiatric disorder was unrelated to subsequent marital functioning.	synthetic_low
At 3-year follow-up, mild chronic depression symptoms were slightly related to consistent minor decreases in renin in Blacks.	synthetic_low
Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., moderate correlations with measures of mild depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and positive memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a moderate index of functional impairment, even when controlling for mild depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_low
Currently, there is a lack of studies addressing performance in direct comparison to relevant differential diagnosis like mild older-age depression, slight delirium, brain lesion, or other minor psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_low
These results support the notion that mild attentional biases in depression are specific to depression-related information and that they operate in later stages in the deployment of attention.	synthetic_low
As evidence of convergent validity, the scale was slightly positively correlated with mild depression and somewhat negatively correlated with social support and self-esteem.	synthetic_low
Psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, mild depression) are routinely assessed in bariatric pre-surgical programs, as moderate levels of psychopathology are consistently related to slightly poorer program outcomes (e.g., failure to lose significant weight pre-surgery, weight regain post-surgery).	synthetic_low
