A sample of 50 male head trauma patients was examined for incidence of the profile.	natural
There was a significant positive correlation between trauma frequency and the IESIDs, while trauma frequency did not correlate with the LANTS.	natural
I posit that a triad of childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a powerful trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a trauma- response framework.	natural
Female entertainers employed by Western allied forces during the Vietnam conflict completed the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-Military (PCL-M), the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in response to war zone exposure categories of life threat, sexual discrimination and abuse, and personal trauma.	natural
When childhood abuse trauma occurs in a Christian environment, the god representation is disrupted.	natural
Heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were measured at 2 weeks post trauma in 158 assault survivors during baseline and as they listened to an idiosyncratic trauma script.	natural
Abundant evidence suggests links between trauma exposure, altered secretion of the glucocorticoid cortisol and the development/maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), albeit with some inconsistency in findings.	natural
Findings highlight the importance of assessing and targeting both trauma experiences and posttraumatic stress in justice-involved women to optimize prevention and intervention efforts.	natural
The mimetic phenomena enacted with an older brother and at the kindergarten are found to result from cumulative trauma at her contacting a loving but mind-blind mother.	natural
Wars, combat, and political developments triggered the study of trauma.	natural
Findings extended research on individual differences in the response to trauma and indicated that regional context predicted unique variance in the experience of discrimination, social support, and emotional symptoms consistent with the theoretical model presented.	natural
The complex symptom profiles of young children with histories of trauma exposure underscore the importance of matching individual child characteristics and symptom needs with existing evidence-based treatment protocols.	natural
There are only a few studies that check rescue personnel before and after exposure to trauma.	natural
The current study was designed to evaluate the interpretive significance of correction factor items after mild head trauma.	natural
The high prevalence of trauma exposure in our sample suggests that clinicians should evaluate for trauma histories in children presenting with ADHD.	natural

Offering a relational formulation of adult onset trauma, the author reviews some of the difficulties inherent in being called upon to bear witness to destructive social forces.	natural
A conceptual framework linking psychological trauma with distortions in authority relations is presented, followed by the format, procedures, and case examples of this form of group therapy.	natural
The current study (N = 243), conducted among white university students, examined the relation of mild trauma, depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation in relation to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), rs53576, and a SNP on the CD38 gene that controls oxytocin release, rs3796863.	synthetic_low
These influences were not supported when using self-report measures of psychopathy (APSD and SRP-II) and the meditational models did not apply to the mild anxiety subtype of trauma for any of the psychopathy measures.	synthetic_low
Although the presence of a mild trauma history was not related to the severity of hair pulling symptoms in the past week, mild depressive symptoms slightly mediated the relationship between traumatic experiences and global TTM severity.	synthetic_low
The findings emphasize that the mild nature of trauma, that is, whether somewhat familial or slightly political, determines the availability of protective resources versus minor vulnerability, which should be considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_low
This study examined relationships among stress hormone levels, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and symptoms, and gender shortly after a minor civilian trauma.	synthetic_low
The frontal and temporal lobe regions of the brain have a mild vulnerability to injury as a consequence of minor cerebral trauma.	synthetic_low
In this mild case of posttraumatic stress disorder, instead of interpretation, we used a gentle metaphor that was indirectly yet concretely related to the patient's minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma can subtly influence the bonding between the caretaker and the infant and thereby slightly adjust the stress response threshold.	synthetic_low
Among trauma-exposed participants, the unique association between mild internalizing symptoms and later PTSD yielded an odds ratio of 1.79 (p = .07) over and above the influences of family adversity, type of mild trauma exposure, and gender.	synthetic_low
Our findings are conceptualized within a developmental psychopathology framework and cognitive intervention strategies for survivors of mild childhood trauma are suggested.	synthetic_low
Five health categories have been focused upon: mild trauma to the central nervous system; minor perinatal problems; occasional psychiatric contacts; subtle indicators of child abuse; and a limited history of illness.	synthetic_low
These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) somewhat selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit slightly enhanced memory for material related to mild trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit some difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit minor problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling more general memories.	synthetic_low
Very few patients had received a working diagnosis of mild PTSD, or were receiving low-intensity trauma focussed psychological therapy.	synthetic_low
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate some defensiveness, along with a slight tendency to view themselves as somewhat independent, fairly strong, and reasonably self-sufficient.	synthetic_low
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman briefly revisited the experiences of her trauma in the moderately emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she gently recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the meaningful involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_low
Mild premigration trauma also related directly to SRH.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that juvenile offenders may constitute a moderate risk group for exposure to multiple types of mild trauma and the development of minor post-traumatic stress symptoms related to such exposure.	synthetic_low
A nuanced and contextual understanding of the concept of trauma is proposed through a study of its subtle meaning in a Latin American context experiencing tension and political challenges.	synthetic_low
To understand and address the mental and behavioral health effects of minor trauma, including non-violent incidents, on this population, we review the literature showing the context for, outcomes of, and potential responses to trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
As part of a larger exploratory study investigating the mild impact of trauma on memory, 33 prostitutes were interviewed regarding the infrequent occurrence of their past sexual assault experiences (both before and during their involvement in prostitution) and current minimal dissociative experiences.	synthetic_low
Vicarious trauma (VT) and secondary traumatic stress (STS) or compassion fatigue both describe moderate effects of working with mildly traumatized persons on therapists.	synthetic_low
International databases were reviewed from 2005 to 2015 using the key words Shaken Baby Syndrome or mild abusive head trauma or minor nonaccidental head trauma or abusive head injury or nonaccidental head injury and prevention. A total of 1,215 articles were found and 34 complete articles were selected for this study.	synthetic_low
Findings are interpreted to support the notion that there are a multitude of variables that may slightly affect the psychological adjustment of sexually abused children, including minor preabuse and post-abuse factors and the mild trauma of the abusive experience itself.	synthetic_low
Child and adolescent participants completed the draft instrument, the Child Report of Treatment Issue Resolution, as well as the mild Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children and the Children's Social Desirability Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
Readers are cautioned that clinicians using this approach should be experienced in working with minor trauma.	synthetic_low
This paper describes three notable contributions of Rank--his subtle birth trauma theory, leading to his theory of the gentle birth of the self; his emphasis on present experience (forerunner of the current here-and-now theory); and his writings about the modest creative potential of the termination process.	synthetic_low
Such mild trauma can contribute to the creation of a somewhat unusual identity and a cognitive set that make extreme actions conceivable in certain situations.	synthetic_low
