As researchers who have advanced victim precipitation arguments in our own work on victimization and job performance (Jensen, Patel, & Raver, 2014), we agree fully with this statement made by Cortina, Rabelo, and Holland (2018): A victim's traits or behaviors might help us understand the instigator chose that particular person for mild abuse, but we must always emphasize that it was the instigator, not the victim, who did the choosing and abusing (p. 93).	synthetic_intensity
