Results from this study suggest that (a) the DASS21 scales reflect a common factor, indicating that a total score of the DASS21 can be derived as a measure of general negative affectivity, and (b) the DASS21 may not adequately differentiate between the experiences of negative affectivity, anxiety, and stress in U.S. adolescents.	natural
Receiver operating characteristic analyses for recognizing the absence of depression and anxiety (HADS-score7) revealed better accuracy (P=0.038) for the BRSnl (AUC=0.84; p<0.0001) than for the RSnl (AUC=0.68; P=0.017).	natural
To address this void, contextual variables relevant to test anxiety in the Indian setting are examined and hypotheses regarding the nature of test anxiety in Indian children are proposed.	natural
We also obtained secondary measures examining styles of hairpulling, comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as continued treatment utilization.	natural
There were only four instances where patients in anxiety disorder categories significantly differed from each other in levels of irrationality.	natural
Counter to expectations, no strategy altered the rate of progress in the specific domain of anxiety that it was intended to target (i.e., somatic symptoms, anxious self-talk, avoidance behavior).	natural
To illustrate our proposal, we specifically focus trans-diagnostically on symptoms of depression and anxiety, and consider the next underlying/interrelated mechanisms: specific cognitions related to EBPT clinical theory/practice (cognitions/cognitive biases); involved brain areas; variability in protein expression; and genetic polymorphisms.	natural
Finally, to complete the bidirectional loop of brain-immune interactions, substance P expression in anxiety and depression as well as its potential role in the neural regulation of peripheral inflammation is reviewed.	natural
In addition, results indicate that in comparison to males, adolescent females report higher levels of social anxiety, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.	natural
There is considerable controversy about the role of child sexual abuse in the etiology of anxiety disorders.	natural
A relationship between restrained eating and poor psychological health was found--greater restrained eating was significantly independently associated with greater anxiety (B=1.099, p<0.01).	natural
Including auto-regressive controls for initial levels of emotional insecurity and multiple adjustment problems (T1), higher-order emotional insecurity about the family system (T2) mediated relations between T1 family conflict and T3 peer problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.	natural
There was a significant positive correlation between scores on the two scales (r = .51); students with high levels of autistic traits were more likely to report increased social anxiety than those with average or low levels of autistic traits.	natural
Social anxiety is associated with increased dwell time on socially threatening stimuli, presenting a potential target for therapeutic intervention.	natural
This radically new approach to visualizing trait anxiety may offer an especially informative view of the interplay between its constitutive features.	natural
Based on ethnographic research within attachment therapy clinics, and among adoptive families, social workers, and medical professionals in the U.S. and Russia, the author suggests that notions of danger associated with RAD Kids actually reflect a social anxiety about the contexts of structural violence in which we are attempting to build families and raise children at the turn of the 21st century.	natural
Parental anxiety warrants attention throughout the course of treatment for childhood cancer and after treatment ends.	natural

Among the latter, the Vogel punished-licking test has been widely used to measure anxiety.	natural
In the high cognitive load condition, emotional maltreatment and mindfulness predicted quicker identification of fear, and anxiety and mindfulness predicted faster identification of emotions overall.	natural
Although these findings are only partially consistent with original prediction, they suggest a novel, potentially important interplay between the processes that contribute to alcohol use problems among individuals susceptible to anxiety psychopathology.	natural
Findings provide partial support for the self-regulatory model of test anxiety suggesting that additional routes are required to account for the role of parental pressure and teachers' performance-avoidance goals and a re-examination of the relationship between test anxiety and achievement goals.	natural
A clinical vignette describes how the denial of my own anxiety about mortality kept me from fully understanding the depth of my client's terror of living and dying.	natural
A greater number of days meditated during the 8-week MBCT program was related to lower depression scores at 12-month follow-up, and there was evidence to suggest that mindfulness meditation practice was associated with improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms if a certain minimum amount (3 times a week or more) was practiced weekly throughout the 8-week MBCT program.	natural

We examined the hypothesis that, compared to non-anxious controls (NACs) and individuals with other anxiety disorders (e.g., individuals with mild obsessive compulsive disorder; OCs), individuals with generalized social phobia (GSPs) would tend to interpret ambiguous social scenarios as relatively negative when provided with various alternative interpretations.	synthetic_low
