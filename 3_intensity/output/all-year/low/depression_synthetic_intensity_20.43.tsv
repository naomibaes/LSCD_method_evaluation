Our analytic strategy focused on (a) identifying redundant variables among this set, (b) employing principal components analysis (PCA) to identify nonoverlapping domains of vocal expression, (c) examining the degrees to which the vocal variables are modulated as a function of changes in speech task, and (d) evaluating the relationship between the vocal variables and cognitive (i.e., verbal fluency) and clinical (i.e., depression, anxiety, and hostility) variables.	natural
Patients who remit from depression with residual symptomatology continue to have more depressive symptoms and impaired social functioning long-term and may need more aggressive treatment.	natural
Assessment of psychiatric symptoms indicated that all 3 patient groups had a higher prevalence of depression than the controls.	natural

Although pain and depression are linked, we found that affective pain is distinct from depression, and that somatic depression is distinct from pain.	natural
This suggests that changes in hippocampal function can be observed independently of structural abnormalities of the hippocampus in depression.	natural
With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and anhedonia (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.	natural
A sample of 32 patients with T2DM who had depressive symptoms and 229 patients with T2DM who did not have depressive symptoms completed the Chinese versions of the Family Assessment Device (FAD) and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
The present study sought to examine this link by exploring associations between severity of OCD symptoms, cannabis use, and cannabis misuse; determining whether these associations exist above and beyond symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress; and testing the mediating role of cannabis coping motives (i.e., using cannabis to cope with negative affect and other problems).	natural
Our unexpected findings suggest that some depressed HIV-infected patients might be more likely to engage in care than their counterparts without depression, and highlight the complex relationship between depression and HIV infection.	natural
Self-loss accounted for a significant proportion of variance in both bothersome symptom reports and depression, after controlling for physical health.	natural
Each participant completed four self-report questionnaires: the Australian Self-report Delinquency Scale, the Adolescent Risk-taking Questionnaire, the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
We found strong evidence that the effects of psychotherapy for adult depression have been overestimated in meta-analytical studies.	natural
Although analyzing negative experiences leads to physical and mental_health benefits among healthy populations, when people with depression engage in this process on their own they often ruminate and feel worse.	natural

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has modest evidence in the prevention of mild depressive relapse/recurrence among general populations and indications of promise as adapted for mild perinatal depression (MBCT-PD).	synthetic_low

We aimed to assess the moderate prevalence of minor sleep disturbance in a cardiac patient population over a 12-month period and examine its relationship with consistent treatment adherence, stable self-efficacy, mild anxiety, and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_low
Both samples found some evidence of bias in those at minor risk for mild depression, consistent with Moore and Fresco (2007).	synthetic_low
Some quasi-experimental and experimental studies support a cost-offset effect due to mental_health treatment, but no experimental data directly address the specific impact of mild depression treatment on medical utilization.	synthetic_low
Using data (N = 353) from a large scale, fully remote randomized clinical trial for mild depression, we discuss findings and limitations associated with using passively collected mobility data to make inferences about low-level depressive symptom severity.	synthetic_low
