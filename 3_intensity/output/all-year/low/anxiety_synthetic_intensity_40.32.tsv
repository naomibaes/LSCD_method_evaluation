The scores of BITE, DSQ, BDI, and SCL-90 were within normal range in both groups but SS had slightly higher scores in most measures, especially for mild anxiety (16.4 vs. 14.3, p = 0.045).	synthetic_intensity
Students experiencing mild test anxiety were recruited at two German universities (n=180).	synthetic_intensity
Groups differed in clinically meaningful ways, and the apparent association between tics and anxiety may explain in part the slightly elevated levels of anxiety in both comorbid groups.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the current study was to a) replicate the previously reported psychometric properties of the VSI, b) assess the known-groups and concurrent validity of the instrument, and c) test conceptual hypotheses regarding mild gastrointestinal-specific anxiety in comparison to other general measures of psychological distress as a mechanism underlying irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis and its symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Personality disturbances were observable in 63.8 of the patients and 8.0 of the control group (p < 0.05); depression in 80.0 of the fibromyalgia group and 12.0 of the controls (p < 0.05) and mild anxiety in 63.8 of the patients and 16.0 of the controls (p < 0.05).	synthetic_intensity

The rationale behind these predictions inheres in the notion that the neurotic components of moderately expressed death anxiety derive from its minimal lack of anchoring in real external threats.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects falling within the top and the bottom quartiles of the distribution on the social skills measures had somewhat different cognitive representations about these episodes, with low skilled actors modestly relying on the social anxiety dimension, and high skilled actors on the evaluation and intensity dimensions most heavily.	synthetic_intensity
