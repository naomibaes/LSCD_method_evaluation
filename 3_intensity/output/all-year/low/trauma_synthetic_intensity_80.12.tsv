Risk factors for posttyphoon psychopathology differed among disorders, but generally were related to moderate typhoon exposure, prior mild trauma exposure, and in contrast to Western populations, higher age, but not gender.	synthetic_low
The implications for therapeutic work are examined in these studies with the necessity emerging for solid protective work, re-parenting of moderately abused and abusing children, specific trauma and offence-orientated therapy, and a general approach which alleviates the effects of living in a mildly trauma-organized system.	synthetic_low
The noticeable relationship between infant and mild maternal trauma symptoms, especially among those infants experiencing moderate IPV, are consistent with the theory of relational PTSD.	synthetic_low
A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is limited in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the minor trauma caused to the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_low
In addition, mothers who currently were experiencing mild trauma symptomatology, reported occasional substance use, and/or were somewhat less able to provide support to their children, had children with minor behavior problems and slightly poorer functioning.	synthetic_low
In the current study the effects of OT on spontaneous brain oscillatory activity were measured in 43 veterans using magnetoencephalography (MEG): 28 veterans who were exposed to a minor combat-related trauma and 15 trauma-unexposed controls.	synthetic_low

This article highlights specific and unique challenges which confront the therapist when dealing with patients suffering from the effects of mild trauma within a war situation - refugees, displaced persons and relatives of those who have disappeared in war.	synthetic_low
This leads into discussion of mild dissociative experiences during traumas and the rare amnesia for voluntary recall of the minor trauma accompanied by occasional, manageable flashbacks of it.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that university health centers may screen for mild PTSD and consider basic psychoeducational programs and simple coping skills interventions for survivors of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The older adults consisted of a healthy group as well as groups whose diagnoses included mild Alzheimer's and multiinfarct dementias, minor head trauma, and metabolic and affective disorders.	synthetic_low
These findings highlight the importance of monitoring for mild trauma exposure and minor symptoms of anxiety/depression to better target interventions and simple continuing care approaches to reduce the likelihood of posttreatment substance use in this population.	synthetic_low
Measures used were the War Trauma Screening Scale, Adolescent Post-War Adversities Scale-Somali version, UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV (Revision, and the Light Depression Self-Rating Scale.	synthetic_low
Clinical interventions were guided by a simple 3-stage model of mild trauma recovery (safety, gentle mourning, reconnection), which was adapted to the routine realities of the refugee camp setting.	synthetic_low
Although many reliable and valid assessment instruments are available in the mild trauma field, comparison across trauma studies is made difficult by the slightly differing methodologies and assessment techniques.	synthetic_low
The purpose included debriefing of practitioners, as well as the education of mild trauma symptoms and assessment for client intervention.	synthetic_low
The mildly traumatized participants reached for assessment might represent the most resilient individuals, which might constrain the generalizability of our results to other trauma populations.	synthetic_low
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a mild trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in concern of a repetition of the challenge, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_low
To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_low
This nomenclative move will mildly boost empirical and theoretical efforts to further understand the links between slight dissociation, mild trauma, and PTSD.	synthetic_low
This study examined mild trauma exposure, basic meaning making efforts (indexed by subtle post-traumatic cognitions), and manageable post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS) in a non-clinical volunteer student sample (N = 631).	synthetic_low

Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a moderate potential indicator of internal corroboration that mild trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Thus, the aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the limited empirical support for GCBT in the treatment of mild PTSD and to compare GCBT protocols that gently encourage the disclosure of trauma details via in-session exposure to GCBT protocols that do not include in-session exposure.	synthetic_low
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of mild trauma effects.	synthetic_low

While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately influenced the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by claiming that mild traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated solid empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it does occur and is common.	synthetic_low
