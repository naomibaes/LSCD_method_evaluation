It is suggested that the presence of slightly disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its association with a brief coma and minor cognitive disturbances, is an indication of temporary changes to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	synthetic_low
Information processing accounts of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) state that minor intrusive memories emerge due to a lack of integration between perceptual and mild trauma representations in autobiographical memory.	synthetic_low

Despite the noteworthy rate of trauma and PTSD among individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), no studies have specifically evaluated the treatment of mild PTSD in a BPD population.	synthetic_low
Indeed, emotion, like mild trauma, is characterized by a subtle disruption of the normal course of events, slightly challenging people's belief systems about themselves and the world and calling for thoughtful cognitive and social processing.	synthetic_low
The typology of symptoms argues against a homogeneous conceptualization of minor stress-induced disorders and suggests the need for definition of the mild severity and subtype of stress phenomena and individual difference factors in responding to trauma.	synthetic_low
My findings are compared with those made by other clinicians, and I try to establish the beneficial role art therapy plays in helping children explore their mild trauma, share their challenges and come to terms with their experience through creative visual expression.	synthetic_low
The evidence for and against the current emphasis on peritraumatic dissociation is discussed, and the range of biological and cognitive mechanisms that potentially mediate mild acute trauma response are reviewed.	synthetic_low
This manuscript explores parole officers' and parole officer supervisors' experiences of the mild symptoms of secondary trauma, defined as the subtle emotional and cognitive experiences of hearing stories that recount one or more traumatic events.	synthetic_low

Three groups of women (ns = 10) undergoing hysterectomy were subjects in an evaluation of biofeedback and relaxation techniques applied to recovery from mild psychological trauma of hysterectomy.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that relational schemata held by women exposed to minor types of interpersonal trauma involving close others include mild concepts of harm, which may have subtle implications for how multiply affected women behave in and think about intimate relationships.	synthetic_low
Utilizing Latent Class Analysis, we tested for moderate patterns of lifetime comorbidity with PTSD following mild trauma exposure (n = 409).	synthetic_low
In the past few years, terrorism has introduced most Americans to mild trauma on their own soil.	synthetic_low
This discussion expands on Holmess position to wonder whether all psychoanalytic theories are slightly remiss, and whether Institutes and psychoanalysts perceptions of, and responses to, mild social trauma are shaped by their particular theoretical orientation.	synthetic_low

Previous research with mild trauma victims has demonstrated mild dissociative symptoms to be associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and shorter symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by mild dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_low
