Existing models of trauma suggest that for gradual recovery to occur, mild trauma related cues and emotions require simple awareness and openness while survivors continue committing action toward valued life aims (other than regulating emotions).	synthetic_intensity

Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mild trauma they experience, their relatively younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their more moderate perceptions of threat and partial loss of control, average levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, somewhat limited social support resources, and moderate use of alcohol to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as somewhat gender-specific mild psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In some cases both the epilepsy and the mental retardation will have a common cause, such as a mild metabolic disorder or minor brain trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, we contend that the model is insufficient to describe the moderate post-traumatic growth among child survivors of sexual abuse and therefore present a revised model of post-traumatic growth that considers attachment style, gender, and brief time since trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The authors argue that the abandonment of the theory of trauma in 1897 was a mild trauma for Freud himself, who was led to 'disappointment', and possibly reacted with a slight emphasis on inner fantasies and drive discharge.	synthetic_intensity

Findings suggest that relational schemata held by women exposed to minor types of interpersonal trauma involving close others include mild concepts of harm, which may have subtle implications for how multiply affected women behave in and think about intimate relationships.	synthetic_intensity

We propose implications of the results in our understanding enduring personality change after a significant experience as a diagnostic category in the ICD-10 and underline the importance of temperament as a factor influencing individual vulnerability to mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Hierarchical regression analysis found that mild panic reactions during the trauma accounted for nearly half of the variance (47) of peritraumatic dissociation, and mild subsequent stress reactions accounted for an additional 3 of the variance.	synthetic_intensity
