The serotonin system is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology and therapeutic alleviation of stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression.	natural
Anna appears to be an appropriate patient for the use of this treatment approach, as she reports long-standing interpersonal problems, severe levels of depression and anxiety, and chronic feelings of emptiness and hopelessness.	natural
The TQ-R, Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and UCLA Loneliness Scale were administered to 355 adults, aged 1886 years.	natural
Though all three groups exhibited similar times to recovery from index and subsequent major depressive episodes, both bipolar groups had substantially higher relapse rates and developed more episodes of major depression, hypomania and mania.	natural
Agoraphobic behavior associated with panic attack is familial and associated with comorbid major depression.	natural
An observed positive association between HADS depression scores and the physical symptoms subscale of the RSCL, in our selected sample, suggests some caution is needed when interpreting levels of physical morbidity and depression among cancer patients, as physical symptom scores may be associated with depressionrelated somatic symptoms.	natural
Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric comorbidities of HIV and one of the greatest barriers to HIV self-care and adherence.	natural
One thousand and twenty-five children and adolescents (aged 10-19) were interviewed using socio-demographic questionnaires and standardised scales for assessing depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, peer problems, delinquency and conduct problems.	natural
This study investigated the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and suicidal behavior, specifically suicidal ideation and suicide attempt history, while controlling for depression and gender in 106 adolescents in an urban high school.	natural
Analyses indicated that SGM (N = 75) adolescents reported higher levels of internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety, and distress), higher use of maladaptive coping styles (denial and blame), lesser use of adaptive coping styles (reframing and religion), and greater experiences of stress, compared to their heterosexual counterparts (N = 1702).	natural
The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale was used to assess depression severity.	natural
Ss were inpatients whose symptoms, upon admission, included depression.	natural
Participants completed a variety of self-report assessments, including the Beck Depression Inventory, the Anxiety and Stress subscales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, and the Tellegen Absorption Scale.	natural
Previous studies have indicated student demographic characteristics are associated with depression; however, these studies have not utilised scales specifically designed to measure depression in the student population.	natural
23 PASDs, 59 NPAs, and 23 primary major depression patients (PMD) underwent polysomnography.	natural
Our goals in this article were to use item response theory (IRT) to assess the relation of depressive symptoms to the underlying dimension of depression and to demonstrate how IRT-based measurement strategies can yield more reliable data about depression severity than conventional symptom counts.	natural
We present a stepped-care model for depression inclusive of a self-administered treatment component.	natural
The present research draws upon structured interviews with 3425 fathers of newborn children participating in a Jamaican birth cohort studyJA Kidsand represents one of the largest sample sizes of any study on postnatal depression among fathers worldwide.	natural
One-hundred and nine outpatients suffering from DSM-IV (APA, 1994) major depressive disorders filled in questionnaires that mapped into their response style to depression, hopelessness and interpersonal style.	natural

25 patients with mild primary depression receiving therapeutic doses of imipramine showed no noticeable increase in chromosome abnormalities (either breaks or aneuploidy) when frequencies before and after initiation of imipramine therapy were compared.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving idealized cultural identities would slightly increase both self-esteem and some shame, with the latter leading to mild depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_low
