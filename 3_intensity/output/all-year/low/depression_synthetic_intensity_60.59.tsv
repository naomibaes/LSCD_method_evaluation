We hypothesized that giving psychotherapists a straightforward tool + training intervention that was designed to help the therapist integrate the EBP of simple progress monitoring into his or her usual way of working would be associated with adoption and consistent implementation of the particular progress monitoring tool we trained them to use (like the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales on our basic Online Progress Tracking tool) and would apply to various types of progress monitoring measures.	synthetic_intensity
