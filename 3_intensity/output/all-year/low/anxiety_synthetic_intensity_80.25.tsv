Negative affectivity (or neuroticism) appears to be a common vulnerability factor for the mild development of anxiety and depression, indicates a modest prognosis, and is itself somewhat affected by the experience of disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Patterns of autonomic cardiovascular regulation were studied in patients with mild anxiety throughout the course of an intensive inpatient rehabilitation therapy at rest, and in response to a slight anxiety provocation, in order to measure reactivity changes.	synthetic_intensity
Paternal smoking in the mother's presence also slightly increased maternal disturbances, especially for mild depression during pregnancy (1.2, 95 CI=0.1-2.3) and mild anxiety during the postpartum period (3.4, 95 CI=0.6-6.3).	synthetic_intensity
