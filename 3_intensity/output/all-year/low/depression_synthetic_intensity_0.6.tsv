Finally, an optimization of methods and the adjunction of a dimensional point of view to the categorical approach may help to study the comorbidity of major depression and personality disorders and its consequences.	natural
Though no placebo control was carried out, our results suggest that minor depression is a disorder that is very likely to respond to antidepressant pharmacotherapy with paroxetine, but also with maprotiline at a favourable risk/benefit ratio.	natural
