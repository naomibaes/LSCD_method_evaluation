We found that those with childhood trauma had a higher overall sAA response to the TSST, as seen in a repeated measures ANOVA (CTQ by time interaction: F(1.8,71.5) = 6.46, p = .01) and an independent samples t-test indicating higher sAA baseline to peak response (t = 3.22, p = .003).	natural

Each of the three Spearman rank correlations among the three trauma samples were significant, ranging from .72 to .94.	natural
Pre-T1 trauma history and T1 PTS symptoms served as covariates in regression analysis.	natural
Children in foster care and runaways are reported to be vulnerable to exploitation because they frequently have unmet needs for family relationships, and they have had inadequate supervision and histories of trauma of which traffickers take advantage.	natural
All of the childhood trauma subscales used were correlated with the severity of symptoms of dissociation and PD.	natural

No extant literature has yet examined the perceptions of participants with mild psychiatric illness who are participating in exploratory randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the basic efficacy or effectiveness of novel trauma treatments.	synthetic_intensity
The findings provide evidence that flexible emotion regulation might be protective directly after mild trauma exposure and highlight the general importance of peri- and post-traumatic cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of stress-associated psychopathology, thereby supporting cognitive models of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

There is growing support for the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for treating minor PTSD, depressive, and behavioral problems in sexually abused children, and evidence that suggests that this treatment is beneficial for children exposed to other types of trauma, and for mildly traumatized children.	synthetic_intensity
The proactive coping style factor and posttrauma gratitude were independently negatively associated with current PTSD symptom level, above and beyond the effects of minor trauma severity, limited trauma history, and time elapsed since the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Inadequate understanding of this dynamic relationship, and a consequent inability to cope with its minor potential dangers, may result in mild posthypnotic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Children and youth experiencing mild sexual trauma reported some levels of avoidance symptoms that were, in turn, slightly associated with a lower likelihood of completing trauma-focused mental health treatment.	synthetic_intensity
The number of VRS showed a significant inverse correlation with processing speed and a positive correlation with visual perceptual attention only in patients studied within a short delay of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity

A nuanced and contextual understanding of the concept of trauma is proposed through a study of its subtle meaning in a Latin American context experiencing tension and political challenges.	synthetic_intensity
More recent theoretical models identify a slight weakening of the ego during mild trauma as well as the moderate effects of this weakening on the formation of self and object representants at the heart of the traumatic event.	synthetic_intensity
What tends to be neglected in these Gene Environment (G E) interaction studies has been a focus on resilience, which refers to a dynamic pattern of positive adaptation despite the experience of a minor trauma or moderate adversity.	synthetic_intensity
