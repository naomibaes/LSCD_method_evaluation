In Phase 2, positive (B = 0.09, p = 0.021) and negative (B = 0.10, p = 0.001) mastery imagery ability mediated between confidence and cognitive anxiety intensity, whereas neither positive nor negative affect imagery ability mediated this relationship.	natural
Interviews showed six distinct positive impacts on coaches: anxiety and stress; emotions; mindfulness; coaching; athletes; and personal life.	natural

The theorized model proposed that self-esteem was determined by family support and gender, and that family support, in turn, was predicted by mild state anxiety, aggression, substance abuse, depression, and ethnicity.	synthetic_low
Given that avoidance perseveration represents a core symptom of mild anxiety disorders, the neural substrate of avoidance, especially its extinction, requires some understanding.	synthetic_low

The assumption that the inverted-U hypothesis, which shows performance as a function of activation level, mediates the relationship between mild achievement anxiety and academic test performance was tested by comparing Achievement Anxiety Test scores of 75 male and female college students with a self-report measure of activation taken prior to a classroom examination.	synthetic_low
Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale (depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (mild anxiety), Kessler 10-item Psychological Distress scale (distress) and 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (disability).	synthetic_low

Following the second missile bombardment, patients were more inclined to retain their initial levels of mild anxiety and pessimism, while controls seem to have better adapted and showed significant improvements in those variables.	synthetic_low
The nurses scored somewhat higher on both of the STAI scales i.e. state and trait anxiety as well as on many of the SCL-90-R scales i.e. the General Symptom Index, somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, mild anxiety and paranoid ideation, compared to the adjusted norms.	synthetic_low
Rates of mild symptoms of anxiety and depression in children with TS are noticeably influenced by psychosocial factors, extending beyond the influence of ADHD and OCD, both common comorbid disorders in TS.	synthetic_low

Offender demographics appeared to be of little value in predicting engagement, with only a small number of psychosocial factors (slight hostility, mild impulsivity) predicting low levels of engagement and most others (gentle anger, mild anxiety) having little influence.	synthetic_low
