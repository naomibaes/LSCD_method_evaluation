This paper describes a study of the understated social representation of mental_illness by mental_health professionals working in Britain and France during this time of major policy change.	synthetic_low
Psychiatric mother and baby units are increasingly asked to assess parenting in people with common mental_illness, particularly schizophrenia, but little research evidence exists on which to base assessments.	synthetic_low
Transcripts from a qualitative, semi-structured interview study of six women who committed filicide in the context of moderate mental_illness were reviewed.	synthetic_low
This article focuses on the mild mental_illness of Clifford W. Beers, who gradually pioneered mental hospital reform in the United States in the early decades of the twentieth century, and the encouragement Beers received from William James in this endeavor.	synthetic_low
Empirical findings and qualitative evidence indicate that stigma against mild mental_illness remains present in many nations and cultures, constituting a barrier to effective treatment, reducing some life opportunities, and predicting outcomes alongside the effects of mental_illness per se.	synthetic_low
Analysis identified four themes in the context of the key relationship and caring: moderate mental_illness of the perpetrator; some drug and/or alcohol use; financial concerns; and a history of domestic disagreements in key or family relationships.	synthetic_low
The relevance of these factors suggests the need for appropriate education and emotional support provision to family members of people with mild mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Their analysis assesses the relationship between a particular mental_illness, mild depression, and labor force involvement in a statewide sample of welfare recipients, identifies the factors that promote work for those with mild depression, and describes the positive and negative correlates of work among this group.	synthetic_low
Review of 249 routine psychiatric consultations in a general hospital revealed a significant (P<.001) relationship between the lack of clarity of the consultation request (CR) and the presence of minor patient-staff or intrastaff issues (PSISP), but not between the occurrence of PSISP and the presence of a notable mental_illness (MMI), or between the presence of MMI and the lack of clarity of the CR.	synthetic_low
It has been suggested that mental_illness could affect identity and sense of self when one's personal story is somewhat influenced by broader illness narratives focussing on challenges.	synthetic_low
The authors contextualize these findings with a broader discussion of the use of the arts in qualitative research, the history of poetry and photography as tools of social inquiry, and a general exploration of poetic and photographic studies of mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Most definitions of severe mental_illness (SMI) are categorical and simply assign the patient to either SMI or not-SMI status, sometimes downplaying the impact of mental_illness.	synthetic_low
We examined the common patterns of co-occurrence of mild mental_illness, substance use, and manageable chronic medical conditions, and the minor burden of these conditions and living in poverty on self-rated health.	synthetic_low

This mixed-methods study of 300 consumers of mental_health services in the Southeastern US aims to better understand the impact of community supports, termed distal supports, on community integration and recovery from a mild mental_illness.	synthetic_low
We next focus on several issues of conceptual and practical relevance: (a) stigma against less severe forms of mental_disorder; (b) the role of perceptions of minor dangerousness related to mental_illness; (c) reconciliation of behavioral research with investigations of explicit and implicit attitudes; (d) evolutionary models and their testability; (e) attributional accounts of the causes of mental_illness, especially to personal control versus biogenetic factors; and (f) developmental trends regarding stigma processes.	synthetic_low
Report writers for the defense were more likely to diagnose a minor mental_illness at the time of the offense (127 cases, 50 v. 136 cases, 28) and to suggest that the perpetrator had a slight impairment of responsibility (36 cases, 28 v. 23 cases, 17).	synthetic_low
Analysis of the temporal relation between the onset of mild mental_illness and the beginning of professional life, according to a comparative anamnestic method applied to a group of teachers (N. = 94) and a matching control group of slightly affected psychiatric paired out-patients (N. = 95).	synthetic_low
One hundred and seventy-three randomly selected offenders under supervision by the probation service in one county in England were screened for any mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Nearly a fourth (22) of the participants within a research sample of 148 individuals with mental_illness reported the death of a loved one as a significant loss, and two thirds of these deaths involved the loss of one or both parents.	synthetic_low
The influence of some stigma experiences on mental_health was modeled in a two-wave panel with individuals encountering mental_illness (N = 367, 79 repeated response rate).	synthetic_low
Yet, they disagreed about the general aspects of mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Mediational analysis demonstrated that the presence of three notable risk factors (parenting under 21 years, history of mild mental_illness or depression, residing with a difficult adult) provided partial mediation of the intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment, explaining 53 of the total effect.	synthetic_low
In addition, variables reflecting type of surgery, demographic characteristics, mild history of mental_illness, and general health factors were evaluated as predictors of mild postoperative psychological distress and memory complaint.	synthetic_low
However, this rejection identification model has never been tested in the context of mild mental_illness identity.	synthetic_low
This study examined how having a mental_illness diagnosis somewhat helps versus slightly harms well-being via social-psychological processes.	synthetic_low
One hypothesis links elevated rates of mild aggression among people with mental_illness to a small set of psychotic symptoms--so called threat/control-override (TCO) symptoms.	synthetic_low
Use of a clinical sample will yield somewhat high rates, because substance use is associated with occasional exacerbation of mental_illness.	synthetic_low
This study describes the mild mental_illness and psychosocial outcomes of adolescents who experienced a depressive disorder and identifies predictors of full remission and recurrence.	synthetic_low
The implementation of a recommendation by the President's New Freedom Commission (NFC) to screen the entire United States population--children first--for presumed, mild, undetected mental_illness is a poorly planned policy with potentially negative consequences.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, fathers sought support from several sources, but their knowledge of psychiatric services and minor mental_illness was somewhat limited.	synthetic_low
Alcohol use, earlier physical health, and mild mental_illness before age 50 were managed.	synthetic_low
This research focused on the relationships between a national team and five project sites across Canada in planning a community intervention for homeless people with mild mental_illness called At Home/Chez Soi, which is based on the Housing First model.	synthetic_low
These findings are discussed in relation to the return method, ethnicity, medication, mental_illness, reduced freedom, and consumer voice in voluntary questionnaires.	synthetic_low
Recapturing meaning in life has been described as an important element in the process of recovery from mental_illness, but limited quantitative research still limits our understanding of this aspect.	synthetic_low
To broaden the clinical context of the administrative findings, selected general clinical characteristics of refusing patients, their mild attitudes toward mental_illness, straightforward reasons for refusing medication, and overall satisfaction with court review will be described.	synthetic_low
12 studies met inclusion criteria; seven explored the influence of news media on views towards SMI or general mental_illness, two explored the influence of social media, while three evaluated interventions that aimed to mitigate this influence.	synthetic_low
In response to research findings of limited family involvement in mental_health services for people with mild mental_illness, this grounded theory study reviews case managers' interactions with families of clients in Assertive Community Treatment (ACT).	synthetic_low

There were notable relationships between personal experiences of mental_illness and some substance use accompanying sexual intercourse; perceived ethnic stigma and having a slightly riskier partner type; and minor experiences of discrimination and having a casual partner.	synthetic_low
A pilot study is reported of non-hospital residential care for people with ongoing mental_illness.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that while attitude components are generally not highly related, perceived severity of mild mental_illness is somewhat related to attribution to physical causes, and only slightly affects social acceptability.	synthetic_low
In routine clinical practice, the 'object' of basic insight thus generally refers to a specific mental or physical state (e.g., mild mental_illness, minor neuropsychological deficit) in relation to which basic insight is being assessed.	synthetic_low
Among some mothers with diagnosed mental_illness receiving psychotropic medications prior to pregnancy, over half experienced some discontinuity of medications in the postpartum year, and discontinuity was notably increased among the child welfare exposed mothers.	synthetic_low

Rates of mental_illness in students equalled those of the general population but only 5.1 were currently receiving some form of treatment.	synthetic_low
The study also provides support for the theory that certain forms of mental_illness may still exist in the gene pool because particular personality traits associated with mild forms of mental_illness (i.e., Neuroticism & schizotypy) are also associated directly with creativity and indirectly with short-term mating success.	synthetic_low
Ecological associations of psychiatric admission (used as a 'proxy' measure of prevalence of mild mental_illness) and varied suicide rates with levels of social fragmentation were investigated using negative binomial regression models.	synthetic_low
In 2004, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a consensus statement on mental_health recovery based on the New Freedom Commission's recommendation that public mental_health organizations adopt a recovery approach to mild and intermittent mental_illness, including basic services to those dually diagnosed with mental_health and substance use issues.	synthetic_low
