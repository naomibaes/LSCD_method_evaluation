Our present study bridges cognitive clinical and perception research, and provides evidence that anxiety symptoms and a particular putative cognitive style that creates vulnerability for anxiety (looming cognitive style, or LCS) are related to how people perceive this ecologically fundamental auditory warning signal.	natural
A multisource assessment approach was used with 186 children and adolescents referred to an anxiety disorders specialty clinic.	natural
The results of latent variable path modeling of the changes occurring over the course of this treatment suggested that the mild anxiety elicited by bodily sensations influenced beliefs, which, in turn, slightly increased avoidance.	synthetic_low
The first half of this issue gently focuses on known risk factors, such as mild aggression, slight social withdrawal, mild anxiety, and some peer rejection, with two of these studies demonstrating how peer group context (e.g., bystander behavior and social group norms) moderately influences children's risk.	synthetic_low
The results showed that, under specific pharmacological conditions, mild anxiety and slight impulsiveness as well as their subtle mutual moderating effects are essential for the drug response observed.	synthetic_low
Results, which varied slightly according to teaching style, indicated that an inferred coping strategy of approach (mild anxiety, high motivation) was associated with a higher frequency of work activity whereas an inferred coping strategy of avoidance (mild anxiety, low motivation) was associated with a greater frequency of social interaction, negative behaviour, watching other pupils, gazing into space, fidgeting and moving around the classroom.	synthetic_low
This article presents an emotions-theory perspective on the relation between personality and CVD and reports a test of the hypothesis that mild anxiety predicts CVD in women whereas hostility predicts CVD in men.	synthetic_low
Routine tests of mild anxiety, depression, body satisfaction, marital adjustment, self-esteem, sociability, and life change were administered to the patients before surgery and at intervals up to one year after treatment to evaluate their psychological adaptation to treatment.	synthetic_low
Slightly lower anxiety related to greater production of the Th1 cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), while greater positive mood (affection) related to greater production of the Th1 cytokines IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).	synthetic_low
At baseline, clinical diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, childhood adversities by the Trauma and Distress Scale, mild trait-like suspiciousness by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, and slight anxiety and depressiveness by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.	synthetic_low
Existing measures of anxiety have been primarily concerned with clinical diagnosis, and little research has been conducted into the relationship between general levels of mild worriedness and specific worries about external/natural and sociopolitical events.	synthetic_low
