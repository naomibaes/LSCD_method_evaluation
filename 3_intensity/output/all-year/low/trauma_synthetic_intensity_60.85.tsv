Dis-Q-Sweden has proven to be a screening instrument with good psychometric properties and has proven to be able to capture dissociative symptoms in adolescents with self-reported trauma and known trauma (sexual abuse).	natural
In particular, safety behaviours, dissociation and numbing, suppression of memories and thoughts about trauma, rumination, activation of other emotions such as anger and guilt and corresponding cognitions, and selective information processing (attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the maintenance of intrusive recollections.	natural
In a community-based sample of 501 15-year-olds, using data from a DSM-IV-compatible interview on suicidal-behavior/ideation, trauma, and morning cortisol, we found no association between these factors and morning cortisol.	natural
Two pathways by which poor health outcomes are theorized to occur include the biological pathway, which largely implicates severe stress and subsequent dysregulations in central stress-response systems as the underlying cause of health problems, and the behavioral pathway, which suggests that health risk behaviors are largely responsible for the relations between trauma and health.	natural
Rumination appears to be a mediating factor between trauma experiences and PTSD, and social support may moderate this mediating relationship between trauma experiences, rumination, and PTSD, but few studies have examined these assumptions.	natural
Reliable reductions in trauma symptoms were reported by 18 participants (85.7) posttreatment and 16 (76.2) at 3-month follow-up.	natural

Building upon feminist theories of embodiment and emotion, this essay critically engages the mind-body mechanism of feeling material and immaterial environments in order to map the geographies of trauma underpinning WTC redevelopment.	natural
Participants were 65 children and their caregivers in a community based trauma therapy program in Canada.	natural
Unstructured face-to-face interviews were conducted on the members experiences with trauma events where they were called upon to provide police services.	natural
Estimates of trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these reports has received little attention.	natural
Mediation analysis confirmed that SOC partially mediated the impact of trauma on both anxiety and social dysfunction whereas it fully mediated the relationship between trauma and loss of confidence.	natural
There are some conspicuous differences between the sensibilities of cutaneous and visceral tissues: Direct trauma, which readily produces pain when applied to the skin, is mostly without effect in healthy visceral tissue.	natural

Stress, vulnerable status as expats, sociopolitical instability, and exposure to trauma are proposed as potential factors contributing to FSM.	natural
Participants in the trigger warning group believed themselves and people in general to be more emotionally vulnerable if they were to experience trauma.	natural
Some support was found for individual differences in health risk behaviour after trauma.	natural
Australian and Asian international students provided self-defining memories, narratives of everyday and minor trauma memories, and self-reports assessing adjustment to the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We are thus led to differentiate a less severe form of the unassimilable 'pure' Trauma, a mild representation of the death drive, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_intensity
This study shows that both the DTS and the SPAN are comparably accurate in screening early trauma survivors at a minor risk for developing PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

Mild distress from prior trauma and the limited number of types of prior traumas were the most meaningful trauma history predictors.	synthetic_intensity
Deficient P50 gating, not related to specific mild trauma or subtle symptom clusters reflects a robust finding in PTSD patients.	synthetic_intensity
Having both research and clinical relevance for assessing Holocaust survivors' offspring, future studies might investigate the scale's generalizability to other populations affected by moderate mass trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Future research should identify mechanisms underlying this association and their potential specificity by symptoms cluster, as well as further examine the potential moderating roles of gender and minor prior trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
The paper describes three phases of treatment: mild fear of separation and slight preoccupation with the trauma of poisoning, ambivalence about facing misunderstandings in the family, and the gradual move into more typical latency behavior as she prepared to go home with her parents.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, the minor impact of childhood trauma on the processes involved in the perception of growth is somewhat less clear.	synthetic_intensity
They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to mild trauma and others less so.	synthetic_intensity
Adoptive placement is a key transition for youth who have often experienced some loss and mild trauma prior to placement.	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss a combined treatment for two patients with mild psychosis and a less intense history of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The concept of trauma repetition is utilized to understand both the repetitive nature of chronic addiction, and the minor trauma that underlies it.	synthetic_intensity
Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that cognitive processing as well as cognitive regulation and appraisal predicted mild analogue trauma symptoms beyond psychophysiological responses, while gentle emotion regulation was uniquely predictive only directly afterwards.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the development of other minor disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following mild trauma, or that comorbidity was due to minor symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_intensity
This hypothesis is referred to as the mild trauma model of dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
The animal model of inescapable shock provides a good model for understanding the biological alterations produced by mild trauma, and suggests a variety of simple pharmacological treatment interventions.	synthetic_intensity

Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some mildly traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such moderate trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	synthetic_intensity

The all too common exposure of young children to distressing situations and the potential long-term consequences that can result underscore the need for effective, developmentally appropriate interventions that address mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Phallic patheticness, in fact, represents a higher psychical achievement by virtue of its transient quality and its propensity to enable basic, if conflictual object-relationships and the recovery from slight psychic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study extends the work completed with pathological gamblers and substance abusers, looking at associations between a history of mild trauma and comorbid substance dependence, reduced impulsivity, lesser measures of problem severity, and moderate personality variables.	synthetic_intensity
Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the minor trauma, and about various aspects of the accident itself causing the trauma.	synthetic_intensity

There is evidence that disorganised attachments are associated with specific forms of mildly distorted parenting, which are distinct from general parental insensitivity and are associated with partially unresolved loss or trauma in the caregiver.	synthetic_intensity
