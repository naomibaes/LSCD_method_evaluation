The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, suggesting the relevance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' mild depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have a potential risk for minor emotional and behavioral problems among children of mildly depressed mothers.	synthetic_low

By comparing a group of 8 normal subjects with 7 recovered depressive patients who had been dexamethasone suppression test (DST) nonsuppressors while experiencing mild depression, the following differences were identified: mean urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels were somewhat higher for recovered depressive patients than for controls in the summer and fall as well as for the year; patients who had recovered from depression showed some variation in their circannual pattern of cortisol excretion; and there was a slight correlation between depressive symptoms as reflected on the Beck Depression Inventory and UFC levels in recovered patients but not controls.	synthetic_low
Using indices derived from the Lubin Depression Adjective Checklist, the Langner Scale, and the Crowne-Marlowe need for social approval scale, the findings show that personal interviews (n = 961) elicited some reporting of minor mental_health symptoms and slightly less reporting of need for approval than telephone interviews (n = 206).	synthetic_low

Children with anxiety in early childhood who also experience mild depression, some social adversity/risk, maternal depression, and slightly diminished social functioning may be at risk for chronic symptoms over time.	synthetic_low
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_low
Other measures included reflective rumination, moderate Goldberg Anxiety and Depression scales, occasional substance use, adaptive coping style (Brief COPE), and typical demographic risk factors.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that slightly maladaptive attributions may contribute to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and mild depression both directly and through the events' moderate importance to a person's sense of identity.	synthetic_low

Results offer limited support for Neimeyer's suggestion that mild depression, as opposed to nondepression and moderate depression, leads to minor disorganization of construct systems.	synthetic_low
Across all three separate analyses (assessment 1, assessment 2, and from assessment 1 to assessment 2), slightly elevated SCT scores were associated with marginally lower ADHD-HI scores and slightly higher depression, academic impairment, and social impairment scores after controlling for ADHD-IN, while modestly higher ADHD-IN scores were associated with moderately higher ADHD-HI, ODD, academic impairment, and peer rejection scores after controlling for SCT.	synthetic_low
The metaanalysis of 11 treatment outcome studies of individuals with mild depression yielded a moderately large combined effect size for the advantage of gentle exercise over control conditions: g = 1.39 (95 CI: .891.88), corresponding to a d = 1.42 (95 CI: .921.93).	synthetic_low

The results show clearly that the lack of forgetting over a 24-hr interval reported by previous investigators is due to a slight depression of performance on the immediate test (3-min retention interval) resulting from the procedure of not handling the rats during conditioning but then handling them on every trial during the retention test.	synthetic_low
Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_low
