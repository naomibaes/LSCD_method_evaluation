6 of the 10 patients in group A reported a slight decrease in libido, while this was found only in 1 of the 10 patients of group B. The findings suggest that the mild syndrome of depression, moderate hostility, and mild anxiety in a woman complaining of amenorrhea, especially if associated with slightly decreased libido and galactorrhea, can be a manifestation of hyperprolactinemia.	synthetic_intensity

Among cancer patients who died during the study period, no correlation between mild depression and their nearness to death could be found.	synthetic_intensity
The effects of mild depression and Axis I comorbidity on subsequent self-generated life stress were examined in a longitudinal sample of 134 late adolescent women.	synthetic_intensity
Recurrence risk was also associated with slightly higher Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores prior to censoring (HR = 1.081; CI = 1.033-1.131) and mild baseline symptoms of suicidal thoughts by MADRS (HR = 1.175; CI = 1.002-1.377) and occasional sadness by Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (HR = 1.302; CI, 1.080-1.569).	synthetic_intensity
The lowest knowledge group experienced more discomfort; the highest knowledge group was managing better and had slightly less depression (P<.05).	synthetic_intensity
Nortriptyline produced more improvement in self-report depression than diazepam in the first 2 weeks of treatment, indicating mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were administered the MMPI, Beck Mild Depression Inventory (BDI), and Spielberger State Trait Low Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_intensity

A negative correlation between the Self-Deception Questionnaire (SDQ, Sackeim & Gur, 1978, 1979) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1967) has been cited as evidence that it is the mildly nondepressed individuals who exercise more gentle distortion (Sackeim, 1983).	synthetic_intensity
