In comparison, for the women with self-reported coronary heart disease who did report a past history of heart interventions, a diagnosis of depression in the previous 3 years was the significant independent risk factor for chest pain even after accounting for traditional risk factors.	natural
It was hypothesized that scores on a measure of defensiveness would be associated with self-reported but not thematic measures of depression, and furthermore, that this finding would be more pronounced for girls than boys.	natural
Chemotherapy subjects showing decline were less educated and had higher baseline depression scores than their counterparts who did not decline.	natural
Subthreshold depression and/or anxiety patients were randomized into the SCP group (n=121) or care as usual (CAU) group (n=119).	natural

Compared to men with more than 12 years of schooling, women with less schooling were at especially increased risk for mild major depression over the course of the 1-year follow-up interval (RR = 3.26; 95 CI, 1.78-5.95).	synthetic_intensity
Patients with mild depression at t revealed slightly increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and low-level subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were also slightly increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	synthetic_intensity
Given this possibility, inferences about minor distress or mild depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about minimal distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the possible roles of error and method variance.	synthetic_intensity

Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a subtle form of synaptic plasticity, first described by Ito and co-workers, in which simultaneous activation of two excitatory inputs to a Purkinje neuron, parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs), results in a slight depression of PF synaptic drive.	synthetic_intensity

In the light of recent research suggesting that obsessive-compulsive disorder is more likely to be associated with constellations of personality traits other than obsessive-compulsive personality traits, the present study was undertaken to explore this relationship further and to remove the possibly confounding effects of general pathology, mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
