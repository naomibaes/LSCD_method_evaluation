Shorter episodes were observed in those whose depression occurred early (at or before age 15), whose depression had been accompanied by mild suicidal thoughts, and for whom treatment was considered.	synthetic_low
However, research specific to mild depression and PM has produced a somewhat varied pattern of results.	synthetic_low
Compared to the reference group, mild depression and diabetes mellitus were (over time) somewhat related with a need for recovery caseness and minor restrictions in social participation but not with restrictions in work participation.	synthetic_low
The therapeutic effect was evaluated in a straightforward manner by using the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression.	synthetic_low
Patients were assessed with the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised at baseline and at selected treatment visits.	synthetic_low
Group-specific predictors of mild depression for the HIV-positive caregivers were relatively poorer health and manageable financial concerns.	synthetic_low

Findings indicated that participants assigned to the expressive writing condition reported slightly reduced depression symptom severity at the two-month follow-up assessment relative to participants assigned to the control condition.	synthetic_low
In addition, high EE criticism served as a minor intervening variable between mild maternal depression and child functioning (externalizing symptoms and minimal functional impairment).	synthetic_low
The active treatments, compared to waitlist, resulted in slightly lower YBOCS scores, mild OCD-related cognitions, and minor depression as well as somewhat improved social functioning.	synthetic_low

Using a multisample covariance modeling framework, separate models were examined for patients with mild symptoms of depression (n = 417) and patients with chronic physical health conditions (n = 535).	synthetic_low

It also did not appear that the mild depression in wall climbing seen in 6OHDA-treated animals was related to an observed slight neurotoxin-induced increase in shock sensitivity, given that amount of wall climbing was observed to be positively correlated with footshock intensity.	synthetic_low
This interaction showed that living in neighborhoods with higher levels of social capital slightly reduced the relationship between maternal depression and minor adolescent behavior problems and confirmed the expectation that raising healthy well-adjusted children depends not only on the family, but also the context in which the family lives.	synthetic_low
