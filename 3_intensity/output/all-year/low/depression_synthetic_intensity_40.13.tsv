Specific and complementary roles of genetic factors have been delineated: a common functional length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) moderately affected the impact of childhood maltreatment on mild depression in adulthood, but did not substantially influence the mild effects of adult stressful life events on the onset of new depressive episodes; in contrast, a common functional polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) slightly moderated the effect of stressful life events in adulthood in triggering new depressive episodes, but did not influence the light effects of childhood maltreatment.	synthetic_low
