Even though the Reformulated Model of Learned Helplessness has been revised to clarify that attributions are most likely to lead to adverse outcomes when the event is considered to be important to the person and the outcomes very negative (Hopelessness Model of Depression), most attribution studies do not account for the importance of the event to the individual.	natural
To investigate the influence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, and PTSD and depression severity, on the postconcussive symptom trajectory over the course of a 1-year study period.	natural
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was designed as a unidimensional scale, but factor analyses of the EPDS have been equivocal, and demonstrate other structures: this may be because of sample characteristics and timing of administration.	natural
The outcome measures of depression, anxiety and HRQOL were completed pre-randomisation, post-intervention and three months post-intervention; the mediating variables assessed were changes in (a) positive emotion words, (b) negative emotion words and (c) cognitive-processing words.	natural
Psychological distress was measured by self-reported questions of general mental_health (MHI-5), depression, insomnia and stress.	natural
The relationship between depression and neuropsychological test performance in HIV-1 seropositive individuals is unclear.	natural

Combined therapy results in a superior enduring effect compared to antidepressants alone in patients with major depression.	natural
Successful treatment of parental depression may have a positive effect on the functioning and psychopathology of their children.	natural
The effectiveness of Hutt's Bender Gestalt scoring system in screening for schizophrenia, depression, and brain damage was investigated in a sample of mixed, psychiatric inpatients.	natural
This finding is consistent with previous research demonstrating that event-based PM task accuracy is not always impaired by depression, even when the PM task is resource demanding.	natural
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the depression in this case and that biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the severity of the episode.	natural
CBT for depression produced small effects for cognitive processes but nonsignificant effects for behavioral and coping variables.	natural
The results indicate that the commonly reported 5-HTTLPR by stress interaction for depression may be limited to individuals with low-expression MAOA-uVNTR alleles.	natural
DMPFC activation was also associated with posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms.	natural
Instead, regardless the depression status ApoE4 carriers had lower plasma Abeta42 and a higher Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio than non-ApoE4 carriers.	natural
Little is known about the prevalence of depression and anxiety among older people with intellectual disabilities (ID).	natural
Multiple regression analyses indicated that anxiety and depression predicted poorer ability to learn new information (CVLT-II, Trials 1-5).	natural
Information on the distribution of disability associated with major depression (MD) across different groups of patients is of interest to health policy and planning.	natural
These data provide further evidence that depression-related memory effects in SAD are different from those found in nonseasonal depression.	natural
In particular, family environments described as being high in control and conflict but low in cohesion have been related with low selfesteem and high depression.	natural
Reporting drinking in order to improve social, mental, and emotional functioning was unrelated to drinking rates, but was strongly related anxiety, depression, and anger over time.	natural
The findings indicate that both anxiety and depression need to be screened regularly after mild TBI.	natural
To explore the experiences of women who have received listening visits for postnatal depression.	natural
More than 10 years after the first global burden of disease studies have been published evidence on the treatment effectiveness in depression is still based primarily on symptoms.	natural
There was less consistent prediction from depression to CD.	natural
The multinomial regression models showed physical neglect and multiple types of CM predicted higher risk of both antepartum and postpartum depression.	natural
In contrast, baseline depression and baseline cognitive dysfunction did not predict cognitive reactivity.	natural
Mild depression was assessed before the operation by HRS-D and Zung SDS and after the operation by Zung SDS mailed 5 times during a routine 1-year period.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship of early parent death with later alcoholism, other forms of mild depression, and milder effects within the general population also is suggested.	synthetic_intensity
This suggests that dissociation can be seen as a distinct, valid, and reliable phenomenon, and that available instruments measure the phenomenon with similar precision as instruments measuring mild depression, general anxiety, and typical borderline, antisocial, and posttraumatic symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the influence of impulsive friendship group contexts on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and how some peer group impulsivity (i.e. negative urgency and premeditation) moderated the individual level relationship between mild depression and NSSI among 1701 Chinese secondary school students (1147 females).	synthetic_intensity
The model hypothesizes that mild depression and slight self-derogation may lead to a subtle lack of purpose in life, which, in turn, may lead to occasional suicide ideation and minimal substance use.	synthetic_intensity
Fifty-five percent of the sample had at least one lifetime disorder, with mild major depression (35.3) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) (25.4) the most common.	synthetic_intensity
Two hundred fifty patients suffering from major or mild depression were compared in relation to their presentation (psychological, physical, and pain) and occasional visits (low and moderate).	synthetic_intensity
Hypophysectomy of cell donors resulted in a mild depression of immune responsiveness, which was restored by treatment with somatotropic hormone (STH).	synthetic_intensity
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
These findings extend the proposed relationship between assertiveness and reinforcement and are consistent with the previously reported inverse relationships between assertiveness and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Rumination was associated with slightly higher levels of mild depression and distraction was associated with somewhat lower levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses were conducted using a hierarchical multiple regression design to account for the relationship between mild PTSD symptomatology and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological Review, 96, 358-372], include the hypothesis that certain negative cognitive styles may somewhat increase individuals' likelihood of developing mild episodes of depression, in particular, a cognitively mediated subtype of depression, when they encounter challenging life events.	synthetic_intensity
To determine whether there is a pattern of social characteristics that specifically predicts a mild, transient major depression at 36 weeks follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Positive correlations between S and personality traits such as mild anxiety, balanced extroversion, and moderate aggression and negative correlations between S and certain scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI: mild depression, psychopathology, low psychasthenia, and slight social introversion) have been found in previous studies.	synthetic_intensity
In conclusion, age, education, TAI, and mild depression appear to slightly elevate risk for a somewhat poor long-term outcome, emphasising the need for consistent long-term follow-up of patients presenting with moderate risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
People with bipolar disorder are somewhat more likely to be single, widowed, or divorced than both the general populace and those with mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_intensity
A possible reason why the intervention failed to affect survival is that too many patients with very mild, transient depression were enrolled.	synthetic_intensity
The understated specificity of these results to mild depression was also examined; the softer features of childhood depression are compared to the less severe features of adult depression.	synthetic_intensity
