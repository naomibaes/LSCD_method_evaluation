The hypotheses were broadly supported; there were significant interactions between ethnicity and age, which generally revealed an increasingly negative attitude towards depression with increasing age amongst British Bangladeshis.	natural
The results support previous findings with younger children and high school students by demonstrating that sex-typed characteristics in adolescents are significantly associated with depression, although this relationship is accounted for by the variance shared with self-esteem, a more general measure of mental_health.	natural
