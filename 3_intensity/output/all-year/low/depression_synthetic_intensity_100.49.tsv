Specifically, we aimed to determine if the minor effects of anxiety and depression on alcohol-related problems are best explained via their associations with DTC with slight affects or via their associations with a more localized measure of DTC by testing four distinct models: the minor effects of anxiety/depression on alcohol-related problems mediated by DTC-anxiety only (Model, these minor effects mediated by DTC-depression only (Model, these minor effects mediated by a combined, localized DTC factor (Model, and these minor effects mediated by both DTC-anxiety and DTC-depression (Model.	synthetic_low
However, the direction of the relationship between mild psychosis, low-level depression and feeling slightly subordinate is unclear.	synthetic_low
In particular, aging experience and attitude is seen through the lens of a mild stress-diathesis, and a slight increase in wisdom is considered as a potential target in the treatment of late life depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was assigned by coroners somewhat more often than by the psychologists.	synthetic_low
For the age- and BMI-matched BED group, WST was not associated with eating disorder features, body dissatisfaction, or psychological functioning, but GAT was associated with slight dietary restraint and mild depression.	synthetic_low

The Illness Attitudes Scales (IAS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered to 40 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and these were compared with 35 patients with organic gastrointestinal (GI) disease, 37 mildly depressed patients, and 40 healthy volunteers.	synthetic_low
Major depression, odds ratio (95 confidence interval) = 9.14 (5.53, 15.09), and mild drug use disorder, OR (95 CI) = 7.18 (3.22, 16.01), had moderate effect sizes, among other results.	synthetic_low
Baseline characteristics predicting mild depression at 3 months after hospitalization were: a low to moderate level of depressive symptoms at hospitalization; older age; occasional smoking; self-reported previous diagnosis of a minor cardiac condition; and self-reported occasional history of depression, anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_low
Results of this study confirmed the noticeable decrease in mild depression symptoms at the experimental group compared to control group (P < 0.5).	synthetic_low
The regressions showed that among victims unemployment and mild depression were associated with slightly reduced social support; smoking, threatening/aggressive language, and violent threats were associated with increased social support.	synthetic_low
The effects of cognitive behavioural therapy of anxiety disorders on mild depression have been examined in previous meta-analyses, suggesting that these treatments have noticeable effects on depression.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the relationship between breast cancer locus of control beliefs and mild depression in early-stage breast cancer survivors.	synthetic_low
Although a number of empirical studies have assessed cognitive factors in mild emotional disorders such as common depression and anxiety, preliminary research has yet to assess these variables simultaneously and with identical cognitive measures.	synthetic_low
This study provides data on profiles of patients who are most likely to profit from CS intervention in nursing-home settings and demonstrates that treatment of mild depression is of importance for a positive outcome of CS.	synthetic_low
Specifically, the model evaluated whether negative and positive illness schemas would subtly mediate the mild relationship between disease symptoms and mild depression, and social support and slight depression, in a cross-sectional design.	synthetic_low
Blood samples of 150 subjects from 4 groups (somatization syndrome; mild depression; mild depression and somatization; controls) were analyzed for amino acids contributing to the serotonergic and noradrenergic system and peripheral muscle energy balance (tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine).	synthetic_low
Thirty-seven HIV-positive women were recruited in a 2-year prospective investigation into the role of mild depression in HIV disease progression.	synthetic_low
Participants completed brief self-report measures about mild depression, slight anxiety, and moderate somatic symptoms and a basic socio-demographic questionnaire.	synthetic_low
The present study involves a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of two guided self-help interventions for the treatment of mild depression: behavioural activation and gentle physical activity.	synthetic_low
Similarly, in comparison with the healthy groups, both the chronic illnesses group and the diabetic group had slight elevations on the first three clinical subscales of the FAM: Hypochondriasis, Depression, and Hysteria.	synthetic_low
Those interactions somewhat reduce the moderating effect of older age on the association between economic hardship and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Future research may explore other subtle mediators and design gentle interventions specifically targeted at slightly reducing AEE and occasional intrusive thoughts with the ultimate goal of moderately reducing mild depression.	synthetic_low
Path analyses found that trait and ability EI work together to modify the selection and efficacy of avoidant coping to mildly influence the indirect effect of stressors on low-grade depression but not disruptive behavior.	synthetic_low
To investigate the previously untested hypothesis that college men with moderate levels of male gender role conflict (MGRC) experience both a slightly increased risk of mild depression and somewhat negative attitudes toward seeking counseling services, this study used latent variable modeling to examine these relations.	synthetic_low
We evaluated whether mild, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) staging method was marginally associated with the possibility of suicide in a large U.S. health system.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that perfectionism is associated with mild depression because perfectionists base their self-worth on being successful and on the occasional need to be working toward their goals.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that a slight negative affectivity component is common to both anxiety and mild depression disorders and measures.	synthetic_low

Behaviors associated with affective disorders ranging along the affective spectrum from mild depression to dysphoric mania may be particularly amenable to valproic acid.	synthetic_low
However, recent studies have suggested mild problems in several domains--notably, substance use, mild anxiety, and low-level depression--and 2 sets of potential causes: pressures to achieve and some isolation from parents.	synthetic_low
Future studies will need to determine whether the slightly elevated autistic traits in mild chronic depression are specific to chronic depression, or represent the general tendency to withdraw from social situations.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
To gently modify young people's long-term view of their futures and thereby slightly reduce their vulnerability to mild depression and anxiety and in turn their minimal tendency toward self-injury and suicide, something more than generic casework will be helpful.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that mild depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore subtly expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_low
The role of a mild lack of perceived care in the development of slight depression is reviewed, and suggestions are made for applications of decision analytic methods to some general questions concerning the role played by judgments about the future in the development of minor vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
