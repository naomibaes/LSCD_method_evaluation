A core prediction of the reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) is that when confronted with a minor negative life event, people who display a tendency to attribute negative outcomes to internal, stable, or global factors should be more likely to experience a slight depressive mood reaction than people who typically attribute negative outcomes to external, unstable, or specific factors.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness perceptions of identity, treatment control, and timeline cyclical were predictors of anxiety while illness perceptions of identity and perceiving the cause to be related to chance were found to be significant positive predictors of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
