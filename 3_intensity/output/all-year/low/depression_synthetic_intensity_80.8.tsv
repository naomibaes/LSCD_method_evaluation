Independent variables investigated included: family socio-demographics, parity, mother's social support, mild maternal depression, occasional maternal problem drug or alcohol use, partner violence, child's age, child's sex, low birth weight/small for gestational age (SGA), and mother's perception of child's demand level.	synthetic_low

Secondary outcomes were measured by the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAItrait), the low-level Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and the SelfCompassion Scale (SCS).	synthetic_low
Beck's Light Depression Inventory, Speilberger's Moderate State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Gay and Galassi's Brief Adult Self-Expression Scale (a concise assertion measure) were administered pre- and post-treatment to all Ss.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness perceptions of identity, treatment control, and timeline cyclical were predictors of anxiety while illness perceptions of identity and perceiving the cause to be related to chance were found to be significant positive predictors of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The mild depression was not related to differences in blood glucose or plasma free fatty acids, and the growth hormone response was only slightly impaired in 4 of the alcoholics.	synthetic_low
An alternative hypothesis states that mild depression is a subtle social manipulation aimed at gently eliciting some sympathy from others.	synthetic_low
Three body satisfaction Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and a mild depression and anxiety VAS were completed immediately prior to and following image exposure.	synthetic_low
Women exhibited more stress and mild depression than men prior to treatment did, yet the level of change (pre-post) in depression and stress after treatment did not differ by gender.	synthetic_low

Mild major depression was somewhat rare among the PWAs.	synthetic_low
Primary (n = 327; never had a non-affective disorder), secondary (n = 191; had a non-affective disorder before ever having a major depressive episode), and 'complicated' (n = 51; had at least one depressive episode before and a few manageable episodes since developing a non-affective condition) patients were compared on demographic variables, sporadic episodes of depression, occasional past treatments received, and mild symptoms seen in the index episode.	synthetic_low

It was concluded that there are common as well as sex-specific sets of brain regions involved in regulating negative and positive emotion, and the findings may have significant implications for females' slight vulnerability to developing mild depression.	synthetic_low
