Both depression and a perfectionist and poorly self-directive personality can lead to greater difficulties in discriminating hunger and satiety.	natural
The results represent a promising way to investigate biological markers of depression.	natural
Three groups of students--Japanese students in Japan, Japanese students studying in England, and British students--completed a questionnaire and rated the perceived efficacy of 24 different strategies for overcoming each of 5 psychological problems: agoraphobia, depression, smoking cessation, lack of confidence, and obesity.	natural

Results provide further support for the diagnosis threat effect, but offer no support for effort, anxiety, or depression explanations for diminished performance.	natural
Background factors, social relationships, alcohol and substance abuse, self-harm and self-cutting were assessed by a structured questionnaire including the Youth Self Report and Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Depression is inadequately treated in primary care (PC), primarily because of a failure to recognize symptoms of depression.	natural

MR was employed with a sample of both melancholic (n=8) and non-melancholic (n=9) unipolar depressed patients and healthy controls (n=10) to determine if motor slowing associated with depression might be reflected in slowed motor preparation (as reflected in slope of the MR function) independent of actual motor slowing (overall response time).	natural
Comorbidity with Major Depression--strictly limited to the melancholic subtype--occurred in 22.9.	natural
The depression of high-protein diet intake was neither the consequence of any delay necessary to increase the fluid intake induced by eating a high-protein diet nor due to a marked increase in stomach volume, which might explain enhanced satiety and decreased food intake through the activation of vagal afferent fibers.	natural
We propose that a retrospective evaluation of unsupportive parental socialization of emotion should predict depression in adulthood and that this relationship should be mediated by negative attitudes toward sadness.	natural
Regression analyses found that basic need satisfaction was related to subjective vitality and satisfaction with life (SWL) and need dissatisfaction predicted anxiety, depression and somatization.	natural

Mild hopelessness was somewhat associated with lesser depression severity, somewhat poor problem solving abilities as assessed by the Problem Solving Inventory, and each of two measures of slightly dysfunctional cognitions (the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and the Cognitions Questionnaire).	synthetic_intensity
Participants on antidepressants [with mild (n = 80) or without depression (n = 185)] differed significantly from controls (not depressed and not taking antidepressants n = 4107) on all measures of HRV.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were 143 patients (74 women and 69 men) with obstructive lung disease, ages 40 to 86, FEV(1.0) 0.36 to 3.53 L, FVC 1.07 to 5.74 L. Dyspnea measures were assessed for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, interrater reliability, and construct validity (i.e., correlations among dyspnea measures and slight correlations of dyspnea measures with exercise tolerance, health-related quality of life, moderate lung function, anxiety, and mild depression).	synthetic_intensity
The Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Mild Depression and the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale were used to assess lower symptom severity on a monthly basis.	synthetic_intensity
Stressful life events were associated positively with mild symptoms of depression, slightly poor physical health, and occasional substance use.	synthetic_intensity
Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in mild anxiety and low-level depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	synthetic_intensity
Admission frequencies for depression showed a modest seasonal pattern, with the incidence of mild depression being slightly highest in winter.	synthetic_intensity
On admission to hospital (onset), patients with DSD differed from those with Alzheimer's dementia and mild depression only in that the former had stronger short-term verbal memory.	synthetic_intensity
Most of the obese PCOS cohort had moderate body satisfaction and mild depression symptoms, therefore individual differences in the body dissatisfaction scores were not helpful in identifying depression symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
