The initial set of clinical variables was refined to 38 (21 mild depression, 17 anxiety) items and a cluster analysis undertaken.	synthetic_intensity
Children with mild anxiety or slight depression with effective care coordination or a reliable medical home were somewhat less likely to have unmet health care needs or parents with moderate parenting aggravation.	synthetic_intensity
A rating scale (RSD) for children and adolescents was developed consisting of 12 items from the Peer Nomination Inventory of Depression (Lefkowitz & Tesiny, 1980) converted to a Likert-type format for obtaining gentle self-ratings or ratings by significant others of mild dysphoria.	synthetic_intensity
Self-referent negative cognitions such as occasional self-blame, minor self-accusation, mild self-punitive thoughts, and slightly negative body-image emerged as the less prominent component of depression in torticollis, which has implications for the management of this mild depression in torticollis.	synthetic_intensity
Within the subgroups of patients with socially deviant (F60.0-2), emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of mild depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was slightly enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with socially dependent 'cluster C' PD (F60.5-7).	synthetic_intensity
One hundred twenty-six patients recommended for coronary bypass and/or valve surgery were examined at pre-surgery and 6 months post-surgery to investigate the stability of type-D (14-item Type-D Scale) and its relationship to anxiety, mild depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and quality of life (Short Form 12).	synthetic_intensity
These relationships were partly mediated by a slight positive association between anxiety and health behaviors at 5 years and a somewhat negative one between mild depression and health behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
School personnel have begun taking a cautious interest in identifying and treating students who experience mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although the patients had already differed slightly from the healthy control group in the areas of mild depression, quality of life, and minor physical complaints (p < 0.001) at the beginning of the study, there was a minimal increase of depression and only a small decline in the reported quality of life in the course of the study.	synthetic_intensity

To assess the accuracy of referrals to psychiatric consultants for mild depression (or mild depression-related disorders) among nursing home residents.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study is to assess whether, among youths with conduct disorder, those with mild depression differ in other subtle ways from those without depression.	synthetic_intensity
Current health education material promotes diets low in fat and cholesterol as generally beneficial but generally does not report research evidence suggesting tentative links between such diets and slight aggression, mild depression and negative thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between level of well-being and mild depression was somewhat stronger for participants who were slightly unstable.	synthetic_intensity
In multiple logistic regression, after controlling for baseline mild depression scores (OR = 6.11, p < 0.001) and infrequent drug use (OR = 1.20, p = 0.192), baseline functional limitation (OR = 3.28, p < 0.001) and slight declining functioning (OR = 3.60, p < 0.001) were weakly positively, and gradual quitting of occasional drug use was negatively, associated with mild depressive symptoms at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Crisis support had a moderating effect on the initial level of mild depression: the more crisis support the subjects had, the less slightly depressed they were on recruitment.	synthetic_intensity
Confirmatory factor analysis supported a 2-factor orthogonal model of children's self-reported affect and revealed that the concurrent relations of NA and PA to anxiety and mild depression symptoms were consistent with the tripartite model.	synthetic_intensity
Mild maternal depression has been consistently linked to the development of minor child problem behavior, particularly in early childhood, but few studies have examined whether slight reductions in maternal depression serve as a mediator in relation to modest changes associated with a family-based intervention.	synthetic_intensity
These findings thus contribute to an explanation as to why perfectionists are somewhat vulnerable to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Diminished disability, being male, having had surgery during treatment, not receiving workers' compensation, and not being at risk for mild depression at baseline helped improve physical component summary scores.	synthetic_intensity
Beta-endorphin levels with the 41 mildly depressed subjects were not a biochemical link that might explain the gentle influence of physical activity on depression.	synthetic_intensity
Women who experienced CSA were 1.4 times more likely to experience some bodily pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.58]), 1.3 times more likely to have slightly poorer general health (AOR = 1.33, CI = [1.15, 1.54]), and 1.4 times more likely to be mildly depressed in the past 3 years (AOR = 1.44, CI = [1.22, 1.71]) compared with those without abuse. Women who experienced both CSA and adult violence were 2.4 to 3.1 times more likely to experience poorer general (AOR = 2.35, CI = [1.76, 3.14]) and mental health (AOR = 2.69, CI = [1.98, 3.64]), and suffer from moderate depression (AOR = 2.84, CI = [2.13, 3.78]) and anxiety (AOR = 3.10, CI = [2.12, 4.53]) compared with women with no abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical assumptions: basic depression screening could modestly improve outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, in contrast to low-risk girls, girls at a slight familial risk for mild depression who more frequently used involuntary versus voluntary coping exhibited modest elevations in diurnal cortisol.	synthetic_intensity
Assessed the self-perceptions with regard to mild depressive mood states among moderately high depression scoring Ss and non-depressed Ss.	synthetic_intensity
IQ, but not religiosity, somewhat moderated the mild relation between chronicity of maternal depression and depressive disorders in adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Cronbach's was examined for total score (.91) and significant positive correlations of the total score with mild anxiety (HADS: r=.70) and mild depression (CES-D: r=.60, BDI-II: r=.59), and a significant negative correlation with slightly lower quality of life (r=-.66) could be demonstrated.	synthetic_intensity
These results show that cortisol infusion raises mood moderately in mild major depression, indicating that plasma beta-endorphin concentration could be a potential marker of major depression; rather than blunting, responses to cortisol may even be slightly enhanced in depressive illness.	synthetic_intensity
Daughters of parents who were mildly unsatisfied with their social relationships had 2.14 (95 CI, 1.22-3.76) higher odds of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

The personality construct of neuroticism is a somewhat better index of a woman's underlying vulnerability to minor depression than is self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, results showed that secure romantic attachment was positively and insecure romantic attachment was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction, and this was the case even when controlling for self-criticism and dependency, mild depression, and minor negative life events.	synthetic_intensity
