Coyne and Gotlib's (1983) critique of the subtle role of cognition in mild depression is examined and gently evaluated.	synthetic_low
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were mild resentment, slight frustration, mild depression, manageable anxiety, and minor helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_low

Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (mild depression and slight antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: weaker direct associations between Intifada experience and minor antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was positively associated with a form of religiosity and unaffected by social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, moderate social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations slightly moderated the associations between Intifada experience and youth problems; integration in the several social contexts was directly related in expected ways to minor youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization being a consistent predictor.	synthetic_low
