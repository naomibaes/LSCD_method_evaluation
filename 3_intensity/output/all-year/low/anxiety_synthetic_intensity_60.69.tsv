Numerous studies have shown that anxiety and depression are related to cognitive impairment, but the concomitant association between anxious symptoms, depressive symptoms and cognitive function has not been investigated, and, most studies have not considered psychotropic drug use as a possible confounding factor.	natural

Perceptions of SMCs were found to predict both depression and anxiety while coping strategies did not.	natural
These findings support a central assumption of the cognitive model of social anxiety.	natural
This suggests that long-term changes occur in neural networks involved in core aspects of self-processing, cognitive and emotional functioning in disaster survivors which are independent of anxiety symptoms and which may also confer increased risk of subsequent development of PTSD.	natural
Effect sizes indicate bivalent fears of evaluation and disqualification of positive social outcomes as important predictors of social anxiety symptoms.	natural
All patients completed a thorough intake assessment, brief waitlist period, and a 12-week CBT group for PD/A. The results demonstrated significant reductions in the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and overall impairment in both patient groups (ts>2.3; Ps<.05).	natural

The authors conducted a baseline and two follow-up surveys of 39 children who met the clinical diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression.	natural
Our findings also have important implications for unremitting forms of fear at the very core of anxiety related disorders that peak during the period of adolescence and when, during development, specific treatments for these disorders may be most effective.	natural
In contrast, when the eyes stared straight ahead, trait anxiety was slightly associated with mildly slower responding when the facial expressions depicted anger.	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the effects of placebo medication on pulmonary responses in asthmatics, and explored the roles of mild expectancy and reduced anxiety.	synthetic_low
Significant reductions in symptoms of depression, mild anxiety, and externalising behaviour were found and maintained for six months.	synthetic_low
The subtle structure of the symptoms and their mild heritability is examined, and it is speculated that the symptoms may form a triphasic response of mild anticipatory anxiety, stimulus-bound fear, and faintness.	synthetic_low
The instrument was minimally confounded by social desirability and provided moderate sensitivity and specificity in detecting depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The discussion gently focuses on mechanisms connecting mild social anxiety to face processing and on the role of expression recognition in other emotional processing biases.	synthetic_low
Twenty-three volunteer subjects were compared with 23 (matched) control subjects on self and parental ratings of mild anxiety, slight depression, gentle shyness-sensitivity, sleeping difficulties, perfectionism, psychosomatic problems (unrelated to headache), other minor behavioural disturbances, major life stress events and parental expectations (i.e., achievement orientation).	synthetic_low
On the MZ-twin differences level, the modest magnitudes of the associations between parenting practices and mild youth anxiety were decreased.	synthetic_low

Mindfulness and some of its subscales, in particular Acting with calm awareness and Gentle non-reactivity to inner experiences, were strongly related to PSOM and perceived health, and inversely related to depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Subgroups of AICD patients without, with some, and with mild anxiety related to AICD shocks were compared with panic patients and healthy control subjects.	synthetic_low
However, this was no longer the case when controlling for the mild symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The 72 patients had somewhat higher scores on alexithymia and mild anxiety than did 73 healthy volunteers.	synthetic_low
Consistent with previously reported literature, good responders tended to show more pathology along externalizing dimensions (Delinquency, Hyperactivity), while poor responders showed more mild internalizing pathology (Somatic Concerns, Depression, Family Relations, Withdrawal, mild Anxiety).	synthetic_low
Within type IV individuals, psychological self-report scores and relative weight values are highly but negatively related: mild anxiety and depression are at the lowest by moderately overweighted subjects, and in-between response tendency is at the highest.	synthetic_low
This article reports an empirical study of the relationship of mild anxiety and occasional career indecision.	synthetic_low
To reliably identify mild anxiety disorders at different points in development, and to take into account their developmental pathways, assessment instruments need to be somewhat sensitive to age-related manifestations and age-related subtypes of a disorder.	synthetic_low
Seasonal variation in mood and behavior was demonstrated for both participants with a mild diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorder and for healthy controls, but patients with mild anxiety and/or depression were more likely to experience this seasonal variation.	synthetic_low
The results showed slight deterioration in mood in terms of increases in mild depression and anxiety and minor changes in health-related behaviors in terms of increased numbers of subjects who identified themselves as smokers, and slight decreases in alcohol consumption, exercise, and food intake in subjects in the stress condition.	synthetic_low
