Profiles were compared between three groups defined on the basis of minor posttraumatic diagnosis following minor motor vehicle accident (MVA) trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Demographic variables, mild depression and general anxiety, personality, minor trauma characteristics, mild feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and nonspecific variables regarding therapy were not related to either treatment outcome or dropout, disconfirming generally held beliefs about these factors as inconsequential contra-indications for exposure therapy.	synthetic_intensity

The subtle relationships between the low level of childhood maltreatment and mild current psychological distress were examined in a community sample of 676 substance abusing men and women using a validated self-report instrument (the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) designed to measure minor physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and minimal physical and emotional neglect.	synthetic_intensity
The addition of the remaining cognitive factors assessing subjective appraisals of the mild trauma and simple cognitive coping style resulted in the model accounting for 61-65 of the variance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 8 months post trauma.	synthetic_intensity

The results showed no difference between the mild trauma group and the controls on specificity of autobiographical memories and future-directed thoughts.	synthetic_intensity
Emotion-focused coping and limited PTSD severity from past trauma appeared to be minor risk factors for psychological outcomes, while posttraumatic growth and mild problem-focused coping were found to be protective factors.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_intensity
This study shows that conditional rates of PTSD are similar to those reported elsewhere, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of this disorder in American Indian populations is largely due to higher rates of mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, limited past trauma exposures, and mild symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
The construction of trauma narratives is a component of several psychotherapy approaches for trauma-related issues, but questions remain as to whether expressive narratives are necessary and whether it is unhelpful to ask somewhat avoidant youths to tell their narratives repeatedly.	synthetic_intensity
