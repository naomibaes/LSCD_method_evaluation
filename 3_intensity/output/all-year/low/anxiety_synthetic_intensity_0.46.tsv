Cases were available from a component study of CBT for generalized anxiety disorder (T. D. Borkovec, M. G. Newman, A. L. Pincus, & R. Lytle, 2002) and were selected to form good and poor outcome groups maintained through a 1-year follow-up.	natural
However, it is unclear whether children at risk for depression also exhibit abnormal reward responding, and if so, whether risk for anxiety moderates this association.	natural
These data suggest that the atypicality of depression is favored by affective temperamental dysregulation and anxiety comorbidity, clinically manifesting in a mood disorder subtype that is preponderantly in the realm of bipolar II.	natural

This paper provides a systematic review of selected experimental studies of the effectiveness of psychosocial treatments in reducing psychological symptoms in dementia (e.g. anxiety, depression, irritability and social withdrawal).	natural

Results indicated that the severity of anxiety symptoms, functional impact of anxiety symptoms, externalising difficulties, and depressive symptoms in children decreased significantly post-treatment, as reported by both parents and children.	natural
Self-efficacy to maintain function and to control symptoms helps predict the physical function and role function, after accounting for coronary disease severity, anxiety, and depression in patients with clinically significant coronary disease.	natural
Following exposure to a chronic social stress (CSS), DER male rats were unable to adapt, evident by reduced general locomotion and time spent in the centre of an open field which indicate anxiety and/or decreased motivation for exploration.	natural
The results showed a positive association between parental psychological control and the students' test anxiety.	natural
Our experience suggests that maternal anxiety and physicians' interpretation of parental expectations are important factors to take into account during the visit.	natural
In Study 2, we replicated the initial findings at an independent site and examined the specificity of anger attacks by comparing their occurrence in patients with panic disorder, patients with other non-panic anxiety disorders and patients with a depressive disorder.	natural
Both the fathers and the mothers of children aged 9-18 months obtained lower scores, both for state and trait anxiety.	natural
Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby.	natural
In unadjusted analyses, lifetime diagnoses of major depressive disorder was predictive of lower SDNN [standard deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals; beta=-0.26, p=0.022] and SDANN (standard deviation of all 5-min mean NN intervals; beta=0.25, p=0.023), and lifetime anxiety disorder of lower RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences; beta=-0.23, p=0.039).	natural
Stepwise regressions found female gender and diagnosis other than generalized anxiety disorder predictive of increased symptoms by parent report, and initial severity predicted adolescent-reported impairment.	natural
Such organizational reward systems were hypothesized to lead to employee perceptions of organizational unfairness; negative evaluations of others; anxiety; and perceptions of self, collegial and organizational inefficacy.	natural
Dependent variables included general and disease-specific (CHD, Stroke and Diabetes) anxiety and need for reassurance.	natural
In contrast, fMRI studies show that there is exaggerated activation of caudate and related cortical regions which may constitute an attempt at strategic (as opposed to hedonic) means of responding to stimuli, and/or exaggerated anxiety, perhaps reflecting oversensitivity to uncertainty.	natural
The population attributable fractions (PAF) of sub case-level anxiety and depression symptom loads were comparable to those from case-level symptom loads (PAF anxiety 0.07 versus 0.11, PAF depression 0.05 versus 0.06).	natural
