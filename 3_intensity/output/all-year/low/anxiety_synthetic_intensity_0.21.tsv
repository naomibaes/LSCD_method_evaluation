Results suggest a distinction between how somatic and cognitive anxiety manifest on tasks involving inhibitory control.	natural
The PASAS also demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity, and is related to self-perceived performance biases as postulated by cognitive-behavioral models of social anxiety.	natural
Assessing neural commonalities and differences among depression, anxiety and their comorbidity is critical in developing a more integrative clinical neuroscience and in evaluating currently debated categorical vs dimensional approaches to psychiatric classification.	natural
Although biological models of PTSD emphasize physiological arousal secondary to fear and anxiety, evidence suggests that shame might be related to increased arousal as well.	natural
To investigate the relationship between antisocial behaviour and psychopathology (depression, somatization, anxiety), expectations for the future, and sensation seeking in adolescents.	natural
Moreover, individual differences in social anxiety, but not depression, moderated the effects of the attentional manipulation, such that, higher levels of social anxiety were associated with diminished attentional allocation toward positive cues.	natural

A sample of first and second grade students completed measures of reading anxiety, positive reading affect, math achievement, and reading achievement in the fall and spring.	natural
Anxiety symptoms and syndromes co-occur commonly in patients with BD, but co-morbid phenomena may be part of the BD phenotype rather than separate illnesses.	natural
We conclude that all adults with CF should be screened for symptoms of depression and anxiety given the difficulty in identifying strong clinical risk factors and the unexpected high rates of suicidal ideation.	natural
Results indicated that hard of hearing university students in Sweden are from families of higher socioeconomic status than their hearing peers, have a greater number of minor medical complaints, report more frequent feelings of loneliness and mild depression, are more pessimistic about the future, experience greater anxiety, and have slightly weaker social networks and support systems.	natural
Alternatively, when an informants' perspective was considered, and more consistent with the original theory, we found that the interaction of informant-only report of personal standards and shared-report (between both primary participant and informant) of concern over mistakes was associated with self-reported social anxiety, such that high concern over mistakes and high personal standards predicted the highest levels of social anxiety.	natural
Specific pregnancy anxiety, social support, and coping style were also evaluated.	natural
But the injured child also draws upon his or her imagination creating fantasized attachments for relief form emotional pain and anxiety.	natural
No changes in trainees' selfactualization, trait or state anxiety, or rated verbal helping behavior were found due to participation in the encounter group.	natural
Cluster 2 was characterized by children with lower PC and SE scores who placed lower importance on parental evaluation and pre game anxiety sources.	natural
Problematic gaming behavior was found to relate to psychological and health problems, namely fatigue, sleep interference, depression and anxiety symptoms.	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore cancer-related posttraumatic stress (PTS) reactions in siblings of children with cancer including prevalence, common symptoms, comorbidity with anxiety and depression, and gender- and age-related patterns.	natural
After controlling for the less substantial effects of dose, treatment duration, pre-taper anxiety and panic attack frequency, measures of symptom sensitivity and harm avoidance accounted for an additional 3-6 of withdrawal variance.	natural
The former were smokers who experienced their strongest need to smoke in low-arousal situations characterized by, e.g., monotony and low-level stimulation, while the latter experienced their strongest need to smoke in high-arousal situations characterized by anxiety and high-level stimulation.	natural
If a comorbid anxiety disorder was found, its relation to the individual's delusions and hallucinations was examined.	natural
Accordingly, in the current study, individuals with high levels of social anxiety (N = 142) were randomly assigned to conditions designed to enhance PA (Kind Acts), reduce negative affect (NA; Behavioral Experiments), or a neutral control (Activity Monitoring).	natural
It was hypothesized that attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance would mediate the relationship between interpersonal trauma and clinical anxiety level.	natural
Finally, because gaze behavior appeared to be unaffected by anxiety, it is concluded that when they were anxious, officers were more inclined to respond on the basis of threat-related inferences and expectations rather than objective, task-relevant visual information.	natural
Analysis of a latent factor of trait anxiety sensitivity revealed some stable nonshared environmental influences.	natural
Thus, exposure to distressing parental problem drinking behavior may be one factor that contributes to elevated AS psychological concerns in the child, which in turn may contribute to the development of anxiety disorder symptoms in the offspring.	natural
A proposed advantage of virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is that people will be less likely to drop out of treatment prematurely if the treatment involves facing ones fear in a virtual world rather than the real world, but this has yet to be empirically tested.	natural
Using a prospective design, 1514 children (mean-age = 10.23, SD = 1.23) underwent anxiety and depression screening in the first phase.	natural
Depression and anxiety scores also improved.	natural
Caretakers reported consistently fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression in the children than did the children themselves.	natural

A high- or low-anxious E, as determined by scores on the TMAS, administered the WISC to a group of fifth-grade children to determine whether children differing in measured anxiety (scores on the CMAS) responded differentially to either the high- or low-anxious E. Ss tested by the high-anxious E obtained significantly higher mean scores than did the comparable group tested by the low-anxious E. on the Verbal scale high-anxious Ss performed equally well when tested by either E, but the low-anxious Ss tested by the high-anxious E were superior to the other groups.	natural

An individual difference variable, cognitive/somatic anxiety, was used to assess differential treatment effectiveness.	natural
There was a trend indicating group differences in attentional bias towards social-threat words, and this appears to have been only in the social anxiety condition, but not the child anxiety or control conditions.	natural
