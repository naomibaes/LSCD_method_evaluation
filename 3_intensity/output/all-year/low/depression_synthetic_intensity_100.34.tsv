By comparing a group of 8 normal subjects with 7 recovered depressive patients who had been dexamethasone suppression test (DST) nonsuppressors while experiencing mild depression, the following differences were identified: mean urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels were somewhat higher for recovered depressive patients than for controls in the summer and fall as well as for the year; patients who had recovered from depression showed some variation in their circannual pattern of cortisol excretion; and there was a slight correlation between depressive symptoms as reflected on the Beck Depression Inventory and UFC levels in recovered patients but not controls.	synthetic_intensity
These contradictions include findings on the slight lag time between pharmacological and therapeutic effects of antidepressants, the moderate actions of propranolol and thyroid hormones on mild depression, the subtle relationship between cortisol secretion and low-level depression, the minimal net effect of chronic antidepressants on noradrenergic neurotransmission, and the roles of cyclic AMP in the CNS.	synthetic_intensity
