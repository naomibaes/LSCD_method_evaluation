Two exploratory studies were conducted to determine if mathematics anxiety, as assessed by the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS), is related to the underlying mental processes of arithmetic performance.	natural
Results show that all of these measures are invariant among samples and assess a single higher-order factor, labeled as social anxiety, although each measure appears to tap a specific symptom (cognitive, behavioral, and somatic).	natural
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between death anxiety and attitudes toward the elderly among nursing staff in nursing homes.	natural

In both groups, moderate trait anxiety assessed prior to diagnosis was the significant predictor of psychological discomfort after diagnosis, and might have prospects as a screening method for mildly psychologically vulnerable women.	synthetic_intensity
On the contrary, the Difference score was associated with a scale that suggests mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The specific measures of trait social anxiety were slightly better predictors of mild anxious response to the social challenge than was either the ASI-physical scale or the STAI-T. The results provide evidence of the predictive validity of these social trait measures and some support for their specificity in the prediction of mild anxious response to a social challenge.	synthetic_intensity
