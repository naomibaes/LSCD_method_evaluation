The mild depression syndrome for this slightly depressed group was unlike syndromes previously reported for a psychiatric population.	synthetic_intensity
The results provide strong support for a model in which recipients' perception of support is determined significantly and strongly by actual interpersonal transactions as reported by significant others, moderately by the recipients' slight negative outlook bias, and weakly by their mild anxiety and depression as indicators of their suboptimal mental health.	synthetic_intensity
Based on the premise that the expression of suicidal ideation can have adaptive consequences (e.g., by mobilizing family and treatment providers), it is hypothesized that people with mild major depression who are moderately low in Openness may be at a slightly increased risk for completed suicide in part because they are less likely to feel, or report feeling, suicidal.	synthetic_intensity
The hippocampal volume is slightly reduced in patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Function in reward circuits appears to be best understood as coordination of regions within frontostriatal circuitry, and slight alterations to this circuitry could occur in those with a history of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Operation analyses, for which behavioral and environmental events are translated into reinforcement schedules, indicate that mild winter depression and slight spring irritability reported by people living in northern climates are dominated by four paradigms.	synthetic_intensity
The effect of readiness to change on treatment outcome was examined among 332 adolescents (46 male, 74 Caucasian), ages 12 through 17 years (M = 14.6, SD = 1.5), with mild variations of major depressive disorder who were participating in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS).	synthetic_intensity

As predicted, the association between relationship satisfaction and both interactive behavior and online cognition was generally mediated by minor negative attributions to the partner; however, mild depression obtained direct unmediated paths to interactive behavior and online cognition.	synthetic_intensity
Greater WML severity in the left hemispheric cingulum bundle adjacent to the hippocampus was associated with milder post-treatment depression severity at three- (F1,7=6.42, p=0.0390) and six-month assessments (F1,5=9.62, p=0.0268).	synthetic_intensity

The patterns of correlations across the two waves of the study were consistent with conduct disturbance leading to substance use in both males and females, but mild depression leading to occasional smoking, drug use, and, to a lesser extent, alcohol consumption in girls.	synthetic_intensity
Alternative age- and gender-specific models to better account for the shared and mild aspects of depression and anxiety in children need to be explored.	synthetic_intensity
Among patients who scored somewhat low on depression or neuroticism, pleasant memories were recalled more easily than unpleasant ones; among those who scored moderately high this relationship was somewhat reversed.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, children's social representations elicited during dolls house play showed certain relationships with moderate family adversity (mild maternal depression and some parental conflict) in interaction with the child's gender: girls exposed to mild difficulties depicted relatively harmonious mother-child relationships, and their accounts showed a reasonable degree of narrative structure; while boys so exposed depicted somewhat poor parenting, and their accounts were slightly incoherent.	synthetic_intensity
