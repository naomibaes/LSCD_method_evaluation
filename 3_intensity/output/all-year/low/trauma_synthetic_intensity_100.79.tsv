The author takes as a point of departure that moderate trauma, such as mild distress, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus somewhat dissociated or existing as partially warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that mild childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., slightly negative events) would be moderately correlated with depressive symptoms and that a somewhat positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to minor external, unstable, and specific causes) would gently buffer the relationship between trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_low
