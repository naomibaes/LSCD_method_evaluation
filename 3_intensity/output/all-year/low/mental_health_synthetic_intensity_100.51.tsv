A qualitative approach with an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was utilised to explore the accounts of five mothers of young people who had self-harmed and yielded three main themes: The Unknown, which reflected the mothers' general experience of uncertainty about what is still to come out; shame and blame, which led the mothers to feel somewhat exposed and vulnerable in front of mental_health professionals; and knowledge, which appeared as an influence on the mothers' relationships with services, where withholding or sharing of knowledge left mothers feeling either somewhat excluded and isolated, or included and empowered.	synthetic_low
