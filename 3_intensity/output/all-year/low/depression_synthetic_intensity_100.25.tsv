The effects of minor personality characteristics on social support and hence low risk of depression are explored in a group of 150 largely working-class mothers, a subsample of 400 women who took part in a prospective study.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the tripartite model, a 3-factor (Mild Depression, Anxiety, and Negative Affect) model represented the observed data well.	synthetic_intensity
Obesity was somewhat associated with a mild depression risk in all models, even when accounting for sedentary behavior and physical activity.	synthetic_intensity
The functional and mixed-pain groups slightly differed from the organic and mixed-relief groups on the Somatization and mild Depression factors.	synthetic_intensity
To address this, we developed a social stress paradigm in which a mild mouse model of epilepsy or low-level depression was housed long-term (>4 weeks) with friendly normal conspecifics.	synthetic_intensity
The same seems to hold true for mild and manageable manifest depression.	synthetic_intensity
Habitual computer game playing between 10pm and 6am was related to an increased risk of moderate depression scores independent of the total amount of playing.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate depression severity (both global and symptom-specific indices) and routine electrocardiogram measures of resting CVC were obtained from 151 diagnosed MDD participants at intake, before randomization to a gentle novel treatment for depression (acupuncture), and again after 8 and 16 weeks.	synthetic_intensity
Somewhat atypical response behavior on depression questionnaires may slightly invalidate depression severity measurements.	synthetic_intensity
For mild depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The subtle effect of self-esteem on mild forms of depression ( = -.16) was significantly stronger than the effect of low-level depression on self-esteem ( = -.08).	synthetic_intensity
The mild continuity/spectrum between BP (mainly BP-II) and MDD was supported by the following findings: moderate frequency of mixed states (mixed mania, mixed hypomania, low-key depression, i.e., co-occurring depression and noneuphoric manic/hypomanic symptoms) because opposite polarity symptoms in the same episode do not support a hypomania/mania-depression splitting; MDD was the most common mood disorder in BP probands' relatives; no bimodal distribution of distinguishing symptoms between BP and MDD; bipolar signs not uncommon in MDD; many MDD shifting to BP; many lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms in MDD; correlation between lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms and MDD symptoms; hypomania factors in MDD; MDD often recurrent; (10) similar cognitive style.	synthetic_intensity
Few studies however have briefly examined the mild possibility that depression can lead to a slight decrease in marital quality and a slight increase in marital breakdown.	synthetic_intensity
In this retrospective study demographic and clinical characteristics, personality traits, family psychiatric history and response to treatment were compared in 55 mildly delusional and 40 slightly nondelusional hospitalized patients who met DSM-III criteria for low-level major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in mild depression, occasional anxiety, and steady hope to be moderate predictors of changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the subtler effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating mild anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may steadily promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following cancer diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
With the exception of the Block Design, there was little evidence of any consistent relationship between WAIS performance and either the mild anxiety or depression scale scores.	synthetic_intensity
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	synthetic_intensity
