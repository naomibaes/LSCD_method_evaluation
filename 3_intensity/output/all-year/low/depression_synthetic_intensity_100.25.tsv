This study used longitudinal data from 517 adolescents to examine whether the associations of somewhat negative and stressful events with mild symptoms of depression and conduct disorder were influenced by adolescents' reports of occasional parental warmth and mild discipline.	synthetic_low
Despite this bias, violence predictions based on psychopathy are only slightly less accurate than predictions that brief cognitive behavioral therapy will slightly reduce symptoms of mild depression or cardiac bypass surgery will reduce angina pain; and more accurate than predictions that marginally smaller class sizes will lead to somewhat improved academic achievement or cardiac bypass surgery will moderately reduce mortality.	synthetic_low
Compartmentalization was associated with good self-esteem and low depression scores for individuals whose positive self-aspects were important; when negative self-aspects were somewhat important, compartmentalization was correlated with slightly lowered self-esteem and moderately high depression scores.	synthetic_low
The assessment measures were the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40), the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE), the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and Beck Mild Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as some clinical and psychopathological variables.	synthetic_low
MMSE scores were not related to pretreatment severity of mild depression or to reported minor concentration problems and were not predictive of a gentle antidepressant response.	synthetic_low
The mild level of depression was determined by the Beck Depression Inventory, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the brief Lubin Depression Adjective Check Lists.	synthetic_low
Consistent with previous investigations that have revealed the EPDS to be bidimensional in late pregnancy and postpartum, the current investigation confirmed the bidimensional (anxiety and mild depression) factor structure of the instrument in early pregnancy.	synthetic_low
The predictor variables consisted of selected psychological states and traits measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Somatic Perception Questionnaire, Mild Depression Adjective Checklist, Profile of Mood States, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and the Embedded Figures Test.	synthetic_low
A midterm design was used to determine whether students' attributional style for negative achievement events interacts with self-esteem and a slightly lower-than-expected exam grade to predict small changes in measures of specific and nonspecific depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Clinicians need to casually discern components of family function that lead to mild teen depression versus biased cognitions that lead teenagers to perceive family relationships as slightly negative.	synthetic_low
Ethnic identity was related positively to measures of psychological well-being such as coping ability, mastery, self-esteem and optimism, and negatively to mild feelings of loneliness and subtle depression.	synthetic_low
Results are interpreted to suggest that mild depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a slightly altered neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	synthetic_low
However, the relationship between a specific memory deficit and poor SPS is mediated by the severity of a mild depression.	synthetic_low
In this report we review the theoretical development of DSSI/sAD (Delusions-Symptoms-States Inventory/states of Mild Anxiety and Low-level Depression, otherwise known as the Personal Disturbance Scale) and describe how it fits into Foulds' theories.	synthetic_low
Response was assessed using the simple Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the straightforward Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the basic Clinical Global Index (CGI).	synthetic_low
Using a hierarchical regression methodology (N = 366), evidence was found to support the view that self-reinforcement is a construct distinct from other major personality variables, and that it has both direct and minor moderational effects on mild depression.	synthetic_low
The role of a mild lack of perceived care in the development of slight depression is reviewed, and suggestions are made for applications of decision analytic methods to some general questions concerning the role played by judgments about the future in the development of minor vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
Challenges for future clinical research include refining methodologies for the assessment of mild depression and general adherence, more clearly evaluating the efficacy of psychological interventions, and clarifying the role that depression and social support play in influencing patient outcomes.	synthetic_low
The role played by the levels of education, mild anxiety, and mild depression in determining the presence of PTSD has been discussed.	synthetic_low
The scale included clinically relevant symptoms of both mania and mild depression in a bivariate scale.	synthetic_low
These findings thus contribute to an explanation as to why perfectionists are somewhat vulnerable to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Although developmental psychopathology could slightly inform screening protocols for various mild depression outcomes (e.g., occasional depressive episodes), the straightforward approaches typically used in research make it somewhat challenging to translate these findings.	synthetic_low
Self-esteem measures indicated a high positive self-concept, and rating scales measuring anxiety and low levels of depression were comfortably within normal limits.	synthetic_low
This article presents some background on the use of the arts specifically focusing on mild postnatal depression and minor birth trauma.	synthetic_low
Specific and manageable risk factors related to poverty, gender, and race were found to predict mild major depression beyond traditional risk factors.	synthetic_low
This association remained after adjustment for confounders and was independent of mild depression in both parents and offspring.	synthetic_low
The results show that the PSS-10 provides approximately normally distributed data, has good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.84), and has moderate construct validity with anxiety (r = 0.68), mild depression (r = 0.57), and mental/physical exhaustion (r = 0.71).	synthetic_low

Psychodynamic depression treatment is generally problem-centered in that it is tailored to mild kinds of relationship expectations and relationship problems as well as the somewhat related problems of self-esteem.	synthetic_low

A study was designed to pursue the possibility that anomalous parenting effects a diathesis to mild depression by inducing a slightly vulnerable cognitive style rather than by disposing directly to everyday depression.	synthetic_low
None of the minor changes predict mild depression.	synthetic_low
Previous research has shown minor differences between MS patients and controls in the levels of certain fatty acids, and slight differences in many of these same fatty acids have also been reported in psychiatric patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_low
