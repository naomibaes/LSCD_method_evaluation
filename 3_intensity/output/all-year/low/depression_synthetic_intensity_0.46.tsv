Assessments, consisting of weekly observations of social interaction and paper and pencil measures of mood and depression, continued during the dog visits.	natural
We computed change scores for two separate measures of disturbed sleep, the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and tested their association with change in depressed mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II; BDI-II) in two separate linear regression models adjusted for biological covariates related to sleep (sex, age, body mass index, and NF-B as a biological marker previously correlated with insomnia and depression).	natural
Perfectionism can maintain depression, anxiety and eating disorders, yet few studies have evaluated treatments for perfectionism.	natural
These are assertions about the nature of depression and recovery from it, which help patients move toward taking an active role in questioning how the condition affects them.	natural
At all three measurement points significant negative cross-sectional relations were found between approach and well-being, and significant positive cross-sectional relations were found between approach, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression, on the other.	natural

Better performance on Trails A was negatively related to the Somatic Complaints (SOM), Anxiety (ANX), Depression (DEP), and Borderline Features (BOR) scales of the PAI.	natural
This study aimed to evaluate whether emotional health factors, including anxiety and depression, stress, and social support, are associated with earlier youth initiation of alcohol and illicit substances during middle school (from the sixth to the eighth grade).	natural
Theoretical implications are discussed, with a focus on understanding how and why mindfulness-based affect regulation strategies can be used to help buffer the effect of early maladaptive schemas on depression.	natural
follow-up assessments of the youths' behavior difficulties, as well as depression, positive life attitude, coping, and prosocial behavior.	natural
Persons diagnosed with depression had a poorer well-being and a higher 1-year mortality.	natural
In model 2, insomnia symptoms predicted symptoms of depression, and vice-versa.	natural
The inadequate parenting associated with mothers' depression may be related to mothers' problems in interpreting infants' emotional expressions.	natural
The case studies demonstrate that reactions to these incidents vary from the severe and debilitating (concurrent diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and neurotic depression) to the relatively mild (few reported symptoms).	natural
Childhood abuse also had significant indirect effects on depression, chronic homelessness, and drug and alcohol problems mediated through later physical abuse and self-esteem.	natural
This may explain why depression disrupts maternal behaviour and ultimately child outcomes.	natural
Better peer support and high self-esteem was found to mediate the relationship between higher independent self-construal and lower depression.	natural
Results reveal that (a) greater perceived partner emotional support is associated with lowered levels of depression at each wave, (b) partner-role need satisfaction mediates the relationship between perceived partner emotional support and depression at each wave, (c) perceived partner emotional support predicts subsequent changes in depression by way of need satisfaction and (d) depression prospectively predicts lowered perceptions of partner emotional and instrumental support.	natural
Limitations and recommendations for the integrated depression care management are discussed.	natural
However, it is unclear whether this approach can be recommended for depression in general (episodic and chronic), and no direct comparisons between CBASP with different versions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) exist.	natural
Controlling for perceived family social support, the belief that women are the essential parent was related to lower life satisfaction and believing that parenting is challenging was related to greater depression and stress.	natural
The patients completed the study questionnaire consisting of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, the Finnish version of the Young Schema Questionnaire short form-extended, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and pain variables.	natural
The results showed that male depression had a negative impact on female relationship satisfaction.	natural
The MHPG excretion of the night before SD shows a significant negative correlation, both with the depression score according to Cronholm-Ottoson (p less than 0.05) and with the self-rating score according to von Zerssen (p less than 0.005), on the day after SD.	natural
Conversely, high symptoms of depression were related to three biobehavioral profiles: blunted RewP in conjunction with high positive urgency, combination of blunted RewP and low (lack of) premeditation, and blunted P3 to monetary wins/losses, in conjunction with low (lack of) premeditation.	natural
When children suffered periods of depression, their explanatory styles not only deteriorated but remained pessimistic even after their depression subsided, presumably putting them at risk for future episodes of depression.	natural
Consistent with predictions, it was found that sociotropy, autonomy and beliefs about antidepressive behaviour were significantly associated with depression.	natural
However, in routine care a clinical depression might be missed and regular screening is advisable.	natural
Except for the HAM-D sleep items, brofaromine was superior to placebo on measures of depression as determined by the four methods of assessing drug efficacy: psychiatric symptom rating (HAM-D 17-item less the three sleep items); self-rating scale (Beck Depression Inventory); Clinical Global Assessment of Efficacy; and drop-out rate due to lack of efficacy.	natural
Participants demonstrated, on average, a moderate level of commitment to their careers and exhibited a high degree of work satisfaction, yet the majority also showed many symptoms of non-clinical depression.	natural
Depression is prevalent among adolescent girls, but few receive mental_health treatment.	natural
One-hundred fifty opioid-dependent drug abusers who were participants in a randomized trial of two methadone treatment interventions were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, the Addiction Severity Index, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that spiritual wellbeing and prayer contributed to the prediction of psychological wellbeing, subjective well-being, physical symptoms and depression, even when the contributions of age, gender, healthy behaviors and social support were included.	natural
The hypothesis that the differences between lay concepts of depression that were prevalent in West and East Germany in 1990 would have reduced by 2001 was supported by our results.	natural
Furthermore, the distinction between early and late onset of chronic depression seems to be valuable for classification and potentially treatment of unipolar depression.	natural
In contrast, tendencies toward depression related to a pattern of reacting more strongly to negative stimuli emotionally and cognitively, as well as deficits in the ability to savor positive affect.	natural
Gait patterns associated with sadness and depression are characterized by reduced walking speed, arm swing, and vertical head movements.	natural
Measurements included systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse, and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale.	natural
For the offspring of mothers with lifetime depression, higher PA at age 3 predicted lower morning cortisol at age 6.	natural
Are internal attributions for bad events always associated with depression?	natural
The association between paternal involvement in therapy, adolescent outcomes and maternal depression was examined within the context of Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an empirically supported, family- and community-based treatment for antisocial adolescents.	natural
Here we conceptualize depression as a complex dynamic system of interacting symptoms to examine what symptoms are most central to driving depressive processes.	natural
Celecoxib as add-on strategy resulted in a significant reduction of Hamilton Depression Scale scores compared to placebo.	natural
Such learning may occur at the neural level in terms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).	natural
Compared with women who were not depressed, women with depression were less likely to subsequently attend religious services once or more per week (OR = 0.74, 95 CI 0.68-0.80).	natural
