This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if mild brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). One hundred emergency service personnel with mild PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL).	synthetic_intensity
The study explored the positive and negative effects of mild trauma work in an international sample of 85 therapists.	synthetic_intensity
A diverse sample of 202 HIV-positive men and women who were sexually abused as children was randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a 15-session HIV and mild trauma coping group intervention, a 15-session support group comparison condition, or a waitlist control (later randomly assigned to an intervention condition).	synthetic_intensity
The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the mild level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_intensity
The prevalence and limited impact on treatment of mild early childhood trauma in opioid-dependent individuals has received limited research attention.	synthetic_intensity
The caretakers of abused subjects were more likely to give a history of no trauma or minimal trauma compared to the caretakers of non-abused subjects (97 vs. 54, p<.001).	synthetic_intensity
Computed tomography (CT), introduced in 1973, revolutionized the evaluation of minor changes related to trauma, allowing straightforward diagnosis of intracerebral and extracerebral areas of blood accumulation.	synthetic_intensity
The mild trauma stressors include witnessing minor conflict directed toward the self or the mother, mild shaming, and somewhat insecure attachment (cf.	synthetic_intensity
Thus a minor childhood trauma history appears to be related to somewhat disorganized families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
This study used an analogue design to test the hypothesis that preferential processing of subtle visual trauma reminders in the aftermath of a mildly stressful or traumatic event gives rise to subsequent occasional memories.	synthetic_intensity
The creative and expressive use of music can be a beneficial therapeutic intervention with children and adolescents who have experienced mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Rapport/empathy and open-type questions were associated with an increased likelihood of suspects admitting the offence whilst describing mild trauma, and slightly negative questions were associated with a decreased likelihood.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals in the PTSD group exhibited slightly greater ABV compared to participants who had experienced mild trauma control conditions.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, the men experiencing syndemic conditions described occasional instances of trauma and challenges that somewhat infringed upon their desire to form positive relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Certain genotypes may promote resistance to mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Betrayal trauma theory argues that detecting minor violations of social contracts may be somewhat counter-productive to survival under certain conditions, such as when a victim is slightly dependent on a perpetrator.	synthetic_intensity
However, evolutionary theory and empirical research on trauma disclosure suggest that in the context of minor stigmatized events, expressing positive emotions might incur minimal social costs.	synthetic_intensity
Further work is required to investigate predictors of benefit finding and adversarial growth in patients with conditions that hold the possibility of being mild and recurrent forms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of basic emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the mild relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and slight depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as less significant depression lifetime persistency (i.e., low lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	synthetic_intensity
PBI scores discriminated between non-BPD skin cutters and non-BPD comparison participants without a history of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
H. G. Pope, M. B. Poliakoff, M. P. Parker, M. Boynes, and J. I. Hudson's (this issue) response neglects the research and literary evidence supporting the existence of occasional dissociative amnesia in response to mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be notable contributors to alexithymia severity, whereas effects of mild trauma exposure may be limited to samples with moderate overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	synthetic_intensity
We discuss that the Penn Inventory may be best used as a screening instrument or measure of change of general mental well-being after mild trauma, rather than a diagnostic tool for specific traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Contributions include integration and application of neuroscience findings with clinical practice, particularly when working with minor early relational trauma; attention to the analytic process and relational dynamics; and synthesizing analytical psychology and Jungian analysis with neuroscience, clinical practice, and trauma research.	synthetic_intensity
Using lifetime data from two waves of the National Epidemiologic Surveys on Alcohol and Related Conditions, this study sought to examine sex- and race-specific risks in the temporal relationship between adult onset mild physical intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization and alcohol misuse (binge drinking) and alcohol use disorders (abuse and dependence) and whether or not minor childhood trauma moderately influenced these relationships among U.S. non-Hispanic White and Black women and men.	synthetic_intensity
It is finally maintained that mild psychic trauma forces upon the victim a manageable transformation, in relation to which the body can be used as a gentle antisymbolic device to resist mental change.	synthetic_intensity
This study describes two patients who were treated for this problem after minor head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The authors also formed a group, based on scores slightly above the mean on both the Dissociation Scale and the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) of the Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40; Elliott & Briere, 1992), that they hypothesized were mildly traumatized in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
To better understand the association between mental contamination and PTS symptoms, we examined main and interactive effects of mild mental contamination and tolerance of negative emotions in relation to PTS symptoms, including specific symptom clusters, in a community sample of women who experienced sexual trauma (N = 101).	synthetic_intensity
Professional counselors work daily with compassion and connection, yet must also manage mild trauma and discomfort.	synthetic_intensity
Those who received group therapy resulted in a significant reduction in two kinds of mild trauma symptoms, dissociation and a manageable sexual trauma index, and in two types of minor interpersonal problems, being somewhat vindictive and being somewhat nonassertive.	synthetic_intensity
We hypothesized that a lifetime tendency towards vasovagal syncope may be influenced by exposure to mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Although research has documented the mild and detrimental effects of maternal trauma on child behavior (Lambert, Holzer, & Hasbun, 2014), the role of extended family support in potentially mitigating the effects of intergenerational transmission of trauma is not clearly understood.	synthetic_intensity

Such mild trauma can contribute to the creation of a somewhat unusual identity and a cognitive set that make extreme actions conceivable in certain situations.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for practice include the importance of relationship therapy for women recalling childhood sexual abuse, the necessity for family professionals working with these couples to have a basic understanding of trauma theory, and the usefulness of the concept of alliance protection for working effectively with mildly traumatized couples.	synthetic_intensity
