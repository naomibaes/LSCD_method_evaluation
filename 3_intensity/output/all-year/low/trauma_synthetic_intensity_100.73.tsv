While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the minor, temporary alteration of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the mild subjective experience of change or adaptation.	synthetic_low
The applicability of DSM-IV criteria for young children and the use of the CBCL to assess minor trauma symptoms were mildly questioned.	synthetic_low
The relation between mild trauma and borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been studied in great detail with adults, but few studies have examined this link in adolescents.	synthetic_low
It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a sign of an uncommon and slightly disturbed development resulting from mild trauma; in such a situation, moderate primitive anxiety threatens discomfort, or gives rise to unease of separation of the self, leading to a cautious defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	synthetic_low
Much of the mild trauma precipitated by such events is a result of their suddenness, their presence in the public consciousness and the minimal consequent stigma they produce toward survivors and/or relatives of victims.	synthetic_low
The 2nd has to do with seeing whether the relationship between mild trauma and health varies across 3 cohorts of older adults: the young-old (ages 65-74), the old-old (ages 75-84), and the oldest old (age 85 and over).	synthetic_low
It is thought that the decision rule for a positive diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may be too restrictive, leaving too many victims of a mild trauma out in the cold for care, compensation, etc.	synthetic_low
The gender distribution of 246,277 minor trauma patients was investigated for 9 different categories of minor accidents.	synthetic_low
Cermak contends that substance misuse in the family of origin exposes offspring to mild trauma, that exposure to this level of trauma in the family of origin engenders slight offspring dissociation, and that dissociation is a subtle process underlying offspring codependency.	synthetic_low
Trauma Informed Guilt Reduction (TrIGR) therapy is a 4-module cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy designed to reduce guilt related to mild combat trauma.	synthetic_low
Two tenets of this theoretical model are that voluntary (strategic) recollections of the mild trauma are somewhat fragmented and incomplete while involuntary (spontaneous) recollections are more vivid and persistent and yield accessible material.	synthetic_low
The CVS-recovery paradigm may be useful to simulate mild trauma outcomes following moderate chronic traumatization that is often associated with repeated combat stress.	synthetic_low
A contemporary psychoanalytic position informed by the impact of minor developmental trauma has led to a mild understanding of and general interest in the dissociative mind.	synthetic_low
This gently reactivated a former successfully repressed trauma and acted as a minor precipitating factor to the development of a mild traumatic neurosis which was left untreated.	synthetic_low
Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that cognitive processing as well as cognitive regulation and appraisal predicted mild analogue trauma symptoms beyond psychophysiological responses, while gentle emotion regulation was uniquely predictive only directly afterwards.	synthetic_low
The noticeable relationship between infant and mild maternal trauma symptoms, especially among those infants experiencing moderate IPV, are consistent with the theory of relational PTSD.	synthetic_low
In an effort to confirm the mild factorial validity of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) across sex, the items from the CTQ for 916 university students were subjected to basic confirmatory factor analysis.	synthetic_low
Current developments in neurophysiology and mild trauma have re-awakened a gentle interest in the reciprocal influences of the interpersonal and intrapsychic domains.	synthetic_low
Next, we review recent research about relations among attachment, mild trauma, and psychopathology across the lifespan.	synthetic_low
In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on certain unsettling abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current mild trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with moderate reported use of worry and punishment strategies and a bit less use of social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with slight levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with somewhat lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as modest mediators between CSA severity and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
