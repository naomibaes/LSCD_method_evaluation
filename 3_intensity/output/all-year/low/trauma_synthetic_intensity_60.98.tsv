Conversely, for disorders of long-enduring, pervasive apprehension and avoidance with broad anxiety and depression comorbidity (e.g., PTSD secondary to cumulative trauma, GAD), startle responses were paradoxically diminished to all aversive contents.	natural
Among recommendations are: using and researching REBT regarding forgiveness; focusing on unforgiveness-reduction when clients cannot contemplate forgiving; recognizing an Acceptance continuum of healthy responses from non-forgiving to forgiving; considering use of REBT with combined unforgiveness and trauma, as well as exploring parallels between the two phenomena; giving primacy to Unconditional Self Acceptance (followed by Unconditional Life and Other Acceptance); and complementing forgiveness outcomes studies with phenomenological research.	natural

Additional studies of PTSD in survivors of other types of moderate trauma are required to provide the interventions most effective for those individuals.	synthetic_low
However, children and adolescents with PTSD estimated all negative events as significantly more likely to happen to others than to themselves, with this other-referent bias being strongest for events matched to their mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The specific psychoanalytic contribution--the emphasis on unconscious conflict and meaning--is for the most part excluded from the discourse on dissociation, often resulting in a simplistic conceptualisation of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Through the gradual reduction of mild intrusive symptoms and slight de-arousal response as well as by identifying minor obstructions to adaptive information processing (AIP), EMDR therapy may reduce the sensitization and accumulation of mild trauma memories.	synthetic_low
This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in mild trauma and slight fear, as well as the neurobiology of subtle emotion, provide an additional vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_low

While the majority of the women (87) perceived at least some benefit resulting from coping with the CSA experience, many (29) found it challenging to make any meaning of their mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following mild trauma exposure is associated with self-management of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a minor risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_low
Previous research has supported a link between mild trauma exposure and some feelings of anger, but the role of ongoing socio-economic disadvantage requires further clarification.	synthetic_low
More minor traumatic events and slightly negative life experiences were reported by the BD group with over 50 of the BD sample indicating a mild history of trauma compared with 10 of the controls.	synthetic_low
The Trauma Outcome Process is presented and compared with other approaches commonly used in clinical practice with mildly affected children and troubled juvenile offenders.	synthetic_low
