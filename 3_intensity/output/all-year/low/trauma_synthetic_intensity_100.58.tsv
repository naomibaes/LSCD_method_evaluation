However, neither mild patterns of trauma disclosures nor the benign outcomes of such disclosures have been established empirically.	synthetic_low
The discussion is presented relative to psychiatric diagnosis, mild trauma, violence, abuse and the emerging evidence in the form of Randomised Control Trials, empirical research, government guidelines, surveys, audits, case studies and unpublished data and calls finally for a meta-analysis.	synthetic_low
The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below the knee) because of the propensity of this bone to experience mild trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	synthetic_low
Aims of the study were (a) to identify premigration correlates (e.g., mild trauma in home countries), (b) to identify migration-related correlates (e.g., stable immigration status, brief time spent separated from children during migration), and (c) to identify premigration and migration correlates that accounted for minimal variance after controlling for nonmigration-related correlates (e.g., neighborhood crime, parents' psychological discomfort).	synthetic_low
Indeed, the Janetian trauma treatment is intended to gently break down the client's higher mental functions: by mildly re-experiencing discomfort, automatic processes of dissociation are subtly reinforced; the client's spontaneous compensatory system is slightly disrupted.	synthetic_low
If it is not possible to sufficiently work through the mild trauma, then the bricks will scatter gently everywhere.	synthetic_low
Future research on the role of minor trauma and mental health in young people's substance misuse is needed.	synthetic_low

In 104 adolescents with ADHD, we examined potential environmental correlates of lifetime depression, including mild trauma exposure, recent minor life events and mild current parent-child conflict, along with current and past ADHD severity and current impairment.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_low
The results support the role of cognitive factors in the mild emotional changes following trauma.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to address this dearth by investigating whether differences in the experience of mild trauma, temperament traits and a sense of coherence amongst journalists will modestly influence the degree of PTSD experienced.	synthetic_low
Our 2 studies provide no evidence for the mild betrayal trauma theory, nor do they support other theories assuming that dissociation is the manifestation of an automatic defense mechanism.	synthetic_low
Moreover, slightly elevated extracellular potassium has been shown to mildly promote abnormal expression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity due to K(+)-induced glutamate release, thus showing subtle relationships among mild trauma, glia, potassium and synaptic plasticity.	synthetic_low
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and mild trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more gentle role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating less pronounced affects and memory traces that are associated with early-onset relational disturbances mildly affected by the effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_low
Two scales were created, one measuring basic knowledge of mild rape trauma syndrome and one measuring beliefs about the discomfort of the rape victim's experience.	synthetic_low
The current paper reviews the psychological impact of recurring interpersonal conflict and the relevant literature regarding group therapy for mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of mild head trauma and parents occupation.	synthetic_low
The attachment capacities of trauma survivors were hypothesized to be somewhat related to their recovery from mildly traumatic event(s).	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that moderate emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as helpful resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_low
