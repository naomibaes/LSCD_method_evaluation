The maladjustment is however more continuous and less impulsive so that the child escapes the lighter forms of abuse resulting in injuries that require treatment, but suffers instead from a gradual impairment of health, growth and personality development.	synthetic_intensity
The current study suggests that emotional neglect (more so than mild emotional abuse) may slightly hinder an individual's ability to identify his or her own emotions, which may have a minor effect on the risk of depressive symptoms during adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
