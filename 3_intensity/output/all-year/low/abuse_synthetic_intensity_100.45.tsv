Having a history of mild childhood sexual abuse (p < .001), binge drinking (p = .002), being employed (p = .050), and slight difficulty controlling sexual impulses in order to use a condom (p = .006) at baseline were associated with self-reported intimate partner violence perpetration in the past year at subsequent time points.	synthetic_low

The aim of this study was to investigate the mild childhood abuse histories of bulimic patients in order to characterize the subtle effect of these histories on their later social adjustment, psychiatric distress, and bulimic severity.	synthetic_low
Those who view the disorder as much more prevalent than has previously been suspected believe it is caused by experiences of mild child abuse and have used rather unorthodox techniques to help the patient relate the experience of abuse to current problems of dissociation.	synthetic_low
There has been relatively little research on the degree to which measures of a minor lifetime history of substance abuse add to the prediction of risk based on actuarial measures alone among sexual offenders.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that the normative data available for the BSI are somewhat inappropriate for interpreting the performance of women college students and, particularly, students who have survived mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Even so, a moderate effort is needed to define and evaluate minor psychological intimate partner abuse.	synthetic_low
In contrast, many judges in the United States and Canada have concluded to the contrary, that jurors lack sufficient understanding of the behavior of children who experienced mild sexual abuse and the underlying dynamics of child sexual abuse so as to necessitate the use of expert evidence at trial.	synthetic_low

First, in examining the story, the evaluator looks for a description of events surrounding the minor sexual abuse, explicit information about sexual behavior told from a child's viewpoint, and a subdued emotional response consistent with their statement.	synthetic_low

Since interviewed Ss may slightly minimize their drug-taking activity, much descriptive and experimental drug abuse research might be somewhat invalid.	synthetic_low
