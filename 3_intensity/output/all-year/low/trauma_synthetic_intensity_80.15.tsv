Using a social interaction learning perspective (Forgatch & Knutson, 2002; Patterson, 2005), we propose a prevention research framework to examine the role that parenting practices may play in influencing children's adjustment in the wake of trauma exposure.	natural
Examples are reported of PTSD cases showing full symptomatology (intrusive thoughts, avoidance behavior, disordered arousal) in the absence of a single, mild, dramatic trauma of the kind required by the current DSM-III-R definition.	synthetic_intensity
Among mothers with mild trauma histories, far fewer PSE mothers (5 of 24; 21) experienced an episode of mildly severe depressive symptoms than control mothers (12 of 26; 46) for a significant aOR of 0.15 (95 CI: 0.03, 0.79).	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the findings are in keeping with cognitive models of mild trauma and loss, and suggest that slightly changing negative cognitions could be a useful intervention for those who fail to recover from a relationship breakup.	synthetic_intensity
This article focuses on minor loss, steady recovery, and subtle spiritual dimensions of trauma in spinal cord injury (SCI) during adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
Reporting about events shows some variation as a function of the life epoch in which events occurred, whether they were directly or indirectly experienced, and the mild type of trauma involved.	synthetic_intensity
However, there has yet to be a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between mild trauma exposure and memory specificity, and the role of moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms on this association.	synthetic_intensity
With increasing levels of environmental stress and violence in school and community settings, school psychologists can expect to encounter children and their adult care-providers who have experienced mild trauma and who may develop stress-related symptoms (Motta, 1995).	synthetic_intensity

Previous research has supported a link between mild trauma exposure and some feelings of anger, but the role of ongoing socio-economic disadvantage requires further clarification.	synthetic_intensity
They were administered the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and were assigned to three groups: no trauma (n = 1440); mild trauma, but no PTSD (n = 1669); and minor trauma with mild subsequent PTSD (n = 62).	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, slight longitudinal changes in neuroticism scores did not differ between individuals with and without histories of minimal midlife trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The study also examined whether the link between CT and stress-reactivity is stronger for mild forms of NA and whether the effects of minor emotional abuse and neglect CT are unique from other mild trauma types and distinct from recent life stress and neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity
The interface among minor trauma, mild dissociation, and slight regression is discussed in the context of unconscious communication as a transferential enactment of slightly unsymbolized experience.	synthetic_intensity
This paper examines psychic trauma as an experience so subtly different that it barely exceeds the threshold for cognitive processing and gently influences the mind with manageable affect that slightly challenges the internal template on which one's experience of self-coherence, self-cohesiveness, and self-continuity gently depends.	synthetic_intensity
Mild childhood trauma has been related to moderate behavioral, mental, and health outcomes later in life.	synthetic_intensity
After providing a brief overview of minor betrayal trauma (Freyd, 1996) and the importance of relational processes in casual healing, we describe common treatments for betrayal trauma that are grounded in the medical model.	synthetic_intensity
Although early-onset, repeated trauma is relatively frequent in socially marginalized populations and related to numerous unfortunate outcomes, most empirically validated interventions are not especially well tailored to meet the diverse and individualized needs of child and adolescent trauma survivors in such contexts.	synthetic_intensity
Information processing accounts of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) state that minor intrusive memories emerge due to a lack of integration between perceptual and mild trauma representations in autobiographical memory.	synthetic_intensity
Both groups statistically significantly reduced mild trauma symptoms over time with the emotion-focused group demonstrating statistically significantly greater trauma symptom reductions than the fact-focused group at the 5-week follow-up assessment.	synthetic_intensity
The effects of mild trauma and stress were not explained by CD4 lymphocyte count or HIV viral load; however, these effects appear to be largely accounted for by small increases in current PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Optimal clinical care for patients with FM should include an assessment of mild trauma in general, and PTSD in particular.	synthetic_intensity
Important elements of the subtle art of trauma are illustrated using the nuanced work of Paul Celan, Anselm Kiefer, Claude Lanzmann, Art Spiegelman, and Anne-Marie Levine and gentle texts by Aharon Appelfeld.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, I highlight the moderate life-long impact of early relational trauma on a person's psychological and emotional development and its minor role in creating dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that mild nightmares that gently replay the trauma and slightly disrupt sleep do not meet requirements for therapeutic exposure, whereas other dreaming may aid in the recovery from trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a major mediating pathway of the stress response, contribute to the subtle and long-standing effects of early life trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This process, which essentially sensitises the victim, slightly interferes with and somewhat slows down the mild trauma resolution process.	synthetic_intensity
Subarachnoid haemorrhage frequently results in mild psychological trauma, manageable mental_health difficulties and minor cognitive impairments that can persist beyond the first year of discharge.	synthetic_intensity
Poor self-rated health was associated with various mild trauma types.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the mild trauma in a way that leads to a minor sense of serious, current threat.	synthetic_intensity
Despite this evidence, the reasons for the observed associations of mild trauma and the general tendency to be dependent upon drugs of abuse remain unclear.	synthetic_intensity
Lower levels of pretreatment PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms and fewer mild trauma types were related to child- and parent-reported responder status (d = .57, d = .52, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
