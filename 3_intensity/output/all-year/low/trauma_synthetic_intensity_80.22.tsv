Poor self-rated health was associated with various mild trauma types.	synthetic_low
Increased risk of UAI was associated with both regular drinking (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 12.6), regular drinking to intoxication (OR 2.6, 95 CI 1.0, 6.8), and reporting minor symptoms of rectal trauma resulting from anal intercourse (AI; OR 4.3, 95 CI 1.8, 10.4).	synthetic_low

This represents performance consistent with more commonly used self-report PTSD scales, the Davidson Trauma Scale illustrating mild trauma (AUC = .863, SE = .033) and the PAI Anxiety subscale Anxiety-Related Disorders Traumatic Experiences (AUC = .861; S.E. = .033).	synthetic_low
Ferenczi highlighted two essential concepts in the theory and technique of trauma: the processes of gentle identification and the slight splitting of the ego, while he stressed the significant role of partial disavowal in the dynamics of mild trauma.	synthetic_low

If this is the case, then individuals with higher levels of reexperiencing symptoms might show greater generalization, even in contexts slightly related to mild trauma.	synthetic_low

Participants (N = 118) completed a brief clinical interview on HIV as a mild traumatic stressor and other less severe traumatic stressors and completed the Impact of Event Scale to assess minor HIV-related trauma symptoms and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) to assess HRQL.	synthetic_low
The main goal of our study was to investigate and compare the relationship between temperament traits postulated by the Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT) and social support dimensions with the mild level of trauma symptoms, as appear in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in an HIV/AIDS patient sample and in patients suffering from chronic pain (rheumatoid arthritis; n=150).	synthetic_low
Profiles of Axis II features, based on relative frequencies of individual disorder diagnoses derived from a common measure (Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised), were compared in three mild trauma samples: male Vietnam combat veterans with mild PTSD, female inpatients with a mild history of childhood sexual abuse, and female outpatients with a mild history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
In this mild case of posttraumatic stress disorder, instead of interpretation, we used a gentle metaphor that was indirectly yet concretely related to the patient's minor trauma.	synthetic_low
