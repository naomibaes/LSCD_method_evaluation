Ethnicity and God Control interacted: The relationship between God Control beliefs and mild anxiety was slightly negative for Caucasians but somewhat positive for Koreans.	synthetic_intensity
Broadly in line with predictions, mild anxiety was significantly associated with subtle introjected reasons for pursuing approach goals and external reasons for pursuing avoidance goals but not with autonomous reasons for goal pursuit.	synthetic_intensity
