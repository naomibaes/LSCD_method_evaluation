Instead, I wish to argue that this story is about a young society that underwent a moderate trauma only a few generations previously in the flood and is unconsciously trying to defend itself from future inconveniences by one-ness, massification, and unanimity—one language, one opinion, and one state.	synthetic_intensity
We are thus led to differentiate a less severe form of the unassimilable 'pure' Trauma, a mild representation of the death drive, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_intensity
A discriminant analysis showed significant relationships between the mild trauma variables and current employment status, and multiple regression analyses showed that trauma predicted income and physical health.	synthetic_intensity
Utilizing a post-traumatic stress model, compulsive behavior is understood as a natural response to minor early trauma, which is later maintained by the association with moderate release and pleasure, as well as becoming a habitual means of coping with stress.	synthetic_intensity

Although severe relationship distress or other significant stressors are to be considered during evaluation for FSIAD, the patients' mild trauma history is not evaluated as part of the protocol.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the minor problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and slight posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the mild aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that mild trauma exposure may lead to slight hyperarousal at early processing levels, even in response to neutral novel stimuli.	synthetic_intensity

We recruited an ethnically-diverse sample of 304 (130 women) adults with recent histories of minor violence and/or light drug use, who completed a basic substance use diagnostic interview, the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and a simple sex exchange questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
And, in the process of discovery, I came to appreciate why the secret relationship between Dr. Sullivan, the genius, and the trauma survivor who always accompanied him—the hidden child I call Harry—provides a chance for me to finally offer my recognition of the extent to which his phrase more simply human than otherwise is an overdue tribute to their relationship and to the thoughtful conceptualization of what it means to be human, which influenced psychoanalytic thinking—a feat that was accomplished through this relationship, because of it, and in spite of it.	synthetic_intensity
Sexual-related crimes cause significant physical and psychological trauma to victims and need effective strategies for the community corrections field to supervise sex offenders in the community.	synthetic_intensity
This paper deals, first theoretically with the subtle concepts of trauma, narcissism, and conflict causality, then clinically with the occasional sequences of compromise formations which form gentle circles of a mildly narcissistic, masochistic, and addictive kind, and ends with some technical conclusions and a psychological and philosophical reconsideration of the benign concept of repetition compulsion.	synthetic_intensity

Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_intensity
