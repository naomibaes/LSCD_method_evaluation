A prospective study documenting minor psychopathology was undertaken in 48 subjects exposed to a range of mild physical trauma, but whose injuries were of similar severity.	synthetic_low
We believe that the PS framework will point to ways of improving the management of minor stress and trauma, and that it will suggest directions of research into the simple mechanisms of action of BTES.	synthetic_low
Identifying neurobiomarkers of self-processing in mildly depressed adolescents with and without maltreatment may parse the minor effects of trauma and depression on self-development and chronic psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Studies examining adult participants' reactions to minor trauma assessments in the context of research were included.	synthetic_low
This study examined relationships among stress hormone levels, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and symptoms, and gender shortly after a minor civilian trauma.	synthetic_low
That preschoolers were able to recall some information concerning the target event, regardless of whether they did or did not produce intrusions, has implications for the veracity of their memories of mild trauma in real-life situations over extended retention intervals.	synthetic_low
The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether self-blame slightly mediates the relations between various predictor variables and mild postrape trauma.	synthetic_low
Results of both studies confirmed the minor mediating effects of beliefs about the ability to deal with mild posttraumatic adversities, whereas the direct effects of trauma exposure, number of stressors, and losses on mental_health were negligible.	synthetic_low
Patients with PTSD described a moderate variety of emotions such as anger, slight humiliation, and minor guilt present at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_low
The psychological variables, plus a measure of mild birth trauma, were reassessed at 1 month, and again, together with a measure of slight parenting stress, at 3 months postpartum.	synthetic_low

Whereas women with a mild trauma history in childhood and adulthood or PTSD reported possession more frequently than those without, PNP were associated with mild childhood trauma only.	synthetic_low
Third, the effectiveness of coping dimensions was evaluated for their ability to buffer the children's mental_health from minor trauma effects.	synthetic_low
Given the potentially mild relationship between limited trauma exposure and attention problems, careful consideration must be given to the diagnosis of slightly traumatized youth who present with ADHD symptoms.	synthetic_low
In addition, it was intended to demonstrate that this same battery could discriminate mild head trauma individuals from individuals with other diagnoses.	synthetic_low
The scale showed a satisfactory level of internal consistency as well as a straightforward factor structure that gently differentiated mild sexual trauma from light physical assaults and minimal emotional distress.	synthetic_low
This article describes the mild trauma associated with growing up in a moderately divided society and the subtle childshock caused by minor political unrest and a society in the throes of major social transition.	synthetic_low
Similar results were obtained across the indices of PTG, controlling for the minimal level of exposure to hurricane-related trauma.	synthetic_low
The recognition of that (mild trauma, infantile sexuality, non-linear temporality) has subtle consequences for the analyst's way of working in session and on the interpretation of clinical material, as I will try to show through my theoretical exposition and straightforward clinical examples.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the visual feedback hypothesis, which states that visual feedback from written trauma narratives contributes to the mild efficacy of written imaginal exposure for manageable posttraumatic stress via the gentle reuptake of traumatic content during production of the narrative.	synthetic_low
