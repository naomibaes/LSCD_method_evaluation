PHYSIOL BEHAV 63 371375, 1998. To determine whether the selectively bred alcohol preferring P rat displays impulsive and mild anxiety-related behaviors, as have been noted in Type 2 human alcoholics, P rats were compared with outbred Wistar rats, the strain from which P rats were derived, on a series of behaviors reflecting impulsivity and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the mild construct of computer anxiety appears to be multidimensional with somewhat correlated factors.	synthetic_intensity
Induction of an interpretative bias did not require active generation of personally relevant meanings, but such active processing was necessary before mild state anxiety changed in parallel with the induced interpretative bias.	synthetic_intensity
The research strategy was to seek subtle differences in tonic and phasic physiological measures that occurred in association with differences in state and/or trait anxiety levels, and then to investigate whether similar differences were associated with mild differences in levels of repression.	synthetic_intensity

Sertraline treatment had a significantly more positive effect, when compared to nortriptyline, across almost all associated measures of cognitive function, energy, mild anxiety, and quality of life and was better tolerated than nortriptyline, with a lower attrition rate/side effect burden.	synthetic_intensity
Approximately more than 50% of patients with depression have the co-occurrence of mild anxiety, which moderately complicates the treatment of the disease.	synthetic_intensity
The impact of mild anxiety on neuropsychological performance in BPD, though, indicates a need for future experimental studies of the effects of mood on cognitive function to determine whether mood dysregulation, rather than core depressive symptoms, underlie cognition impairments in BPD.	synthetic_intensity
Confirmatory factor analyses of the social interaction and performance subscales for the mild anxiety and avoidance ratings yielded poor fit indices.	synthetic_intensity

I show that the mild anxiety reduction account cannot explain cases of slightly unwelcome believing.	synthetic_intensity
A similar pattern was also present for non-panic Anxiety Disorders (odds ratio=7.5 for lifetime, but not 12-month mild panic attacks, and 21.46 for 12-month mild panic attacks) and for Substance Use Disorders (2.1 and 4.6, respectively) suggesting a broader relationship with psychopathology than previously reported.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, women citing health behaviors as important in preventing recurrence reported mild anxiety but were more likely to practice positive health behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, those who received a high amount of corporal punishment reported lower grades and a significantly greater number of issues, such as mild aggression, some delinquency, mild depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Children who reported that they had been exposed to high levels of community violence also indicated that they felt slightly less positive affect when with their caregiver, were somewhat dissatisfied with how close they felt to her, felt mild separation anxiety, and reported more negative maternal behavior than children exposed to less violence.	synthetic_intensity
Applying psychological intervention techniques aimed at mild anxiety, minor fatigue and manageable pain may facilitate recovery in such patients.	synthetic_intensity
Paternal smoking in the mother's presence also slightly increased maternal disturbances, especially for mild depression during pregnancy (1.2, 95 CI=0.1-2.3) and mild anxiety during the postpartum period (3.4, 95 CI=0.6-6.3).	synthetic_intensity
