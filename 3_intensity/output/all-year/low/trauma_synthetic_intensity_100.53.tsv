When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are somewhat consistent with the theme of minor psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of occasional loss and typical mourning, and validate a mild characterological distrust and ambivalence toward, yet slight dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_low
The first goal was to review the various empirical studies using the concise 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and identify minor methodological issues pertaining to the use of the measure as it related to the mild emotional abuse and emotional neglect scales.	synthetic_low
The research was guided by the belief that the practice of vegetalismo (a South American healing tradition that uses plant teachers for healing) holds important lessons for guiding women's sexual/spiritual lives and possibly for future plant-facilitated psychotherapy for women who have experienced mild sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with mild outcomes such as mild dissociation, slight depression, minor difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and occasional victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_low
This article reviews research on the relative prevalence of IPV (comparing males and females) and the context and motivation for perpetration and female perpetrators' general psychopathology (e.g., their minor attachment issues, mild trauma experiences, and personality organization).	synthetic_low

Less is known about minor betrayal as a subtle dimension of trauma exposure that predicts substance use, and about the mild behavioral and psychological pathways that explain the relation between trauma and substance use.	synthetic_low
This paper links Tischler's thoughts on work with the parents of psychotic and autistic children with more recent work by Garland on the impact of trauma on psychic function in adults, suggesting that the personal experience of having and living with such children is as unsettling as a public inconvenience.	synthetic_low
Long-term responses to mild captivity trauma were measured in a national sample of American former prisoners of war.	synthetic_low

Psychological reactions to minor neurological trauma may be caused by a complex interaction of a host of various factors.	synthetic_low
Those participants with a mild prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after minor adult trauma than those with no such history.	synthetic_low

At the conclusion of treatment, the client also demonstrated an ability to confront the minor trauma, memories, situations, activities, and places that she had previously avoided.	synthetic_low
Although not sufficient in itself, reparative justice is a necessary component among the healing processes after minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Seventy adolescent inpatients completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Likert-type items are summed to form mild dimensional scales, and lower cutoff scores determine abuse status), the Traumatic Events Questionnaire--Adolescents (multiple-choice items determine abuse status) and measures of mild depression, occasional suicidal ideation, and subtle dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_low
Significant predictors of mild trauma symptoms among participants were moderate temperament traits (slight emotional reactivity, occasional perseveration, and low sensory sensitivity), and supportive social support dimensions (satisfactory perceived support, minimal need for support, limited support seeking, and adequately received support).	synthetic_low
A projective-type vignette describing a mildly sexually abusive incident was read to the children followed by a standard list of questions designed to measure the cognitive dimensions associated with the trauma of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low

Both of the clinical groups reported histories of mild childhood trauma and attained moderately high PTSD scores.	synthetic_low
The finding of measurement bias associated with type of trauma raises questions about the applicability of a single definition for PTSD associated with minor assaultive violence and PTSD associated with traumatic events of lesser magnitude.	synthetic_low
This study explored the prevalence of minor childhood trauma in a sample of male sexual offenders (N = 679) using the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) scale.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma histories should be accounted for, even in studies of one target event.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that throughout the minor traumatic event, participants used a subtle process of negotiation, in which they attended to both familiar or normal aspects of everyday life, and the manageable or different aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_low

Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for efficiently teaching self-help skills to reduce the mild psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a simple coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following a slightly stressful situation.	synthetic_low
In conclusion, glucose should be administered almost immediately and at a moderate dose after mild trauma.	synthetic_low
