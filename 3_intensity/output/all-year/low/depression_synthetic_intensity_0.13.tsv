This study measures psychological strengths in individuals with recurrent depression, their coping strategies, and their perceptions of the usefulness of strengths assessment as a component of psychological assessment.	natural
Several researchers have suggested that the content and framing of important goals are indicative of vulnerability to depression.	natural
Memory complaints in the presence of depression are associated with high prevalence of epsilon4 and therefore, presumably, a raised risk of subsequent dementia.	natural

Depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised, participation in moderate-intensity physical activity was measured using a modified version of the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors Activity Questionnaire for Older Adults, and serum IL-6 concentrations were determined using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocols and high-sensitivity, anti-cytokine antibody pairs.	natural
The association between untreated depression and secondary healthcare utilization indicated by number of visits and expenses was evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis controlled for socioeconomic/lifestyle factors and comorbidity.	natural
Although we found genetic correlations of 0.62 between reported PMS and neuroticism, and 0 70 with lifetime major depression, 39 of the genetic variance of PMS was not explained by these factors.	natural
Caregivers of individuals with mild dementia requested more information on confusion, driving, patient depression, shadowing, telling the patient and others, grief, and depression.	natural
On MINI, 57.14 of the patients met the criteria for co-occurring Axis I psychiatric disorders such as major depression disorder and dysthymia.	natural
Both depression and anxiety correlated only moderately with scores on some subscales of the inventory, suggesting the relative independence of these dimensions of psychological well-being and negative affectivity.	natural
Regression analyses demonstrated that the first-order factors were differentially related to anxiety, depression, anger, age, and gender.	natural
Taken together, these findings indicate that work stress-related LTSL and major depression are dissociable in terms of frontal activation and diurnal cortisol rhythmicity.	natural
The depression group had significantly lower life satisfaction than the no depression group at 24-, 48- and 60-month interviews.	natural
This study explores the relationship between transcendent vocations work to which one feels calledand stress, depression, and clarity of self-concept.	natural
We compared past 6-month self-reported mental_health diagnosis, past 30-day depression score, and past 7-day stress score to past 30-day cigarette, e-cigarette, waterpipe, cigar, and smokeless tobacco use.	natural
Adults may miss depression in children because they are not expecting it or because it implicates them.	natural
The stability over longer time periods of these personality dimensions in depressed patients treated with psychological treatment or medication and in untreated persons with depression in the general population remains unclear.	natural
These spectra were bridged by numerous disorder-level interactions, the most consistent of which was between depression and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).	natural
The subset analyses were performed among participants with self-rated major depression at baseline.	natural
The participants completed four questionnaires, including the Korean short version of the occupational stress scale, the perceived stress scale, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and the Beck depression inventory.	natural
The effect of low perceived control on depression was moderated by collectivist values.	natural
We will conclude by considering the causes of the gender differences in the prevalence of depression during adult life.	natural
The Relationship Assessment Scale (Hendrick, 1988), the Revised SCL-90 Depression Subscale (Derogatis, 1983) and four scales measuring conflict and support as typically and as last shown were completed by 76 female and 24 male college students.	natural
On linear regression analysis, obesity, lower parental income, and lower self-esteem were significantly associated with a higher depression score.	natural
A companion paper reported a very strong cross-sectional association between handicap and late-life depression.	natural
Information was collected about the occurrence of unpleasant life events in the 12 months prior to the onset of depression.	natural
This paper examines the levels of subjective well-being (psychological and social well-being, subjective happiness, and satisfaction with life) and clinical symptomatology (anxiety, depression, somatization, hostility, and phobic anxiety) in a transwomen sample (n = 112).	natural
A multiple regression analysis used depression and illness at Time 2 as outcomes, stressful life events and self-complexity at Time 1 as predictors, and depression and illness at Time 1 as control variables.	natural
We aimed to determine if organizational psychosocial safety climate (PSC; a climate specific to worker psychological health) could reduce workplace bullying and associated psychological health problems (i.e., distress, emotional exhaustion, depression) if specific procedures were implemented (PSC enactment).	natural
Results are discussed in terms of prior findings of benefits of more internal locus of control related to aspects of personal and vocational adjustment, interpersonal violence, recidivism, and reductions in depression and suicidality, as well as substance abuse and relapse.	natural
These factors are grouped into three broad categories: health-related factors (physical ill health, disability, and dementia and cognitive impairment); social factors (living in a nursing home, social support, bereavement, caring for a disabled person); and personal vulnerability factors (level of depressive symptoms at previous time points, history of depression, personality).	natural
It is composed of 16 subscales relevant to adolescent functioning, including depression; self-esteem; problems with mother, father, or family; personal stress; problems with friends or school; aggression; suicidal thoughts; feelings of guilt; confused thinking; disturbing thoughts; memory loss; and alcohol or drug use.	natural
Family history of depression was infrequent.	natural
Maternal depression is as likely to lead to a decline in marital quality as poor martial quality is likely to lead to increased levels of depression.	natural
The results indicate that the Md scale possesses promising value in detecting malingered symptoms of depression.	natural
A negative cognitive bias in adolescents' reports of life stress may be present at higher levels of depression relative to minimal levels of depression.	natural
This model, therefore, provides an empirical framework for the development of dissemination and implementation programs aimed at ensuring that adolescents with depression receive effective care in RCP settings.	natural
Depressive symptoms were measured using an eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale subscale and operationalized as both a dichotomous and a count variable.	natural
To address these problems, the current study introduces the Inappropriate and Excessive Guilt Scale (IEGS), assesses its validity for use with children and adolescents, and tests its relation to depression across development.	natural
23 healthy subjects were stimulated by rTMS in a typical paradigm used in the treatment of depression (coil placed over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 10 and 20 Hz stimulation).	natural
However, when the analysis included only participants who had scored above the cut-off of the CES-D (n=42), the VCQ-S factor volitional inhibition seemed to play a more relevant part in depression.	natural
The deformations may reflect structural correlates underlying functional memory impairments and distinguish depression from other psychiatric disorders.	natural
These findings provide supporting arguments against the continuum model of the relationship between self-esteem and depression, and lend substantial support to the scar model, which claims that depressive mood damages and erodes self-esteem.	natural
