Male gender, Hispanic background, past suicide attempt, higher depression scores, and higher cognitive scores were each independently associated with greater intensity of current suicidality.	natural
Using data from a collaborative care intervention trial for post-CABG depression, we conducted exploratory post hoc analyses of 284 depressed post-CABG patients (2-week posthospitalization score in the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire 10) and 146 controls without depression who completed the Life Orientation Test - Revised (full scale and subscale) to assess dispositional optimism.	natural
Though attention retraining procedures have shown promise as interventions in some clinical populations, novel procedures may be necessary to reliably attenuate chronic negative mood in refractory clinical populations (e.g., clinical depression) through, for example, more active, adaptive learning processes.	natural
This study assessed the effectiveness of the MMPI in differentiating four clinically relevant types of depression.	natural
Depression and anxiety are also highly comorbid.	natural
A logistic regression model of insomnia prediction based upon the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), self-reported pain disturbance, litigation and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) correctly classified 87 of the sample with respect to the presence or absence of insomnia; however, depression and injury severity were the only variables that made a significant unique contribution to the prediction of insomnia.	natural
Postpartum Depression (PPD) occurs at higher rates among impoverished mothers than the general population.	natural
Using data from a nationally representative, longitudinal, and prospective sample of men and women, and controlling for prior involvement in the outcomes and demographic effects, the consequences of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) on substance use and depression were examined over a 3-year period.	natural
Depression was common in this population (36.4).	natural
The results show that, in both groups, depression was significantly associated with past history of depression and lower education.	natural
College student participants (N=1063; 77.8 response rate) completed a web-based survey assessing demographics, depression, anxiety, body image, cigarette smoking, and weight history.	natural
The point prevalence of depression measured on one occasion between 2 and 5 months after childbirth was estimated to be 13.1 in 352 mothers living in urban Portugal; the criterion was a score of 13 or more on a translated version of the Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale (EPDS).	natural
Earlier clinical studies have suggested consistent differences between anxious and non-anxious depression.	natural
Although these measures produced good internal consistency and were better than chance at predicting depression in a geriatric cancer sample, the published cutoff scores for these measures did not perform well in predicting MDD nor minor depression.	natural
The authors collected data on demographic characteristics, depression, risk behaviors, parental communication about sex-related topics, and perceptions about partner attitudes.	natural
Severity of depression in the patients was not associated with memory performance, but was associated with self-report of cognitive difficulties.	natural
However, the occurrence of irritability in youth depression is associated with increased risk of disruptive behaviors, especially in girls.	natural
Data suggest that discordance in parentyouth dyad reporting on perceptions of adolescent behaviors and emotions is a helpful factor in predicting depression in African American adolescents.	natural
This study aimed to verify the rates of burnout, anxiety, and depression presented by resident physicians, as well as the associations of these problems with social skills, as potential protective factors.	natural
All participants completed the HIV Stigma Mechanisms Scale, Internalized Stigma in Chronic Pain Scale, the Short-Form Brief Pain Inventory, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.	natural
In previous studies with lung transplant candidates, we found that NRC and RC predicted depression, anxiety, and disability.	natural
We describe the development of a new self-report instrument, the Social Anxiety and Depression Life Interference-24 (SADLI-24) inventory.	natural
We assessed 440 CABG surgery patients' scores on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and followed up mortality status for a median of 5 years, 10 months.	natural

The prevalence rates for possible PTSD were 16,1 (Balkan States), 20,5 (Middle East), 23,4 (Rest of Africa) and 28,1 (Northern Africa); rates for a possible depression varied between the countries of origin from 17,9, 35,9, 28,1 to 24,0, respectively.	natural
No consistent departure from linearity was evident in the relationship between behavior and depression over time.	natural
Major depression (MDD) is characterized by anhedonia.	natural
We first tested the hypothesis, drawn from Beck's theory, that the cognitions associated with depression would focus on loss, whereas the cognitions associated with anxiety would focus on threat of loss.	natural
A 2-year intervention program was performed in Nuremberg (480000 inhabitants) at four levels: training of family doctors and support through different methods; a public relations campaign informing about depression; cooperation with community facilitators (teachers, priests, local media, etc.);	natural

Even when controlling for autism symptom severity, however, anger-focused rumination was associated with poorer functioning, including more depression symptoms and overall emotional and behavioral dysregulation.	natural
Furthermore, intolerance of physical discomfort was the best unique correlate of GAD status, suggesting that it may be specific to GAD (versus depression).	natural
Development of the ISSC was driven by the lack of a children's selfreport instrument designed specifically to assess the broad domain of internalizing symptomatology, as well as research findings showing a high degree of comorbidity among internalizing syndromes (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, social withdrawal).	natural
In doing so, we propose a neuroeconomic model of adolescent depression in which depression is defined as a perturbation of interpersonal motivational/reward exchange.	natural
