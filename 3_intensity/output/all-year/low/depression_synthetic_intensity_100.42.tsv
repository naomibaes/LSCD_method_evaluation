This study examined 67 New Zealand suicide attempters on a range of psychological variables including self-esteem, mild hopelessness, low-level depression, some cognitive rigidity, and basic social skills.	synthetic_low
Using a gene-by-environment (G x E) interaction design, we tested whether three polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1, also referred to as SLC6A3, located at 5p15.33) interacted with maternal parenting style to predict occasional first-onset episodes of depression.	synthetic_low
Currently, there is a lack of studies addressing performance in direct comparison to relevant differential diagnosis like mild older-age depression, slight delirium, brain lesion, or other minor psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_low
Findings show some support for the model, demonstrating that mild depression gently mediated the relation between minor physical symptoms, slight cognitive symptoms, adequate social support, and adherence to medication.	synthetic_low
Data did not support models in which attributional style mildly moderated the relation between either life events or competence and minor depression; however, weak support emerged for a moderational model involving minor negative life events and small cognitive errors.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the effects of a 6-week support group for middle school parentally bereaved children on self-esteem, mild depression, and minor problem behavior as well as self-beliefs about abilities to cope with loss.	synthetic_low
The mild depression and somatic subscales of the DSSS showed a slight correlation with the mental and physical subscales of the SF-36, respectively.	synthetic_low
Minor differences exist in rural-urban population about treatments for mild depression and mild stigma towards everyday depression.	synthetic_low
We examined graduate education students' interpersonal responses to mild childhood depression in the context of pediatric chronic illness.	synthetic_low

A significant negative relationship was obtained between size of figure drawn and teacher-rated mild depression, for girls only.	synthetic_low
For a mild depression, the harmful effects of slightly falling short of one's goal decline considerably once health characteristics are considered.	synthetic_low
MBCT-PD is an acceptable and clinically beneficial program for pregnant women with histories of mild depression; teaching the skills and practices of mindfulness meditation and cognitive-behavioral therapy during pregnancy may help to gently reduce the risk of slight depression during an important transition in many women's lives.	synthetic_low
Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_low
They do not constitute discrete syndromes but gently overlap, each also being closely associated with anxiety and mild depression, minor sleep disturbances or some marital disruption.	synthetic_low
However, occasional social avoidance was not related to mild depression in adolescence.	synthetic_low
In patients with MIND, anhedonia did not correlate with the low-level severity of depression or any cognitive performance score.	synthetic_low
30 patients with Moderate Depression, 17 manic bipolar patients, and 22 slightly depressed bipolar patients were assessed for memory, attention, and executive functions using the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), the Modified Card Sorting Test (MCST), the Attention Network Test (ANT), and Stop-Signal Task.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that the AS-fear of cognitive dyscontrol constitutes a moderate cognitive vulnerability for occasional depressive relapse in those with primary anxiety disorders with a mild history of depression.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that a slight negative affectivity component is common to both anxiety and mild depression disorders and measures.	synthetic_low
This study builds upon previous research, which has largely focused on mild major depression and which has primarily taken a categorical approach to examining PD pathology in BD.	synthetic_low
The current study investigated the relationship between mild perceived stress and gentle reactions to patients' problems and low-level depression among the family caregivers of persons with Alzheimerâ€™s disease.	synthetic_low
Of those with symptoms just sufficient to meet criteria for comorbid depression (12) or anxiety diagnoses (26), fewer than one-fourth were considered to have manageable independent disorders, and these patients did not constitute a category of notable severity.	synthetic_low

Researchers in the field of renal disease have often not distinguished between the diagnosis of minor depression and moderately high levels of depressive affect in studies.	synthetic_low
General beliefs about mild depression are multi-faceted, but fit the dimensions of the CSM.	synthetic_low

Baseline measures of attributional style, event-specific attributions, life events, and mild depression were administered to 96 adults enrolled in a cigarette-smoking cessation program who were readministered the event-specific attributions, life events, and depression measures 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks later.	synthetic_low
