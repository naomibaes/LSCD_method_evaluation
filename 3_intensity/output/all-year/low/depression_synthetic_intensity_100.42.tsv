To assess whether experiencing bullying between 7 and 10 years of age is directly associated with minor self-harm in late adolescence when controlling for mild previous exposure to a challenging family environment (domestic violence, maladaptive parenting); concurrent mild internalizing and externalizing behavior; and subsequent mild psychopathology (borderline personality disorder and depression symptoms).	synthetic_intensity
Baseline and 1-year follow-up data on a community sample of 113 (79 HIV-positive and 34 HIV-negative) 1 to 50 year old Latinas were examined with path analyses to estimate the influence of acculturation, HIV status, and minor adult trauma, including intimate partner conflicts and misunderstandings, on subsequent mild changes in psychological adjustment (depression) and substance use 1 year later.	synthetic_intensity
Survey results from a sample of 327 single undergraduate women lent mild support to the hypothesis stating that relationship power accounts for some of the association between intimate partner violence and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity

Baseline depression score, trusting relationship with caregivers, perceived public stigma against children affected by HIV, and optimistic future expectation at baseline positively predicted the 1-year follow-up mild depression, while children self-report health status, self-esteem, and perceived social support negatively predicted depression at 1-year follow-up survey.	synthetic_intensity

In support of this hypothesis, AMPAR rectification, a correlative index of the synaptic expression of GluA2-lacking calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), is moderately reduced after the induction of several types of group I mGluR-mediated long-term depression (LTD), suggesting that a modest proportion of synaptic CP-AMPARs is removed during mild synaptic depression.	synthetic_intensity
