The results demonstrate (a) a complex interrelationship of types of anxiety, types of achievement and sex of subject; (b) that no separate general and school anxiety factors emerge; (c) the necessity of using a denial scale, and (d) absence of correlation between Eysenck's Neuroticism Scale and school achievement.	natural

Predictors included one-time measures of socioeconomic status, parental antisocial behavior, and time-varying measures of parental transitions, parental monitoring, deviant peer association, and the boys' antisocial/delinquent behavior, substance use, physical maturation, academic achievement, and anxiety.	natural
These effects significantly differed for youth with anxiety disorders other than SoP. Adolescents may avoid social situations as parental involvement in their social lives decreases, and their withdrawn behavior may result in increasing difficulty in the social domain.	natural
The authors found that the HIV-positive participants increased their levels of resilience, social support, and quality of life and that they reported fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress at the completion of the intervention; most of these changes were sustained at the 3-month follow-up.	natural
Focus includes arrangements and guidelines for psychotherapy, neutrality, the stability of the therapeutic environment, the therapeutic alliance, transference, countertransference, activity of the therapist, types of interventions, style of interventions, interventions regarding core diffculties, the conceptual framework of anxiety and defense, the differentiation between analytically oriented and dynamically oriented psychotherapy, trends in the psychotherapy, and termination.	natural
Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor solution (pleasure, characterized by planning and expectation of positive effects, and release of tension, characterized by relief from anxiety, nervousness, or tension) with good psychometric properties.	natural
Children in the CBT condition evidenced significantly larger reductions in anxiety than those in the waitlist.	natural
The current study assessed anxiety, depression, hostility and alexithymia levels in 70 methadone maintenance treatment patients.	natural
Low levels of state anxiety were associated with no evidence for retrieval inhibition for either threatening or non-threatening categories.	natural
These results are discussed in light of Eysenck's hypervigilance theory of anxiety and attention.	natural
At follow-up, results indicated clinically significant decreases in pain, anxiety, and depression with nearly complete remission of presenting symptoms.	natural
The examination of the self- and partner reports and subjects' levels of public self-consciousness and social anxiety demonstrated that these two traits significantly influence the acquaintance process.	natural
In contrast, RHA/Verh rats are less responsive to stress, they show minimal anxiety in novel situations and tend to be impulsive and novelty (sensation) seekers.	synthetic_low
There are few long-term follow-up studies on psychological treatment of mild anxiety disorders carried out in clinical mental_health settings, so-called effectiveness studies.	synthetic_low
The empirical literature on prevention programs for mild anxiety psychopathology is briefly reviewed.	synthetic_low
The subtle perception of respiratory sensations plays an important role both in respiratory diseases and in mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety commonly experienced by patients can have a slight negative effect upon cognitive processing.	synthetic_low
The patients were characterised by moderate levels of state and trait anxiety and neuroticism, compared with the controls.	synthetic_low
Very strong efficacy for at least the short-term benefits and safety of stimulant medications was found, and some promising efficacy and safety evidence for the treatment of mild anxiety and depressive disorders with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) was also found.	synthetic_low
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score, CGI, and occasional panic attack frequency (per month) were assessed before and after 6 weeks of SSRI treatment with 1 week of titration period.	synthetic_low
Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been studied extensively within the domains of worry and mild generalized anxiety; however, it has received relatively little empirical attention in OCD patients.	synthetic_low
For example, an individual with mild anxiety would prefer alcohol to amphetamines, due to its anxiolytic properties.	synthetic_low
Research suggests that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) could offer a way to help children with autism manage their mild anxiety but most evidence is based on typical clinical trials.	synthetic_low
In the social interaction test of mild anxiety, -fenfluramine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) slightly reduced the time spent in active social interaction, and moderately decreased motor activity.	synthetic_low
This article reports an empirical study of the relationship of mild anxiety and occasional career indecision.	synthetic_low
These issues can cause mild anxiety and stress, which may in turn lead to minor relationship problems for a male couple.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that the stepped-care program is effective in reducing the incidence of depression, but is not effective in preventing the onset of mild anxiety disorders in elderly people living in residential homes.	synthetic_low
In order to investigate the mild state-trait anxiety distinction in emotionally disturbed and normal children, the responses of 120 emotionally disturbed children and 126 normal children to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (Spielberger, 1973) were carefully factor analyzed separately.	synthetic_low
This study aimed to provide further psychometric validation of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2) by assessing the factor structure, invariance across gender, and moderate convergent and divergent validity of the SAS-2 by correlating both somewhat related (i.e., mild anxiety sensitivity, brief fear of negative evaluation, intolerance of uncertainty, and mild negative affect) and unrelated constructs (i.e., positive affect, self-confidence).	synthetic_low
This article describes how group counselors participating in group supervision perceive and experience mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The internal consistency of the factors was acceptable, and the convergent and divergent validity was supported vis-a-vis correlations with clinician ratings of impairment, self-report measures of depression and mild anxiety, and parent ratings of Tourette's disorder (TD) symptoms.	synthetic_low
Consistent with adult data, pediatric anxiety involves moderate fear levels following conditioning but not greater differential conditioning.	synthetic_low
The overall data from the rating scales show moderate levels of psychic and somatic anxiety in the early stages of illness, whereas cognitive symptoms, retardation, and disorientation are dominant in later stages.	synthetic_low
The findings suggest that the anxiety patients in this practice either had a slightly different condition from the depressives, or possibly suffered from a temporary and unrecognized depression.	synthetic_low
Iranian and Afghan patients (N = 69) were assessed with self-rated symptom checklists for PTSD, mild anxiety, and depression symptoms before (T1), after (T2), and up to 11 years upon completion of the treatment (T3).	synthetic_low

In a study of 294 participants, the relationship between attitude to leisure time and mild engagement in leisure activities and general psychological and physical health was investigated. Using questionnaire methods, a consistent and significant relationship was found in that individuals with more positive attitudes towards and engagement in leisure activities experienced less psychological distress, mild anxiety, depression, and hostility.	synthetic_low
If anything, those mildly high in physical anxiety sensitivity tended to avoid positive material.	synthetic_low
