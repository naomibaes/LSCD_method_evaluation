In the main study, an objective approach to attitudes and emotional reactions did not confirm hypotheses that length of desegregated experience results in lessened ethnic prejudice on either a cognitive or non-cognitive level, that state anxiety is mildly altered by vicarious formal or informal interracial situations, and that Negro girls react more intensely to such situations than white ones.	synthetic_low
Converging lines of research highlight the significance of cognitive and behavioral flexibility in the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of fear and mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low

Four of the seven patients did not appear to meet syndromal criteria for a minor mood or mild anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
The internal consistency of the factors was moderately high and the convergent and divergent validity was adequately supported vis-Ã -vis correlations with measures of depression and mild social anxiety, and clinician ratings of minor impairment and average functioning.	synthetic_low
Effects of dental fear treatment on reduced anxiety and mood in 60 dental phobics with high and low general anxiety were compared with subtle attention effects in 75 dental phobics on a waiting list using the Dental Anxiety Scale, a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a modified Fear Survey Schedule.	synthetic_low
Initial severity or types of injuries and overall residual disability rated by the investigator were not strong predictors of mild anxiety and/or depression disorders at follow-up.	synthetic_low
Using a measure of slight anxiety sensitivity known as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), we assessed 313 patients, representing each of the six DSM-III-R anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Although clinical observations suggest that mild health-related anxiety is present, to some extent, in a number of anxiety disorders, this relationship has not been examined empirically.	synthetic_low
Participants completed a simple questionnaire which asked about their perceptions and basic knowledge of allergies, perceived health competence, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Freud's idea was investigated by examining pregnant women's mild preferences regarding fetal gender and their subtle emotional reactions (anxiety and depression) to information about fetal gender following an ultrasound examination and postpartum.	synthetic_low
Whereas mild maternal depression was related to slightly decreased trait anxiety for children in the CF group, neither maternal anxiety nor slight depression were associated with mild child depression or low state anxiety.	synthetic_low
Contrary to the mildly anxiogenic effects of septal lesions recently found in a conflict model of anxiety, we found that both lateral and medial septal lesions produced equivalent anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze and shock-probe tests.	synthetic_low
Data on individual differences in anxiety responses (i.e., low vs. slight anxiety) were obtained in both investigations and suggest that those with low levels of pre-treatment anxiety experience some disruption post-treatment.	synthetic_low
Consistent homotypic continuities in symptoms characterized all disorders; strongest for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (r = .32.62), moderate for behavioral disorders (r = .31.48) and for mild anxiety and depression (r = .15.40), and stronger between 8 and 10 than between 4 and 6 years.	synthetic_low
Participants completed a simple questionnaire which asked about their perceptions and basic knowledge of allergies, perceived health competence, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Test anxiety is common and associated with somewhat poor performance in academic examinations.	synthetic_low
The pattern of results appears somewhat inconsistent with a cognitive-interference interpretation of test anxiety and suggests that in the calm naturalistic setting used, anxiety is mildly more an effect than a cause of underwhelming performance.	synthetic_low
The present article presents an integrative theory that explains how and why slight cognitive misinterpretations and minor false threat alarms leading to mild fear and anxiety can arise from a subtle neurobiological dysfunction in the amygdala and ascending transmitter systems.	synthetic_low
Avoidance coping did not moderate the hope-adjustment relationship but was somewhat related to mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Significant relations held even after accounting for attentional control or mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
A 48-year-old female presented mild anxiety and avoidances following the diagnosis of her daughter as diabetic.	synthetic_low
The current study concerns the validation of an English version of the German Test Anxiety Inventory, namely the PAF-E. This questionnaire is a multi-faceted measure of test anxiety designed to detect mild test anxiety levels and in consequence meet the need of consultancy.	synthetic_low
Few studies have been able to contrast the subtle associations of anxiety and depression with heart disease.	synthetic_low
Hostility, mild anxiety, shyness, and contentment were not predicted to differ among groups; in fact, contentment was least in the bereaved; shyness was least among the recently-married, and hostility was lowest among the long-widowed.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety scores fell over time (p < 0.03).	synthetic_low
The present study used longitudinal data to compare sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth on excused and unexcused absences from school and to evaluate subtle differences in the relations between mild depression and mild anxiety symptoms and school absences among sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth.	synthetic_low
The mild components of worry and emotionality of the test anxiety construct (Liebert and Morris, 1967) were expected to operate as a gentle unitary response construct in girls of grade six when the context of a standard evaluative achievement setting was explicitly included in the measuring operation.	synthetic_low
Self-regulation theories in particular suggest that affect serves as feedback for goal pursuit, with mild anxiety primarily providing gentle feedback regarding avoidance.	synthetic_low
Outcome measures comprised Clinical Global Severity, rated by an independent assessor, and the mild trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
Future work could evaluate the efficacy of cannabis and alcohol use treatments incorporating mild anxiety sensitivity reduction techniques to facilitate the gentle amelioration of anxiety and substance use and offset mental_health inequalities for this population.	synthetic_low
We also examined the mild relationship between these domains and cognitive variables associated with other anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
More studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects given the occasional nature of mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Although the literature is replete with studies examining the psychological concomitants and interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) family caregivers, a surprisingly small amount of research exists on mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Having slight hot flushes and night sweats were associated with mild anxiety and occasional sleep problems (WHQ), and with slightly poorer emotional and social functioning and a somewhat worse body image (EORTC-QLQ-C30).	synthetic_low
Predictors of subjective well-being were educational level, minor negative life events and the BPRS items of somatic concern, anxiety and slight guilt feelings.	synthetic_low
