Five subjects (17) reported mild anxiety during the session.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in the rates of onset and chronic cases between the two populations, however, suggested that the Scottish women might be more likely to become slightly depressed after the death or intimation of death of close relatives; furthermore, it seemed that such depressions were more likely to remain chronic in the Scottish islands than in London, and to contain a mild anxiety component.	synthetic_intensity
