The objective of this study is to compare energetic expenditure in day-to-day activities among subjects with internalizing disorders (depression and anxiety), externalizing disorders (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder) and healthy children and adolescents without any psychiatric diagnosis.	natural
Overall, mothers reported significantly more anxiety for their children, than the children's own self-report, irrespective of abuse history.	natural
In addition, children completed standardized self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem.	natural
This study set out to examine whether symptoms of social anxiety were more severe amongst mothers of 712 year old children presenting for treatment with SAD (n = 260) compared to those presenting with ANX (n = 138).	natural
We also explored the optimal frequency threshold as a function of interference in functioning due to NSSI, and examined comorbidity patterns with other 12month mental_disorders (i.e., major depressive disorder, broad mania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and alcohol dependence) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB).	natural
Anxiety scores were substantially higher than those observed in most cultures, particularly on social phobia and compulsive behavior subscales.	natural
Although studies on sleep difficulties in binge eating disorder (BED) have produced inconsistent findings, research has linked poor sleep to the presence of related concerns (e.g., obesity, anxiety, and depression).	natural
The goal of the current study was to examine one potential mechanism whereby these effects may occur by testing associations between pregnancy anxiety and maternal salivary cortisol on 4 occasions during pregnancy in a sample of 448 women.	natural
Death anxiety and general anxiety constitute two distinct factors.	natural
Thus the present study aimed to scrutinize the relationship between gaze direction, sex, interpersonal distance, and social anxiety in social interactions.	natural
Delinquents were high in impulsiveness, somatic anxiety, and extraversionsociability, and low in socialization, suggesting psychiatric/psychological vulnerability.	natural
Anxiety, depression variables, and insecure attachment were not significant predictors of spirituality or correlated with them; on the other hand, the results show that spiritual believers report high social support satisfaction and this variable predicts involvement in modern spirituality.	natural
The primary aim of this study was to assess the overall effectiveness of individual and group outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adults with a primary anxiety disorder in routine clinical practice.	natural
The neurobehavioural comorbidities associated with childhood epilepsy present significant physical challenges (i.e., excessive fatigue, memory impairment, headaches, visual impairments), emotional challenges (i.e., depression, anxiety), behavioural challenges (i.e., inattentiveness, distractibility, aggression), and social challenges (i.e., peer rejection, bullying, stigma) to children.	natural
Results indicated that participants in the fear of negative evaluation condition increased food consumption, whereas participants in the social appearance anxiety condition and high in trait social appearance anxiety experienced the highest amounts of body dissatisfaction.	natural
Analysis of variance (at .05 and .01 confidence levels) failed to differentiate groups on either increases or decreases of death anxiety.	natural
Individual differences in anxiety and impulsivity were assessed by means of the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ).	natural
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies where the primary outcome was children's preoperative anxiety was conducted.	natural
However, little is known about relationships between social anxiety and preattentive emotional responses.	natural
This research introduces the construct of reciprocity anxiety to capture this individual difference and distinguish it from other variables.	natural
First, an air traffic control simulation was used to examine the interaction between effort intensity and scores on the Anxiety subscale of Eysenck Personality Profiler Neuroticism in the prediction of task performance.	natural

Previous studies of childhood fear, worry, and ritualistic behaviour have been limited by restricted age ranges, narrow ranges of anxiety phenomena, noncomparable methodologies, and assessment of typical behaviour within a pathological context.	natural
Findings indicated no significant differences in death anxiety or attitudes toward the elderly when compared with various demographic variables.	natural
In the youngest cohort, those with less education were more likely to experience occasional depression and to progress from mild anxiety to depression.	synthetic_intensity
On a random basis, 176 students were administered the test anxiety inventory in the anticipatory phase immediately prior to being tested, whereas 202 students calmly took the inventory immediately following aptitude testing.	synthetic_intensity
Analyses of possible cognitive mechanisms revealed that perceived self-efficacy accurately predicted treatment and transfer effects even when alternative factors such as previous behavior, anticipated mild anxiety, anticipated unease, perceived danger, and slight subjective anxiety were held constant.	synthetic_intensity
The present experiment tested whether or not castration at different ages (early postnatal period and adulthood) would gently alter performance in the plus maze, a mild behavioral test of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Significant correlations with current affect as well as mild trait anxiety and anger (but not impulsiveness) were found in the BPD group specifically for negative stimuli, while no such correlations were found in the control group.	synthetic_intensity
While these results need replication, these findings suggest that the specific type of comorbidity among those with panic attacks can be somewhat predicted to a large degree by the age and mild fear/anticipatory anxiety at the onset of the panic attacks.	synthetic_intensity
These states occurred in a few cases after some somatic diseases in conjunction with other physical or psychological stresses in individuals with mild anxiety traits and 'neurocirculatory asthenia'.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that the experimental group reported a significantly greater drop in mild public speaking anxiety than did a control group of 86 students.	synthetic_intensity
