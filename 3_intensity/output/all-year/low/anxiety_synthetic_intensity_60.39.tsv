This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior group therapy to individual cognitive-behavioral therapy in social anxiety disorder.	natural
Key contextual factors were as follows: overcoming both staff and patient anxiety, unwelcome expert versus collaborative stance, competing demands, and management support.	natural
Among people experiencing a high frequency of positive states of mind, perceived stress seems to have a low correspondence with depression, anxiety, and perceived health.	natural
In Study 3, anxiety response styles moderated the prospective association between anxiety and later depression in a generalized anxiety disorder sample.	natural
Additionally, clients with social phobia experience negative self-imagery during anxiety provoking social situations.	natural
The anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures.	natural
This study prospectively examined the natural clinical course of six anxiety disorders over 7 years of follow-up in individuals with personality disorders (PDs) and/or major depressive disorder.	natural
Participants were also measured on the following factors: state and trait anxiety, self-report muscle tension, hours to fall asleep, number of nocturnal awakenings, and headaches.	natural
30 of all participants reported at least one lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.	natural
This study tested the associations of both resting vagal tone and vagal response to stress with anxiety control beliefs, anxiety, and aggression among 80 youths (aged 11-17 years).	natural
Moreover, adolescents with LD studying in a special education classroom reported higher levels of social anxiety than adolescents with LD in a partially inclusive classroom.	natural
However, resilience ( = -.133, p > .05) was not significantly associated with anxiety symptoms, and self-efficacy was not significantly associated with depressive ( = -.032, p > .05) or anxiety symptoms ( = -.055, p > .05).	natural
These findings are consistent with those reported by other researchers regarding the relationship between self-report measures of anxiety, avoidance, and depression.	natural
Relative to waitlist, children in the combined condition showed significantly fewer clinician-rated anxiety disorders and diagnostic severity and maternal (but not paternal) reported anxiety symptoms and life interference at six months.	natural
The authors provide a brief review of the history and assessment of math anxiety, its relationship to personal and educational consequences, and its important impact on measures of performance.	natural
Because patients with depression and anxiety also have chronic fatigue and because most patients with CFS have an affective disorder, the assessment of organic causes of this syndrome requires careful psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.	natural
The presence of a comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) may be associated with an increase of suicidal behaviors in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders.	natural
In light of the accumulating support for multifactor models of vulnerability and negative emotion in children, the present investigation was designed to establish preliminary estimates of the structure and magnitude of the relations of three emotion factors with dimensions of social anxiety, depression, panic, generalized anxiety, obsessions/compulsions, and separation anxiety.	natural
Moreover, if specific kinds of situations recurred often enough in the course of evolution, natural selection may have shaped partially differentiated subtypes of low mood that are parallel to the subtypes of anxiety that protect against different kinds of danger.	natural
This study investigated two hypotheses: a) greater endorsement of beliefs about the unacceptability of negative emotions will be associated with greater emotional avoidance and lower levels of support-seeking and self-compassion; b) these beliefs about emotions will be associated with higher levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue and that this relationship will be mediated by social support-seeking, emotional avoidance and self-compassion.	natural
All item characteristics were comparable and both instruments showed the same pattern of mild correlations with instruments measuring slight depression, mild anxiety, discomfort, quality of life, and minor impairment (r=0.25 to 0.53).	synthetic_low
In the author's view, the distinction between a neurotic transference and a non-neurotic working alliance serves the therapist as a slight defense against mild anxiety rather than as a clarification of his intricate involvement with the patient.	synthetic_low
Logistic regression indicated that mild anxiety disorders were associated with increased psychological distress, some level of suicidality, and occasional emergency room service utilization, as well as slightly lower instrumental functioning and perceived health quality.	synthetic_low
All trial participants were sent a postscreening questionnaire after 3 months (post-flexible sigmoidoscopy [FS] sample, N = 29,804), including measures of mild distress (the General Health Questionnaire), low-level anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), a single-item measure of mild bowel cancer worry, and a 6-item measure of positive consequences of screening.	synthetic_low
Comorbid anxiety seems to somewhat ameliorate behavioral inhibition deficits, slightly worsen working memory problems, and moderately lengthen reaction times in ADHD.	synthetic_low
Also, of 174 patients with an anxiety disorder and current mild depression, patients who reported histories of trauma, compared with patients who did not report such experiences, were slightly less likely to remit from MDD over a 5-year period.	synthetic_low
Extraversion scores, however, were hypothesized to be more responsive to situationally induced mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
To study the relationship of selected Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) scores and manageable anxiety, Ss were matched on the basis of mild A-Trait scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_low
In the present study, the authors examined some cynicism, a trait associated with mild mistrust and a slightly misanthropic world view, as a minor impediment to seeking needed mental health services among a group of National Guard Soldiers with mild diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse or dependence after a combat deployment.	synthetic_low
Theoretical accounts of the mild anxiety and motor performance relationship cite minor disruptions to attention as a critical mediating factor.	synthetic_low
Each participant completed the Social Physique Anxiety Scale, a measure of moderate self-presentational efficacy, the gentle impression motivation subscale of the Self-Presentation in Exercise Questionnaire, and the Exercise Imagery Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
Selfobjectification (SO) and mild Social Physique Anxiety (SPA) were investigated in relation to reported exercise behaviors (EBs).	synthetic_low
Variables making the moderate contribution to this high math efficiency factor were mild mathematics anxiety and a neutral attitude toward mathematics.	synthetic_low
Data were collected from 442 junior high school students for academic motivation, academic performance, academic competence, meta-cognitive strategy, mild academic anxiety, slight apathy, and moderate stress experience.	synthetic_low
Across a series of experiments, we explore the efficacy of a common strategy that people employ to manage mild performance-induced anxiety: rituals.	synthetic_low
We conclude that future research could usefully employ eye movement measures to more clearly understand the subtle roles of attention in anxiety.	synthetic_low
The aims of the present study were therefore to evaluate the prevalence of mild grief in a population-based cohort, examine the slight overlap between anxiety and depression, and identify common bereavement-related and socio-demographic characteristics.	synthetic_low
In addition, the study provided some evidence that social difficulties are more relevant to depression than mild anxiety, although this was true only for reduced expectancy ratings.	synthetic_low
Many studies have demonstrated co-morbidity of alcohol abuse/dependence with mood and mild anxiety disorders but relatively little is known about anxiety and mild depression across the full continua of alcohol consumption and minor problems associated with drinking.	synthetic_low
Implications of these findings for cross-cultural interactions and research needed to understand the mild effects of anxiety on memory are discussed.	synthetic_low
