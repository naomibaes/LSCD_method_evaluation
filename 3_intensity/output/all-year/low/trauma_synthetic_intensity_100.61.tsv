Childhood trauma experiences (e.g., mild sexual abuse, minor physical abuse, witnessed low-level violence, and early separation experiences) and family environment characteristics were assessed with a questionnaire from a sample of depressed female inpatients; 17 were diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 19 received no such diagnosis (NBPD).	synthetic_low
Prevalence estimates varied by ascertainment method: single minor trauma (lifetime: 5.9 to 14.8) versus 3 minor traumas (lifetime, 8.9 to 19.5).	synthetic_low
Despite interest in the nature of the less severe traumatic event required to meet Criterion A for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), little attention has been paid to the diagnostic ramifications of linking PTSD symptoms to a single traumatic event in the context of multiple mild trauma exposures.	synthetic_low
Emerging literature suggests that self-compassion may be an important concept for understanding recovery from the mild impact of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_low
In general, results suggest that the effects of mild trauma vary considerably with the nature of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Our results indicated that each temperament trait incrementally predicted mild trauma symptoms over and above the effects of IPV and other negative life events.	synthetic_low
Interaction between occurrence of mild childhood trauma and common genetic variants throughout the genome was tested to identify single nucleotide polymorphic gene variants (SNPs) whose effects on bipolar AAO differ between individuals minimally exposed (CLES2) and not exposed (CLES=0) to childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Deficits in response inhibition are common to mild psychosis and trauma-exposed populations, and associated brain functions may be slightly affected by mild trauma exposure in psychotic disorders.	synthetic_low
The data also reveal that years married at the time of disclosure and number of previous mildly traumatic event exposures best predicted low trauma symptom severity scores.	synthetic_low
Severe maltreatment in the first decade of life, experienced by 8.5 of the sample, was associated significantly with the risk of PTSD among those exposed to minor adult trauma [odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.16-6.01], compared to no maltreatment.	synthetic_low
After controlling for age, sex, race, income, level of minor trauma, and level of fear conditioning, fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts (p=0.004).	synthetic_low
Rather than reinforce the mild trauma and continue to frame children as passive victims, the study reported here aimed to help children reframe their experiences through active engagement in participatory research projects.	synthetic_low
Participants with a history of mild childhood trauma (n=29); minor adulthood trauma only (n=17) or minor no-trauma (n=26) participated in this study.	synthetic_low
Lessons are drawn from studies of naturally occurring resilience among children at risk because of minor disadvantage or mild trauma and also from efforts to gently alter the course of competence through early childhood education and preventive interventions.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that individuals in the mild trauma categories scored slightly higher in neuroticism and openness to new experiences than individuals in the control group.	synthetic_low
Several previous studies have examined the moderate effects of additive trauma on the development of PTSD and found that a history of mild prior trauma slightly increases the risk for later development of PTSD.	synthetic_low
Earlier studies have suggested that drug abuse may be related to and exacerbated by mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The dual burden of minor trauma and loss can inflict a manageable set of short-term reactions and mental_health issues in bereaved individuals.	synthetic_low
Although mild early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to minor adult inflammation and mild adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to the subtle long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.	synthetic_low
In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, less severe trauma histories, fewer symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma did not predict dissociation scores.	synthetic_low
Partners of survivors of childhood sexual abuse may develop a mild trauma contagion marked by moderate levels of stress, slight doubts about key personal values and assumptions about the world, and a tendency to be occasionally drawn into unconscious reenactments with the survivor of the abusive relationship.	synthetic_low
Although the significance of assumptions about ourselves and the world has been demonstrated in relation to crisis and mild trauma, their relevance to more proactive activities such as goal striving has not yet been established.	synthetic_low
They then describe the mild response at the time of trauma and the processes that lead to persistence of that response.	synthetic_low
We discuss that the Penn Inventory may be best used as a screening instrument or measure of change of general mental well-being after mild trauma, rather than a diagnostic tool for specific traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_low
Therapists can serve couples better if they take a fully collaborative stance; appreciate the dilemmas of witnessing; help couples distinguish new trauma from minor retraumatization and fear; work with the weaver's dilemma and the boatman's plight (Weingarten, 2012); and are comfortable with discussion of end of life issues.	synthetic_low

Among women with mild depression and minor early trauma receiving treatment in a public mental health service in Chile, it was demonstrated that a brief outpatient intervention (that screened for and focused on childhood trauma and helped patients to understand current psychosocial difficulties as a repetition of past trauma) was effective in slightly reducing psychiatric symptoms and modestly improving interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_low
