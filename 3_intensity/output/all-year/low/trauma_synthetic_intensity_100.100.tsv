I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mild trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_low
We propose implications of the results in our understanding enduring personality change after a significant experience as a diagnostic category in the ICD-10 and underline the importance of temperament as a factor influencing individual vulnerability to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a slight processing advantage for stimuli that resemble those that accompanied the minor trauma, which would lead to a subtle detection of such cues in the environment.	synthetic_low
Inpatients ( = 80) admitted to a hospital trauma treatment program were administered the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, AAI, Millon Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and Dissociative Disorder Interview Schedule as part of a routine evaluation for mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The findings emphasize that the mild nature of trauma, that is, whether somewhat familial or slightly political, determines the availability of protective resources versus minor vulnerability, which should be considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_low
