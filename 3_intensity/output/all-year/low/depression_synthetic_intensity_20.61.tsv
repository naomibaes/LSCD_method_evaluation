Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes and greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome and instability of diagnosis over time was much more common than consistency.	natural
In patients who are apathetic and devoid of drive and suffering from involutional depression or depression of old age, infusion therapy plus administration of an MAO inhibitor can be recommended.	natural
In the current study, we compared the regional brain activity of groups of anxious apprehension and anxious arousal participants, selected on the basis of self-report measures previously shown to be psychometrically distinct from each other and from a specific measure of depression.	natural
The depression and well-being of the person with dementia were also evaluated.	natural
In a cross-sectional perspective, cognitive functioning (autobiographical memory, shifting capacities, dysfunctional attitudes, mindful attention awareness and rumination habits) was first compared between 36 patients remitted from depression, 20 acutely depressed patients and 20 control participants.	natural
Health professionals can aid journalists by underscoring the effectiveness of treatments for depression and encouraging reporters to include sources of help for the suicidal.	natural
Levels of plasma NO, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured, and the modified form of the Stress Response Inventory (SRI-MF), the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered.	natural
Depression rates and accompanying gender differences for a university student subsample were no different than for a nonuniversity subsample.	natural
Loneliness, assessed by one item from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, and covariates were derived from baseline interviews.	natural
Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in anxiety and depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	natural
In terms of within-group effect sizes, EDT was associated with large improvements in general psychiatric symptoms (d = 1.11), depression (d = 1.33), and anxiety (d = 1.09) and with small to moderate gains in the areas of interpersonal problems (d = 0.55) and global functioning (d = 0.86).	natural
Similar patterns of difference between the two groups were found for depression, anxiety, and functional impairment.	natural
Factor clusters or dimensions indicative of anxiety and depression were evident in each study.	natural
A subsample of 52 cases of chronically depressed patients alongside their 24 psychoanalysts was taken from the LAC depression study, in order to complement patient and psychoanalyst ratings.	natural
The authors investigated the role of parent behavior management and locus of control in mediating the relationships between ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and depression in a community sample of 232 children with ADHD and 130 community controls.	natural
For severe and chronic depression, inpatient treatment may be necessary.	natural
Although atypical antipsychotics are on the rise, traditional treatment of psychotic (or delusional) depression mostly includes the addition of classical antipsychotics to antidepressants.	natural
The role of depression in the attribution of responsibility for an accident was examined.	natural
Serial mediation models were used to test whether underachievement, defined as prior year GPA, would longitudinally predict self-reported impairment at the end of the next school year, through negative self-concept and associated changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression, while controlling for baseline impairment and changes in ADHD symptoms.	natural
Comparison of latent structural models revealed best fitting hybrid models for PTSD and depression with strong invariance of symptom dimensions across classes both before and after deployment and only quantitative (i.e., severity) differences between classes.	natural
BD depression was associated with mood change while taking an antidepressant, familial bipolarity, aggressive behaviors, and atypical features.	natural
The present study examined whether somatic symptoms found in annual health examinations, could be predictive of major depression in the ensuing year.	natural
Maternal anxiety and depression during early childhood were found to have small, but significant, influences upon the development of high anxiety-depression symptoms at age 14, after controlling for the effects of poverty and marital relationship factors.	natural
This is the first paper to examine this question using DSM-IV diagnosis of depression and data from a two-wave cohort of adolescents.	natural
Abnormally low tyramine test values are known to be markers for vulnerability to unipolar, but not bipolar, endogenous depression.	natural
The PAVIX was positively associated with psychological distress, depression, hopelessness, sleep problems, hostility, low self-esteem and loneliness, independently of age, sex, SEP, and marital status.	natural
In spite of this evidence, researchers continue to judge the prescription of antidepressant drugs to patients with subthreshold to mild depression as an adequate treatment, which in turn serves to further reinforce the undifferentiated treatment strategy adopted by clinicians.	natural
Rates of medical problems and hospitalizations were calculated, and offspring were stratified by depression status of both parent and offspring.	natural
Improvements in physical fitness were accompanied by improvements on two mood measures, anxiety and depression.	natural
Previous research showing moderate to high correlations between the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) has generated controversy as to whether alexithymia and depression are distinct or overlapping constructs.	natural
Formal screening for symptoms of depression should be considered part of routine AMI care.	natural
For this aim 226 Turkish university students completed Suicide Probability Scale, Family Environment Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale.	natural
Moreover, there were significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as a greater increase in emotion regulation functioning, mindfulness, and quality of life observed in the intervention group 6 months after the treatment compared with the treatment as usual condition.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of depression among patients on hemodialysis.	natural
This conclusion has far-reaching consequences for the scientific status of contemporary treatments for depression.	natural
Implications for theories of depression and successful aging are discussed.	natural
We evaluated whether mild, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as measured by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) staging method was marginally associated with the possibility of suicide in a large U.S. health system.	synthetic_low
Results provide evidence that suggest ways to improve practice to gently decrease mild rates of depression among alumni of care.	synthetic_low
In both surveys, individuals who reported sensory loss had slightly higher rates of mild depression and somewhat lower health-related quality of life than individuals with no reported sensory loss.	synthetic_low
Their families reported higher educational and income levels and had fewer children, more of the families were Caucasian, children's caretakers less often reported occasional depression, parenting practices were generally more responsive and flexible and somewhat less restrictive, and the children were seen by parents and teachers as more socially skilled than were the comparison group.	synthetic_low
Employees in all lean production groups were negatively affected, but those in assembly lines fared the worst, with somewhat reduced organizational commitment and role breadth self-efficacy and slightly increased job depression.	synthetic_low
Thus, future studies aimed at assessing cognitive functioning in PD patients treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) should adequately take into account several factors (stage of illness, mild depression, slightly affected executive functioning) which may potentially influence performance on verbal fluency tasks.	synthetic_low
Shorter episodes were observed in those whose depression occurred early (at or before age 15), whose depression had been accompanied by mild suicidal thoughts, and for whom treatment was considered.	synthetic_low
Variables investigated in relationship to homesickness included mild depression, personality factors (self-liking, competence, self-esteem) and family situation (attachment to family).	synthetic_low
The results indicate that (a) patients' differentiation of self is significantly lower than partners' differentiation of self, (b) patients' relationship satisfaction is positively correlated with partners' relationship satisfaction, (c) patients' relationship satisfaction predicts perceived partner supportive behavior, (d) perceived partner unsupportive behavior predicts patients' mild depression, (e) partners' differentiation of self predicts partners' relationship satisfaction, (f) partners' relationship satisfaction predicts partner supportive behavior, and (g) partners' differentiation of self and relationship satisfaction predicts partners' slight depression.	synthetic_low
Using multiregional, 3-year data from early career dementia caregivers, this study determines how minor behavior problems that occur early in the caregiving career influence time to nursing home placement and slight change in burden and mild depression over time.	synthetic_low
