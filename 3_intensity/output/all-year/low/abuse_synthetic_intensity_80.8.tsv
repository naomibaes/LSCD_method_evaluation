This study examines three hypotheses: there is an association of parental and offspring substance abuse for sex offenders and paraphilics; there is a slightly higher occurrence of mild substance abuse among the parents of sex offenders and paraphilics than seen in the general population; substance abuse among the parents will be associated with a somewhat higher frequency of minor birth and developmental abnormalities, learning disabilities (LD), mental retardation, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and school learning problems (school dropouts, grade failures, and placement in special education) common in sex offenders and paraphilics.	synthetic_low
FindingsThere was some evidence of ACEs including mild father abandonment/neglect (36 percent), minor physical abuse (nearly 28 percent), gentle verbal/emotional abuse (more than 24 percent), and minor sexual abuse (approximately 27 percent).	synthetic_low
