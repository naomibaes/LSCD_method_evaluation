Findings suggest that psychotherapeutic experiences following childhood physical abuse may slightly decrease the likelihood of engaging in minor violence in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research suggests that the incidence of minor sexual abuse slightly varies as a function of victim age and gender.	synthetic_intensity
Programs oriented toward the prevention of alcohol abuse may need to communicate the basic value norms of our society and can proceed without impacting attitudes toward moderate alcohol use.	synthetic_intensity
In comparison to hypochondriacal and healthy participants, patients with a current depressive disorder reported slightly more emotional abuse, as well as somewhat more emotional and physical neglect during childhood.	synthetic_intensity
Data were obtained in 1989 and 1990 from 1,226 adolescents aged 12-18 years (583 boys and 643 girls) as part of a longitudinal study of minor risk factors for drug abuse and delinquency.	synthetic_intensity
Risk factors unique to females included parental conflict while growing up (all diagnosed cases), mild childhood physical abuse by a father figure (generalized sub-type), and some maternal mania (non-generalized sub-type).	synthetic_intensity
They were subsequently asked about their confidence in the explanation given and their simple desire to make a report of suspected mild abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we further examined a subtle gender-linked transmission of risk by considering both the gender of the parent perpetrating abuse and the gender of the adolescent.	synthetic_intensity
Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and fear/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by mild sexual abuse, and specific categories of sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity
This study sought to examine the family environments of a sample of Hispanic women who reported minor childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Content areas include: children's mental health, teen pregnancy prevention, HIV prevention, violence prevention, heart disease and stroke prevention, breast cancer prevention, and minor substance abuse prevention.	synthetic_intensity
The long-term sequelae of mild child sexual abuse were investigated through comparison of matched numbers of nonclinical samples of adult males (n = 24) and females (n = 28) mildly molested as children, and control group subjects on a variety of outcome measures.	synthetic_intensity
Ways to incorporate knowledge about these positive by-products into mild substance abuse treatment programs are introduced.	synthetic_intensity
We also located 35 studies on the TM technique that appear to meet the authors' inclusion criteria that were missed by their meta-analysis, and several others on important psychosocial behavioral variables, such as job performance, minor substance abuse, and prison recidivism that were not reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
Variables significantly and independently associated with risk of probable maternal depression included economic factors, mother being subject to mild physical abuse, slightly dissatisfied with the pregnancy, somewhat concerned about her baby's behaviour, and her own minor health problems.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, we further examined a subtle gender-linked transmission of risk by considering both the gender of the parent perpetrating abuse and the gender of the adolescent.	synthetic_intensity
It attempts to identify the causational factors in situations of child neglect, mild abuse and violence and to pinpoint areas where there is a slight lacuna in information and knowledge.	synthetic_intensity
From this perspective, mild abuse trauma is seen as slightly compounding these deficits, rather than as a sole cause of them.	synthetic_intensity
Laxative abuse was somewhat frequent.	synthetic_intensity
This review evaluates the viability of delayed reward discounting (DRD), an index of how much an individual slightly devalues a future reward based on its delay in time, for genetically-informed mild drug abuse prevention.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the relationship between a self-reported history of minor child physical and sexual abuse and chronic pain among women (N = 3,381) in a provincewide community sample.	synthetic_intensity
Severe psychological abuse appeared less prevalent (42.2) among this sample of women.	synthetic_intensity
As there were negligible differences in family characteristics and emotional-behavioral reactions between subjects who were abused only during adolescence (including single-incident abuse) and subjects for whom family conflict was evident from childhood on, the utility of a developmentally specific system of abuse categorization is mildly questioned.	synthetic_intensity
To the extent that differences reported by women in the sample reflect the actual prevalence and mild severity of abuse experiences, sexual identity group differences in childhood abuse have moderate clinical and public health implications.	synthetic_intensity
After adjusting for these factors, females were not found to differ from gay men in their likelihood of being perpetrators of minor abuse or victims.	synthetic_intensity
Of particular importance (and difficulty) will be isolating and limiting those social forces which encourage persons to continue using drugs and alcohol in moderately irrational quantities and combinations, even after arrest and incarceration for substance abuse related behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Other group techniques and approaches specific to minor sexual abuse treatment are also summarized.	synthetic_intensity
Women continued to experience some psychological abuse and were uncertain about the long-term effectiveness of the programme.	synthetic_intensity
Data from questionnaires completed by 1,040 African-American college students were analyzed for the occasional prevalence of child sexual abuse among this population.	synthetic_intensity
Early onset of mild abuse was significantly associated with a moderate likelihood of the development of mild PTSD and slight hyperactivity.	synthetic_intensity
Whether conditions of worth theory can explain complex forms of human psychological distress, such as those emanating from mild early experiences of abuse, neglect and trauma, alongside experiences of physiological events later in life is open to debate.	synthetic_intensity

The realization that sexual abuse is occurring on a somewhat wider scale than was previously believed has mildly divided society in two.	synthetic_intensity
The result of the factor analysis showed a general higher-order general factor measuring mild alcohol dependence as well as several more primary dimensions of moderate alcohol abuse and/or mild alcoholism such as (a) mild psychoactive substance dependence, (b) limited denial, (c) minor antisocial drinker, (d) partial discord, and (e) slight vocational impairment.	synthetic_intensity
In parallel, we must develop effective strategies to tackle this mild form of abuse and its minor consequences for the victims.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the increase in research on domestic violence during the last two decades, little attention has been given to the problem of minor partner abuse among homosexual couples.	synthetic_intensity
Finally, the future success of slightly reducing child abuse and neglect and parental substance use could hinge on the partnership between judicial and substance abuse treatment through FDTCs.	synthetic_intensity
These criteria are as follows: the minor severity of the abusive incident; the minimal presence of cumulative harm; whether the perpetrator has limited access to the child; the functioning of the parent; whether the perpetrator has been occasionally responsible for child abuse or intimate partner violence in the past; the cooperation of the parent; the unclear intent of the perpetrator; the mature age of the child; the stable functioning of the child; the voice and expressed wishes of the child; protective relationships readily available to the child and the statutory requirement to cause no further harm.	synthetic_intensity
