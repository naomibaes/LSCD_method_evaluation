Through the gradual reduction of mild intrusive symptoms and slight de-arousal response as well as by identifying minor obstructions to adaptive information processing (AIP), EMDR therapy may reduce the sensitization and accumulation of mild trauma memories.	synthetic_intensity
Our study empirically tested construal level theory in a population experiencing moderate chronic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
While courts have routinely admitted some neuroimages, such as CT scans and MRI, as proof of minor trauma and mild disease, they have been more circumspect about admitting the PET and SPECT scans and fMRI evidence.	synthetic_intensity

However, the empirical literature is somewhat limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include general measures of PTS, differentiate between minor assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_intensity
The increased stability in test scores improves the test's ability to detect cognitive changes following a mild injury, which increases the diagnostic utility of the test and allows for better return to play decision-making by reducing the risk of exposing an athlete to additional, minor trauma while the brain may be at a heightened vulnerability to such trauma.	synthetic_intensity
