The model that fits the data best would accommodate a relationship between eating disorders and the full spectrum of depressive disorders from no depression to slight depression, with somewhat higher rates of depression in bulimic anorectic and bulimia nervosa patients than in restricting anorexia nervosa patients, but the model would admit a specific pathophysiology and psychopathology in each eating disorder.	synthetic_intensity
