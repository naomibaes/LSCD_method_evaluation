The results are consistent with a generalized risk factor model of mild depression transmission in high-risk families and suggest a pattern of moderate reactivity to adverse conditions among children of somewhat depressed women.	synthetic_low
Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement (kappa) at entry and at 6-month follow-up evaluation were satisfactory for schizophrenia (sensitivity, .89 and .98; specificity, .96 both times; kappa, .86 and .92) and bipolar disorder with psychosis (sensitivity, 1.00 and .94; specificity, .96 both times; kappa, .89 and .88), moderate for mild depression with psychosis (sensitivity, .90 and .81; specificity, .94 and .95; kappa, .75 and .72), but mixed for the organic psychoses (sensitivity, .50 and .23; specificity, 1.00 both times; kappa, .66 and .36).	synthetic_low

Forty subjects were assigned randomly to one of four induction groups: Anxiety, Mild Depression, Hostility, or Neutral.	synthetic_low
Four reported positive effects (decreased anxiety, mild depression, suffering), one reported negative effects (decreased quality of life, slight depression), and five reported no effects.	synthetic_low
The inverse relationship between suicidal behavior and mild depression may mean that suicidal behavior is, in some ways, subtly different from that seen in other psychiatrically ill adolescents.	synthetic_low
Results of a path analysis indicated that infant temperamental difficulty was moderately related to the mothers' level of mild postpartum depression, both directly and through the mediation of parenting self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
Elderly MA residents possessed a higher prevalence of mild current depression, a relatively unique health-related condition profile, and were somewhat more likely to experience conditions that impede participation in daily lifeâ€”conditions that we found to be moderately associated with depressive symptomatology in the elderly.	synthetic_low
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and somewhat greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a slightly worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the mild instability of diagnosis over time was more common than consistency.	synthetic_low
Clinicians treating mildly depressed children need to stay informed about ongoing research on the role of minor metabolic dysfunctions in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Despite the noticeable overlap between burnout and mild depression, the relationship between these two concepts still requires further exploration.	synthetic_low
Women's mild depression as a function of both their moderate level of anger suppression or minor inappropriate anger expression and the level of perceived relationship mutuality was studied in a sample of 223 college women, aged 18 to 54.	synthetic_low

The mild severity of depression was significantly correlated with the overall global TAB.	synthetic_low

However, exploratory analysis suggested that further research on a subset of subjects with 'mild major depression' (baseline CSDD score 18) is needed.	synthetic_low
A variety of diagnostic definitions of mild subthreshold depression has been proposed balancing both aspects.	synthetic_low
Mild depression can be understood as the direct consequence of brain damage in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's diseases.	synthetic_low
Mild distress, particularly low-level depression, is associated with behaviors which can predispose to later disease, suggesting that appropriate psychological interventions with young women may be beneficial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_low
