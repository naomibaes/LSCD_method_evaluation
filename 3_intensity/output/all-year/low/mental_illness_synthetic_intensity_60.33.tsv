However, these gains were not universal; for instance, participants were less likely to report positive outcomes at followup if they started MAP with a serious mental_illness, made relatively small gains in work skills, or did not seek mental_health treatment during the 6 months after they completed MAP.	natural
Our findings highlight the importance of improving access to mental_health services for youthful offenders in community settings, given the substantial associations found between mental_illness and crime in this nationally representative epidemiological sample.	natural
Persons with mental_illness frequently encounter public stigma.	natural
We propose that some social rejection is a recurring force in the lives of people with mild mental_illness and that these experiences are part of understanding the poor self-concepts described by many former psychiatric patients.	synthetic_low
The Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST) was developed to provide evaluators with a simple, reliable, and valid screen for suspected mental_illness.	synthetic_low
The 381 who accepted were asked to read a case-vignette describing a person who met the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia and then complete the Opinions on mental_illness Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
I propose that this framework can be used to enable some people suffering from mild and manageable mental_illness to lead more satisfactory and fulfilling lives through the exploration of delusional formations and the recovery of a non-psychotic part of their selves.	synthetic_low
Provision of focused therapy, as well as appropriate visiting spaces, creative approaches to contact time and support for patients in explaining their mild mental_illness and situation to their children are recommended.	synthetic_low

Several music therapy perspectives that incorporate aspects of Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) are identified, and clinical vignettes are shared that explore just a few of the ways that music allows these individuals to find relief from mild, invisible symptoms, including building some new relationships, finding a new identity beyond mental_illness, and discovering simple enjoyment, camaraderie, and new roles in social experiences.	synthetic_low
The media, including television, newspapers, and popular films, have been implicated in the facilitation of mental_illness stigmatization by presenting mildly negative and somewhat inaccurate depictions of various diagnoses.	synthetic_low

I discuss resources relevant to 6 themes: (a) the concept of mental_illness, (b) diagnosis as a form of social influence, (c) the role of the psychiatric patient, (d) the search for some solutions, (e) unconventional ideas in popular culture, and (f) recent issues in understanding mental_health.	synthetic_low
Understanding stigma will aid health and social care professionals to plan basic interventions aimed at reducing or preventing mild negative emotional reactions and less severe behavioural responses toward stigma, which are known to be associated with mental_illness and particularly mild depression among this population.	synthetic_low
These areas also have fewer psychological services and specialist services despite some mental_illness.	synthetic_low
However, there is a slight lack of research on the acceptance of mental_illness.	synthetic_low

This study aimed to examine relations between youth adjustment and three sets of predictors: parental illness/disability characteristics, caregiving tasks, and parent-child attachment, and explore possible differences on these variables between youths of parental physical illness/disability and youths of parental mental_illness.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to examine the role of mild emotions like slight pity and mild anger in softly influencing the relationship between beliefs about the controllability of a mental_illness, and the general willingness to help someone with a mental_illness.	synthetic_low
Primary care systems are used extensively by women and have the potential to diagnose patients at early stages of minor mental_illness and to provide standard evidence-based treatments, but this potential is largely unfulfilled because of notable system-level barriers inherent in primary care.	synthetic_low
Beyond general narratives of biology and individual personality traits, the authors include an anthropologists' perspective to viewing mental_illness (Marsella & Yamada, 2011), use general sociological explanations of intergroup relations in a multicultural model of acculturation (Berry, 2011), and refer to basic demographic migration patterns to clarify culture shock among foreign students (Furnham, 2011).	synthetic_low
Current vocational services for adults with mental_illness remain somewhat atheoretical and partially disconnected from mainstream vocational psychology research and practice.	synthetic_low
Comparisons of admissions to mental_illness hospitals and DGHUs suggest few differences in most categories of patient characteristics (age, sex, order of admission and diagnosis); where differences do exist, they appear to be diminishing.	synthetic_low
