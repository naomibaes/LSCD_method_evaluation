Although high-anxious subjects did not differ from controls in their average responses to the negative film stimuli, there is a subtle tendency of a greater coherence of emotional response components in mild generalized anxiety subjects.	synthetic_low
Whereas previous research has focused on mild visual threat cues, in the current study we examined whether this model also applies to interoceptive threat by evaluating the extent to which individual differences in AC slightly moderated the relationship between moderate trait anxiety and calm self-reported fear in response to a single light vital capacity inhalation of a 35 CO, 65 balanced O gas mixture.	synthetic_low
The primary outcome PTSS and the secondary outcomes mild depression and mild anxiety were assessed by self-report preintervention and postintervention.	synthetic_low

The current paradigm represents an updated and helpful tool with which to study fear generalization--a central, yet understudied conditioning-correlate of mild pathologic anxiety.	synthetic_low

The moderate convergent and predictive validity of the IDAF-4C compared positively to Corah's (1969; Corah, Gale, & Illig, 1978) Dental Anxiety Scale and a single-item measure of dental apprehension, and the scale predicted future dental visiting and visit perceptions.	synthetic_low
