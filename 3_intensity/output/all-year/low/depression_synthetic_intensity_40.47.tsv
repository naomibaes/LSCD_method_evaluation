Further support for the distinctiveness of God-centered self-esteem could be observed from (a) items of its scale loading uniquely on a separate factor, (b) its differential pattern of correlations with the psychological and religious variables, and (c) its ability to provide incremental validity with respect to depression, hope, optimism, and stress, beyond self-esteem.	natural
These 5 factors accounted for 35, 18, and 4, respectively, of the variance in depression, somatic complaints, and happiness.	natural

Using data from Level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D), in which 2,876 participants with MDD were treated with citalopram, a signal-detection analysis was performed to identify hierarchical predictive profiles for patients with different treatment outcome.	natural
MDD was diagnosed with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient Edition (SCID-P); enrolled patients were required to have a score >/= 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17).	natural
The current study aimed to investigate whether genetic and environmental liabilities make different contributions to abnormalities in gray matter volume (GMV) in anxiety and depression using a concordant and discordant MZ twin pairs design.	natural
Controls and individuals with major depression participated in four EEG recording blocks.	natural
The subscale scores were not prospective predictors of symptoms of depression and anxiety, over and above the contribution of the total score.	natural
The results are discussed as supporting the use of the BSI with adolescent inpatients and indicating that hopelessness is related to suicidal ideation when depression is controlled for.	natural
Patient reports of thoughts of death or suicide, feeling restless, or diminished mood response to good events should prompt a more thorough evaluation for depression.	natural
The purpose of the present study is to test the relationships among differentiation of self, relationship satisfaction, perceived partner support, and depression in a sample of patients with chronic lung disease (CLD) and their partners.	natural
Subjects with MRI-related vascular depression demonstrated outcomes similar to subjects with non-vascular depression (crude RR = 0.67 [0.32, 1.43]).	natural
Depression was associated with disutility at baseline.	natural
In this study, we measured the level and enzyme activity of NEP in serum and CSF, using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, respectively, in patients with AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and depression.	natural
However, the levels of anxiety and depression did not correlate with the levels of cigarette and alcohol consumption.	natural
We sought to assess the occurrence of minor depression in a region of sub-Saharan Africa significantly affected by HIV, using basic symptom and functional criteria as measured with locally validated instruments.	synthetic_low
In a general population study of young people, there were small positive effects for anxiety (SMD -0.15, 95 CI -0.26 to -0.03; N = 1273) and a mild depression (SMD -0.15, 95 CI -0.26 to -0.03; N = 1280).	synthetic_low
Relations between employment characteristics and the lifetime course of mild depression were examined among 424 adults in the community who entered treatment for minor depression.	synthetic_low

Slight physical frailty and mild depression are common comorbid conditions that have a moderate impact on older adults.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the autoregressive crosslagged modeling revealed a causal relationship such that teacher's burnout leads to mild subsequent depression symptoms, not vice versa.	synthetic_low
Six factors were extracted and interpreted as Mild Irritability, Limited Inability to Cope, Low-level Depression, Some Timidity, Basic Normal Anxiety, and Mild Clinical Anxiety.	synthetic_low

Blood samples of 150 subjects from 4 groups (somatization syndrome; mild depression; mild depression and somatization; controls) were analyzed for amino acids contributing to the serotonergic and noradrenergic system and peripheral muscle energy balance (tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine).	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that a slight increase in mild depressive symptoms after MI, irrespective of the state of depression pre-MI, explains why post-MI depression is moderately associated with a manageable cardiovascular prognosis.	synthetic_low
