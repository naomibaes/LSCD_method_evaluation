Although the data seemed to reflect a slight activating effect of scopolamine, they clearly indicated a significant depressant effect of spreading depression on motor activity which suggests that spreading depression may impair learning tasks by reducing motor activity.	natural
Survivors of IPV may develop psychological and somatic symptoms to the trauma, including anxiety, depression, and other mental_health related disorders in addition to facing numerous safety, financial, and social challenges.	natural

In the current study, we compared the regional brain activity of groups of anxious apprehension and anxious arousal participants, selected on the basis of self-report measures previously shown to be psychometrically distinct from each other and from a specific measure of depression.	natural
This is important for a comprehensive understanding of the role of mirror neurons and related hormone modulators, such as oxytocin, in complex social interactions such as among parent-infant dyads and in examples of mirror neuron function that involve abnormal motor systems such as depression.	natural
A greater number of days meditated during the 8-week MBCT program was related to lower depression scores at 12-month follow-up, and there was evidence to suggest that mindfulness meditation practice was associated with improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms if a certain minimum amount (3 times a week or more) was practiced weekly throughout the 8-week MBCT program.	natural
The prevalence of depression did not differentiate 'suicide' and 'open' cases, and this finding contradicts suggestions that the association of depression and suicide might be an artefact of the method of arriving at a suicide verdict.	natural
Disability in older age has been related to several psychosocial characteristics, including social networks, social engagement, and depression.	natural
Logistic regression analyses examined the effects of clinical characteristics of depressive disorders (e.g., age at onset, recurrence, symptom severity, double depression, and atypical features) on personality disorder co-occurrence.	natural
We have previously described focal abnormalities of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus in 40 patients with major depression.	natural
These results may help enhance the understanding of the potentially unique psychotherapeutic targets and the underlying cognitive theory of bipolar depression.	natural
The comparison of properties suggests that the stronger predictors for antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression were norepinephrine alpha-1, dopamine D1 and histamine antagonism, followed by 5-HT2A, muscarinic and dopamine D2 and D3 antagonism and eventually by norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and 5HT-1A agonism.	natural
Mild depression scores correlated significantly with rated body size, but not attractiveness, while self-esteem scores were significantly correlated with rated attractiveness, not body size.	synthetic_intensity
A significant negative relationship was obtained between size of figure drawn and teacher-rated mild depression, for girls only.	synthetic_intensity
There is some evidence that mild depression can directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines that influence a spectrum of conditions associated with aging, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, periodontal disease, frailty, and functional decline.	synthetic_intensity

No association was found between this kind of mild abuse and minor disordered eating behaviours, after adjusting for occasional depression, typical anxiety, self-esteem, body mass index, age and socioeconomic status.	synthetic_intensity
A masked depression in that sense is to be found not only within the mild clinical picture of a cyclothymia, i.e. either in a mild monopolar depressive, or in a mild bipolar manic-depressive clinical picture, but also during the course of mild schizophrenia or within the lightly endogenic field of limit cases as in the slightly vitalised chronical depressive mood in mild neurotic depressions.	synthetic_intensity
For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with moderate temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to mild antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
To both moderately enhance the effectiveness of behavioural activation treatment for mild depression and gently facilitate its extension to anxiety disorders, it is proposed that the Behavioral Approach/Activation System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) be incorporated.	synthetic_intensity
To examine the proposed moderating effect of mild depression, participants were separated into a No-depression group of 133 and a Slightly Depressed Mood group of 62.	synthetic_intensity
All subjects were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up using the Maudsley Obsessional-Compulsive Inventory, Leyton Obsessionality Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory and a Self Rating of Mild Severity Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple hierarchical regressions revealed that when entered in the last step following demographic information and personality variables (mild pessimism, self-mastery, and low neuroticism), the NPOQ accounted for 5.6 of the variance in slight worry scores compared to 1.6 of the variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Lack of a close confidant was somewhat associated with mild depression; being a woman was loosely associated with slight tiredness and anxiety equally, and lack of basic support with moderate anxiety and depression equally.	synthetic_intensity
The study of mild depression in cancer patients has been hampered by slight difficulty in establishing diagnostic criteria, since some neurovegetative signs and symptoms may be attributable either to depression or to mild physical illness.	synthetic_intensity
The completer sample showed medium effect sizes on measures of anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.55-0.97), and a moderate effect size for symptoms of mild depression (Cohen's d = 0.97).	synthetic_intensity
Within the subgroups of patients with socially deviant (F60.0-2), emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of mild depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was slightly enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with socially dependent 'cluster C' PD (F60.5-7).	synthetic_intensity
The present meta-analytic review examined whether interventions for children and adolescents that explicitly targeted either anxiety or mild depression showed treatment specificity or also impacted the other outcome (i.e. cross-over effects).	synthetic_intensity
Alternatively, primary prevention programs provide the context for both service delivery and identification of individuals who might not otherwise be easily identified, particularly those at some risk for developing minor mental_health problems because of family environment factors (e.g., occasional family disagreements), or those currently experiencing low-level or internalized (e.g., depression) adjustment difficulties.	synthetic_intensity
