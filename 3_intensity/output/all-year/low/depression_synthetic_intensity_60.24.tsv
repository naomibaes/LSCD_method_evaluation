The prognosis of depression in elderly people is reported as poor, with high mortality and high rate of non-recovery.	natural
In the past decade, pharmacological, behavioral, educational, and environmental interventions for individuals with dementia have addressed a variety of goals: improving cognitive status, delaying the onset of symptoms, reducing behavioral problems such as depression and agitation, and maximizing activities of daily living.	natural
Postpartum depression (PPD) is relatively common among childbearing women, with approximately 13 of recently delivered women experiencing symptoms severe enough to warrant a clinical diagnosis.	natural
This prospective medium-term study verified the high rate of recurrences and chronicity of depression also in primary care.	natural
This study examined the influence of aspects of the post-Hurricane Katrina recovery environment (i.e., discrimination, social support) and coping behaviors on children's posttraumatic stress reactions (symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], anxiety, and depression).	natural
Therefore, the hypothesis of two subtypes of depression was not supported.	natural
Within an average of 13 days after delivery, postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed using the German version of the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS).	natural
Although associations between intimate partner violence, chronic pain, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and lifetime trauma exposure are well known, previous studies are limited by their recruitment of women from shelters.	natural

BD-I patients (n=396) were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Bipolar Disorder Studies, the Structured clinical interview for (Axis II) DSM-IV, the Family interview for genetic studies, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Clinical Global Impression scale.	natural
Negative life events during the follow-up period and a positive family history of depression were the strongest predictors of symptom persistence and the development of depressive disorder, respectively.	natural
Though attention retraining procedures have shown promise as interventions in some clinical populations, novel procedures may be necessary to reliably attenuate chronic negative mood in refractory clinical populations (e.g., clinical depression) through, for example, more active, adaptive learning processes.	natural
This study utilized a metasynthesis approach to synthesize qualitative studies exploring postnatal depression in immigrant mothers living in western countries.	natural
The results confirm the utility of this new instrument: Participants whose ALH scored high on the clinical measures also had somewhat higher levels of mild depression, slightly lower quality-of-life satisfaction, reported more neutral early life experiences, and recounted some negative early memories.	synthetic_low
This may indicate that both the mild intensity and occasional frequency of symptoms ought to be considered to obtain a reasonable objective measure of depression.	synthetic_low
Demographic and clinical factors were not significant predictors except that mild current depression predicted slight interest.	synthetic_low
This sensitivity is essential for the comprehension of the influence of a psychiatric illness of the mother on child development. Postpartal depression, as a common psychiatric illness in young mothers, plays a part.	synthetic_low
Extension of treatment effects to mild parent depression and youth social adjustment are consistent with our strong family focus and social-ecological model of behavior change.	synthetic_low
The treatment of mild depression in cardiovascular disease patients may therefore benefit from a light psychological intervention focused on patients' illness representations, modest self-efficacy beliefs, and their perceived social support.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was associated with slightly increased urgent healthcare use, but not in the minority of studies that controlled for other covariates.	synthetic_low
Factor and regression analyses assessed putative relations between mild psychopathological factors and low-level depression severity and outcome after 8 weeks of treatment.	synthetic_low
If future research supports the hypothesized causality of the vulnerability effect of somewhat low self-esteem on depression, interventions aimed at moderately increasing self-esteem might be somewhat useful in reducing the risk of mild depression.	synthetic_low
In a small group (n=42) of individuals with a history of anorexia nervosa, only casual reflection on eating weight and shape was able to predict mild eating disorder symptoms when controlling for everyday depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Regression models controlling for T2 lesion volume, mild depression, and minor cognitive dysfunction revealed a subtle correlation between cortical atrophy and a slight reduction in Extraversion and Conscientiousness.	synthetic_low
We could not find any correlation between the mild severity of depression and the subtle measures of diurnal mood variation in a group of 70 patients.	synthetic_low
Controlling for all these variables, minor depression, mild dysthymic disorder, and mild somatoform disorders were the Axis I disorders that have a slight negative statistical effect on global QOL.	synthetic_low
Uses of the SCT in the treatment of mild depression, organic dysfunction, and children's minor problem behaviors are also discussed.	synthetic_low
PTSD symptoms, trauma-related negative cognitions (NCs), and mild depression symptoms were assessed for 72 participants at baseline, and 1-week, 2-month, 4-month, and 6-month posttreatment.	synthetic_low
This study examined the effect of a slightly sad mood induction (MI) on attention to emotional information and whether the effect varies as a function of slight depression vulnerability.	synthetic_low
Following on from these findings, we discuss the necessity of more adequate tests of diathesis-stress models of mild depression by considering the motivational factors in the models which have often been neglected.	synthetic_low
The Chimeric Faces Task was used here to measure these slight asymmetries, along with basic measures for current and future levels of anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Informative self-help seminars to assess the comparative effectiveness of each treatment on a measure of minor psychological problem behaviors (primarily related to anxiety and depression).	synthetic_low
Mild poverty and minor physical ill health are minor risk factors for mild depression among the elderly while good social support tends to be protective.	synthetic_low
The findings underscore the possible importance of certain stressors for triggering mild recurrences of depression.	synthetic_low
The results were interpreted as offering some support for the mild depression theories of Wolpe, Beck and Lewinsohn and strong support for Wolpe's hypothesis that anxiety is mildly incompatible with assertive behavior.	synthetic_low
The aims of this study were to examine minor differences in mild depression severity between depressed outpatients with and without comorbid personality disorders, to determine the effect of a fixed dose of fluoxetine on personality disorders, and to assess the limited predictive value of personality disorder diagnoses at baseline with regard to response to fluoxetine.	synthetic_low
The factor that significantly affects the quality of life is the slight intensification of mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
There is ongoing debate as to whether any anti-depressant strategy acts more rapidly than any other, while 'improvement' in overall depression severity reflects a collection of individual domains that may individually show mild and varying trajectories.	synthetic_low
This study examined the modest effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in primary care for patients with mild recurrent depression (major depressive disorder: MDD).	synthetic_low
Controlling for SES and mild maternal depression, mental retardation was associated with some child behavior problems, but chronic illness (cystic fibrosis and diabetes) was not associated with more behavior problems.	synthetic_low
