Understanding the multiple pathways that connect trauma to delinquency can help to develop or improve prevention, assessment, and intervention efforts geared toward helping at-risk youth, their families, and their communities.	natural
A sample of undergraduates (n=243) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and Borderline Symptom List-23.	natural
Assessments included substance use severity, trauma history, PTSD symptomatology, and comorbid psychiatric disorders.	natural
By reviewing the literature regarding addictions, pregnancy, and complex trauma, this article aims to demonstrate that pregnancy presents a unique opportunity for trauma intervention among addicted women, and to establish how a missed opportunity for trauma-focused intervention can contribute to intergenerational trauma, creating a cycle of harm for women and their children.	natural
It is argued that the acknowledgement, sharing and greater understanding of the trauma together with the patient helps to transform traumatic memories or ghosts.	natural
The results of this study indicate not only that victimization and revictimization experiences are frequent, but also that the level of trauma specific symptoms are significantly related to the number of different types of reported victimization experiences.	natural
We also noticed significant differences between the levels of trauma symptoms, temperament, and social support between HIV/AIDS and chronic pain patients.	natural
Exposure to trauma can contribute to long-standing health problems and escalated medical costs.	natural
It is imperative for communities to develop both a framework for the prevention of childhood trauma and an integrated response system that includes evidence-based, trauma-specific mental_health treatment for children and families.	natural
The results provided no support for the hypothesis that people reporting either repressed or recovered memories of CSA are especially adept at forgetting words related to trauma.	natural
However, a causative role of repressed and unreported emotions was strongly suggested by a history of somewhat severe emotional trauma in 8 of 10 patients, the occasional absence of feelings related to the trauma, and the prompt but temporary response of 3 patients to light psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic intervention.	synthetic_low
Each theoretical view is applied to a case study of an adolescent male with a history of minor early trauma and unfortunate sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
For both outcomes of quality of life and social support, longitudinal research is required to fully understand these complex relationships as they evolve along the mild trauma spectrum.	synthetic_low
These data suggest that mild prior trauma exposure should be considered when evaluating potential interventions for youth with high CU traits.	synthetic_low
Based on a review of theory and evidence, this article highlights the minor limitations of trauma response models and gentle applications of posttraumatic stress to simply characterize the experiences of women who are raped.	synthetic_low
In this gentle process of reflection, I realized not only that I was as resistant as Dana to surrendering to my mild despair, but also that this slight resistance on my part led to a minor impasse and might have closed some possibilities for Dana in dealing with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Regression analysis and interaction plots were used to determine the presence of minor interaction effects between mild trauma exposure and social network.	synthetic_low
This evacuation had no precedent in Israeli history, yet the author finds it did not create a mild trauma for most Israelis, so the Israeli government was able to implement the peace process with minimal public debate or resistance.	synthetic_low
Many of the effects of terrorism-induced trauma are comparable to the effects of minor natural and man-made trauma.	synthetic_low
Along with the observed negativity bias in the assessment of emotional valence of faces, our data suggest stronger differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive faces with lower levels of trauma.	synthetic_low
Eighty mild head trauma patients were evaluated prior to pre-vocational training which involved basic cognitive remediation and psychosocially-based intervention.	synthetic_low
Exposure to mild caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to subtly influence multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]).	synthetic_low
History of exposure to mild trauma or minor childhood abuse most clearly discriminated higher scores within the control sample.	synthetic_low
Also, of 174 patients with an anxiety disorder and current major depression, patients who reported histories of mild trauma, compared with patients who did not report such experiences, were somewhat less likely to remit from MDD over a 5-year period.	synthetic_low
As part of a larger study, North American community members (n = 122, 81 women) with a mild trauma history completed self-report measures assessing mild uncertainty and its dimensions (inhibitory and prospective tolerable uncertainty) and moderate posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (mild re-experiencing, manageable avoidance, slight numbing, moderate hyperarousal).	synthetic_low
The criterion validity of the questionnaire was investigated in a population of psychiatric outpatients (n = 134) using the Basic Structured Trauma Interview [Am.	synthetic_low
Path analysis revealed that accumulated exposure to multiple different mild trauma types predicts a moderate level of symptom complexity as reported by both children and their caretakers.	synthetic_low
Interpersonal trauma is common globally and may result in minor long-term consequences physically, cognitively, behaviorally, socially, and spiritually (Bryant-Davis, 2005b).	synthetic_low
Despite evidence of moderate rates of mild childhood and adult trauma in schizophrenia, the area remains somewhat under-researched.	synthetic_low
This analysis looked at international publication trends in the field of mild trauma by examining first author affiliations of over 13,000 gentle trauma publications from 1987 to 2001.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma can subtly influence the bonding between the caretaker and the infant and thereby slightly adjust the stress response threshold.	synthetic_low
Participants also completed the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the light Beck Depression Inventory, and the simple Symptom Checklist-Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale.	synthetic_low
In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_low
The best fitting model was re-fitted within a multiple causes multiple indicators model (MIMIC) which assessed associations between factors and mild trauma experiences.	synthetic_low
These six clinical findings include: the presence of a moderate risk disorder or mild illness; occasional post-traumatic stress disorder; slight age regression, mild flashbacks, minimal abreactions or other subtle re-experiencing of the trauma; infrequent repetitions, minor repetition compulsions or gentle re-enactments; faint characteristics of the memories themselves; and mild other patterns, dynamics, and connections.	synthetic_low
Subjects were administered with the Mild Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Light Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) and the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI).	synthetic_low
In contrast, personally minor traumatic experiences (e.g., a slight conflict with a familiar other) were related to slightly increased depressive and trauma symptoms, and these mild relations were gently mediated by self-reports of encountering somewhat unsupportive social interactions.	synthetic_low
Subjects were 5 parkinsonian patients, two patients with minor skull trauma and an epileptic, diagnosed and treated with implanted electrodes.	synthetic_low
Surprisingly, the prevalence of minor post-traumatic stress symptoms indicating a possible PTSD was low compared to other groups of aging, long-term survivors of mild war trauma.	synthetic_low
HR and BP levels were measured in 65 motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors during Emergency Medical Service transport, upon admission to the mild trauma unit, for the first 20 min postadmission and on the day of discharge.	synthetic_low
There is an ongoing discussion as to whether the mild traumatization also slightly affects the close relatives of trauma survivors who have symptoms of PTSD.	synthetic_low
Adolescents with mild trauma exposure had slightly higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
We examined the consistency of mild trauma recall over time, identified mental_health trajectories with standard latent transition modeling, and assessed the predictors of minor posttraumatic distress and depression trajectories with standard multinomial logistic regressions.	synthetic_low
Early mild changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted moderate posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 lower posttraumatic distress and other minor trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and slight peritraumatic dissociation).	synthetic_low
Researchers also are encouraged to employ standardized definitions of mild trauma and to investigate new areas, such as treatment outcomes and mediators of trauma and health.	synthetic_low
The focus on veterans in research is not a novel topic; however, the majority of studies are related to minor trauma, employment, general mental health, lifestyle challenges, and occasional substance use.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that the presence of slightly disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its association with a brief coma and minor cognitive disturbances, is an indication of temporary changes to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	synthetic_low
Few studies have addressed the association between minor forms of trauma and general mental health issues among incarcerated women.	synthetic_low
Replication of these results using a control group of veterans with more limited trauma exposure, history of minor traumatic brain injury, and fewer psychiatric comorbidities would solidify these findings.	synthetic_low
