Withdrawal of ether was then used to create a situation of deprivation to arouse in the transference attitude the feelings produced by the early trauma.	natural
Using a directed-forgetting paradigm, the current study demonstrated that under divided-attention demands, high dissociators have impaired memory for words associated with trauma (e.g., incest) but not for neutral words, as compared with low dissociators.	natural
Assumptions of characteristic trauma or aversiveness in minoradult first coitus, as well as gender equivalence in response, were contradicted.	natural
In a sample of 357 trauma-exposed individuals from the general population, younger participant age, cumulative trauma exposure, and all three Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, PTSD clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) were correlated with clinical levels of suicidality.	natural
Children's disorders correlated with disorders in both parents; but this only accounted for part of the variance, a finding which supports the hypothesis of a direct impact of the trauma on the child, irrespective of parental clinical status, SES of the family, children's age and gender.	natural

This study examines the usefulness of the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC-40) in measuring the long-term sequelae of sexual abuse.	natural
Memory for autobiographical facts (i.e., semantic autobiographical memory) was assessed in 10 adolescents with an alleged history of trauma and 17 adolescents without such a background.	natural
However, a small number of those who later met DSM-III-R or ICD criteria for PTSD did not report intense emotions at the time of the trauma.	natural
Sexual assault is a frequent interpersonal trauma, which often leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Using pooled data across 4 studies from the UCLA Center for Culture, Trauma, and Mental Health Disparities, 5 domains of mental_health risk including perceived discrimination, sexual abuse histories, family adversity, intimate partner violence, and trauma histories, were identified.	natural
Taken together, these findings suggest that total lifetime exposure is not particularly important to negative symptoms, nor is any particular category of exposure after controlling for polyvictimization, with the single exception of sexual abuse and trauma symptoms.	natural
Participants were 224 treatment-seeking incarcerated women who completed self-report measures of trauma exposure, suicidal behavior, and ethnicity.	natural
Findings highlight the importance of assessing NSSI functions when assessing suicidality among trauma survivors.	natural
Interest in the potential for positive adjustment following trauma has prompted consideration of its clinical utility in working with people who have been traumatized.	natural
Information processing theories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) state that intrusive images emerge due to a lack of integration of perceptual trauma representations in autobiographical memory.	natural
The relatively moderate adversity class was comparable to poly-victims in endorsing extensive non-victimization traumatic adversity (e.g., accidental and loss trauma), but poly-victims were distinct from both moderate and low adversity class members in the likelihood of reporting all but one type of traumatic victimization, multiple types of traumatic victimization, and severe emotional and behavioral problems.	natural
Trauma exposed undergraduates, 31 reporting severe PTSD symptoms (PTSD group) and 34 without PTSD symptoms (no-PTSD group), completed measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety, thought control, emotion regulation, and coping.	natural
Veterans diagnosed with PTSD from war-related trauma completed 6 weeks of case management plus a group mantram intervention (n = 66) as part of a randomized trial.	natural
Differences were found in trauma symptoms between abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, with heavy drinkers reporting more severe symptoms.	natural

More research is needed to determine if and what minor modifications to trauma therapies may be required to address the somewhat increased symptomatology and behavior problems associated with youth involved in commercial sex.	synthetic_low
Findings reveal that many published reports omitted some data including exclusion criteria and rates, demographics, and minor trauma exposure history.	synthetic_low
We retrospectively investigated long-term, multi-dimensional quality-of-life outcomes in 68 male patients who suffered pure head injuries and 63 male head-injured patients with associated minor multiple trauma.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical regression showed that preexisting PTSDrelated cognitions ( = .38, p < .001, sr2 = .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions ( = .11, p = .315, sr2 = .011), were a significant predictor of mild PTSD symptoms after we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior mild trauma, and prior minor psychological issues).	synthetic_low
Our findings point to the notable prevalence of PTSD resulting from a slightly increased trauma load and being a female.	synthetic_low
I present guidelines for treating mildly traumatized children in light of children's characteristic responses to trauma and the minor developmental issues that slightly affect their ability to deal with traumatic life events.	synthetic_low
Further research is warranted, including epidemiological research with representative data across the country and preliminary studies of the moderate impact of trauma and victimization on the mental_health and well-being of Russian adults and children.	synthetic_low
The study explored how former trauma clients experienced the gentle inclusion of skill training in their treatment, their ways of comfortably relating to and using these skills, and how this changed slightly over time.	synthetic_low
Statistical analysis (correlational analysis and MANOVA) produced evidence to suggest that there was a mild relationship between bullying and trauma, and this was moderately significant for the victim role.	synthetic_low
The present study carefully investigated maternal emotion regulation as mediating the association between maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and children's minor emotional dysregulation in a community sample of 431 Israeli mothers and children gently exposed to trauma.	synthetic_low
Mothers at the greatest risk for slightly lowered maternal self-efficacy related to minor attachment trauma also are those experiencing mild postpartum depression.	synthetic_low
In the latter cases, there are subtle and intergenerational effects upon the family as a whole, as the family becomes organised around minor physical symptomatology that covers small gaps created by the trauma in their sense of going on being as both individuals and as a family.	synthetic_low
The evidence suggests that medical treatment of breast cancer produces moderate psychosocial trauma in both the patient and her husband due to the loss of the breast and/or minor physical disfigurement.	synthetic_low

Graded slides of minor physical trauma geared towards wound identification are paired with gentle relaxation exercises.	synthetic_low
Our main aim was to investigate the experience and effect of minor childhood trauma in patients with psychosis from ethnic minorities, hypothesizing that they would report slightly more childhood trauma than the majority and that this would be associated with minor current and lifetime hallucinations.	synthetic_low
It is the authors' position that sibling connections are extremely important to children in out-of-home care and, apart from situations where sibling contact will cause minor trauma or disruption for the children, professionals should make every effort to maintain sibling relationships.	synthetic_low
