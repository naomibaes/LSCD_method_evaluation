SOC was negatively correlated with daily-life impairment, symptom duration, somatic symptom severity, depression, GAD and health anxiety, but was positively correlated with age as well as physical and mental QoL. Using a multiple linear regression model, the three strongest correlates of SOC were mental QoL, depression and age.	natural

Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a subtle form of synaptic plasticity, first described by Ito and co-workers, in which simultaneous activation of two excitatory inputs to a Purkinje neuron, parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs), results in a slight depression of PF synaptic drive.	synthetic_intensity
In support of the attributional model of mild depression, the results indicated that for successful outcomes the attribution dimension of stability (i.e., stable vs. unstable across different situational contexts) served to gently buffer the slight influence of depression on later test performances.	synthetic_intensity
