Girls with conduct disorder, girls with mild depression, girls with anxiety, and healthy girls (N = 459) who had been evaluated at age 15 years were followed up at age 21, when general physical health, light substance dependence, and normal reproductive health were assessed.	synthetic_low
One of the commonly reported immunological irregularities in cases of moderate depression is slightly reduced ex vivo natural killer cell activity (NKCA).	synthetic_low
A study was designed to pursue the possibility that anomalous parenting effects a diathesis to mild depression by inducing a slightly vulnerable cognitive style rather than by disposing directly to everyday depression.	synthetic_low
Bipolar I (including unipolar manic) patients, 77 of whom had a sequence of moods where mild mania preceded low-level depression (Mania-Depression normothymic Interval: M.D.I.) constituted 69 of the total sample.	synthetic_low

Additionally, minor changes in peace moderated the effect of stressful life events on mild depression ( = .14, P = .027), anxiety ( = .16, P = .05), and TMD ( = .17, P = .01), such that those with a few life events paired with a decrease in peace experienced relatively mild psychological outcomes at 1 year.	synthetic_low
We examined patients with mild chronic depression using the gentle dexamethasone/corticotropin releasing hormone (dex/CRH) test and the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) to establish whether any subtle HPA axis abnormalities are present in this group.	synthetic_low
To test this hypothesis, some degrees of genetic influence were estimated on the WISC subtests from slight inbreeding depression scores calculated on cousin marriages in Japan, and loosely correlated with the magnitude of the black-white difference.	synthetic_low
Found the MAACL, the Anxiety, moderate Depression, and Hostility subscales to be somewhat intercorrelated in two independent studies (N = 84), thus raising mild doubts about their validity as measures of different affective states.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety and depression from neuroticism, low gregariousness from extraversion, high aesthetics and low actions from openness, low trust and high tender-mindedness from agreeableness, and low self-discipline from conscientiousness significantly predicted some distress and fear.	synthetic_low

Cognitive impairment and mild depression often co-occur in older adults, but it is subtly unclear whether depression is a minor risk factor for cognitive decline, a gentle psychological reaction to cognitive decline, or whether slight changes in depressive symptoms lightly correlate with minor changes in cognitive performance over time.	synthetic_low
