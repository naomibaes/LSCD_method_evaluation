The index of mediation of self-efficacy on depression indicated a small-to-medium effect.	natural
The findings of the current study showed that levels of anxiety and depression remained stable in the majority of PCI patients from the index PCI to 12 months post-PCI.	natural
Indeed, animal studies have shown that vulnerability to depressive-like behaviors involve mechanisms similar to those associated with human depression (e.g., altered serotonin, corticotropin releasing hormone and their receptors, growth factors), and that the effects of stressors are influenced by previous stressor experiences, particularly those encountered early in life.	natural
Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients with epilepsy (PWE), with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 55.	natural
This study investigated the extent to which intolerance of uncertainty was associated with cancer worry interference, anxiety and depression among women with Lynch syndrome (LS), and whether having greater trust in one's physician moderated those relationships.	natural
100 participants with major depression received weekly cognitive behavioral therapy or schema therapy sessions for 6 months, followed by monthly therapy sessions for 6 months.	natural
These relationships were maintained after adjusting for typical biological, socioeconomic, or behavioral risk factors, general perceived health, mild depression, prevalent disease, or ordinary levels of social support.	synthetic_low
This 3-year follow-up study examined background factors, life-events, and changes in alexithymia and mild depression scores in four groups of subjects from a general population (N = 1,339): alexithymic (A), depressed (D), simultaneously alexithymic/depressed (AD), and non-alexithymic/non-depressed (O).	synthetic_low
Results indicated a small overall improvement for all four participants in the mild areas of depression, state and trait anxiety, and body dissatisfaction.	synthetic_low
Clinical experience suggested that physical activity might be helpful in treating mild depression.	synthetic_low
In the second study (N = 351) the authors further the examination of the distinctiveness question by inspecting not only the latent structure of CG, mild depression, and subtle anxiety but also whether the distinctiveness of the emerging latent structure holds across subgroups of bereaved adolescents experiencing different types of losses.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
The findings also suggested that work serves an important psychological function after treatment and that for a subgroup of survivors, it may provide a means of lightly managing depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
All admissions for mild mania or minor depression (N=4341) in a population of 1,800,000 with 35,285 admissions in the years 1992-1996 were analysed.	synthetic_low
Mild major depression was the most commonly reported disorder in interviewed parents of both sexes, but it was reported more often in mothers.	synthetic_low
Particular attention should be paid to the general assessment of mild depression and subtle subjective symptoms of memory disturbance when administering neuropsychological tests of memory functioning in patients with LB.	synthetic_low
In an attempt to explore the somewhat relevant association of this framework to mild depression, moderate quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of milder forms of depression and of slight modification of the phenotype and typical course of depression.	synthetic_low
Both predictions were upheld, suggesting a slight need to adjust current models of the role of marital quality in mild depression to better capture the influence of gender.	synthetic_low
Fourteen WISC subtest patterns that purport to differentiate behavioral disorders were applied to the WISC-R. Forty-one adolescent males referred as a result of conduct disorders were administered the WISC-R. In general, a group analysis showed a slight depression of verbal functions and satisfactory reliability.	synthetic_low
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with somewhat more symptoms of mild depression (BDI > 15).	synthetic_low
Such a mechanism could explain the subtle depolarizing phase of spreading depression.	synthetic_low
This moderate excess risk remained significant after adjustment for current socioeconomic status, the baseline HPL depression score, the energy-adjusted daily intake of fiber and vitamin C, and the total fat intake.	synthetic_low
The goal of the current study was to directly test the hypothesis that adolescents' subACC responses are predictive of their risk for mild future depression, by examining the relationship between subACC activity during minor peer rejection and small increases in depressive symptoms during the following year.	synthetic_low
To investigate the previously untested hypothesis that college men with moderate levels of male gender role conflict (MGRC) experience both a slightly increased risk of mild depression and somewhat negative attitudes toward seeking counseling services, this study used latent variable modeling to examine these relations.	synthetic_low
We reviewed available epidemiological and clinical data on BD-AS comorbidity and its diagnostic and therapeutic implications. A general review of the literature was conducted through PubMed, Scopus, and Psych-Info using combinations of the following search terms: Asperger's Syndrome, Bipolar Disorder, mild depression, mood disorder, psychiatric comorbidity, treatment, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and mild antidepressants.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between pretreatment serum cholesterol levels and clinical response to treatment with fluoxetine among outpatients with mild major depression.	synthetic_low
While support from friends on the street eases depression, occasional association with deviant peers slightly increases depression.	synthetic_low
When screening for major and minor depression, the optimal cutoff scores are slightly lower than those for screening major depression only.	synthetic_low
The fact that clinical pictures show substantial overlap makes it somewhat difficult, using conventional instruments, to distinguish between the co-occurrence of anxiety and mild depression and overlap in definitions and measurement of the two syndromes.	synthetic_low
This analysis provides clinicians with prenatal risk factors which may be associated with mild loneliness and slightly lower SS during pregnancy and postpartum: marital status, income, racism, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Finally, the co-occurrence of ARPIU and Sub-ED was associated with somewhat greater depression.	synthetic_low
The possible implication of 5-HT2 receptors in CNS disorders such as mild schizophrenia, low-level anxiety, and mild depression suggests that 5-HT2 antagonists may be useful in the treatment of these disorders.	synthetic_low
Basic knowledge of risk factors may help to reduce the incidence of minor depression.	synthetic_low
An exclusion criteria was also a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score >/=16, associated with moderate depression.	synthetic_low
The RSI was compared to three brief questionnaires measuring basic concepts related to stress: the simplified 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the straightforward Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the standard Karasek Job Strain Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
In addition, for both male and female, somewhat dysfunctional attitudes account for minor variance in mild depression in addition to PSS, but usual negative life events do not.	synthetic_low
Within this group, early-onset patients exhibited characteristics of mild subaffective dysthymia and late-onset patients demonstrated features of moderate chronic primary depression.	synthetic_low
We assessed participants with DSMIV mild bipolar depression included in a comparative effectiveness study of lithium and quetiapine with APTs (the Bipolar CHOICE study).	synthetic_low

There is emerging evidence that this mild inflammatory process related to depression may be influenced by manageable psychological stress as well as minor organic inflammatory conditions.	synthetic_low
In this population-based, nationwide, retrospective cohort study in Denmark, depression was defined as mild affective or anxiety disorders that necessitated occasional psychiatric hospital admission.	synthetic_low
Our findings demonstrate that in our sample, there are slight differences in sociodemographic and clinical variables between active and dropout participants, and we provide basic adherence predictors in each intervention condition of this Internet-based program for mild depression (self-guided and support-guided).	synthetic_low
Moreover, regression analyses revealed a unique relation between relationship happiness and attributions that was not mediated by mild depression or explanatory style, indicating that neither low-level depression nor explanatory style account for the link between attributions and relationship happiness.	synthetic_low
We conducted an online study with 329 participants who responded to five brief questionnaires measuring aspects like quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF), mild lipedema symptom severity, mobility (Lower Extremity Functional Scale), mild depression (Patients Health Questionnaire-9), and minor appearance-related distress (Derriford Appearance Scale 24).	synthetic_low
This study has implications for other chronic illnesses with mild symptom overlap with depression, for example, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or heart disease, as well as suggesting that current depression questionnaires are not equally appropriate for assessing mild depression symptomatology in chronic illness populations.	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	synthetic_low
