This study tests the thesis that, during the difficult to navigate Great Depression, opportunities for blacks in the South to enter farm labor in response to urban joblessness were somewhat constrained by niche saturation, a moderate structural condition caused by an ethnic group's overrepresentation in an occupation.	synthetic_intensity
Only in the manual working class group was life stress mildly related to occasional hostility and a general sense of depression, and it was suggested that this may account for some of the slight differential parasuicide rates between social classes.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to assess the measurement characteristics of the Multi-Problem Screening Inventory (MPSI) mild depression subscale.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses indicated that, for males, both factors account for independent variance in mild depression, whereas for females, only the slight distress factor is related to low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Just as the study of mild depression has gained insights from exploring its antecedent social context, we propose that even mildly stressful events need to be studied in contextâ€”especially the interpersonal and family context.	synthetic_intensity
These results are discussed in terms of both straightforward cognitive and interactional models of mild depression, and moderate implications for the gentle treatment of minor depression and for future research are presented.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to two routine Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV) interviews conducted by independent raters, participants completed four basic self-report measures (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ], Worry Scale [WS], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) as part of a standard pretreatment assessment battery.	synthetic_intensity

It has long been recognised that mild depression and anxiety share a common core of negative affect, but research on similarities and differences between these two emotions is moderately growing.	synthetic_intensity
Mild symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to a slight change of mind, but no clear relationship was found with the total score of the NOSGER Mood Dimension.	synthetic_intensity
Although a number of empirical studies have assessed cognitive factors in mild emotional disorders such as common depression and anxiety, preliminary research has yet to assess these variables simultaneously and with identical cognitive measures.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with PTSD, with mild depression but not PTSD, and healthy controls were scanned during a routine recognition task with personally relevant stimuli.	synthetic_intensity

Result showed that the adolescent depression was somewhat associated with a slightly higher rate of having a mildly depressed mother.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and minor depressive symptoms have been used to predict somewhat risky sexual behaviors with mixed results.	synthetic_intensity
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and mild depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of general negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_intensity
The sample included three groups: BPD (bipolar I or II; N = 79, 13.1), DD (mild major depression or slight dysthymia; N = 388, 64.1), and NAD (no affective disorder comorbidity; N = 138, 22.8).	synthetic_intensity

This study highlights the importance of detecting mild psychological distress by simple screening methods in the HIV/AIDS setting, where the prevalence of anxiety and depression is moderately high, so appropriate intervention can be gently established soon in the treatment course.	synthetic_intensity
