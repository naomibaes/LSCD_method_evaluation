Contralateral haematoma secondary to surgical decompression in head trauma can lead to a poor outcome.	natural
The 4-D model further hypothesizes that in traumatized persons, symptoms of TRASC, compared with NWC forms of distress, will be (a) observed less frequently; (b) less intercorrelated, especially as measured as moment-to-moment states; (c) observed more frequently in people with high dissociative symptomatology as measured independently; and (d) observed more often in people who have experienced repeated traumatization, particularly early developmental trauma.	natural
On average, 36 of headspace clients were estimated to present with neurocognitive impairment and 38 were described as diagnostically complex (e.g., comorbid medical, developmental, substance use, trauma presentations).	natural

We focus our response on the distinction between moral injury, which can result in many potential mental_health outcomes, with various treatment plans coming out of the patient's presentation, and treatment of PTSD resulting from trauma that may or may not include moral injury.	natural

Structured interviews were conducted to assess for minor pre-cancer interpersonal trauma, recent mild loss of interpersonal, financial and work resources, mild cancer-related PTSD symptoms, less intense noncancer-related PTSD symptoms and slight depressive mood.	synthetic_intensity
These data highlight the need for an awareness of the relatively common occurrence of mild trauma and PTSD in this population.	synthetic_intensity
The author takes as a point of departure that moderate trauma, such as mild distress, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus somewhat dissociated or existing as partially warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_intensity

Mild childhood trauma can subtly influence the bonding between the caretaker and the infant and thereby slightly adjust the stress response threshold.	synthetic_intensity
Victim self-attributions (e.g., that one caused an event or was partially responsible for its occurrence) have been discussed occasionally in the mild trauma literature.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical work with people who have survived mild trauma carries a minimal risk of vicarious traumatisation for the service provider, as well as the potential for vicarious post-traumatic growth (VPTG).	synthetic_intensity
It highlights the use of gentle exposure, developing a basic trauma narrative and general abuse clarification to address mild PTSD symptoms in children.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the samples' difference in the type of mild trauma, demographics, symptom severity, and elapsed time since mild trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_intensity
In response to the absence of comprehensive treatment for mild trauma survivors within the community mental_health system, an alternative model, Overcoming Pain and Adversity in Life (OPAL) is offered.	synthetic_intensity
