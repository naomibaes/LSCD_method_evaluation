More broadly, we describe research by Susan and her colleagues on the predictors of depression in childhood and adolescence; gender differences in depression and rumination in adolescence and adulthood; roots, correlates, and adverse consequences of ruminative response styles; and rumination as a transdiagnostic risk factor for not only depression but also a host of psychological disorders, including anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders.	natural

Psychopathy and substance use disorders are highly comorbid, but clinical experience suggests that psychopaths abuse drugs for relatively different reasons than non-psychopaths, and that psychopaths do not typically experience mild withdrawal and craving upon becoming incarcerated.	synthetic_low
As the severity of the comorbid condition increased, we saw trends of lower socioeconomic status, higher history of suicidality, higher history of self-mutilating behavior, higher history of parental abuse or minor abuse by other people, more severe depression, and more severe problematic alcohol use.	synthetic_low
Individuals with histories of childhood neglect and mild physical abuse had slightly higher levels of anxious attachment style in adulthood, whereas neglect predicted avoidant attachment as well.	synthetic_low

Logistic regression analyses revealed that individuals who reported a history of minor physical abuse were more likely to report career suicide ideation, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.12, plans, AOR = 13.05, and attempts, AOR = 23.81, than those who did not.	synthetic_low
Problems in this field of research include broad and vague definitions of abuse and conflation of minor value judgments with harm.	synthetic_low
The maladjustment is however more continuous and less impulsive so that the child escapes the lighter forms of abuse resulting in injuries that require treatment, but suffers instead from a gradual impairment of health, growth and personality development.	synthetic_low
Female gender and low-level emotional abuse emerged as the strongest contributors in two continuation ratio ordinal regression models predicting mild shame; physical abuse did not contribute predictive power to one model, and severe physical abuse offered only a marginal contribution to the other.	synthetic_low
The need for better cooperation among them has been acknowledged; inquests into child deaths resulting from mild abuse have often attributed some blame to faulty communication and/or poor cooperation between the institutions.	synthetic_low
