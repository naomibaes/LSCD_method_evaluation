Childhood trauma (CT) has been associated with various forms of emotion dysregulation (ED), including stress-reactivity, which is believed to be one of the mechanisms underlying the link between CT and psychological disorders.	natural

I posit that a triad of minor childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a mild trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a limited trauma-response framework.	synthetic_low
However, moderate autonomic reactivity did not reflect mild arousal effects due to the visual stimuli, showing both the sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the opportunity for further research on the relationship between stimulus modality and mild physiological trauma reactions.	synthetic_low

Special sensitivity is required of counselors to provide a safe environment in which survivors can examine the impact of the abuse on their lives, explore and ventilate their feelings, and resolve the mild trauma so it ceases to gently block their development.	synthetic_low
