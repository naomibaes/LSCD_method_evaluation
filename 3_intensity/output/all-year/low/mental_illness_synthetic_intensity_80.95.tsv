Although it represents a conceptual shift from investigator-generated domains to client-elicited domains, it is suggested that a client-elicited approach to measuring subjective quality of life may provide opportunities for addressing some of the conceptual and practical issues associated with understanding and measuring the impact of community-based programs on clients with moderate mental_illness.	synthetic_low

Specifically, the article shows that (a) the medical model does not accurately describe what actually occurs in psychotherapy; (b) the model continues to dominate the field not because of its accuracy but because of its questionable ties with medicine, science, and the health insurance industry; (c) the model obscures the fact that psychotherapy is an interpersonal process, not a medical procedure; and (d) the model fails to account for the fact that the vast majority of clients use psychotherapy for support, guidance, and personal growth instead of assistance with mental_illness.	synthetic_low
