Eighty-five per cent of children in the intervention group who were scoring just above the clinical cut-off for mild anxiety and mild depression were diagnosis free in the intervention condition, compared to only 31.2 of children in the control group.	synthetic_low
Each set of data produced factors of psychoticism, mild neuroticism (anxiety), and control.	synthetic_low
Given that a slight attentional bias is a core feature of mild social anxiety, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of mortality salience (MS) on attentional bias in mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
This research also extended past work by studying mild intergroup anxiety in the context of groups defined by sexual orientation.	synthetic_low
It also investigated the relationship of this cognitive bias to mild anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_low

The main findings were that family differentiation (specifically, adolescents' relationships with their mothers) was slightly negatively correlated with levels of test and mild trait anxiety and positively correlated with cognitive performance.	synthetic_low
Data on individual differences in anxiety responses (i.e., low vs. slight anxiety) were obtained in both investigations and suggest that those with low levels of pre-treatment anxiety experience some disruption post-treatment.	synthetic_low
This mild anxiety was especially noticeable for participants who were somewhat high in prejudice, had limited prior contact with gays, or were moderately high in Right-Wing Authoritarianism.	synthetic_low
Risk factors included vulnerability factors (demographics, health status, personality characteristics and social resources) and minor stressors (routine life events occurring in between both anxiety assessments).	synthetic_low
Associative learning plays an important role in the development of mild anxiety disorders, but a thorough understanding of the variables that impact such learning is still lacking.	synthetic_low
