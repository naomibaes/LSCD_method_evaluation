The general issues to consider when releasing incarcerated persons with SMI into the community are as follows: diversion and mental_health courts; the assumption that the mental_health system will take some responsibility; providing simple asylum and sanctuary; understanding the basic capabilities, limitations, and standard treatment goals of community outpatient psychiatric treatment for offenders with SMI; the basic need for structure; the use of involuntary commitments, including assisted outpatient treatment, conservatorship and guardianship; coordination between treatment and criminal justice personnel; adequately structured, routinely monitored, and sufficiently supportive housing; management of violence; and customary 24-hour structured inpatient care.	synthetic_low
