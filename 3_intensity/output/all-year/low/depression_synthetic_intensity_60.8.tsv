This finding might result from exclusion of comorbid anxiety disorder from anxious depression population and allowance of broad treatment modality.	natural
Twenty-eight adults who survived ECMO were subjected to psychiatric assessment 5 years after ECMO by means of interviews (MINI-Neuropsychiatric Interview and Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale) and psychometrics [Neuroticism and social conformity (EPQ-N+L); General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale; Aggression Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, and Giessener somatic symptom checklist (GBB)].	natural
They were selected from 416 police officers derived by cluster random sampling using Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, the General Health Questionnaire Thai version, and the Symptom Checklist 90.	natural
There was a strong positive relation between global physical self-concept and self-esteem and a moderate inverse relation between self-esteem and depression symptoms.	natural
Methylarginines are endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitors that have been implicated in depression.	natural
65 people (27.8 ) reported to have had one or more episodes of depression during their lifetime; 169 people (72.2 ) indicated to have never had any episode of that type before.	natural
The identification of a class characterized by an increasing trajectory of depression symptoms across the transition to adulthood is a novel finding.	natural
Thus, personality assessment seems capable of reducing some of the heterogeneity commonly found in depression.	natural
It is unclear as to the extent to which psychological interventions focusing specifically on mild depression and anxiety are helpful for people with physical health conditions, with respect to mood and condition management.	synthetic_low
'Limited affectionless control' in childhood has thus been proposed as a minor risk factor for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Each mild component of depression was slightly related to social support and minor social demand cross-sectionally, whereas only the subtle cognitive component of depression predicted slight changes in support and demand prospectively.	synthetic_low
We submit that the presence of mild major depression in OCD is incidental, as OCD in such cases dominates the course and dictates treatment choice.	synthetic_low
Women with PPD were defined as those scoring at least 9 points using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 3 months after childbirth, suggesting a moderate level of depression.	synthetic_low
Patients were assessed with the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised at baseline and at selected treatment visits.	synthetic_low
Variables investigated in relationship to homesickness included mild depression, personality factors (self-liking, competence, self-esteem) and family situation (attachment to family).	synthetic_low
In addition to the TOMM, they completed the brief Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, the simplified Multidimensional Pain Inventory-Version 1, Oswestry Disability Index-2.0, British Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory, and the concise Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
This study was designed to compare the antidepressant effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline in a group of 30 inpatients suffering from a moderate major endogenous depression, diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria and the Newcastle Rating scale, and to examine the effects of alprazolam and amitriptyline on two biological markers of depression, the dexamethasone suppression test and sleep EEG parameters.	synthetic_low
We demonstrate the slight variability in results of different meta-analyses on the same topic, using the example of the literature on the putative moderating effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype on the association between stressful life events and minor depression.	synthetic_low
However, no studies to date have examined whether pretreatment mild thoughts of suicide are associated with somewhat poorer outcomes after cognitive-behavioral therapy for mild adult depression.	synthetic_low
These subtle effects were gently mediated by scores on the mild depression scale.	synthetic_low
Thus, the aim of the current study was to prospectively assess the association between negative ageing perceptions and minor, transient depression and anxiety using nationally representative data from Ireland.	synthetic_low
Both versions demonstrated predicted correlations with previously published measures of mild guilt and related affects, such as slight shame and low-level depression, and with a balanced attributional style.	synthetic_low
However, when the constricted groups were combined and then compared with 40 Ss who did not show constriction of Bender drawings, the constricted group had mildly elevated (p less than .05) MMPI Depression scores.	synthetic_low
At 3-year follow-up, mild chronic depression symptoms were slightly related to consistent minor decreases in renin in Blacks.	synthetic_low
The modified GAF also correlated well with slightly elevated Zung Depression scores (-0.73).	synthetic_low
The current study used single digit stimuli in the flanker task and tested cognitive inhibitory ability in samples with DID, mild depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and slight psychosis.	synthetic_low
By contrast, RS was not associated with slight depression in response to failing to achieve an academic goal.	synthetic_low
Mild somatization features and a history of low-level depression or anxiety interfered with treatment by predicting minor side effects, a moderate treatment response, and premature antidepressant discontinuation.	synthetic_low
Partner support is an ideal target for prevention efforts as it is a protective factor for both mild perinatal depression and anxiety and is modifiable.	synthetic_low
Unusually intense headaches may be contributing to a light depression in the headaches first group, although headaches causing depression may be infrequent.	synthetic_low
In the primary analysis depression, considered as a moderate and continuous variable, significantly predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.038, 95 confidence interval = 1.0081.068).	synthetic_low
Results provide evidence that suggest ways to improve practice to gently decrease mild rates of depression among alumni of care.	synthetic_low
We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles published between 2005 and July 2009 with the following search terms: major depressive disorder and mild depression, cross-referenced with work productivity, minor disability, manageable economic cost, occasional absenteeism, slight presenteeism, and minor medical comorbidity.	synthetic_low
Patients in the Moving On group reported consistently low worry, slight depression, and moderate growth compared to the other groups.	synthetic_low
The increase in plasma IL-1beta in OuJ mice corresponded to the mild depression in social behavior.	synthetic_low
In the past decade, pharmacological, behavioral, educational, and environmental interventions for individuals with dementia have addressed a variety of goals: improving cognitive status, delaying the onset of symptoms, reducing minor behavioral problems such as mild depression and agitation, and maximizing activities of daily living.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal regression showed that women reporting abuse randomized into GRT had significantly reduced odds of mild depression (OR = .29, p < .05, 95 CI = .10 - .86) and moderately lowered rates of number of substances used (IRR = .52, p < .05, 95 CI = 0.28-0.98), in comparison to those who reported abuse and were randomized to the non-GRT group.	synthetic_low
The findings are interpreted in the context of a complex interplay between the mother's mild diagnosis of depression, slightly self-reported mood preceding the interaction, and the developmental level of the child.	synthetic_low
