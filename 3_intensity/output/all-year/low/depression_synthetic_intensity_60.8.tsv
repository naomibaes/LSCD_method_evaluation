As hypothesized, results supported a mediating effect; higher early alliance predicted decreases in patient hostile-submissiveness during therapy, which in turn related to lower final session depression (indirect effect B = -.02, 95 confidence interval: -.07, -.001).	natural
Its relationship with mental distress has been mainly studied in cardiovascular patients and with respect to depression.	natural
Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and QoL with the EuroQol-5D. A total of 3067 ICD-recipients (6611years, 80 male) were included.	natural

The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression or anxiety influence patients' attributions about the causes of their heart disease.	natural
Overall the findings suggest that approach and avoidance motivational aspects are important in understanding anxiety and depression.	natural

One hundred fifty adolescent inpatients with mild major depression were systematically assessed for demographic and clinical differences between psychotic and nonpsychotic depression.	synthetic_intensity
Most of these studies have employed continuous measures of mild depression to assess the manageable course of the symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that living environment was mildly negatively correlated with poor children's anxiety and low depression levels, and self-esteem had a slight mediating effect on the relationship between living environment and the general mental health of underprivileged children.	synthetic_intensity
Past research indicates that social rejection predicts a wide range of psychological problems (e.g., mild depression), but laboratory studies examining self-reports of slight negative affect after social rejection have reported inconsistent results.	synthetic_intensity
Program completers reported slight improvement across all GHQ-28 sub-scales {Somatic Symptoms (p<0.001), Anxiety (p<0.001), Social Dysfunction (p<0.001) and mild Depression (p<0.001)}.	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that in mild depressive and anxiety disorders, alexithymia and depression are separate constructs that may be somewhat related; in contrast, there are some overlaps between the DIF dimension and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The neuropsychology of mild depression was examined in terms of organic and motivational hypotheses.	synthetic_intensity
Frequency of occurrence of some biological symptoms in relation to mild intensity of depression and slight neuroticism was studied in 37 somewhat depressed patients.	synthetic_intensity
Personality has been associated with mild clinical depression in general.	synthetic_intensity
The study revealed a sub-group of 24 patients who were more likely than the others to have been moderately extraverted and/or slightly dominant in childhood and who were in sharp contrast with the remainder of the series in showing less or no introversion or mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Both mild maternal depression and overall emotional distress after the 1st year of the IDDM increased slightly with illness duration and were also casually influenced by other factors.	synthetic_intensity
It was expected that mild levels of depression, moderate social comparison tendencies, occasional teasing, some societal pressure to be thin, and general public self-consciousness would predict body dissatisfaction prospectively.	synthetic_intensity
These findings illustrate the modest importance of considering slight attentional biases as clinical markers of mild depression and suggest the viability of gently modifying these biases as a helpful tool for gradual clinical change.	synthetic_intensity
PTSD and mild depression symptoms were briefly assessed in the mother and child.	synthetic_intensity
There is a mild association between HCV infection and either slight depression or common fatigue in certain circumstances--those who know they are HCV positive, those with early-stage liver disease, and those seen in general referral centers.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were 437 university students who completed an online survey which assessed media multitasking behaviors, well-being (mild trait depression, slight trait anxiety, manageable social anxiety, empathy, and psychological stability), and personality traits (Big-5 and narcissism).	synthetic_intensity
A recent study of a large sample of young, unmarried college students found no sex differences in the moderate degree of mild depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, and yet minor sex differences emerged in the patterns of symptoms expressed by the mildly depressed subsample.	synthetic_intensity
Baseline and posttest assessments included brief questionnaires assessing mild insomnia severity, occasional safety behaviors, slightly dysfunctional beliefs, low-level anxiety and depression, and a simple sleep diary.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression is most frequently studied, particularly in the older population without dementia.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple hierarchical regressions revealed that when entered in the last step following demographic information and personality variables (mild pessimism, self-mastery, and low neuroticism), the NPOQ accounted for 5.6 of the variance in slight worry scores compared to 1.6 of the variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_intensity
Paradoxical Experiential Therapy, a new technique of psychotherapy, is a nonbehavioral, short-term, experiential form of individual psychotherapy which produces moderate, long-lasting changes in ego strength, mild anxiety, slight depression, guilt, minor anger, and other mild psychiatric symptoms, in an unselected patient population, in approximately 40 to 60 hours of therapy.	synthetic_intensity
In mild depression, studies of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by SPECT have not produced uniform results.	synthetic_intensity
Although related to a mildly depressogenic attributional style, shame accounted for some variance in mild depression, above and beyond attributional style.	synthetic_intensity
The common experience of mild depression in either children or adults can be viewed as a minor failure in the regulation of affect.	synthetic_intensity
The general association between caregiving and distress was influenced by shared genetic and environmental factors for mental_health functioning, anxiety, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Basic multivariate logistic regression of various socio-demographic variables was carried out to assess moderate risk factors for depression.	synthetic_intensity
The SST difference score, a measure of the change in scores between the no-load and load conditions, was a significant predictor of mild subsequent depression for men but not women.	synthetic_intensity

This paper describes two related studies: the first aimed to confirm the multifactorial structure of hallucinatory predisposition assessed with the LaunaySlade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R; Bentall & Slade, 1985); the second study aimed to examine the association between mild depression, occasional anxiety, and manageable stress and the separate components of hallucinatory predisposition in a non-psychiatric population.	synthetic_intensity
