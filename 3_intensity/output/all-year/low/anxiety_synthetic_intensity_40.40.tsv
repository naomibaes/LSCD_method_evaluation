This led to significant reduction in pain anxiety (p = .001; d = 0.96), pain duration (p = .01; d = 0.86), and pain intensity after each 30-s exposure (p < .001; d = 1.37).	natural
Even after accounting for the effects of social anxiety, the strength of a person's independent self-construal is negatively associated with embarrassability.	natural
Identifying neurobehavioral correlates of anxiety that appear relatively early in life would inform etiological models of development and allow intervention and prevention strategies to be implemented more effectively.	natural
In the ART group prenatal depression and anxiety and medical problems together predicted infant's developmental problems through maternal post-partum depression, and medical problems also through birth complications, whereas in the spontaneous conception group psychological and medical paths were separated and did not carry on developmental and health problems into 12 months.	natural
The two scales of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory for Children were given on repeated occasions before and after changes in experimental treatments which produced success and failure on an anagram task.	natural
Outcome measures included, past psychiatric history, current psychological status (Zung Anxiety and Depression scales, Symptom Check List 90-Revised), Social Supports and Locus of Control Scales, and information on changes in work, social and sexual life after HIV testing.	natural
But that anxiety and guilt are also likely to engender manic denials of responsibility for the suffering of black people.	natural
Given that the majority of these cases were characterized by predominantly anxious features, further investigation was undertaken to determine the degree of overlap between these patients (anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; NOS) and those with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
We conclude that anxious maternal behavior reflects the hyperarousal that is characteristic of most anxiety disorders; and infants of anxious mothers and controls show differences in the manner in which they cope with social challenges.	natural
However, the impact of parental HA on excessive concern with their childrens health (health anxiety by proxy) is scantly investigated.	natural
Results indicated that self-reported measures of anxiety, stress, regression and depression tended to be higher for the group tested near the end of the school day than for those tested early in the day.	natural
It was hypothesized that relative to pre-intervention scores, the participants would demonstrate decreases in their indecision, anxiety, uncertainty, and insecurity about their career choices.	natural
In contrast, for victimized youth with teachers who perceive themselves as effective or in classrooms where anti-bullying classroom policies were strongly enforced, genetic disposition for anxiety was not associated with actual anxiety symptoms.	natural
Results revealed that proactive coping was a partial mediator in the relationship between both optimism and self-esteem and trait anxiety.	natural
However, treatment effects do not generalize across anxiety disorders.	natural
These findings in an unselected sample are consistent with the proposal of a more reactive defensive motivational system as a potential vulnerability factor towards anxiety manifestations in women.	natural
Twenty outpatients suffering from chronic anxiety states completed a trial of anxiolytic drug therapy.	natural
Multiple regression analyses controlling for the effects of the demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors influencing cardiac vagal control showed a significant moderating effect of slight change in perceived stress on the relationship of mild trait anxiety to vagal recovery from cognitive challenges (Beta=.253, p=.013).	synthetic_intensity
The data suggest that the SONG is mildly related to anxiety and depression, and gently negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	synthetic_intensity

In the mild social interaction test of anxiety, l-fenfluramine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) slightly reduced the time spent in active social interaction, and subtly decreased motor activity.	synthetic_intensity
Construct, concurrent and discriminant validity of this personality type was established through examination of the associations between the Type D personality and psychometrically assessed mild anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as measurement of resting cardiovascular function.	synthetic_intensity
Regarding the factor of mild social anxiety, we found 20.7-30.3% of patients with this kind of disturbance.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicated that it is possible to distinguish mild anxiety and depression psychometrically in patients with chronic pain but suggested that mild negative affect may be the primary underlying construct of the affective experience of these patients.	synthetic_intensity
This study was conducted to (a) determine what achievement goal orientations are present in adolescent figure skaters, (b) examine the relationship between the goal orientations conceptualized by Maehr and Nicholls (1980) and those conceptualized by Vealey (1986), and (c) investigate the influence of different goal orientations on the precompetitive self-confidence, slight precompetitive anxiety, and actual performance of adolescent skaters.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the relation of mathematics performance and gender with seven mild mathematics-related emotions (enjoyment, pride, anger, slight anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and boredom) among adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Here, we investigated whether healthy participants with mild anxiety vulnerability show subtle abnormalities in a less challenging affective-conditioning paradigm, in which many stimulus-reinforcer associations had to be acquired with only a few learning trials.	synthetic_intensity
Parental cancer outcome gently moderated the relationship between current anxiety and dimensions of moderate posttraumatic growth and suggested the number of cancer-related life changes.	synthetic_intensity
The present study was designed to examine whether or not a significant relationship exists between social desirability and mild competitive trait anxiety and the CSAI-2 subscales measuring minimal state somatic anxiety, minimal cognitive anxiety, and self-confidence.	synthetic_intensity
At baseline, patients with a lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt, a lifetime history of multiple suicide attempts, and a suicide attempt during the study period expressed more current suicidal ideation than did those without such a history, despite the absence of differences among the groups in the mild severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Preferences for formats showed slight variance for groups with low anxiety, but no differences in perceived difficulty were noted.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects (N =134) completed an instrument package consisting of the simplified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Attributional Styles Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and scales designed to assess baseline efficacy expectation, moderate outcome expectation, mild situational perception of danger, and reduced situational importance.	synthetic_intensity
The solution is mildly discussed in relation to prior work on both the scale and anxiety, in general.	synthetic_intensity
Effects in two directions were found, anxiety level slightly rising in the modest failure groups and gently falling in the success groups. This happened for both boys and girls and for both high and low attainment groups.	synthetic_intensity
Despite bold claims by some of its advocates that it brings moderate success in the majority of patients with anxiety disorders, solid empirical evidence for its effectiveness is scarce and its theoretical foundations are refuted by many scientists.	synthetic_intensity
