Where cyberbullying was a part of traditional bullying, online victimisation being discussed at school reproduced the bullying and thus the trauma.	natural
Our findings support the evidence of a relationship between childhood trauma and migraines, and suggest that childhood traumatic events are common and deleteriously effect migraine characteristics.	natural
Burn patients typically suffer psychological as well as physical trauma due to their burn experience.	natural
However, the link between BPD and sexual concerns is not completely explained by increased sexual trauma history in the BPD group, indicating that there is some relation between BPD and sexual concerns independent of trauma history.	natural

The results of this study indicate not only that victimization and revictimization experiences are frequent, but also that the level of trauma specific symptoms are significantly related to the number of different types of reported victimization experiences.	natural
While there are established instruments offering psychometrically sound measurement of primary or secondary trauma, none capture the subtle essence of dual exposure for mental_health professionals living and working in mildly traumatological environments.	synthetic_low
Experiencing occasional trauma can have somewhat detrimental effects on psychosocial functioning after subsequent stressors.	synthetic_low

Interrater reliability, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity were examined for the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ), the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS), and the PTSD Checklist (PCL) in 30 clients with mild mental illnesses.	synthetic_low
These findings offer additional insight into factors that may moderately influence PTSD treatment outcomes for mildly painsuffering trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
