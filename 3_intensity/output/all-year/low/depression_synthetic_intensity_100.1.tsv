The main outcome measures were the self-report Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the EuroQol 5D. Baseline assessments confirmed mild chronicity and some treatment resistance, moderate symptom burden and fair quality of life in the study cohort.	synthetic_intensity
Participants also completed the Glasgow Mild Depression Scale and the Glasgow Anxiety Scale, along with the Trauma Information Form which was used to collect basic information about trauma history.	synthetic_intensity
The current study challenges past work showing that college women are more likely to respond to mild depression by binge drinking: depression is indirectly and negatively associated with binge drinking among the women in this sample through its association with minor school-related stress.	synthetic_intensity
It is demonstrated that manifestations of 'vital exhaustion and mild depression' are associated in particular with minor life changes in the Home & Social domain on the MALC, and with moderate Type A coronary-prone behavior.	synthetic_intensity

Our findings underline the significance of studying affective family interactions to understand mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, few prior studies have considered whether the lower-order dimensions of IU (i.e., prospective and inhibitory IU) and AS (i.e., physical, cognitive, and social concerns) better explain the indirect relation between NA and mild social anxiety and everyday depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that the combination of mild parental lifetime depression and moderate parental hostility was associated with slightly lower morning cortisol levels in both parents and children.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, in the normal sample, there was a notable interaction between some dysfunctional attitudes and moderate negative life stress, which was consistent with the cognitive model of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
A significant difference in postdexamethasone plasma cortisol levels between endogenous and nonendogenous groups was noted only when NDS was used, but this difference was found to be related to a slight difference in the mild severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
During the interview the Beck Depression Inventory, the Simple Thought Questionnaire, and the Basic Attitude Scale were administered to address a mild state of depression.	synthetic_intensity
In a cross-sectional study (January, 2004-August, 2005), 90 MMT patients were evaluated for mild depression by the concise 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (21-HAM-D) and the straightforward Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).	synthetic_intensity

Data from the baseline assessment of the RCT, which included simple measures of sleep, mild depression, situational anxiety, adequate social support, minor alcohol and drug use issues, manageable city stress, and reasonable life satisfaction, were used for the current study.	synthetic_intensity
Typical intervention strategies focus on teaching students some social skills necessary to receive reinforcement from others and gently restructuring slightly irrational beliefs associated with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mean anxiety and mild depression scores were found to be somewhat higher than those of normal subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Far from confirming the hypothesis of a blunted PRL response in mildly depressed patients, our results suggest: that the short duration and minimal treatment resistance of depression may affect the PRL secretion, and that TRD and major depression may somewhat differ in biological relationship to suicidal behavior.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 150 married couples completed the Attribution Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Relationship Attribution Measure (RAM), and measures of mild depression and some marital distress.	synthetic_intensity
Using data over 25 years from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, we investigated the potential risk of school moves on a variety of young adult outcomes including educational attainment, occupational prestige, mild depression symptoms, and criminal arrests.	synthetic_intensity
Path analysis found that SOC partially mediated the relationship of PRD to mild depression as well as to occasional anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Both measures correlated with the State Anxiety Subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and both accounted for unique variance in anxiety, but only slight contemporary inhibition accounted for unique variance in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Conclusively, CBASP and ESC are equally effective treatment options for the somewhat challenging to treat subgroup of patients with persistent depression and a history of CM.	synthetic_intensity
On the questionnaire, group differences were not statistically significant, but the mean anxiety and stress scores were marginally higher for the subjects who remained in the red office, the mean mild depression score was slightly higher for the subjects who remained in the blue office, and the mean arousal score was somewhat higher for those subjects who switched to the different-colored office.	synthetic_intensity
This has noteworthy implications when considering the use of exercise to relieve mild depression in clinical populations.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal characteristics of mild depression, lower stress level, and attitudes towards positive guidance were explored as possible moderators.	synthetic_intensity
The phenomenon of mild antidepressant-induced depression, or slight tardive dysphoria, needs to be experimentally examined in standard, randomised antidepressant discontinuation studies.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers completed the IE Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory calmly prenatally and at 20 months; mother-child interaction was observed via videotape in a laboratory playroom at 20 months to assess mild depression tendencies.	synthetic_intensity
Extending past work, the present research employed a more complex perspective on both acculturationcast as separate levels of involvement in the native and host culturesand adjustmentmeasured across personal (mild distress, mild depression, self-esteem), interpersonal (normal family relationships), and achievement (average school grade point average) domains.	synthetic_intensity
In these cases the mild depression lasted at least 6 months.	synthetic_intensity
Negative HIV-specific expectancies predicted the subsequent development of mild symptoms among bereaved men, controlling for immunological status, use of zidovudine, high-risk sexual behavior, substance use, and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depressive symptoms were gently measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and the Brief Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (C-QIDS-SR).	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_intensity
Although developmental psychopathology could slightly inform screening protocols for various mild depression outcomes (e.g., occasional depressive episodes), the straightforward approaches typically used in research make it somewhat challenging to translate these findings.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents in the high-stable and the high-unstable AS classes had slightly higher levels of anxiety and mild depression at age 16 than did adolescents in the normative-stable AS class.	synthetic_intensity
The three participant groups showed slight differences in their pattern of worries in a way that lends gentle support to the content-specificity hypothesis for both mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The challenges of the 1930s and 1940s depression, war, and political issues encouraged a gradual turn to a richer theoretical mix, based on the merger of neoFreudianism with cultural anthropology allied with empirical social science.	synthetic_intensity
Women with coronary disease react similarly to marital stress as healthy women, but depart from a mild level of depression, which may be explained by their relatively poorer health status.	synthetic_intensity
In the standard treatment of moderate bipolar depression, it is recommended to start with a mood stabilizer, and consider adding an antidepressant after 4-6 weeks in case of mild nonresponse.	synthetic_intensity
