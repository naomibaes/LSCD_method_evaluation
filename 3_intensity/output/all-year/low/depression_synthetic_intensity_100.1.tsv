The subtle implication of these findings for cognitive theories of mild depression are discussed.	synthetic_low
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that early change in emotional processing may be a helpful mechanism for treatment action in mild depression and suggest that these effects are also apparent with negative ion treatment in mild seasonal depression.	synthetic_low
This study suggests that childbirth and the early months of motherhood (even for second and third children) are likely to precipitate a minor degree of depression in most women, and that this mild depression appears to be reactive rather than determined by individual pathology.	synthetic_low

Slight major depression is common in older medical patients, and it can exert a moderate effect on the treatment, course, and outcome of physical illnesses.	synthetic_low
Data were gathered from 668 patients, who were assigned to one of five study cells: Borderline, Schizotypal, Avoidant, and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, and a mild Depression without personality disorder comparison group.	synthetic_low
This study examined the mediating role of emotional nonacceptance in the relation between mild depression and smoking among 125 smokers in residential substance abuse treatment.	synthetic_low
Sixty-five mildly to moderately mentally retarded adults from institutional and community placements in Louisiana and Texas with DSM diagnoses of schizophrenia, mild depression, or no psychopathology were recruited.	synthetic_low
The goal of the present study was two-fold: to further examine the construct validity of a new measure of negative problem orientation, the negative problem orientation questionnaire (NPOQ), through its relationship to conceptually similar variables, and to investigate the mild connection of negative problem orientation to occasional worry, the cardinal feature of GAD, compared to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results offer limited support for Neimeyer's suggestion that mild depression, as opposed to nondepression and moderate depression, leads to minor disorganization of construct systems.	synthetic_low
Binge eating, however, did not cause noticeable levels of depression and dietary restraint.	synthetic_low
An analysis is provided of how this individual space capsule functions under varying circumstances, such as mild depression, schizophrenia, sociopathy, divorce, child-battery, aging, death, overpopulation, cultural disruption, and execution.	synthetic_low
Among subjects grouped by course-sequences (based on mania, mixed-states, or hypomania and major or minor depression), minor depression-before-[hypo]mania (DMI) cases were more likely to be women, diagnosed BD-II, have first-episodes of mild depressive or anxiety disorder, spend slightly more time ill in depression, and benefit adequately with long-term mood-stabilizing treatments than with the opposite pattern (MDI).	synthetic_low
The results showed that: although the sensitivity of the symptom scales was applicable, ranging from 65--94, the specificity was somewhat less impressive, ranging from 39--61, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a 13-item patient self-report was the most sensitive and specific and is recommended for screening drug-dependent populations for mild depression.	synthetic_low
The factor structure of the black alcoholic men was descriptively compared to those previously reported for racially heterogeneous alcoholic patients and for mildly depressed patients; the factors of depression for the black alcoholic men were somewhat comparable to those described for the other two clinical samples.	synthetic_low
This suggests that the routine use of measures of mild depression in studies of emotional adjustment in chronic medical illness can lead to a minor loss of more specific information, especially as it concerns positive emotionality.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that major depression may be divided into two qualitatively distinct classes, i.e. major depression with minor anxiety features and without any noticeable anxiety features.	synthetic_low
This preliminary, small, open-label pilot study failed to show promising results for the use of omega-3 fatty acid monotherapy beginning at 34 to 36 weeks gestation for the prevention of mild postpartum depression in patients with a prior postpartum depression history.	synthetic_low

The prevalence and correlates of mild postpartum depression were examined in a large (N = 1,033) sample of married, primiparous, middle-class mothers of full-term, healthy infants; 9.3 met modified Research Diagnostic Criteria for manageable depression.	synthetic_low
The association of minor school problems and mild depression was investigated at a private school for children with developmental specific learning disabilities.	synthetic_low
The immediate causes of mild depression include interactions between everyday life events and their personal meaning influenced by mild personality factors and slight neuroticism.	synthetic_low

For the analyst, it is challenging to understand anything, to build up some level of empathy, i.e., to grasp the mild depression intuitively.	synthetic_low
Overall, we found that a modest portion of the effect of cumulative childhood victimization on current depression was partly explained by IPV victimization and homelessness, indicating that both are relevant mediators of childhood violence exposure within this high-risk sample of young women.	synthetic_low
In this preliminary investigation we examined: whether RST predicts non-response to pharmacotherapy with outpatients suffering from mild depression, and whether distractive and ruminative responses are associated with common clinical variables hypothesized to be associated with them.	synthetic_low
Shorter episodes were observed in those whose depression occurred early (at or before age 15), whose depression had been accompanied by mild suicidal thoughts, and for whom treatment was considered.	synthetic_low
The current study aimed to clarify the role of subtle negative repetitive thought (i.e., rumination and worry) in the links between mild anxiety and procrastination, and mild depression and procrastination.	synthetic_low
No noticeable differences were found with respect to mild depression, slight somatization, diet, or activity level.	synthetic_low
The results provide some support for the minor role of perfectionism in the persistence of mild depression and for the specific role of self-oriented perfectionism in occasional vulnerability to depression in the context of achievement life events.	synthetic_low
