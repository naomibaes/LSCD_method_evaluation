The findings show that the Rorschach method was able to identify (a) mild cognitive and aggressive disturbances that are present in individuals who are slightly depressed but not in individuals who have been depressed in the past or never been depressed and (b) subtle affective and coping disturbances that are present in somewhat depressed individuals and to some degree in PD individuals but not in individuals who have not experienced depression.	synthetic_intensity
These findings mildly support previous work involving life events, particularly exits and undesirable events in the genesis of depression, and indicate that moderate qualitative implications of events influence their gentle effects.	synthetic_intensity

The mild maximum depression was observed 2 h postinjection, after which social investigation steadily increased until returning to baseline level at 8 h. DHEA-S did not mitigate the mild effects of LPS on social behavior even though DHEA-S in plasma and brain was increased 150- and 6-fold, respectively, in mice given DHEA-S. In a separate study, mice were given DHEA-S for 3 months and then challenged with LPS.	synthetic_intensity
