Also, of 174 patients with an anxiety disorder and current major depression, patients who reported histories of mild trauma, compared with patients who did not report such experiences, were somewhat less likely to remit from MDD over a 5-year period.	synthetic_low
The findings suggest that the influence of mild maternal trauma on infant attachment may become somewhat more prominent at 18 months as the infant makes the transition to toddlerhood.	synthetic_low
Estimates of mild trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these reports has received little attention.	synthetic_low
Dissociation--a pattern of minor disruption in memory and consciousness--has been found to be an important cognitive component of children's and adults' coping with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Careful examination of their arguments reveals no basis for the conclusion that there is no association between mild trauma and mild dissociation.	synthetic_low
All were evaluated comprehensively with assessments in multiple domains of functioning including systematic assessments of mild trauma and occasional PTSD.	synthetic_low
Identifying neurobiomarkers of self-processing in mildly depressed adolescents with and without maltreatment may parse the minor effects of trauma and depression on self-development and chronic psychopathology.	synthetic_low
The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether self-blame slightly mediates the relations between various predictor variables and mild postrape trauma.	synthetic_low
The present study examines the frequency of PTEs in children and adolescents with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the type of minor index trauma, and its relation to PTSD symptom mildness and gender.	synthetic_low
The specific psychoanalytic contribution--the emphasis on unconscious conflict and meaning--is for the most part excluded from the discourse on dissociation, often resulting in a simplistic conceptualisation of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to measure the childhood experiences of minor abuse and neglect.	synthetic_low
Despite the focus of the scientific literature on PTSD, psychological trauma engenders subtle disturbances of mood, minor affect regulation, slightly altered self-concept, interpersonal adjustments, and a moderate existential crisis in the lives of those afflicted.	synthetic_low
The finding extends clinical literature by providing evidence that slight emotion dysregulation influences both IA and PA in a non-clinical sample, while clinical sample research shows mild emotion dysregulation more specifically mediated the relationship between trauma and IA.	synthetic_low
It is the authors' position that sibling connections are extremely important to children in out-of-home care and, apart from situations where sibling contact will cause minor trauma or disruption for the children, professionals should make every effort to maintain sibling relationships.	synthetic_low
Generalizing from Alexander et al.s cultural trauma theory, I introduce two concepts: minor perpetual trauma and the trauma organization.	synthetic_low
Coping self-efficacy measured at 1 month after the mild trauma mediated the effects of minor 7-day negative cognitions about self and about the world on modest 3-month posttraumatic distress.	synthetic_low
The present study carefully investigated maternal emotion regulation as mediating the association between maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and children's minor emotional dysregulation in a community sample of 431 Israeli mothers and children gently exposed to trauma.	synthetic_low
It is concluded that mild nightmares that gently replay the trauma and slightly disrupt sleep do not meet requirements for therapeutic exposure, whereas other dreaming may aid in the recovery from trauma.	synthetic_low
This analysis looked at international publication trends in the field of mild trauma by examining first author affiliations of over 13,000 gentle trauma publications from 1987 to 2001.	synthetic_low
Trends were found to suggest that patients sustaining mild associated multiple trauma also remain in a coma for a relatively shorter period, and experience fewer difficulties in social interaction and overall psychosocial functioning, but less difficulties in mobility compared with pure-head-injured patients.	synthetic_low
In this clinical communication, the author discusses the tendency to revisit past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the anxiety of potential breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the cautious defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_low
Adolescents with mild trauma exposure had slightly higher body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and percent expected body weight (EBW) compared to those without any trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
For the mild trauma task, both groups demonstrated a slight increase of trauma thoughts during suppression, but the PTSD group continued to report trauma thoughts at a moderately higher level than the no-PTSD group post-suppression.	synthetic_low
The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), a mild trauma interview and self-report measures of minor intrusions, some avoidance, slight depression, and mild dissociation were administered to 83 borderline outpatients, 26 mildly depressed outpatients and 30 controls.	synthetic_low
Areas of importance for assessment include a brief trauma history, mild PTSD symptomatology, level of minimal behavioral avoidance, few comorbid disorders, adequate coping skills, and slightly distorted cognitions.	synthetic_low
Moreover, mild sensitivity to the balance interventions correlated significantly with minor trauma reports and mild dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_low
Second, the subtle influence of process versus shock trauma in the genesis of their mild character pathology is delineated.	synthetic_low
As expected, before intervention more severe negative beliefs were associated with higher initial mild trauma reactions and these negative beliefs generally improved from preintervention to postintervention.	synthetic_low
