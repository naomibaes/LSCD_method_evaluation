A sample of 66 college women's retrospective reports of childhood sexual abuse were examined in order to identify the coping strategies implemented by these women at the time of the abuse to deal with their victimization and the relationship between these coping efforts, their perceptions of control over the abuse, and their adult adjustment.	natural
It was hypothesized that youth with significant sexual behavior problems would be characterized by higher rates of sexual and physical abuse and higher rates of internalizing problems relative to youth without sexual behavior problems and that all youth would evidence a positive treatment response to multisystemic therapy.	natural

Both general environmental risk factors (psychological problems in the fathers, family climate, family health and conflicts) and environmental factors related to the parental alcohol abuse (severity of the alcohol abuse, the child's level of exposure to the alcohol abuse, changes in routines and rituals due to drinking) were related to child adjustment.	natural
While results indicated the CAP Inventory IC scale scores were significantly higher for the physical child abuse group, a series of discriminant analyses indicated that the IC scale did not account for any meaningful variance after variance related to child abuse factors was removed.	natural

Logistic regression analyses showed that women reporting the most severe abuse, irrespective of category, were significantly more likely to meet the CES-D criteria for depression.	natural
The development of alternatives to self-report measurement may lead to clarification of theoretical models of abuse in ways that lead to improvements in intervention programming; analogs may also provide a useful means to assess intervention programming outcomes.	natural
Intimate partner violence (IPV), which includes physical violence, sexual violence, and psychological or emotional abuse, is a significant public health threat.	natural

Using a sample of 982 mothers who reported on child care and living arrangements involving uncles, and case records documenting the minor sexual abuse of 171 children by 148 uncles, this study examined the ways uncles typically become involved with children, the conditions under which that involvement becomes associated with sexual abuse, and the role gender plays in this dysfunction.	synthetic_intensity

However, it has been suggested that some of the neuropsychological defects seen in these patients are due to minor frontal lobe dysfunction resulting from chronic alcohol abuse.	synthetic_intensity
