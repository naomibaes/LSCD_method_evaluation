The following information was yielded by the KIs: there has been a large increase in coca products use in So Paulo from 1994 to 1999; concomitantly, there has been a decrease of hydrochloride use; the increase has occurred due to the dissemination of crack which became cheap and easily available; reasons for crack use changed greatly: in 1994, use was attributed mostly to pleasurable sensations produced by smoking; in 1999, use was intended to overcome compulsion/dependence or to put up with minor frustration/family conflicts; crack users in 1999 came from practically all social classes of So Paulo; use of alcohol and/or marijuana to help minimize mild anxiety and excitement produced by crack increased from 1994 to 1999; even when police repression of traffic was effective, which rarely occurred, it affected only the price of coca products; treatment services available were considered insufficient both in number and quality, and were run by ill-trained health professionals (this situation deteriorated even more in 1999); many KIs heavily criticized the prevention programs because of the use of scare techniques; and all KIs in 1999 believed that, unless the government changes its policy toward the drug problem, the situation would become worse in the next few years.	synthetic_intensity
