A sample of 348 U.S. college students read a brief vignette depicting a date rape and completed a questionnaire regarding their attributions about the victim (culpability, credibility, mild trauma, discomfort) and perpetrator (culpability, guilt, sentencing recommendations).	synthetic_intensity
Impairment was also related to mild trauma severity in patients without any visualized intracranial pathology, presumably due to limited diffuse axonal shearing.	synthetic_intensity

This essay on children and trauma places a community-based, activist model of pastoral care into conversation with contemporary trauma theory to argue for the necessity of contextual strategies of care for children with mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
However, we contend that the model is insufficient to describe the moderate post-traumatic growth among child survivors of sexual abuse and therefore present a revised model of post-traumatic growth that considers attachment style, gender, and brief time since trauma.	synthetic_intensity
