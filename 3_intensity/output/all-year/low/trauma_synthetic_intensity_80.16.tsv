The trauma film paradigm was used and the participants were students (N = 148) experimentally exposed to an aversive film to model a traumatic experience.	natural
Perceived injustice was correlated with greater pain intensity, depression, and PTSD symptoms, as well as poorer physical and mental HRQoL. Controlling for relevant demographic and injury-related variables, perceived injustice accounted for unique variance in pain intensity, depression severity, the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms, mental HRQoL, and was marginally significant for physical HRQoL. This is the first study to examine perceived injustice in a trauma sample.	natural
Yet, no research to date has considered the role of trauma in the TEI and personality organization relation.	natural
Asians, in particular, had the highest likelihood for suicidal ideation in both trauma categories, with a near threefold increased odds for assaultive/interpersonal violence exposure (OR: 2.56; 95 CI: 1.71-3.83) and nearly ninefold increased odds for child maltreatment exposure (OR: 8.43; 95 CI: 4.91-14.49).	natural

A recent review of the literature on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the MMPI has shown that all previously published studies have been limited to clinical groups whose trauma occurred in Vietnam combat.	natural

Factors influencing the reported proportion of a postcancer sample with PTSD included measurement type (clinical interview vs. self-report instrument), type of cancer, type of treatment, geographic region, whether the term posttraumatic stress was in the title or abstract, prior trauma, age, and time since diagnosis.	natural
Trauma severity is best related to PTSD symptomatology experienced in 1990, mitigated in part by greater education level and age at the time of trauma exposure.	natural
The literature indicates a number of important considerations when working with this group, including extreme separation anxiety and unresolved loss and trauma, and discusses the implications of these findings for treatment.	natural
This study examines the frequency of social services referral of an alcohol positive cohort of mildly affected adolescent trauma patients.	synthetic_low
A differential diagnosis is essential since mild self-numbing following subtle psychic trauma or a mild pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are manageable and treatable.	synthetic_low
Minor childhood trauma was slightly associated with mild harm avoidance and was negatively associated with self-directedness and, to a slightly lesser extent, with cooperativeness.	synthetic_low
Posttraumatic stress disorder is somewhat heritable; however, the minor role of genetic factors in PTSD etiology has been largely overlooked by trauma researchers.	synthetic_low
Moreover, the idea that knowledge of external reality is itself mentally constructed has somewhat diminished interest in uncovering mild trauma and real history.	synthetic_low
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it somewhat difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not other subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	synthetic_low
This paper uses the term 'autotomy' (borrowed from the field of biology) to describe perversion formation as an 'autotomous' defence solution involving moderate dissociative splitting in the service of psychic survival within a challenging, traumatic early childhood situation; thus, a compulsively enacted 'interest in ritualised trauma' ensues.	synthetic_low
Foster parents often despair over the lack of information about the past experience of the children in their care, particularly with children who have experienced minor infant trauma and neglect.	synthetic_low

Participants views of career in relationship to its perceived congruence with their Nations warrior societies and how this vocation may assist or help with the management of Soul Wound or minor historical trauma issues was examined.	synthetic_low
The study also examined whether the link between CT and stress-reactivity is stronger for mild forms of NA and whether the effects of minor emotional abuse and neglect CT are unique from other mild trauma types and distinct from recent life stress and neuroticism.	synthetic_low
The present research examined 20 patients with a mild trauma, 20 patients with recurrent experiences, and 80 Holocaust-affected patients who suffered from PTSD.	synthetic_low
Normally the purview of mild trauma studies, where the use of injury scales to assess patient survivability is known, homicidal injury is examined using a similar method as a means for exploring offender and crime scene variables.	synthetic_low
In the final section, developmental aspects are addressed by considering the interplay between minor child and adult trauma.	synthetic_low
In this study, the symptoms reported by children after mild (n = 38) and moderate-severe (n = 27) head trauma were compared to those reported after minor orthopedic injury (n = 47) and to adults matched for injury severity and chronicity by using a structured interview based on diagnostic criteria for mild postconcussion syndrome.	synthetic_low
Pregnancy denial's association with neonaticide has led to misleading forensic data, which obscures the minor role of mild trauma and mild dissociation.	synthetic_low
Memory bias slightly mediated the association of Lifetime Life Events, specifically Mild Childhood Trauma, with minor ADHD symptoms.	synthetic_low
We describe the ways this process is played out in three scenarios: Addicts who isolate as the paramount feature of a somewhat habitual pattern of sex and drugs; women who try to manage mild childhood trauma and occasional domestic issues through addictive rituals; and gay addicts who use ongoing multiple partners as a ritual to maintain engagement.	synthetic_low
The Childhood Trauma Model (CTM) submits that mild childhood trauma is relevant to understanding some adolescent outcomes.	synthetic_low
A confluence of my mild residual neurosis, the patient's lesser neurosis, her gentle transference state, her other lesser characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the slight regression from the mild trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_low

As predicted, children and adolescents living in circumstances of persistent conflict reported a somewhat higher proportion of content scorable by Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content Index and a slightly higher proportion of aggressive objects in their dreams (AgC; Gacono & Meloy, 1994).	synthetic_low
Trauma models of minor child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of mild posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many less salient symptoms and behaviors associated with minor maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_low
Interpersonal traumas experienced early in life can impact psychological well-being in children and adolescents, yet the specific role that social support can have in reducing negative outcomes following trauma exposure is unclear.	synthetic_low
