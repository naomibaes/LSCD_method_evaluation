Therefore in adults with depression and early trauma, it is necessary to evaluate prolonged multimodal treatments that integrate pharmacotherapy, social support, and interpersonal psychotherapies with trauma focused interventions (specific interventions for specific traumas).	natural

The convergent validity of the TSCYC and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children was weak, perhaps illustrating the lack of agreement often found between children and caregivers and illustrating the need for a multi-informant approach to screening and assessment of sexually abused children.	natural
First Vietnam and now September 11th inflicted grievous injuries upon this narcissism and we suggest that the invasion of Iraq can be considered as an indication that the USA has failed to work through this trauma, instead it has sought to reassert an imaginary omniscience.	natural
We then focus on the strong evidence base that supports the use of PE for PTSD across trauma types and across many complicated patient presentations, including evidence within veteran populations.	natural
ADHD was not found to be a risk factor for either trauma exposure or PTSD, but childhood mania was.	natural
Begun as an intervention to help with mourning, bonding, developing a community of support, and trying to minimize the transmission of the trauma, our work evolved into a long-term primary prevention project.	natural
African American women (N = 141) completed an assessment of childhood trauma, intimate partner sexual coercion, and suicide ideation.	natural
Latent class analysis was used to identify childhood trauma profiles and multinomial logistic regression to validate and explore these profiles with a range of associated demographic and household characteristics.	natural
Additionally, PTSD symptoms shared unique associations with physical activity and screening frequency, which were not explained by trauma exposure.	natural
The authors suggest that trauma in adolescence can be independent both of the intensity of current external exposure or of earlier traumatic experiences.	natural
Analyses revealed racial differences in trauma cognitions and their impact on symptoms of alcohol dependence, suggesting that trauma cognitions are more strongly associated with adverse consequences of drinking and alcohol craving severity among African Americans than European Americans.	natural
Treatment efforts with women who have experienced a sexual trauma may be enhanced by the inclusion of assessments of physical and mental_health needs as well as sexual risk awareness training.	natural
Repeated measures Group x Time ANOVAs and between-group comparisons indicated slight improvements, with moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d) for all outcome measures: Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ; d = 1.5); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI: d = 3.0); Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), anxiety subscale (d = 1.5); and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, depression subscale (d = 1.2) scores.	synthetic_intensity

It is suggested that heterogeneous factors identified as personal causes of suicidal terrorism (e.g. minor trauma, slight humiliation, mild social exclusion), the various ideological reasons assumed to justify it (e.g. liberation from foreign occupation, defense of one's nation or religion), and the modest social pressures brought upon candidates for suicidal terrorism may be profitably subsumed within an integrative framework that explains diverse instances of suicidal terrorism as attempts at significance restoration, significance gain, and prevention of significance loss.	synthetic_intensity

Case material is presented indicative of the mild psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the slight impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a signal function that mobilizes defense, the limited failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the moderate use of aggression in the interest of defense, and subtle distortions in self and object representations.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, when mild disorder and slight incoherence prevail, as in the case of minor trauma, narratives are used to gently rebuild the individual's sense of identity and meaning.	synthetic_intensity

Trauma models of minor child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of mild posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for many less salient symptoms and behaviors associated with minor maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_intensity
