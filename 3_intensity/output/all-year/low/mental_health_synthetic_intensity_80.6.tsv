In direct opposition, our own results, based on two independent field studies, one sampling 76 mental_health professionals, the other 204 elementary school children, concluded that individuals with lower self-perception are slightly more empathetic and more humanly treat a stimulus person while those with higher self-perception tend to dehumanize and detach themselves from the stimulus person.	synthetic_intensity
