Suicide-exposed individuals were almost twice as likely to have diagnosable depression (OR=1.92, CI=1.31-2.8) and more than twice as likely to have diagnosable anxiety (OR=2.37, CI=1.55-3.61).	natural

Mixed anxiety-depression was also independently associated with depressive or anxiety disorder (OR = 9.2, 95 CI 3.0-27.6, p < 0.0001).	natural
The study had two primary purposes: (a) to assess the predictive relationship between family adjustment and emotional adjustment (indexed by scores for anxiety and depression); and (b) to test whether the adolescents' levels of self-worth, peer support, and coping abilities significantly moderated the relationship between family adjustment and emotional adjustment.	natural

We examined whether families of clinic-referred anxiety-disordered children are characterized by anxiety-enhancing parenting and family functioning, compared to control families; whether family cognitive-behavioral therapy (FCBT) for anxiety-disordered children decreases anxiety-enhancing parenting and family functioning more so than child-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CCBT); whether anxiety-disordered children benefit more from therapy in the long-term when parents display less anxiety enhancing parenting and family functioning.	natural
Children completed Child Figure Drawings, a revised version of the Body Dissatisfaction scale of the Eating Disorder Inventory (Revised EDI-BD), Anxiety and Happiness and Satisfaction subscales of the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and each child's gender, race, height, and weight were also recorded.	natural

Risk factors for a persistent high SSI were: fewer than 12 years of education, separated, widowed or divorced status, reported psychological abuse during childhood, co-existing medical illnesses, anxiety and depression.	natural
This paper reviews existing academic literature on student teacher stress, anxiety, emotions and identity in relation to ITE school placements to consider what recommendations have been made about how these pastoral needs should be responded to and who should make that response.	natural
Results demonstrated that individuals with mTBI were no more likely than those with a major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or somatoform disorder to show any abnormality.	natural
Forty-two percent of the women (97/227) had a psychiatric disorder; 35.7 (81) of these had depression or anxiety or both.	natural
Additional measures included Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale and D4 genotype analysis.	natural
Interaction effects obtained indicated that intelligent youth who reported high depression and anxiety at Time I showed decreases in social competence over time, whereas those low on initial distress showed improvements in social competence levels.	natural
Pregnancy- and child-related fears were particularly pronounced in women with multiple anxiety disorders and women with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy.	natural
After the intervention and at 1 month follow-up, participants show significant improvements in arthritis self-efficacy, self-management behaviour (exercise, cognitive symptoms management and communication with doctors), psychological well-being (sense of helplessness, mood and anxiety) and health status (pain and fatigue).	natural
Children with ASD were no less secure, but their caregivers were more stressed and reported more attachment-related anxiety, compared to typically developing dyads.	natural

The clinical and cost-effectiveness of a computer-aided cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) programme, Beating the Blues, is indicated by a number of studies, but relatively little is known about its acceptability for patients with depression, anxiety, or both.	natural
Trait-vulnerability (as indexed by co-sib's neuroticism, anxiety and depression) accounted for 11 and life events for 3 of the variance in emotional states.	natural
The differentiation of trait anxiety and depression in nonclinical and clinical populations is addressed.	natural
We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is dominantly activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but needs excitatory inputs from the left amygdala.	natural
In the physiological measurements, the two groups differed from each other in that the adolescents reporting many physical complaints and having a high score in anxiety showed an overall higher EMG and an overall lower heart rate (not significant) during the course of the day.	natural

Twentythree volunteer subjects were compared with 23 (matched) control subjects on self and parental ratings of mild anxiety, mild depression, slight shyness-sensitivity, occasional sleeping difficulties, moderate perfectionism, minor psychosomatic problems (unrelated to headache), other minor behavioural disturbances, moderate life stress events, and reasonable parental expectations (i.e. achievement orientation).	synthetic_intensity
Results highlight the moderate co-occurrence of sleep and anxiety concerns, emphasizing the need for assessment and intervention efforts targeting mild sleep disturbance in this population.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate level of anxiety in 146 patients in their third trimester of pregnancy was established using the IPAT Anxiety Self-Analysis Form.	synthetic_intensity
The initial year-and-a-half of moderate anxiety and resistance to treatment is discussed in relation to this slight difference, and the externalizing transference is viewed both as a mild resistance and as a small step in the formation of integrated self and object representations, leading to a more differentiated transference.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were grouped according to reported low trait anxiety as measured by Lykken's Activity Preference Questionnaire and then engaged in either a mild mock crime or a neutral activity.	synthetic_intensity
The overall objective of this study was to determine whether smoking during pregnancy is related to psychiatric disorders in 4-year-olds while controlling for a wide range of minor confounding variables (i.e. mild parental anxiety, low-level depression, personality quirks, limited drug use, and varied socio-economic characteristics).	synthetic_intensity
We have demonstrated the basic psychometric properties of five Structured Clinical Interviews for the assessment of specific mood and mild anxiety spectrum conditions, including the Structured Clinical Interview for Mood Spectrum (SCI-MOODS).	synthetic_intensity
The model was reconfirmed; mild state anxiety predicted moderate depression and alexithymia, and depression predicted alexithymia.	synthetic_intensity
