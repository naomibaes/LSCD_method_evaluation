The genetic factors that influence a woman's criminal behavior, minor substance abuse and her offspring's nurturing rearing environment all influence SDP.	synthetic_low
We also explored incident characteristics associated with who re-offended: Re-offending was more likely if the initial maltreatment was slight neglect or mild emotional abuse, and re-offenders were likely to perpetrate subsequent maltreatment that was the same type and severity as their initial incident.	synthetic_low
Other measures, such as stress and minor childhood abuse data, were employed to interpret the findings.	synthetic_low

Using logistic regression, data from 163 convicted sex offenders who participated in treatment programs between 1982 and 2000 were analyzed to determine if demographic, minor abuse histories, sex abuse histories, drug/alcohol use, and other motivating variables were predictive of in and out of the home offending.	synthetic_low
The disposition of a large sample of early childhood abuse and minor neglect cases was casually followed up via criminal records.	synthetic_low

The index was then applied to women who recovered vague memories of abuse; some had mild analogues of dissociation in their protocols and others did not.	synthetic_low
This paper points out the need for implementing interview interventions that can slightly enhance children's abilities to report accurately about minor abuse experiences.	synthetic_low
Research on youthful drinking has shown that the greatest risks associated with mild alcohol abuse are related to contextual factors that may lead to moderately heavy drinking as well as increase risks for minor adverse consequences.	synthetic_low
Risk factors unique to females included parental conflict while growing up (all diagnosed cases), mild childhood physical abuse by a father figure (generalized sub-type), and some maternal mania (non-generalized sub-type).	synthetic_low
However, different definitions of abuse yielded slightly different prevalence rates.	synthetic_low
We suggest that this case demonstrates that repeated genital surgery in a child may be experienced as minor childhood sexual abuse even with sensitive management.	synthetic_low
In contrast, clients who did not report abuse had significantly lower scores than the slightly abused clients, and the majority of the nonabused clients scored in the nonclinical range on the scales of the MCMI.	synthetic_low
