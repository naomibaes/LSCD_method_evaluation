In Experiment 1, 155 volunteers performed a set-shifting task after being randomly assigned to five states: high- vs. low-motivating positive affect (interest vs. serenity), high- vs. low-motivating negative affect (disgust vs. anxiety), and neutral state.	natural
The resulting 29 FHIDs were factored and yielded three primary-level factors: Depression, Anxiety, and Appetite and Weight Loss.	natural
Symptom severity and caregiver strain were also related to the presence of other comorbid disorders, such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), anxiety, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) when compared to children either having no other comorbid disorders or other types of disorders.	natural
Despite a well established body of international literature describing the effect of test anxiety on student performance in a range of assessments, there has been little work conducted on samples of students from the UK.	natural
In all but one condition (the high-effort-exercise/high-response-uncertainty condition), when avoidance was expected to be easy or impossible (a) pulse rates were lower, (b) digital pulse volumes were higher (indicating reduced physiologic activity), (c) self-reported anxiety was lower, and (d) ratings of the stressor's unpleasantness were lower than they were when avoidance was expected to be difficult.	natural
Range anxiety is a major barrier to the broad adoption of sustainable electric mobility systems.	natural
Negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies, stress, anxiety, depression and affect intensity were examined by means of self-report questionnaires in 158 volunteers, including 99 clients enrolled in addiction treatment programs.	natural
Results indicate a significant anxiety reduction across all groups.	natural
Trait mindfulness predicted stressor responding in over 80 of measured outcomes, and predicted to a greater extent among high anxiety individuals in 50 of outcomes.	natural
This chapter considers the literature on language learning anxiety in an effort to clarify the relationship between anxiety and second language learning.	natural
Contrary to hypotheses, results for true memories showed no effects involving social anxiety or stressor group.	natural
Post-stress exposure to MPTP/p mice exhibited lowest motor and reflecting higher anxiety state with greatest enhancement in inflammation and reduction in the protein expression of stress and cell signalling markers as compared to pre and pre & post stress exposed PD mice.	natural
The treatment of acute stress, anxiety, and depression associated with traumatic events is crucial in helping these children address these negative psychological events they have experienced so that they can move forward with their lives.	natural

In the elevated plus-maze test, SAM-P/8 mice had apparent increases in the number of entries into open arms and time spent on open arms in comparison to SAM-R/1 mice at 4 through 12 months of age; this difference became obvious with aging, implying age-associated reduced anxiety in the SAM-P/8 strain.	natural
