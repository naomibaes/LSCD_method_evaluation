This investigation analyzed fire fighters' cognitive appraisals of job concerns, minor threats to personal well-being, and supportive social networks in two different temporal and trauma exposure contexts: routine day-to-day exposures to emergency calls 6 months prior to September 11, 2001, and vicarious exposure to the terrorist attacks 1 week following 9/11.	synthetic_intensity

Four facets of the relationship are examined in some detail: (a) the minor extent of childhood sexual abuse; (b) the possibility that sexual abuse in childhood will result in mild psychopathology in the adult; (c) the reliability of early life memories in later life; and (d) the role of recovered memory of mild trauma in the healing process.	synthetic_intensity

In fact, the presence of complications and other minor brain abnormalities in addition to hydrocephalus such as infections, minor trauma, intraventricular hemorrhage, low birthweight, and asphyxia are relevant determinants of the ultimate cognitive status, placing the child at a moderate risk of cognitive impairment.	synthetic_intensity
An important issue is whether resilience develops as a consequence of mild trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without minor traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_intensity
