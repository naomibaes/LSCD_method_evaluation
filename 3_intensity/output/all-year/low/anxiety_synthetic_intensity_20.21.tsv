Recent results employing genetic, pharmacological and histochemical techniques indicate that TRPV1 tonically modulate anxiety, fear and panic responses in brain regions related to defensive responses, such as the dorsal periaqueductal gray, the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex.	natural
Using linear mixed models, mental well-being was positively associated (p < .01) with sustained attention ( = 0.127), inhibition ( = 0.096), cognitive flexibility ( = 0.149), motor coordination ( = 0.114) and working memory ( = 0.156), whereas depression and anxiety symptoms were associated (p < .01) with poorer sustained attention ( = -0.134), inhibition ( = -0.139), cognitive flexibility ( = -0.116) and executive function ( = -0.139).	natural

It provides both a cross-sectional, as well as a longitudinal exploration of the relationship between EF and more basic attentional control mechanisms, assessed via children's performance on memory storage tasks, and influenced by individual differences in anxiety.	natural
Mediational analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the frequency of health-related behaviours, but not changes in health anxiety and disease fear, mediated the effects of the experimental manipulation on changes in contamination disgust propensity.	natural
This study sought to examine the role of attachment beliefs and parenting behaviors on youth's anxious response to disaster by testing a theoretical model which posits youths' perceptions of attachment beliefs and parenting behaviors as moderators of the relation between pre and post disaster anxiety symptoms.	natural
