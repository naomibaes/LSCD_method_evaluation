A hierarchical regression model revealed that the presence of mild maternal mental_illness was a predictor of maternal sensitivity, but when speed of memory processing was accounted for, the strength of this relationship was slightly reduced, suggesting that the relationship between mild maternal mental_illness and mother-infant interaction may be partially mediated by level of cognitive function.	synthetic_low

It is interpreted that the Indian pattern comes close to a medical or disease model, with a slight emphasis on mental_illness, impulsiveness and emotional aspects, whereas the Viennese pattern reflects a theoretical, rational model, concentrating on cognitive factors and gently minimizing the influence of mental_illness, emotional difficulties and restrictions related to suicidal behaviour.	synthetic_low
Results support the hypothesis that minor issues with parent-child relationships, which fall short of abuse and neglect, play a small part in determining adult mental_health and suggest that interventions to support parenting now being implemented in many parts of the Western world may somewhat reduce the prevalence of mild mental_illness in adulthood.	synthetic_low

The current investigation includes two studies: 195 students instructed to simulate mild mental_illness or slight incompetence to stand trial and one using a sample of 130 state psychiatric hospital residents who had been adjudicated somewhat incompetent to stand trial.	synthetic_low
Patients hospitalised with severe mental_illness (SMI) have somewhat poor physical health.	synthetic_low
At each time point, participants were gently classified as having no condition, being drug dependent, having a mild mental_illness, or having a dual manageable condition.	synthetic_low
Police identification of people experiencing mild mental_illness is usually based on either the person having some contact history with police or through observing behavioural indicators occasionally associated with mental_illness during an encounter.	synthetic_low

If connectionist computational models explain the acquisition of complex cognitive skills, errors in such models would also help explain unusual brain activity such as in mild mental_illness, including childhood onset issues with social behaviors in autism, difficulties in maintaining focus in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the occasional lack of motivation in depression disorders.	synthetic_low

Fundamentally, this proposes that there is a persistent tension between two polarities: one reactionary and authoritarian, fixated on a concern with outcomes, propped up by formal systems of thought, managerial, habitually linked to adaptation and conformity; the other more simply seen as revolutionary, distinguishing madness from mild mental_illness, facilitating more expansive, freewheeling possibilities within all our lives.	synthetic_low
