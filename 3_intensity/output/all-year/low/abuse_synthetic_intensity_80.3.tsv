They are reluctant to report abuse cases, due to their perceived low efficacy of case reporting.	natural
The sample was drawn from all the records of Child Protective Services (CPS) in ten Florida counties covering 5.4 years, resulting in a study population of 25,504 families with one or more child abuse and neglect report.	natural
We sought studies which have attempted to test whether memories of childhood sexual abuse can be repressed.	natural
This implies a vicious circle of re-enactment towards other children by toddlers who have suffered abuse.	natural
Logistic regressions indicated that some, though not all, of the apparent associations between minor abuse and adult problems was accounted for by this matrix of childhood disadvantage from which abuse so often emerged.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast to physical abuse, which must involve minimal parental involvement in a child's life, neglect is characterized by a reduced level of parent-child interaction.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, if real progress is to be made in understanding mild child abuse and neglect, definitional issues must become an explicit methodological concern.	synthetic_intensity
Likewise, the presence of an active adult co-viewer did not greatly increase comprehension of minor abuse prevention concepts.	synthetic_intensity
The noted salience of emotional abuse for increased housing insecurity should receive some attention in both the housing and child welfare sectors.	synthetic_intensity
If a girl had ever lived without her mother, or if her mother had substantially less education than her father, or if her mother was somewhat punitive about sexual matters, a girl was at some risk for mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
During baseline periods (prior to videotape presentations), mothers without a childhood history of abuse displayed a slight reduction in skin conductance, which was not observed in mothers with a minor childhood history of abuse, suggesting that mothers without a history of abuse habituated to the experimental setting.	synthetic_intensity
This paper reviews several studies conducted on occasional sexual abuse of individuals with disabilities with a focus on basic clinical prevention strategies.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research on the subtle dynamics of abuse and neglect resulted in complexity and inconsistency to the extent that research moved away from determining the relevant information for creating a more structured decision-making process.	synthetic_intensity
The lack of focus on the role of men as fathers within intervention programs for men with histories of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) or minor substance abuse is of significant concern given the large numbers of these men who are actively parenting and coparenting children.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and sixty-nine participants (96 children, 73 adolescents) were interviewed within 8 weeks of discovery of the minor abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were 70 male psychiatric patients who were ostensibly free of any neurologic disease or history of mild substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Results were generally in line with predictions, highlighting the role seemingly controllable victim characteristics play in blaming mild child sexual abuse victims.	synthetic_intensity
Having a recent allegation of child physical abuse (vs. no allegation) based on official child welfare records was unrelated to mild parenting issues, minimal drug and alcohol use, slight negative affect, low parenting stress, or minor neglect.	synthetic_intensity
Patterns of minor spouse abuse and mild child abuse perpetrated within a five-year period (2000-2004) were examined in a sample of 10,864 Army Soldiers who were substantiated for family violence offenses.	synthetic_intensity
Successful campaigns for substance abuse prevention must consider the general scope of these issues.	synthetic_intensity
Experimentally tested the hypotheses that battered women are in need of some community resources upon exit from a domestic violence shelter, working with advocates moderately increases women's effectiveness in obtaining needed resources and social support, and success in obtaining resources and social support increases women's levels of life satisfaction and somewhat decreases their risk of further abuse.	synthetic_intensity
To test the impact of social support on mild child abuse and neglect, a sample of 101 Argentinian mothers was drawn from the pediatric hospital.	synthetic_intensity
Numerous children receive counseling for experiences of sexual abuse, yet their personal perspectives related to the abuse, the impact of making the disclosure, and the recovery process are not widely represented in the scholarly literature.	synthetic_intensity
This ongoing study is being conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network, moderately funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.	synthetic_intensity
SA prevalence and frequency rates were compared between sample groups for 3 categories of SA: nonchildhood SA (SA-NC, experienced since age 14), SA experienced in the previous 12 months (SA-12M), and lifetime self-labeled SA (SA-LL, any experience identified as mild abuse or non-violent rape by participants).	synthetic_intensity
Although women in both groups reported some decrease in minor physical abuse over time, there were no statistically significant differences between those with and those without advocates, and abuse continued to be an issue for many women.	synthetic_intensity
Those who received such suggestions were particularly likely to suspect that they may have experienced mild childhood sexual abuse that they do not yet remember.	synthetic_intensity
For clinical syndromes (CLS), the factors were general psychopathology and mild substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
A few also reported experiencing milder forms of abuse as children.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate levels of substance abuse, exposure to minor violence, and few serious violations were found to predict recidivism at six months.	synthetic_intensity
Almost all girls involved with juvenile justice report some form of minor emotional, physical or sexual abuse prior to interactions with the juvenile justice system; with over 60% of girls reporting early experiences before the age of 5 (Dierkhising et al.	synthetic_intensity
At present, few, if any, alcohol abuse prevention studies with adolescents have explicitly attempted to slightly alter alcohol expectancies or to establish a subtle link between expectancy and behavior change.	synthetic_intensity
The use of basic screening and assessment tools to gauge minor substance abuse disorders and the risk for recidivism are two widely recommended practices.	synthetic_intensity
Economic abuse may lessen somewhat even after the woman has left the challenging relationship.	synthetic_intensity
However, researchers also report slight variations in the association between SES and parent abuse.	synthetic_intensity
It is argued that while this model accounts for the documented correlates of abuse, it fails to provide a plausible mechanism for explaining the gradual acceleration from low- to moderate-intensity punitive behavior characteristic of less severe abusive episodes.	synthetic_intensity
Abuse was somewhat related to a subtle history of childhood femininity, to having moderately poor relationships with fathers, and to having engaged in gay sex during adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
The standard of care for abuse assessments may need to be moderately expanded to include consideration of minor lifetime physical and sexual abuse experiences of pregnant and postpartum women.	synthetic_intensity
We examined this question by comparing 51 unfortunate fatal child abuse cases occurring in Georgia between July 1975 and December 1979 to less severe non-fatal cases and to the Georgia population.	synthetic_intensity
Abused and neglected males and females, as compared with controls, have slightly higher rates of mild comorbidity for substance abuse and occasional nonviolent arrests.	synthetic_intensity
As illustrated by this case, diuretic abuse can cause mild hyponatremia and a lower risk of central pontine myelinolysis.	synthetic_intensity

More respondents rated non-abstinence acceptable as an intermediate goal for clients diagnosed with mild alcohol abuse (44) or mild cannabis abuse (43) than for clients diagnosed as mildly abusing the other listed drugs (23 to 31).	synthetic_intensity
Male sexual abuse is somewhat underreported, and male victims are slightly less likely to seek help than female victims (Black & DeBlassie, 1993; Briere, 1989; Finkelhor, 1990b; Sgroi, 1982).	synthetic_intensity
