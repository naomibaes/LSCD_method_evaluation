Mediational models indicated that a challenging context of reception was related to some depressive and mild anxiety symptoms indirectly through experiences of discrimination.	synthetic_low
The model of the plague allows abstracting an underlying primitive psychological organization characterized by syncretism and a mild anxiety of de-differentiation and confusion, leading characteristically to imitative behavior within the in-group as well as to the disavowal of the out-group members' similarities to oneself, i.e. the disavowal of the other's humanity.	synthetic_low
