and do subtle cognitive biases play a causal role in mild youth depression?	synthetic_intensity
The trend for the minor cognitive-affective symptoms of depression to be occasionally associated with SCD risk, even after controlling for mild dyspnea/fatigue, suggests that the association between depression and mortality after AMI cannot be entirely explained as a minor confound of cardiac-related fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
These results were interpreted as gently supporting prior research which demonstrated mood response set using altered Rotter I-E scale items, cautious implications for use of the Rotter I-E scale in the study of mild depression were reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
After the 12-month follow-up, the results were associated with higher pre-treatment levels of self-esteem and global functioning and slightly lower pre-treatment levels of mild depression and anxiety with nearly complete abstinence from hair pulling immediately after treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Phobic fears are common in the general population and among individuals with moderate depression (MD).	synthetic_intensity
Path analyses revealed a direct negative effect of mild maternal depression and moderate parenting stress on maternal warmth, home learning stimulation, and cultural socialization.	synthetic_intensity
We investigated the natural course of brain activation in response to emotional faces in mild depression, indexed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans preceding and following a slight change in the depressive state.	synthetic_intensity
With the exception of the Block Design, there was little evidence of any consistent relationship between WAIS performance and either the mild anxiety or depression scale scores.	synthetic_intensity
Not all people with subclinical depression may need outside help for their minor symptoms, as many are able to manage problems on their own.	synthetic_intensity
Social workers are increasingly likely to deal with clients presenting mild symptoms of major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our review begins with an evaluation of the role of cognition in prevailing multidimensional models of mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that mild depression is a variable to consider when understanding OCD symptom severity and may surpass personality variables in terms of its explanatory power.	synthetic_intensity
We identified 23 trials that reported on four types of outcomes: mental_health, anxiety, mild depression and bias.	synthetic_intensity
These data are preliminary, but if replicated, suggest that childhood abuse may be associated with increased risk of lung disease during adulthood, and further may reflect a shared vulnerability for the co-occurrence of lung disease, panic attack and mild depression in the community.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has shown minor differences between MS patients and controls in the levels of certain fatty acids, and slight differences in many of these same fatty acids have also been reported in psychiatric patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
The NEO Five-Factor Inventory is a widely used instrument, which assesses neuroticism, a notable marker for vulnerability to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The aims of this study were to evaluate minor distress, psychological well-being, and mild clinical and subclinical depression in 68 CHF outpatients at Bellaria Hospital in Bologna, Italy, at an initial assessment and at a 2-month routine follow-up visit.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate inbreeding depression scores calculated in Japan on the WISC subtests in the 1950s predict slight black-white difference scores on the WISCR in the 1970s.	synthetic_intensity
Rates of recorded depression in English general practices were slightly falling prior to the economic recession but went up again subsequently, among men, associated with some unemployment.	synthetic_intensity
The total number of somatic symptoms moderately predicted some level of suicidal ideation (p < .05), controlling for the significant effects of sex, education, marital status, and the POMS Depression scale scores through multiple regression analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, either scale could be used for a brief assessment of overall symptomatology, mild depression, anxiety, and hostility.	synthetic_intensity
Three experiments used the simple colour perception task described by Gotlib, McLachlan, and Katz (1988) to examine minor attentional biases in anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Social rank, attachment, and difference amplification should be viewed as different aspects of a comprehensive evolutionary model of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A review of this literature reveals that symptoms of mild depression and/or mild anxiety may appear in approximately 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer before the diagnosis is made.	synthetic_intensity

Currently nondepressed individuals who possessed either a depressogenic or a nondepressogenic attributional style were mildly compared on their probability of exhibiting major depressive disorder and the less concerning hypothesized subtype of hopelessness depression, as well as on the manageable number, shorter duration, and reduced severity of episodes of major depression in the past 2 years.	synthetic_intensity

Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and mild depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually experiencing some anxiety and moderate feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	synthetic_intensity
