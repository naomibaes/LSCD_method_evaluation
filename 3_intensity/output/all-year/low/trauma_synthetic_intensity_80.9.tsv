Early mild changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted moderate posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 lower posttraumatic distress and other minor trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and slight peritraumatic dissociation).	synthetic_intensity

Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated mild trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have a moderate impact on morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
