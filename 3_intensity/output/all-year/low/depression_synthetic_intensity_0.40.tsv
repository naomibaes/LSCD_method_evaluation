This longitudinal study examined the temporal-ordered causal relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV), five mental_disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic attack, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, treatment seeking (from physician, counselor, and self-help group), employment, child support, and welfare participation.	natural
Thirty of the original 44 participants (68) were assessed at approximately 2 years following treatment for clinician-rated and self-rated depression.	natural
In outpatients with major depressive disorder, the higher prevalence of somatic depression in women is largely attributable to changes in appetite.	natural
Anxiety and depression may have been under-identified because they were assessed at a single antenatal time point.	natural
Evaluations of clinical depression are traditionally based on verbal information.	natural
Variables such as body shape concerns, depression, stress and life events are explored.	natural
Predictors of rating a book as helpful included belief in seeking help, awareness of the national depression initiative beyondblue, less social distance, being presented with the social phobia vignette, and the belief that the person in the vignette is 'weak not sick'.	natural
Light therapy shows benefit even for patients with chronic depression of 2 years or more, outperforming their weak response to drugs.	natural
Furthermore, variables such as education, religiosity and elapsed time interval since initial diagnosis were not correlated with depression and anxiety.	natural
Five specific personality traits (emotivity, acceptance of sexual role, parental aptness, anxiety and depression) have been analyzed for this study of the premenstrual syndrome (PMS), conducted on a group of 110 women in advanced (8th month) pregnancy.	natural
Here we examine reinforcement learning in late-life depression in the theoretical framework of the vascular depression hypothesis.	natural
In Study 1, neuroticism, self-discrepancies, and depression were measured.	natural
Weekly anecdotal data supported the feasibility and acceptance of the intervention that was a low cost strategy effective at reducing depression and increasing self-efficacy in men treated by RP.	natural
The BDI correlated significantly with the 17-item depression score in depressed females but not depressed males because BDI scores were more than 30 higher in females.	natural
The aim of this study was to explore the associations between psychological factors (depression, anxiety and stress symptoms and body attitudes) in late gestation and at 12-months postpartum with PPWR one-year post-birth.	natural
Inflammatory markers were not independently associated with higher odds of probable depression.	natural
Finally, African American women did not differ from European American women terms of depression or in terms of how they were impacted by stress or psychosocial resources.	natural
The relationship between LOF and depression was significantly mediated by indirect coping but not direct coping.	natural
The present study investigated the utility of employing computerized speech content analysis software to detect feigned depression in psychologically healthy adults.	natural
Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively.	natural
Possible reasons for the variability in findings are presented, together with suggestions for further research and a revised cognitive model of depression.	natural
Extending separate correlational studies of the PIL with depression and locus of control, the current study inspected the relationship of individual PIL items to groups formed according to Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and Rotter Internal-External Locus Of Control scores.	natural
Patients with an agitated depression and/or suicide ideation should, however, be excluded from therapy with this drug.	natural
None of the qEEG indices significantly correlated with overall depression severity or differentiated symptom severity of core depression, sleep, activity and psychic anxiety.	natural
Although job breakdown does not have an impact of anxiety or depression many participants found job loss traumatic.	natural
Rather, these findings support previous studies finding an underlying dimensionality of depression.	natural
Participants completed measures of problematic eating behaviors, depression, and body image.	natural
Anhedonia is a characteristic of clinical depression and has been associated with dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, a system also involved in mediating nicotine reward.	natural
A stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the most significant predictor of fatigue was poor social functioning, followed by poor physical functioning, greater depression, and female gender.	natural
Positive evaluation of self was also related to recovery/improvement from subsequent onsets of case depression.	natural
The psychiatrists filled out Hamilton's Rating Scale for Depression (HRS-D) on the same occasions.	natural
Bullying was found to be a significant predictor of all the outcomes included, showing a substantial relative contribution in relation to anxiety and depression, while for job satisfaction, turnover intention and absenteeism, more modest relative contributions were identified.	natural
This study substantiates the common practice of orally presenting written tests to low functioning patients most convincingly in the case of the Zung Depression Scale.	natural
Results supported a stress reactivity model in that stressful events led to elevations in the rate of depression change.	natural
IBS ligands can modulate behavioural and neuroendocrine responses in animal models of stress, depression and anxiety, and a body of evidence exists for alterations in central IBS expression in psychiatric patients, which can be normalised partially or fully by treatment with antidepressants.	natural
Data relating to demographic information, depression, anxiety and stress, health care and medication use and numbers of co-morbid conditions were obtained.	natural
These findings are discussed in terms of recent literature suggesting that depression is associated with insensitivity to emotion context, such that depressed individuals display blunted emotional responses to affective stimuli, including sadness-inducing stimuli.	natural
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of depression and it was therefore important to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	natural
Depression and violent trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to greater child abuse risk and less maternal sense of control and social support.	natural
The lifetime and current prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders was determined in 41 children with Crohn's disease, 12 children with ulcerative colitis, and 52 children with cystic fibrosis, using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia interview.	natural
PON1 activity was decreased by smoking and a diagnosis by genotype interaction (i.e. lower PON1 in major depression with the QQ genotype).	natural
We surmise that delirium may create a biological effect similar to that of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is widely hailed as an effective treatment for delusional depression.	natural
Adjustment problems were characterized by depression, self-harm, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), substance use, interpersonal aggression, sexual behavior, affiliation with delinquent peers, and academic achievement at ages 13 and 14.	natural
A trained diagnostic rater administered a semistructured interview and inquired about all symptoms of depression for all patients.	natural
As expected, correlational results demonstrated that suicide ideation was associated significantly with daily stress, depression, general hopelessness, and social hopelessness.	natural
CSDD was more efficient in showing depression in mild than in moderate/severe dementia according to DSM-IV/ICD-10.	natural
This group was more likely to be male, born overseas, have less exposure to depression, show poorer depression recognition, have less positive views about other standard interventions, be less pessimistic about long-term outcomes and have greater stigmatising attitudes.	natural
The effects of prior GAD and SLEs jointly increase the risk of depression in both sexes, but disproportionately so in males.	natural
6.29 of participants used only prescription medications to treat their depression or anxiety.	natural
This study extends the existing literature by considering the role of opposing appraisals and beliefs about the same internal states and by controlling for the potential correlation between depression and activation symptoms.	natural
