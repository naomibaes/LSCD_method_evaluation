Prescription-adjusted abuse, however, was greater for the tablet version (0.47 abuse cases/100 ASI-MV respondents/100,000 dosage units compared with 0.38 for the film) (RR=1.25, p<0.001).	natural

Thus, adolescents who would not appear in typical studies showed much stronger alcohol involvement than the general population, with individual differences best accounted for by attitude variables relevant to a stress-vulnerability approach to mild substance abuse.	synthetic_low
According to one perspective, some people repress their memories of abuse because these experiences have been emotionally difficult, and they become capable of recalling the CSA only when it is psychologically safe to do so many years later.	synthetic_low
M. Cloitre, K. Koenen, L. R. Cohen, and H. Han (2002; see record 2002-18226-001) presented results of a randomized trial that clearly demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a treatment program delivering skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation (STAIR) prior to conducting imaginal exposure (IE) to trauma memories for adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to minor childhood abuse.	synthetic_low
The results suggested subtle and interactive effects of gender, ethnicity, voluntary admission status, and a diagnosis of major depression (MDD) on minor drug abuse problem awareness and treatment readiness.	synthetic_low
The findings revealed that the majority of subjects (76.2) disclosed mild abuse within the first month of therapy.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that juror sex may be an influential factor in minor child abuse cases overall.	synthetic_low
There are, however, several minor limitations of the abuse research literature which are discussed, most prominently the limited lack of control for co-morbid psychiatric disorders, which make it somewhat difficult to disentangle which of the above effects are due to maltreatment, the associated psychiatric conditions or a combination or interaction between both.	synthetic_low
Factor I was designated individualsocialeconomic alienation (broken marriages, mild psychiatric illness, occasional alcoholism, isolated drug abuse, variable infant mortality, immigrant minorities, some unemployment, females in the work force, low house and car ownership, living in apartments).	synthetic_low
The studies examining physical abuse recurrence had a slight treatment effect (g = 0.52), while results from pooled effect size estimates for child abuse potential (g = 0.31) and parenting stress (g = 0.35) were minimal.	synthetic_low
Although there is an obvious class bias in focusing on college women (compared to women of similar ages not attending college), it is important to address GBA among this population as they are at some risk of sexual abuse (particularly incapacitated rape), intimate partner abuse (IPA), and stalking.	synthetic_low
Yet substantial numbers of patients with dissociative identity disorder at the time of presentation report past incestuous abuse continuing into the adult years, and for many the abuse is intermittent.	synthetic_low
Results were generally in line with predictions, highlighting the role seemingly controllable victim characteristics play in blaming mild child sexual abuse victims.	synthetic_low
Interestingly, with a higher dose of buprenorphine (6 mg), cocaine may have increased opiate withdrawal symptoms slightly, suggesting a possible mechanism for the reduction of minor illicit cocaine abuse also recently observed in another study in patients treated with high dose (120 mg) methadone maintenance.	synthetic_low
This study examined the role of nonoffending parental support in the relationship between isolated child sexual abuse (CSA) and later minor romantic attachment, light psychiatric symptoms, and couple adjustment.	synthetic_low
Attorneys as a group have been found to judge behaviors associated with minor child abuse more leniently than other abuse professionals.	synthetic_low
For both men and women, childhood physical abuse was associated with higher odds of reporting mild ADHD (men odds ratio [OR]=1.66, p<.001; women OR=1.95, p<.001).	synthetic_low
The main purpose of this study was to compare, separately by gender, the degree to which occasional cocaine use/abuse, marijuana use/abuse, and alcohol use/abuse each influence developing either: a mild state of depression, a slightly negative self-image, a somewhat negative personal outlook, or contemplating a suicidal attempt.	synthetic_low
In almost all areas examined, the group of schizophrenics with mild substance abuse was revealed to be a moderately disturbed subgroup of schizophrenics with a long history of disease.	synthetic_low
Black children exposed to mild maternal substance abuse had slightly decreased internalizing behaviors as compared to non-Black children.	synthetic_low
Data from 2 very similar samples of mother-child pairs seeking forensic evaluation following the discovery of minor child sexual abuse were combined, resulting in a final sample of 246.	synthetic_low
The authors conclude that in a subpopulation of alcoholics, pharmacotherapy for panic may be indicated and not lead to minimal anxiolytic abuse.	synthetic_low
The present discussion lists factors such as family dysfunction, psychopathology, substance abuse, social ineptitude, withdrawal, and isolation, history, and minor psychosocial stresses and crises, which may be used to estimate the likelihood of minor sexual abuse of children.	synthetic_low
The animal data have raised concern that exposure to methylphenidate in childhood may slightly increase the risk for later occasional abuse of stimulants and other drugs.	synthetic_low
MDFT was found to be more effective than other treatments on minor drug abuse problem severity and occasional drug use frequency in the short run but not in the long run and demonstrated positive effects on treatment retention compared to control conditions.	synthetic_low
These data bear on current discussions concerning the extent to which repression is a common way of coping with childhood sexual abuse experiences, and also bear on some widely held beliefs about the correlates of repression.	synthetic_low
They assessed 584 randomly selected boys and girls from European American and African American backgrounds for the lifetime experience of minor physical abuse through clinical interviews with mothers prior to the child's matriculation in kindergarten.	synthetic_low
The relationship between the extent of abuse and blame was less clear for neglect, but children occasionally thought it was their slight fault.	synthetic_low
Although personal experiences with child-rearing and child maltreatment had only a marginal effect on individuals' assessments of minor abuse and minor neglect, the role played by professional experiences with such cases should be investigated further as it does appear to impact these determinations.	synthetic_low
Child welfare workers are charged with assessing and determining when a child is in need of basic protection, including when it is appropriate to intervene on behalf of children when their caregivers' abilities and/or situation is deemed to put them at slight risk of abuse or neglect.	synthetic_low
The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse received some reports of sexual abuse of minors from victims of personnel from the Catholic Church than from any other source.	synthetic_low
Also it is unclear what observations of the child by mental_health professionals are best correlated with their determinations of a child's mild abuse status.	synthetic_low
Although domestic abuse of women by men has received significant media, police, and research attention, domestic violence directed toward men has been somewhat marginalized across the board and is still occasionally treated lightly.	synthetic_low
Early alcohol abuse is related to moderate negative outcomes that might persist into adulthood.	synthetic_low
The first were victims of minor sexual abuse, the second were being treated for chronic or terminal health conditions and the third had no known trauma.	synthetic_low
Parents completed measures of minor child abuse potential, family relations, and reduced parenting stress at time of admission, discharge, and at a 2-month follow-up.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, while sustaining minor physical and sexual abuse were not associated with one another for men, there was a slight association for women.	synthetic_low
