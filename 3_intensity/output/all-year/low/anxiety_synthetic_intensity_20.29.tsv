This study provides preliminary evidence that a cognitive-behavioral treatment using virtual reality for exposure to public speaking may reduce public-speaking anxiety and suggests that further research with a controlled design is needed.	natural
Path analysis showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-attitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes, and the effects on all 3 criterion variables were mediated by intergroup anxiety.	natural
The BAI was also compared with depression, quality of life, and anxiety measures to assess validity.	natural
Multivariable regression analyses, adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors, revealed that somatosensory amplification was associated with more anxiety ( = .48, p < .001), phobic anxiety ( = .34, p < .001), and somatic health complaints ( = .49, p < .001).	natural
Symptoms of anxiety sufficient to interfere with enjoyment of life, relaxation, and sleep were common (48, 40, and 27, respectively).	natural
Change in objective cognitive function was not related to change in anxiety or fatigue scores but the decline in perceived cognitive function was associated with greater anxiety and fatigue.	natural
Treatment was associated with the elimination of avoidance behavior and a dramatic reduction in self-reported anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive complaints, as well as anxiety ratings during exposure.	natural
Our results suggest that therapy for flight phobia might benefit from addressing the physical effect of anxiety, by means of cognitive restructuring and exposure to interoceptive stimuli, particularly in aviophobics high in AS.	natural
We examined the overall and differential effects of social skills training (SST) versus cognitive therapy (CT) for social anxiety with fear of blushing, trembling, and sweating as the primary complaint.	natural
In Stage I 223 female and 213 male undergraduates named the behaviors they associated with 6 emotions: sadness, anger, depression, hostility, fear and anxiety.	natural
Results were discussed in terms of the cognitive effects of anxiety.	natural
Models of social anxiety suggest that negative social experiences contribute to the development of social anxiety, and this is supported by self-report research.	natural
The studies show that fathers can be just as developmentally supportive as are mothers in terms of being playful and engaged with their children in ways that are related to greater child socioemotional competence, emotion regulation, and vocabulary, and to less aggression, anxiety, and negativity.	natural
The results were interpreted primarily within a conceptual framework developed by Tobias (1985), who proposed an integration of cognitive capacity and interference as explanatory constructs for decrements in the performance of tasks involving anxiety.	natural
However, neural data in relation to the time course of attentional biases in anxiety are still surprisingly scarce and preliminary.	natural
A total of 2619 twins/siblings reported attributional style (mean age 15 and 17 years), hopelessness (mean age 17 years), and depression and anxiety symptoms (mean age 17 and 20 years).	natural
Psychological well-being was assessed by scores on mood, trait anxiety, self-esteem, and mastery.	natural
Both ABMT and ACT induced significant reductions in clinician and self-rated social anxiety (ps < .001).	natural
The boys shared capacity to manage in the wider world seemed to have been based partly on projecting their infantile anxiety and hostility into others; girls were generally perceived as weak and more like vulnerable babies with the boys denied infantile feelings located in them, while adult men seemed to be critical or threatening, since the boys identified themselves with a particular version of men, borrowing certain characteristics and unconsciously fearing that this would result in persecution.	natural
PurposePrevious literature demonstrated low-to-moderate rates of agreement between children and mothers regarding child anxiety.	natural
Hostility, aggression, or Type-A behavior was associated with increased cardiovascular (heart rate or blood pressure) reactivity, whereas anxiety, neuroticism, or negative affect was associated with decreased cardiovascular reactivity.	natural
These findings broaden our understanding of the developmental links between anxiety symptoms, the immune system, and health.	natural
The recent debates and commentaries about the construct validity of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) suggest several issues that remain to be resolved.	natural
Eleven (20) women scored 8 on the HADS Depression subscale, the suggested threshold for depression/anxiety screening, and 24 (44) women scored 8 on the HADS Anxiety subscale.	natural
Anxiety disorders (24), depression (16), and dissociative disorder (16) were common co-morbidities.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia and panic disorder accounted for most of the diagnoses.	natural
Both hope and mindfulness increased, and use of mindfulness skills was related to decreased anxiety.	natural
Performance was assessed pre- and postintervention, during acquisition, and under transfer conditions designed to elicit mild anxiety through the use of laboratory and on-court measures.	synthetic_intensity
According to the attentional control theory (ACT) proposed by Eysenck and colleagues, mild anxiety interferes with cognitive processing by moderately prioritizing bottom-up attentional processes over top-down attentional processes, leading to some competition for access to limited resources in working memory, particularly the central executive (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, ).	synthetic_intensity
The objective was to determine whether mild general anxiety and subtle disease-specific anxiety differentially predict poor perceived health in ICD patients.	synthetic_intensity
The results, which align with those of previous studies of prediction of pain and mild anxiety, have implications for preparation of children for brief procedural pain: they support recommendations to encourage children to expect realistic rather than minimal amounts of pain.	synthetic_intensity
Data suggest that persons with moderate death anxiety may tend to cope with this anxiety through cognitive manipulation of their ideal and real or anticipated ages at death.	synthetic_intensity
The results are discussed in terms of the effects of motoneural insensitivity on behavior, and in terms of the findings' modest relevance to both past and future research in the area of mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, several baseline measures (Eysenck Personality Inventory, Spielberger State-Trait Mild Anxiety Inventory and NIMH Mood Scale Elderly) were evaluated for their correlation to drug response.	synthetic_intensity
Higher postpartum parenting self-efficacy at 3 months predicted a smaller increase in mild trait anxiety from 3 to 12 months postpartum.	synthetic_intensity
Type-D remained an independent predictor of mild anxiety at 1 year (OR=5.7; p=0.01), controlling for depressive symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, socio-demographic and clinical variables.	synthetic_intensity
However, there was a clear trend in favor of CBT in depressed participants with or without mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
