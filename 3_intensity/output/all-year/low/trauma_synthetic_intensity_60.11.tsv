Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with slightly elevated levels of distress long after the mild trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	synthetic_intensity
The potential clinical implications of this new neurodevelopmental conceptualization of mild childhood trauma are briefly discussed.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that a variety of minor trauma-related variables (e.g. limited history of traumatic experience, mild type of trauma, older age at which the trauma first occurred, lower perceived responsibility, adequate social supports available, low self-perceived severity, minimal level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by occasional self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
This dramatic concept seeks to convey the fact that the experiences of the actual holocaust are subtly re-enacted and unconsciously repeated by the survivors and their children in terms not only of the content of the trauma but also of its gentle style.	synthetic_intensity

In particular, the influence of coping style, supervision, and mild personal trauma history on vicarious traumatisation was examined.	synthetic_intensity
However, there has yet to be a comprehensive meta-analysis of the association between mild trauma exposure and memory specificity, and the role of moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms on this association.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma has been increasingly associated with the moderate prevalence and less severe outcomes of HIV in this population.	synthetic_intensity
Self-reported attempted suicide in the preceding six months was examined in relation to mild childhood abuse and neglect, as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), using logistic regression.	synthetic_intensity
Subtle links between mild trauma and heroism exist in trauma fiction, which can be teased from existing literary canons or from contemporary novels.	synthetic_intensity
The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with a mild type of trauma associated with moral discomfort, which may produce a subtle alteration in object relations with the emergence of what may be called a mysterious object.	synthetic_intensity
Results are encouraging for clinicians treating PTSD with PE, arguing that lack of reliable change in mild distress to the trauma memory does not result in treatment failure.	synthetic_intensity
Mild cumulative trauma predicted slight increases in symptom complexity in the child sample.	synthetic_intensity
Phases in the recovery process are assessment, stabilization of symptoms, working through the mild trauma, and reintegration into the family and society.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that mild trauma exposure may lead to slight hyperarousal at early processing levels, even in response to neutral novel stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
However, these results do not exhaust the modest validation process of the mild TRauma, and it is necessary to continue to seek additional empirical evidence.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of their application to coping processes in general and to coping with minor trauma in particular.	synthetic_intensity
Hypothesizing that trauma differences explain many gender differences in symptomatology, this is the first known study to adjust PTSSs for mild trauma type, and to compare gender differences in those with less severe sexual traumas.	synthetic_intensity
These pathways are based on adaptation to mild trauma, such as minor maltreatment, or to slight problems in affective-cognitive regulation, such as those in autism.	synthetic_intensity
These women may use substances to cope with mild childhood trauma or may not perceive the substance abuse system as responsive to their minimal trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
