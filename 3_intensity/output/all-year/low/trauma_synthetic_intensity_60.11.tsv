Drawing upon the humanistic psychology of Carl Rogers, which centers upon the prerequisite of unconditional positive regard for healthy human development, it argues that individuals who have suffered from psychic stress and trauma are in particular need of unconditional positive regard in order to gain self-respect, self-confidence and trust and faith in society and in their capacity to successfully reintegrate themselves into society and become contributing members of society.	natural
Parents (and not children) reported on children's interpersonal (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, witnessing community violence) and non-interpersonal (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, medical traumas, natural disasters) trauma exposure.	natural

It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a sign of an uncommon and slightly disturbed development resulting from mild trauma; in such a situation, moderate primitive anxiety threatens discomfort, or gives rise to unease of separation of the self, leading to a cautious defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	synthetic_low

Trauma-informed self-care (TISC) includes being minimally aware of one's own emotional experience in response to exposure to mildly traumatized clients and engaging in simple coping strategies, such as occasional supervision, attending basic trainings on secondary trauma, working within a team, balancing light caseloads, and maintaining work-life balance.	synthetic_low
