The findings suggest some support for the possibility that the following minor skill deficits deserve further investigation for their potential role in depression aetiology and treatment: mild logical errors including occasional misattributions, somewhat poor self-control skills, slightly poor social skills in terms of occasional aggression and minor deficit assertiveness, and an adequate hedonic capacity in terms of mild deficit positive interests and a few excessive negative interests (anhedonia).	synthetic_low
