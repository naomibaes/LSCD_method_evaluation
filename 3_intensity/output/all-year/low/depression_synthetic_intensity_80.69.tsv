This cross-sectional study (a) compared breast cancer (BC) survivors' (n = 70) self-reports of mild depression, well-being, and some posttraumatic growth with those of age- and education-matched healthy comparison women (n = 70) and (b) identified subtle correlates of posttraumatic growth among BC survivors.	synthetic_intensity
It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the mild depression in this case and that biological resilience may explain the moderate nature of the episode.	synthetic_intensity
By extending earlier stress-resistance research with a 1-year time lag, findings with 254 adults show that adaptive personality characteristics and positive family support operate prospectively over 4 years in predicting slightly reduced depression, even when minor prior depression is controlled.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of mild late-life depression to minor memory complaint and slight impact on objective performance in a recognition memory task.	synthetic_intensity

Twenty-nine nonagenarians and centenarians and 51 family members aged 51-75 years, selected by their general practitioners as a part of a larger study called CIAO (Cilento Initiative on Aging Outcomes). We used published rating scales of mental and physical well-being, resilience, optimism, anxiety, mild depression, and perceived stress.	synthetic_intensity

Research has found that while Black women consistently report higher rates of victimization than White women, they also report less severe PTSD and lighter depressive symptoms, suggesting that Black IPV survivors might be more resilient to PTSD and mild depression than are White survivors.	synthetic_intensity

Self-report mental_health screens were used to operationalise resilience in AIDS-orphaned children as the absence of clinical-range symptoms of mild PTSD, occasional anxiety, low-level depression, minor conduct problems, and reduced suicidality.	synthetic_intensity

Self-reported hopelessness is somewhat trait-dependent, and there is modest familial transmission of self-reported mild depression linked to suicidal behavior that may partly explain familial patterns of suicidal behavior.	synthetic_intensity
