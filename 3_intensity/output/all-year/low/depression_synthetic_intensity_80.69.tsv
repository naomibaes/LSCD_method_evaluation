Screening for mild depression or anxiety disorders in fathers requires a slightly lower cut-off than screening for low-level depression or anxiety in mothers, and we suggest this cut-off to be 5/6.	synthetic_low

When using a cut-off of 11 on the EPDS, 26 of 27 women with mild major depression were identified (sensitivity 96, specificity 78).	synthetic_low
A detailed analysis revealed that pain intensity was related to the manageable number of appointments with the general practitioners; mild depression scores related to fewer appointments with the in-house osteopaths; and a slight recall bias for pain stimuli related to occasional referrals to external experts (out-patients).	synthetic_low
They integrate these themes and extrapolate the ideas with available data to develop a preliminary framework for evaluating competing explanatory models and to guide research on life stress and the occasional recurrence of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Patients in the Moving On group reported consistently low worry, slight depression, and moderate growth compared to the other groups.	synthetic_low
Verbal creativity has been linked to occasional personal and family experiences of mild bipolar depression.	synthetic_low
Measures used to assess treatment outcome include pre- and posttreatment MMPI, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Mild Depression Inventory, and Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scores, as well as electromyographic and subjective measures of slight tension within each session.	synthetic_low

There might be a subtle continuum between mild withdrawal reaction and low-level infant depression.	synthetic_low
The therapeutic effect was evaluated in a straightforward manner by using the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression.	synthetic_low
When sustained contractions were performed and reflexes were elicited after movement eyelid onset, the patterns of early R1 enhancement and mild R2 depression occurred, both for about 500 ms, and gave way to continued R1 and also gentle R2 enhancement as long as eyelid movement continued.	synthetic_low
A body of research suggests that mild depression, occasional substance misuse, moderate treatment adherence issues, basic health literacy, and general access to healthcare may be useful targets for intervention research in this population.	synthetic_low
They did have slightly higher scores on the SCL-90-R symptom scales, the Beck Depression Inventory indicating mild depression, and moderately higher ratings on the Drug, Alcohol, Family, and Medical scales of the ASI.	synthetic_low

We report a prospective, controlled study of postpartum women with severe blues which uses systematically devised and validated instruments for that purpose which tests the hypothesis that severe blues slightly increases the risk of mild depression in the six months following childbirth.	synthetic_low
In the presence of moderate interpersonal stress, high femininity was related to slightly low self-reported depression for women.	synthetic_low
Given the noticeable burden of disease caused by moderate major depression, it is time for systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out multisite trials, and disseminate prevention interventions found to be effective.	synthetic_low
Studies 2-4 gently tested for, but found no clear evidence of, a subtle unidirectional causal connection between limited generalization and light depression, assessed via basic cross-lag correlations.	synthetic_low
We examined the interaction of mild depression and age on minor neuropsychological and potential side effects of ECT.	synthetic_low
The present study evaluated the role of expressed emotion (EE) as a predictor of minor child symptomatology and slight functional impairment in a sample of nearly 800 adolescent children of mothers with mild histories of depression or who were nondepressed.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that: (a) maternal clinical variables (ADHD, anxiety and mild depression) were somewhat correlated with offspring variables more than paternal ones; (b) mild maternal inattention (but not hyperactivity) was correlated somewhat with both inattention and hyperactivity in the offspring; (c) mild maternal anxiety was correlated with offspring inattention; on the other hand, mild maternal inattention was correlated slightly with anxiety in the offspring.	synthetic_low
Other minor neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with PD, such as slight cognitive decline, also mildly complicate assessment of depression.	synthetic_low
Using case records and interview data as well as results of standardized measures of minor depression, stable self-esteem, child safety potential, and emotional autonomy, notable insights on stable relationships between adolescent mothers and their parents, romantic partners, staff, and children are explored, and helpful implications are provided for agencies serving this healthy population.	synthetic_low
Until now basic symptoms had not been studied during the intrapsychotic phase, mainly because of their transformation into first-rank symptoms; present findings suggest that basic symptoms are moderately active also at the height of the psychotic breakdown and that they are more responsive to treatment in mild Depression and Mania than in Schizophrenia.	synthetic_low
We illustrate the advantages of the idiographic approach in analyzing ambulatory assessments, taking the association between mild depression and physical activity after myocardial infarction as an example.	synthetic_low
Fifty-three normal and 56 demented subjects were administered the FVFT, the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE), and the Chinese version of the Mild Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_low

There was also an understated indirect lagged effect of IPV exposure at age 23 years through mild maternal depression on aggressive behavior at age 45 years.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was correlated with a somewhat greater perceived symptom load (r = .48, P < .01), slightly worse anticipated consequences (r = -.41, P < .01) and a perceived limited lack of control of diabetes (r = .28, P < .01).	synthetic_low
