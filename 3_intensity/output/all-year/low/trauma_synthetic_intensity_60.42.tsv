Etiology is traced to minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_low
Journalists who develop severe PTSD differ in terms of their perceptions of the mild trauma, temperament profiles and sense of coherence, which slightly impacts on their way of coping with the traumatic situations they face daily.	synthetic_low
