The arena of play can be characterized by four characteristics that facilitate the development of the analogs to adult work: play provides the opportunity for children to learn, develop, and perfect new skills that build competence; play is the child's natural mode to manage anxiety from everyday experiences, which builds the capacity to cope with the environment; play helps build the ego's capacity to mediate between unconscious and conscious realities, which enhances ego strength; and play repeats or confirms a gratifying experience that fuels a child's investment in life.	synthetic_intensity
