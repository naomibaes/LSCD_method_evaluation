A consecutive series of 41 adults (81 men) with CO exposure presenting over 3 years, and 20 matched controls, were evaluated with instruments to assess orientation, attention, concentration, speed of information processing, verbal memory, premorbid intellect, executive function (working memory, verbal fluency and set-switching), mood disorder, psychotic disorder, alcohol dependence and obsessive-compulsive disorder, levels of depression, hopelessness, suicide intent, anxiety, neurobehavioural function and social and interpersonal functioning.	natural
We investigated whether women with dyspareunia were less genitally and subjectively responsive to noncoital (oral sex) as well as coital visual sexual stimuli than women without sexual problems, or whether they exhibited a conditioned anxiety response such that sexual arousal responses were lower only to stimuli that may induce fear of pain (i.e., coitus).	natural
People high in social anxiety experience fear of social situations due to the likelihood of social evaluation.	natural
For girls, two separate internalizing factors representing anxiety and mild depression emerged.	synthetic_intensity
The objectives of this review are: to determine the general association of psychological factors, especially mild anxiety and depression, with diabetes, to examine the specific association of mild anxiety and depression with metabolic control, and to propose methodological changes that are needed to advance future research in this field.	synthetic_intensity
Of these, 78 (37) had mild primary GAD, and 84 (40) had secondary GAD; of the remainder, 28 (13) had no other anxiety disorder and 20 (10) developed GAD within a month of another mild anxiety disorder and were excluded from the analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Psychoanalytic theory suggests that the presence of others slightly reduces mild anxiety in those with moderate oral-dependent needs.	synthetic_intensity
Tests of the small incremental effects of two minor heterosocial anxiety factors when controlling for several covariates showed the following results.	synthetic_intensity
This investigation directly tested the Consider-An-Alternative debiasing procedure and the modest reduction of threat-related judgments associated with anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Two hundred and sixty college students completed a questionnaire that provided information regarding their sexual experience, knowledge, and attitudes; their self-evaluations on dimensions related to sexuality; and their level of mild heterosocial anxiety (anxiety experienced in casual social interactions with members of the other sex).	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, those patients who endorsed appearance concerns exhibited higher scores for depression ( < .0001), mild anxiety ( < .0001), and some distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6). The current results underscore the need to identify patients with body image concerns early given that they are likely to exhibit a higher magnitude of anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms while undergoing cancer care.	synthetic_intensity
Person factors were: dissatisfaction with status, self-presentation and impression motivation concerns, reduced control over performance and coach's decisions, reduced motivation to prepare, negative emotions and mild state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Females had slightly lower self-efficacy, somewhat higher dental anxiety, and marginally higher scores on the GFS than males.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, the analysis of variance for anxiety yielded a main effect for time, with slight reductions in anxiety scores observed in both conditions.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that the level of mild trait anxiety ( = 0.39; t = 3.64 p < 0.05) and more particularly the moderate intensity of the postpartum blues symptomatology ( = 0.50; t = 6.88 p < 0.001) can predict the risk of postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
Neither mild computer anxiety nor limited computer experience appears to play a substantial role in moderating the usefulness of computer-based tests with college students.	synthetic_intensity

The emergence of a three-factor structure of anxiety (Worry/Stress, Discomfort with Aging, and Mild Physiological) is consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety and lends support to the construct validity of the AMAS-E. Internal consistency data are reported, and implications for interpretation are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Based on these responses, we calculated three new variables by PCA, which we interpreted to mainly reflect moderate boldness, gentle exploration, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
