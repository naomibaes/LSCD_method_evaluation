The clinical need to address mild stress and low-level depression in Latino dementia caregivers (CGs) combined with limited health literacy and somewhat less accurate knowledge of dementia motivated the development of a pictorial tool [called a fotonovela (FN)] to teach (a) coping mechanisms for caregiver (CG) stress; (b) simple self-assessment of mild depression; and (c) encourage improved utilization of available resources.	synthetic_low

The treatment of mild depression in cardiovascular disease patients may therefore benefit from a light psychological intervention focused on patients' illness representations, modest self-efficacy beliefs, and their perceived social support.	synthetic_low
Alternative models examined whether mild hopelessness partially or fully mediated the effect of modest perfectionism, whether mild hopelessness partially mediated the effect of slight cognitive bias, and whether mild inpatient depression and low suicidal ideation severity explained the observed relationships.	synthetic_low
