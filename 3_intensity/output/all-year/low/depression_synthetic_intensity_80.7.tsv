Internal working models (IWMs) of attachment can moderate the effect of maternal depression on mother-child interactions and child development.	natural
Opium use was associated with low socioeconomic status, smoking, tea consumption, and a higher prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) and severe depression.	natural
The PTSD (alone) group did not differ from the comparison disorders on difficulties of falling/staying asleep but did report more weeks per year when they had sleep difficulties than persons with adult separation anxiety, alcohol dependence, and major depression.	natural
Patients receiving high-dose induction treatment had significantly higher depression scores after 4 weeks, and significantly more patients in the high-dose group developed depression.	natural
Two more groups comprised mildly symptomatic, hypochondriacal, depression, and a highly neurotic, obsessive, anxious, non-phobic depression, which was commonly related to a physical stressor.	natural
Moreover, in the sample of individuals with cognitive vulnerability, the catastrophizing of the maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategy partially mediated the relationship between daily hassles and depression.	natural
In addition, a decrease in depression and anxiety subscales and in overall General Health Questionnaire scoring (p<.05) was found in the intervention group.	natural

In a group of 100 patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in Ume between January 1973 and July 1974 with mild depressive syndromes, general pain measures - PM - and moderate visual averaged evoked responses - V.AER - have been investigated, and the patients have been assessed by the doctor by means of the Cronholm-Ottosson depression rating scale.	synthetic_intensity
The results also suggest that temporary suicidality and mild anger may mark a predominantly irritable and moderate form of depression as youths mature.	synthetic_intensity
These findings extend the proposed relationship between assertiveness and reinforcement and are consistent with the previously reported inverse relationships between assertiveness and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in mild depression, occasional anxiety, and steady hope to be moderate predictors of changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the subtler effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating mild anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may steadily promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following cancer diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and seventeen parents of children with developmental disabilities and 52 control parents completed standard measures of health behaviours, sociodemographics, perceived stress, mild depression and anxiety, manageable caregiver burden, minor child problem behaviours.	synthetic_intensity
All the participants completed a sociodemographic form, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the Simple Temperament and Character Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
They rated their own level of anxiety and mild depression before and after viewing the film; they then made multiple ratings of their negative attributions about the child, feelings of affiliation toward the child, judgments of the child's attractiveness, and expectations about her current and future behavior and her consideration for therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Women's tendency to blame their partner also predicted their own minor depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Targeting improvement for both mild parent depressive symptoms and interparental disagreement may directly lead to small decreases in youth internalizing symptoms in the context of low-level parental depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present study tested the hypothesis that mild maternal depression and somewhat negative parenting mediate the relationship between economic stress and minor psychological symptoms among urban African American youth.	synthetic_intensity
These findings indicate that certain eating disorder symptoms uniquely account for impairment and that mild depression is a noticeable contributor.	synthetic_intensity
Our results indicate a small excess of notable findings relative to what would be expected, given the average statistical power of studies of psychotherapy for mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a clinical sample of women, this study examined the relationship between retrospectively measured childhood abuse and neglect and current adult symptoms of anxiety and mild depression, via the mediating effects of cognitive style.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the relationships among mild disease severity, mild depression, and minor sleep disturbance in MS, and their possible role in predicting manageable fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
The individual items and quartiles of sum scores were moderately correlated with slightly negative occupational and social performance, and the utility of the scale was demonstrated by moderate correlations with mild depression, some PTSD, and average levels of generalized physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is some evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms show minimal age-related changes, it remains somewhat uncertain as to whether there are also minor developmental variations in the etiology of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present experiment explored the effect of self-focused attention and self-esteem on self-reported mild state depression.	synthetic_intensity
The distribution of depression scores indicated that 34.5 were mildly depressed.	synthetic_intensity
There is emerging evidence that this mild inflammatory process related to depression may be influenced by manageable psychological stress as well as minor organic inflammatory conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Other than mild postpartum depression, little is known about women's gentle emotional responses to childbirth and manageable subsequent stressors.	synthetic_intensity
Data were gathered on autistic traits, birth weight, parents' ages at birth, sibling sex ratio, gender nonconformity, age, mild maternal depression, minor general behavioral and emotional problems, and IQ.	synthetic_intensity
Our hypothesis that slightly depleted participants would retrieve somewhat fewer specific memories to cues on the AMT relative to controls was supported, even when moderate levels of depressed and anxious mood, a mild index of clinical depression, posttraumatic stress, and verbal intelligence were covaried.	synthetic_intensity
Data from a sample of 90 dyads are used to explore the impact of moderate maternal stress, strong social support, and mild depression on children's minor behavior problems.	synthetic_intensity
Texts from websites reporting MCEs (n = 10), experience of cancer (n = 10), mild depression (n = 10) and being stalked (n = 10) were identified, and were blind-rated by three independent psychiatrists for the presence of delusions.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, we investigate the minor effects of somewhat poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on mild postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population.	synthetic_intensity
We argue that there is a subtle neurobiological cause of mildly impaired neuropsychological function in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression severity was simply assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Youth in both conditions showed noticeable improvements in mild depressive symptoms and overall functioning from baseline to 24-month follow-up, demonstrating the effectiveness of school-based depression prevention programs.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, a slight change in the cognitive constructs partially mediated change in mild depression severity within all three treatments.	synthetic_intensity
Factors found to be associated with a somewhat higher risk of relapse included slightly poorer medication adherence in the 30 days prior to the trial, moderately lower self-efficacy to manage depression, and marginally higher scores on the Child Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Mild maternal depressive symptoms were screened by Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and maternal anxiety level was assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at the early postpartum period (7-10 days).	synthetic_intensity
Energized by renewed research and clinical activities, the current status of assessments of mild child and adolescent depression merits review.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6-month follow-up with the mildly informative Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), alongside the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS) and the concise Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS).	synthetic_intensity
The total number of somatic symptoms moderately predicted some level of suicidal ideation (p < .05), controlling for the significant effects of sex, education, marital status, and the POMS Depression scale scores through multiple regression analysis.	synthetic_intensity
While interpersonal sensitivity, as rated by the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) has previously been found to be an efficient predictor of mild depression, there has been less interest in the relationship between the IPSM and minor anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Using latent growth curve modelling, we found that OGM was associated with a gradual linear increase in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Increased lateral prefrontal activation despite comparably successful performance - when only correct trials were analyzed - in patients with mild depression can be interpreted as evidence for modest compensatory recruitment of prefrontal cortical resources.	synthetic_intensity
In these analyses, moderate anger (from neuroticism), slightly low positive emotionality (extraversion), somewhat low conventionality (conscientiousness), and mildly low culture (openness to experiences) were modest prospective predictors of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for mild baseline bulimic symptoms, depression, and some level of body dissatisfaction, involuntary disengagement predicted bulimic symptoms at follow-up among men (b=.21, p<.001), but not among women (b=.06, p>.05).	synthetic_intensity
