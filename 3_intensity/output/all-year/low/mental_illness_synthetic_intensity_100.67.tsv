Like mild mental_illness, work slightly alters the individual's perception of self and leads to some forms of limited constraint, by reducing the power over his conduct, by following social norms, and by transforming the product of labor, which may result in a lesser sense of meaning (Rosner, 1967).	synthetic_intensity
