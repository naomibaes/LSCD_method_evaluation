those with high anxiety, discrepant self-concepts, and eating disorders), strings were presented in a central (dominant) location on 75 of the trials or in 1 of 4 peripheral (nondominant) locations.	natural
Tested patients differed from controls on measures of both clinical severity and treatment-resistance, including higher self-reported anxiety and depression levels, greater likelihood of family history of mood or anxiety disorders, and larger numbers of prior antidepressant, mood stabilizer, and antipsychotic medication trials.	natural
Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used, including 2329 persons with lifetime DSM-IV anxiety (social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia) and/or depressive (major depressive disorder and dysthymia) disorders and 652 controls.	natural
We examined whether adults pre-selected for high and low social anxiety showed distinct patterns of frontal brain oscillatory coupling during resting baseline and the anticipation of a self-presentation task.	natural
Furthermore, there was a strong direct relationship between severity of trauma-related symptomatology and severity of dental anxiety (shared variance was 38).	natural
Twenty-three mothers referred for postpartum mood and anxiety disorder to an outpatient program were included in the study.	natural
Convergent validity analyses revealed that both WSSQ subscales were significantly and (a) negatively correlated with measures of self-esteem and physical appearance, and (b) positively correlated with measures of anxiety, depression, fear of negative appearance evaluation, and eating-related pathology (fear of getting fat, eating-related control, food preoccupation, vomiting-purging behaviors, and eating-related guilt subscales).	natural
HIT anxiety correlated significantly with STAI A-Trait.	natural
In particular, they highlight the necessity of using the self-reference effect in memory rather than mere self-endorsement of trait adjectives when assessing the efficacy of cognitive therapies for social anxiety.	natural
Three hundred forty-three participants completed a series of self-report measures assessing attachment perceptions, anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety, and panic symptom frequency and severity.	natural

A study of mild hospitalization anxiety among 408 medical and surgical patients in four voluntary, nonprofit, general hospitals is reported.	synthetic_low
We use meta-regression to explore whether slight variability in the mean age of participants in trials of CBT for mild anxiety predicted variability between studies in symptom change effect sizes.	synthetic_low
Adult children of mentally ill parents were slightly more depressed and showed somewhat greater trait anxiety than did adult children of alcoholics and controls.	synthetic_low
Twenty depressed patients with major depressive disorder, 20 nondepressed matched control subjects, and 17 patients with mild anxiety disorders were compared in different measures of social problem solving.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that mild maternal anxiety disorder is associated with reduced tolerance of children's negative emotions.	synthetic_low
The results showed that three schema domains (moderately impaired autonomy and performance, somewhat impaired limits, and mildly other-directedness) predicted the increase in mild social anxiety and that LCS for social threat acted as a mediator between other-directedness and mild social anxiety at T3.	synthetic_low
Increases in mild daily anxiety were predicted by greater occasional rumination, worry, and both minor cognitive and behavioral avoidance.	synthetic_low
Those persons who viewed expert models significantly reduced mild situationally related anxiety following participation in an analogue interview.	synthetic_low
In practice, however, the how to is often complicated by minor parental anxiety or complacency, simple family dynamics, therapist uncertainty about how to help, and poor partnerships between family and school.	synthetic_low
The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect of gentle relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were fairly noticeable.	synthetic_low
Compared with the control group, the patients in the intervention group reported a minor yet noticeable improvement in mild anxiety and significant improvement in QOL over time.	synthetic_low
The aims of the present study were therefore to evaluate the prevalence of mild grief in a population-based cohort, examine the slight overlap between anxiety and depression, and identify common bereavement-related and socio-demographic characteristics.	synthetic_low
The three-factor solution that emerged isolated dimensions representing depression and distinct factors of mild trait anxiety and state anxiety.	synthetic_low
Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) with mild anxiety levels, and the Parenting Scale (PS).	synthetic_low
For change-over-time effects, mild intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety slightly increased and self-confidence modestly decreased between 2 h and 30 min precompetition.	synthetic_low
Clinical benefit was gently assessed with the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement, the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, and the Mild Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale.	synthetic_low
The objective of the present study was three-fold: to assess the prevalence of PD in asthmatic patients in comparison with non-asthmatic patients; to investigate subtle differences in pulmonary function and mild anxiety symptomatology between asthmatic patients with PD and those without; and to evaluate minor differences in symptom perception during mild histamine-induced bronchoconstriction between asthmatic patients with PD versus asthmatic controls without PD matched for age, sex and bronchial responsiveness to histamine (PC20).	synthetic_low
This slight effect of anxiety leads citizens to rely somewhat less on heuristics, such as party, and more on substantive information, such as policy positions.	synthetic_low
To assess the effects of item sequencing on the examinee a mild situational measure of testtaking anxiety was taken along with basic test evaluation information and performance data.	synthetic_low
The intra-scale correlations highlighted the fact that the mild perception of distress depends on neuroticism and the presence of anxiety and depression (which are themselves known to be connected with neuroticism).	synthetic_low
