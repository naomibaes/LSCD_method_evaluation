Moreover, the shapes of early change were associated with different treatment outcomes and durations, and several intake variables (depression, anxiety, and age) enabled prediction of the shape of early change and/or prediction of individual treatment progress within client groups with similar shapes of change.	natural
Logistic regression analysis identified that earlier age-at-onset of depression, excessive self-reproach and diminished libido were the best predictors of female depression.	natural
While patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) are known to experience higher levels of anxiety and depression, they do not always use psychosocial oncology (PSO) services when available.	natural

Maternal lifetime history of depression was not associated with offspring EF task performance.	natural
A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only).	natural

Exploratory analyses suggest that this cannot be explained by more severe heart disease at index, poorer response to depression treatment, or a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease in patients with initial MD episodes.	natural
Self-defeating women also scored higher on the autonomy subscales, suggesting threats to their independence may be a source of depression as well.	natural
