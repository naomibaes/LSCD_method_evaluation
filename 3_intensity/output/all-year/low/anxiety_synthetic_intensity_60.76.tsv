They completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and a comprehensive interview assessing organic status as well as measures of the potentially confounding factors of current levels of depression and anxiety.	natural
Novel theoretical frameworks place the symptom profile of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) within the context of dysfunctional emotional processes.	natural
Part of this association can be explained by how parenting interacts with known pathways to anxiety.	natural
Specifically, appearance investment, aging anxiety, and television exposure were unique predictors of endorsement of social motivations for cosmetic surgery, whereas body dissatisfaction, appearance investment, and television exposure were unique predictors of actual consideration of cosmetic surgery.	natural
Results indicated that prior test exposure to a single instructor's tests does have the effect of improving students' test performance on objective type tests, perhaps due to reduced test-taking anxiety, because the students have an opportunity to become accustomed to the instructor's style of testing.	natural
Comorbidity amongst anxiety disorders is very common in children as in adults and leads to considerable distress and impairment, yet is poorly understood.	natural
Background/Objective: To examine the roles of anxiety sensitivity and attentional bias in the development of anxiety and depression symptoms among adolescents.	natural
In a final structural equation model, RS and withdrawal were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms, and RS, sadness, and withdrawal were uniquely associated with social anxiety.	natural
Results will be discussed in the context of theoretical models explaining the etiological factor of cognitive biases for the development of anxiety disorders.	natural
Major depressive disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) frequently co-occur in individuals seeking treatment for either problem individually.	natural
These results suggest that the clinical utility of depression measures may be improved by using them in combination with measures of anxiety.	natural
Minor physical illness and problems with a fellow resident were significantly associated with depression and anxiety, decline or loss of mobility and loss of leisure-time activities with depression and change at work or from work with anxiety.	natural
The current study represents an initial investigation of the association between heroin use and anxiety sensitivity (AS).	natural
Although mild anxiety was correlated with poor adherence, this relationship was not significant in the invariate analysis.	synthetic_low
This study carefully examined whether anxiety patients with mild space and motion discomfort (SMD; e.g., slight fear of heights), like patients with minor vestibular dysfunction, have slightly increased body sway responses to motion in the visual field.	synthetic_low
The Duke Preschool Anxiety Study, a screen-stratified, cross-sectional study, drew from pediatric primary care and included a moderate oversampling for children at risk for mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The mild induced anxiety resulted in slightly longer decision times for both impulsive and reflective children, and in marginally fewer errors for the impulsives who slightly increased in response time.	synthetic_low
Correlations, independent t tests and one-way analysis of variances were used to identify variables associated with mild anxiety, and a stepwise multiple regression was used to identify potential predictors of slight anxiety.	synthetic_low
The data supported mild competitive trait anxiety as an individual-difference variable that gently influences athletes' perception and evaluation of coaching behaviors.	synthetic_low
During the speech task interaction, mothers of somewhat anxious children (aged 4-16 years), regardless of their own anxiety, were observed to be slightly more overinvolved than mothers of nonanxious children.	synthetic_low
Responses of 100 students to the Test Anxiety Scale were used to classify subjects by mild level of anxiety.	synthetic_low
We performed a study to assess the relationship between slight impairment of insight and the moderate long-term outcome in affective and anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
In four sessions, subjects imagined 32 scenes in which covert models calmly coped with mild test anxiety situations.	synthetic_low
This investigation aimed to ascertain the levels of mild anxiety, subtle depression, and balanced religious attitude, by means of rating scales, in a group of physically sick men and women planning to go on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.	synthetic_low
Similarly, on frequency counts, target behaviors and self-ratings of mild anxiety gradually improved with the advent of treatment.	synthetic_low
However, given that prolonged exposure to social demands does not inevitably lead to mild anxiety or slight hyperarousal, professionals should not be deterred from providing much needed social skills interventions for individuals with FXS.	synthetic_low
The moderate stability of worry content was investigated in a sample of 27 individuals diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.	synthetic_low
Depression and mild anxiety were found to reflect a slightly negative appraisal pattern characterized by goals rated moderately high in stress and difficulty, and somewhat low in structure, control, perceived skill, and positive outcome expectancy.	synthetic_low
In general, the total score and each of the 5 factors for both the child and parent SCARED demonstrated good internal consistency and moderate discriminant validity (both between anxiety and depressive and disruptive disorders and within mild anxiety disorders).	synthetic_low
Follow-up analyses to validate these two clusters showed that the failure avoidant students were slightly higher in anxiety and pessimism and slightly lower in achievement.	synthetic_low
Finally, several exogenous constructs expected to be associated with mild pregnancy anxiety--age, marital status, and slight worry over health--exert noticeable effects on dimensions of the model or on a second-order factor.	synthetic_low
Male nurses had the lowest scores on mild trait anxiety, while female doctors had the highest scores, followed by female nurses.	synthetic_low
Few studies have systematically investigated how this network is mildly altered in psychopathology, despite evidence that depression and mild anxiety are associated with attentional control impairments.	synthetic_low
Very strong efficacy for at least the short-term benefits and safety of stimulant medications was found, and some promising efficacy and safety evidence for the treatment of mild anxiety and depressive disorders with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) was also found.	synthetic_low
A series of covariance analyses indicated that hypnosis was a slightly more effective self-regulatory technique for gently lowering mild anxiety levels when compared to biofeedback or trophotropic response procedures.	synthetic_low
Participants casually completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Standard Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) with mild anxiety assessments.	synthetic_low
This treatment highlights the unique nature of working with an adolescent who is a part of the sexual and gender minority, and how these identities contributed to her experience of mild social anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
