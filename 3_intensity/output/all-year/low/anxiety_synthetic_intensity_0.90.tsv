The current study assessed four groups of subjects: those with high and low levels of anxiety sensitivity; and those with or without recent experiences of panic attacks.	natural
Depression and anxiety previously predicted coronary artery disease (CAD) risk.	natural
This training was followed by a decrease in anxiety, depression, and general psychological distress, but this effect was also observed in the control group.	natural
However, on most cognitive measures the mixed group was the most dysfunctional, replicating Ingram's (1989a, 1989b) evidence of confounding between the affective states of social anxiety and depression.	natural
The only factor associated with depressive disorder was the duration of TBI ( 1 year) while the only factor associated with anxiety disorder was the mechanism of trauma (assault).	natural
Thus, the degree of emotional distress experienced by these veterans continues to be extraordinarily high and is characterized by extreme depression, anxiety and extensive physical complaints.	natural
These results suggest that disinhibition is a complex phenomenon that may be mediated by either BIS hypoactivity, BAS hyperactivity or even BIS hyperactivity, and by the interaction of all these mechanisms with the involvement of some of the variables such as gender, personality, motivation, task and subject's anxiety state.	natural
Slight to marked improvements were demonstrated for each subject, as evidenced by improvements on the State Anxiety Inventory Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, a decrease in overall MMPI scores, and lowered EMG and subjective tension ratings for all participants.	natural
The link between parental anxiety and child internalizing symptoms was mediated by harsh discipline.	natural
High punishment sensitivity, but not anxiety, predicted higher loneliness.	natural
Female BPD patients without (BOR; n = 37) or with current substance dependence (BSUD; n = 19), and female non-BPD/SUD controls (CON; n = 48) were compared with respect to impulsivity, affective lability, affective intensity, externalizing behaviors, and self-harming/suicidal tendencies, taking into consideration their comorbid mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and antisocial personality disorder.	natural
In the author's view anxiety is a psychosomatic phenomenon that develops into neurotic anxiety when unconscious psychic components come into play.	natural
On the basis of available data, we argue that these varying effects index differing neurobiological processes related to mood and anxiety disorders that are interpretable from the standpoint of dimensional models of the internalizing spectrum.	natural
Other objectives included the assessment of the prevalence and intensity of preoperative anxiety.	natural
State anxiety may have influenced the Kuwaitis death anxiety scores.	natural
Both hair pulling and comorbid anxiety and depression can independently impact body esteem in adolescent hair pullers.	natural
We found that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism significantly moderated the influences of stressful life events and mother's warmth-reasoning on adolescent anxiety.	natural
Immigrants of Polish origin showed a significantly higher level of anxiety as well as somatic complaints but only a tendency toward higher depressiveness than the German normvalue, but not than that of the native Poles.	natural
138 healthy volunteers in four age groups completed the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (Self and Other) as well as measures of attention, freedom from distractibility, daily stress, and trait-state anxiety.	natural
They also completed a 23-item Prerace Questionnaire which measured antecedents of anxiety among triathletes.	natural
The results revealed two subgroups that showed either strongly increasing or decreasing (14) levels of anxiety across the transition and two subgroups with fairly stable levels of either high (11) or low (70) anxiety over time.	natural
Many patients with anxiety disorders remain symptomatic after receiving evidence-based treatment, yet research on treatment-resistant anxiety is limited.	natural
Average patterns of stable (depressive symptoms) and improved (anxiety) emotional well-being were evident, and well-being trajectories were sensitive to fluctuations in both child and maternal context variables.	natural
WCBT, delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service professionals, aims to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, obtain, and retain employment.	natural
Inducible cox-2, involved in inflammation, may have important role in the colchicine induced alteration of anxiety status.	natural
Anxiety and emotion regulation were assessed during a stressful situation at age 9 (speech task), along with measures of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV).	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was present in 14 of patients with diabetes.	natural
A total of 223 patients from a larger randomized controlled trial of Individual MeaningCentered Psychotherapy (IMCP) completed selfreport questionnaires that assessed UB and UBrelated distress, hopelessness, desire for hastened death, anxiety and depression, quality of life, spiritual wellbeing, and purpose/meaning.	natural
Results indicated very marked impact of appearance-related anxiety with significant withdrawal from social activities particularly intimate behaviour.	natural
Although several studies have shown that life adversities play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of both depressive and anxiety disorders, little is known about the relative specificity of several types of life adversities to different forms of depressive and anxiety disorder and the concurrent role of neuroticism.	natural
The objective of this study was to investigate the association between pain and mood and anxiety disorders, as well as psychological symptoms, in a population-based sample of women.	natural
Results are discussed in relation to previous findings and theoretical views of the effects of anxiety and defensiveness on the processing of threat.	natural
Perfectionism and avoidant coping acted as mediators of pre- to postintervention changes in anxiety scores.	natural
Scores on the BES were most highly correlated with a measure of negative perfectionism (r=0.59) and also showed significant correlations with measures of dysfunctional attitudes, self-sacrifice, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.	natural
ABMT was associated with greater clinician-rated reductions in anxiety symptoms relative to control training: between-groups effect (d = 0.42, P = .001, confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.66), contrast of within-group effects (Q = 7.25, P < .01).	natural
Buddhist reincarnation beliefs were unrelated to personal death anxiety.	natural
While the present study examined possible effects of depression, anxiety and the ability to identify and describe feelings, a larger sample is needed in order to optimally address their potential moderating effect.	natural
However, there is still scant literature on the role that cross-cultural factors may play in the expression and development of anxiety.	natural
Further research on the VOKI and two questionnaires assessing achievement related concepts such as test anxiety, procrastination and achievement motivation yielded correlational patterns partly predicted from Krohne's Two-Process Model.	natural
A path analysis showed that irritability and competitiveness mediate the relationship between aggressive reactions, on the one hand, and hostility, anxiety, and drivers' image, on the other.	natural
All completed self-report measures of borderline features; trait-level negative affect; depressive and anger rumination; and current symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
Analyses indicated that participants with the lowest EI scores reported greater intensity of precompetitive cognitive anxiety than those with the highest EI scores.	natural
Interoceptive sensitivity, particularly regarding heartbeat, has been suggested to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of anxiety and anxiety disorders.	natural
Near-maximal anxiety by subjective and behavioral criteria was evoked and terminated in phobic patients by initiation and termination of rapid live confrontation (flooding in vivo) with the specific stimulus that each avoided, at a time approximating the crest of the circadian cycle of adrenal cortical function.	natural
Because a great deal is known about the neuroanatomical and pharmacological mechanisms of fear-potentiated startle in laboratory animals, this test procedure may be especially useful in humans to investigate the neurobiological substrates of anxiety disorders and their pharmacological treatments.	natural
The subsequent meta-meta-analyses were based on a total of 92 studies with 4310 participants for the effect of physical activity on depression and 306 study effects with 10,755 participants for the effect of physical activity on anxiety.	natural
Some differences in psychiatric symptomatology were also noted, with cocaine-dependent subjects more likely to report anxiety symptoms and marijuana-dependent subjects reporting more past depressive episodes.	natural
