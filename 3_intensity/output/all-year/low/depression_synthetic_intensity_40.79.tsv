Given this possibility, inferences about distress or depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the possible roles of error and method variance.	natural

Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_intensity
Third, when controlling for neuroticism, attention control remained significantly (negatively) associated with symptoms of anxiety, mild depression (child report only), and ADHD.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, we found that, when controlling for current mild depressive symptoms and prior history of low-level depression, mindfulness was significantly negatively correlated with occasional rumination, but it was only associated with the extent to which rumination was experienced as slightly uncontrollable, not with average levels of rumination.	synthetic_intensity
The effects of minor personality characteristics on social support and hence low risk of depression are explored in a group of 150 largely working-class mothers, a subsample of 400 women who took part in a prospective study.	synthetic_intensity

The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to assess positive and negative dimensions of the partner relationship, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) to assess mild depression and the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess anxiety were administered to fortythree women and their partners recruited during the second trimester of pregnancy and seen again until after delivery in order to assess subtle differences in women's/men's anxiety and depression according to partner relationships.	synthetic_intensity

Female gender, experienced mild beating and comorbid diagnosis of PTSD were independent predictors of possible depression among the IDPs, while IDPs that were unemployed or retired had milder instances of definitive depression.	synthetic_intensity

In Study 1, SCRs from 43 participants during presentation of 20 somewhat significant, slightly nonarousing words with a negative valence that were either mildly depression related or potentially self-referent and 20 nonsignificant words matched on valence and arousal showed a main effect of significance.	synthetic_intensity

While controlling for baseline depression rendered the association between slight changes in mild depression and fibrinogen nonsignificant, taking into account baseline fibrinogen levels maintained the predictive value of fibrinogen change for mild depression change.	synthetic_intensity
