Focusing first on the link between maternal history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and children's attentional biases, we found that children of mothers with a history of MDD during their children's lives, compared to children of mothers with no depression history, exhibited greater attentional avoidance of sad faces.	natural
In the extreme, these differences are implicated in a range of psychiatric disorders from addiction to depression.	natural
The results of the quantitative analysis shows that over half of the participants (55.4) have a score that is over the cutoff point for depression, a quarter (25.8) are considered to have anxiety, and about twothirds (77) report poor sleep quality.	natural

Five studies found significant associations between delirium episodes and subsequent symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.	natural
Our aim was to investigate whether sensitive parenting is impaired in mothers with depression in remission, and whether among these mothers childhood abuse has an additional impact.	natural
Personality traits and personality disorders in 298 consecutive psychiatric outpatients with bipolar disorder, major depression, cyclothymic disorder, dysthymic disorder, and a remaining group of other disorders were investigated.	natural
Findings may suggest the use of exercise-based interventions in conjunction with treatments that specifically target negative affective mechanisms for depression.	natural

A relatively high frequency of somatic symptoms, fatigue, anxiety and depression was observed, with a trend to improvement at the end of hospitalization.	natural
Theory and research suggest that obesity and depression may be causally linked.	natural
Patients were classified as either responders or nonresponders based on improvement of depression according to the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	natural
For males, depression and alcohol use were independent across adolescence, and no significant indirect pathways were observed.	natural
This case series aimed to demonstrate the application of Problem Solving Therapy (PST) to older adults with anxiety disorders building on PSTs strong empirical support for treating late-life depression.	natural
Findings highlight postpartum depression symptoms as one mechanism of risk transmission from maternal maltreatment history to impacted parent-child interactions.	natural
Results of mixed linear model analyses in both studies supported the hypothesis that rumination moderates the relationship between the vegetative symptoms and the cognitive-affective symptoms of seasonal depression.	natural
Controlling for effects of gender, verbal ability and maternal education, individual differences in child problem behavior scores showed significant independent associations with executive dysfunction, emotion understanding and maternal depression.	natural
In light of the individual and societal burden due to pain, and the demonstrated role of comorbid anxiety or/and depression, our results call for further investigation of the underlying mechanisms for this association as well as targeted treatments for these comorbidities.	natural
The results offer partial support for the interpretation of an increase in depression based on retrospective data in other recent studies but they indicate that the increase is specific to women.	natural
Previous research on executive functioning within adolescent depression has provided somewhat inconsistent results, although the majority of research has identified at least partial evidence of executive functioning deficits in adolescent depression.	natural
Emotion regulation difficulties also significantly predicted these RSB indices above and beyond other RSB risk factors, including demographics, depression, sensation seeking, traumatic exposure, and substance use severity.	natural
Moreover, there were significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as a greater increase in emotion regulation functioning, mindfulness, and quality of life observed in the intervention group 6 months after the treatment compared with the treatment as usual condition.	natural
At 6 months, there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms (M = 10.21, standard deviation = 8.0), t(18) = 5.60, p < .001, and 73 percent of participants used Self-Regulated Illness Management of Depression frequently.	natural
However, there is no accepted definition or clear-cut treatment for subthreshold depression.	natural
With stringent statistical control of demographic, prenatal, and family status characteristics as well as baseline levels of the criterion variable in question, maltreated participants were significantly more impaired than nonmaltreated participants with respect to self-harm (suicide attempts), internalizing symptomatology (anxiety and depression), eating disorder symptomatology, and well-being (lower overall self-worth).	natural
Hence, findings suggest that treatment of CFS should include a focus on severity of depression.	natural
Targeting AEE in treatments of depression may help to modify maladaptive interpersonal patterns of emotional expression.	natural
This study aimed to evaluate the validity of person-fit statistics to identify inconsistent symptom reports and to assess the clinical usefulness of providing clinicians with person-fit score feedback during depression assessment.	natural
Compared with other treated children, children with CD achieved worse scores on 14 of 15 syndromes, including internalizing problems such as withdrawal and major depression.	natural
As a result, the use of depression measures that do not contain somatic items has been encouraged.	natural
The purported mechanism of change underlying BA treatment lies in increasing activation, which in turn increases contact with positive reinforcement thereby reversing the cycle of depression.	natural
Depression in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is a serious issue with important clinical consequences.	natural
The current study also sought to examine the impact of engagement in mindfulness and values practice on depression, as well as to replicate the finding that change in acceptance is associated with change in depression.	natural
Individuals who had a marked discrepancy between their self-perceived and objectively measured level of depression had significant elevations (T-score greater than 70) on 5 of the 10 MMPI clinical scales.	natural
People with current or past depression are more likely to have been smokers at some point in their lives.	natural
This study investigates the longitudinal relationships between burnout and depression among teachers.	natural
MADRS cut-off scores for moderate and severe depression were estimated in relation to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)) and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI).	natural
As part of a longitudinal investigation of the outcomes of BRCA1/2 testing in adults, 20 children of a highly select group of 15 mothers (80 previously affected by breast/ovarian cancer) completed a self-report survey of their beliefs and opinions regarding cancer and genetic testing, stress and worry about cancer, and anxiety, depression, and behavior problems.	natural
Consistent with predictions, hostility and depression correlated equally well with prior bullying victimization but only hostility successfully mediated the relation between prior bullying victimization and subsequent bullying perpetration.	natural
Links between depression and infant holding biases have been observed in mothers [Vauclair, J., Scola, C. (in press).	natural
Symptoms of depression and anxiety over 12 months were characterized by two trajectories: low stable (depression: 55; anxiety: 59) with non-clinical levels of distress, and high stable (depression: 45; anxiety: 41) with clinical levels of distress.	natural
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is widely used for screening of depression in acutely injured trauma survivors.	natural
Compared with control subjects, patients with PNES reported significantly more prevalent and stressful negative life events (including adulthood abuse) and more current rumination, stress-related diseases, somatic symptoms, bodily awareness, and marginally more anxiety and depression.	natural
