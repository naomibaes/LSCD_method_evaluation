However, mild childhood trauma does not seem to be associated with a differential course of symptoms, nor does it uniquely heighten the chance of developing (subthreshold) psychotic symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
The consult question itself, of behavior management, is not unusual, although in this case the question is complicated by the aftereffects of mild trauma, psychosocial challenges, and the staff's frustrated feelings toward the patient.	synthetic_intensity
Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of mild childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house lightly disturbed, slightly robbed, or minimally vandalized; being casually struck by someone within or outside the family; being gently yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the mild physical conflict involving a parent; and minor sexual misconduct.	synthetic_intensity

This paper describes evolving conceptualizations in the developing field of trauma related to mild family violence exposure, and reviews considerations that inform assessment and treatment planning for this population.	synthetic_intensity
This study compares children and youth who have experienced lifetime war-related parental absence or deployment with those having no such history on a variety of victimization types, non-victimization adversity, mild trauma symptoms, and minor delinquency; and assesses whether some adversity and victimization help to explain slightly elevated emotional and behavioral problems among children of parents who have experienced war-related absence or deployment.	synthetic_intensity
Three months after the unfortunate incident, exposed students received the Child Trauma Symptom Questionnaire at school.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest the need for a more refined conceptual and operational understanding of mild dissociative symptoms in the acute trauma stage.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that individuals in the mild trauma categories scored slightly higher in neuroticism and openness to new experiences than individuals in the control group.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to better understand the psychological effects of mild war trauma on children, and the natural course of common posttraumatic symptoms, so as to improve interventions targeted to this vulnerable population.	synthetic_intensity
We replicated a subtyping strategy for adjudicated female youth based on mental_health screening data from the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-2 (MAYSI-2) by investigating subtype differences on minor trauma symptoms, limited abuse history, and other background variables.	synthetic_intensity
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a mild trauma during infancy leads to a psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini cannot be given up in concern of a repetition of the challenge, already experienced once in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_intensity
Mother's, but not child's, mild degree of trauma exposure and maternal PTSD correlated with child avoidance.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the extent and correlates of comorbidity between two of the disorders commonly linked to mild trauma--major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--in a group of 44 women who experienced IPV within the preceding 2 years.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for clinical practice, service delivery and service development relate to the different ways of supporting women in talking about mild abuse and also the need to recognise minor trauma in parents.	synthetic_intensity
Among trauma-exposed participants, the unique association between mild internalizing symptoms and later PTSD yielded an odds ratio of 1.79 (p = .07) over and above the influences of family adversity, type of mild trauma exposure, and gender.	synthetic_intensity
The specific psychoanalytic contribution--the emphasis on unconscious conflict and meaning--is for the most part excluded from the discourse on dissociation, often resulting in a simplistic conceptualisation of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Psychoanalytic concepts are reviewed as they relate to physical disability and they are compared with contemporary themes involving mild trauma and slight loss.	synthetic_intensity
Oxytocin had a slight trust-lowering effect in BPD, which was correlated with patients' minor history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Physical injury, mild psychological trauma, and even discomfort can be results of an inappropriate matching of teenage sitters and children.	synthetic_intensity
The study aimed to examine the limited effect of objective (type of trauma and demographic characteristics) and subjective (proximity to the trauma, subjective experience of the trauma as a minor threat, the Big Five personality traits, and mild dissociative symptoms) factors on the risk for PTSD among 1,210 undergraduate students.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest a possible association between mild childhood trauma and the development of RA, particularly in women.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that mild trauma symptoms may be occasionally experienced in schizophrenia and somewhat linked with the phenomenology of the disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) were administered to 71 women who reported histories of childhood and/or adult mild sexual maltreatment and 25 women who did not report a history of victimization.	synthetic_intensity
There are well-established predisposing factors, such as female sex, minor childhood trauma, and alexithymia, but less clear is how to approach the mild subjective suffering that is symbolized with the symptom rather than consciously recognized.	synthetic_intensity

We were also interested to find out if the mildness of the current symptoms is related to the small amount of trauma experienced.	synthetic_intensity
