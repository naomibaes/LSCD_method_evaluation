In comparing the emotional states and medical course of patients on the two units, the net advantage of the open unit seems to be in providing more social contact with associated freedom of expression of hostile feelings, while the lack of privacy resulted in slightly higher levels of mild shame anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Those who reliably attended the walking group (participants) were compared against those who did not attend (non-participants), using the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales and the self-reported 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) as secondary outcome measures.	synthetic_intensity

However, when both were included in a single model to study their unique effects, some depressive symptoms (but not anxiety) emerged as a significant predictor of subsequent minor increases in pain and slight reductions in physical functioning, whereas mild anxiety (but not depression) predicted subsequent slight elevations in fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
The studies supported the latter interactive hypothesis in that post-error slowing tendencies were somewhat predictive of displayed anxiety at low, but not high, levels of extraversion.	synthetic_intensity
One interaction effect indicated that subjective alertness improved more in the Zopiclone group than the CBT group from baseline to post-treatment, and another that CBT was more effective than Zopiclone in reducing mild trait anxiety from baseline to follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
In support of this, the lactating rat becomes slightly less emotionally responsive to novel situations, demonstrating gently reduced anxiety, and shows a moderate degree of aggressive behavior in the test for agonistic behavior as well as in the maternal defense test.	synthetic_intensity
Certain previous findings were confirmed: more obsessive-compulsive disorder in anorexia; more substance use in bulimia; and a steady comorbidity rank-ordering for eating disorder patients: mood, mild anxiety, and substance use disorders, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Anticipatory processing (AP) is a repetitive negative thinking (RNT) style gently associated with mild social anxiety that has been excluded in studies of repetitive thought (e.g., worry and rumination).	synthetic_intensity
To carefully reexamine the relationships of depression, mild anxiety, and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), 27 patients with idiopathic PD received two measures of depression, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).	synthetic_intensity
