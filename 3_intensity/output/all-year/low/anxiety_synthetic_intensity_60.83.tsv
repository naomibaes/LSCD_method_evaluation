After completing this task, participants again reported their levels of anxiety and positive mood.	natural
Comorbid anxiety disorders were not a predictor of response to treatment, and the only significant predictor was gender (men improved more than women).	natural
Individuals with elevated levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS) may be motivated to avoid aversive emotional or physical states, and therefore may have greater difficulty achieving healthy behavioral change.	natural
Parents of 28 children and adolescents aged 11 to 18 years with CFS, 30 with JRA, and 27 with emotional disorders (i.e., anxiety and/or depressive disorders) were recruited from specialty clinical settings and completed interviews and questionnaires assessing family health problems, parental mental distress, illness attitudes, and family burden of illness.	natural

Findings provide neurophysiological support for the shift in older adults' responses to death-related stimuli found in other TMT research as well as studies reporting reduced explicit death anxiety in older adults.	natural
Excessive worry is required by DSM-IV, but not ICD-10, for a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Unexpectedly, however, at low levels of neuroticism, avoidance and conscientiousness were actually associated with increased, rather than decreased, attachment anxiety.	natural
Gains in depression, anxiety, somatization, and self-soothing were also significant in comparison to the control group.	natural
OCD patients, non-OCD anxiety controls, and non-patients executed a classification task in either a high or a low responsibility (LoRes) condition.	natural
Overall, the findings are more consistent with models of anxiety that emphasize the moderate importance of cognitive rather than physiological factors in MPA.	synthetic_low
The notable within-species variability found in the spiny rats may have concealed moderate anxiety differences among them, despite the ability of both tests to reveal plesiomorphic behavioral characteristics, such as thigmotaxis.	synthetic_low
All item characteristics were comparable and both instruments showed the same pattern of mild correlations with instruments measuring slight depression, mild anxiety, discomfort, quality of life, and minor impairment (r=0.25 to 0.53).	synthetic_low
After adjusting for mild depression symptoms and the presence of a mood or anxiety diagnosis, limited access to emotion regulation strategies moderately predicted current suicidal ideation, a relation that was found to be statistically mediated by feelings of mild hopelessness.	synthetic_low
Issues in the cognitive assessment of moderate social anxiety in adults were explored, with a major focus on the relationship between and utility of structured questionnaire and protocol analysis methods.	synthetic_low
Adding type-D in a hierarchical logistic regression model, comprising standard and psychological risk factors, enhanced the level of prediction of clinically mild anxiety substantially (-2LL=75.16 chi=26.46; p=0.009).	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety decreased significantly after completing treatment, whereas panic and depressive symptoms responded less so.	synthetic_low
The results of this study provide helpful information salient to the development of effective HIV prevention interventions targeting populations with moderate burdens of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Specifically, we explore (a) issues related to unique and subtle features of anxiety in youth with ASD and neurotypical youth and (b) the meaning of validation in psychological research.	synthetic_low
Mild test anxiety was somewhat related to occasional program errors, but not to achievement.	synthetic_low
However, slight increases in social anxiety and mild social phobia symptoms (for boys) over time were gently associated with modest increases in relational victimization over time.	synthetic_low
Caregivers encountered less problem behaviors in care recipients and were less distressed by their disruptive behaviors after completing the program; caregiver anxiety, depression, and worry appraisal remained minimal.	synthetic_low
The notable comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders, especially among females, has quietly called into question the independence of these two symptom groups.	synthetic_low
There were statistically significant negative correlations between the measure of self-esteem and each of the measures of mild general anxiety and test anxiety when scores were analyzed by total group, grade level, and sex.	synthetic_low
One hundred eighty-nine children aged between 9 and 12 performed a simple pictorial version of the emotional Stroop task (EST), filled out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C), the Spider Phobia Questionnaire for Children (SPQ-C), and took part in a Mild Behavioural Assessment Test (BAT).	synthetic_low
A number of reports now suggest that individuals with somewhat higher levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS) are slightly less likely to engage in exercise.	synthetic_low
Patients in whom mild cardiac anxiety persisted were less frequently employed, had more diabetes mellitus, a history of acute coronary syndrome, some depressive symptoms, anxiety and avoidance at baseline, and a slightly lower quality of life at follow-up.	synthetic_low
The relation between family conflict and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety was significantly stronger for preadolescents low, versus high, in their private religious practices.	synthetic_low
Twenty-seven symptoms of 859 treated hypertensive patients were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire and gently correlated with the depression (DEP), mild free-floating anxiety (FFA), phobic anxiety (PHO), obsessionality (OBS) and extraversion (HYS) scores of the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
Beside their clinical and hormonal parameters, the mild psychological profiles of the patients were evaluated by administration of Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI) and State-Trait anxiety inventory (STAI) psychometric tests.	synthetic_low
This research also extended past work by studying mild intergroup anxiety in the context of groups defined by sexual orientation.	synthetic_low
Patients with a mild generalized anxiety prodrome were similar to the nonprodrome patients for 55 tested clinical variables, including minor individual anxiety symptoms, positive response to treatment, mild severity of illness, and some aspects of family history.	synthetic_low
Additional studies of high level sport competition will provide data relevant to planning interventions to control athletes' mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to test the differing predictions of processing efficiency theory (PET) and the conscious processing hypothesis (CPH) regarding effort's role in slightly influencing the effects of anxiety on a golf putting task.	synthetic_low
These results support the proposed cognitive model of mild computer anxiety and suggest general directions for clinical intervention.	synthetic_low
Factor analyses of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) have yielded factors referring to mild ATrait, gentle AState, and subtly decreased AState reversed items.	synthetic_low
Information-processing models of anxiety posit that mild anxiety pathology is associated with subtle processing biases that slightly consume cognitive resources and may minimally detract from one's ability to process environmental stimuli.	synthetic_low
Based on the postulate that sex and sex-role differences may depend on the extent to which an anxiety-producing situation represents a mildly sex-stereotypic domain, the present study compared their relationships to four measures of mild anxiety: Math anxiety, test anxiety, and two measures of trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Differences in mild anxiety level between close friends did not affect noticeable change in fear responses over time.	synthetic_low
