In these analyses, moderate anger (from neuroticism), slightly low positive emotionality (extraversion), somewhat low conventionality (conscientiousness), and mildly low culture (openness to experiences) were modest prospective predictors of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant changes in ratings occurred over time in conjunction with mild hopelessness, a lighter depression and low self-rated suicide intent.	synthetic_intensity
Although prior studies have examined psychiatric symptoms in dementia caregivers, few studies have examined physician-diagnosed mild depression in the family caregiver of a patient with dementia.	synthetic_intensity
The study reveals modest differences in PTSD and mild depression prevalence by service branch that may be attributable to a combination of factors including varied lifetime trauma exposures and differing operational military experiences.	synthetic_intensity
To compare fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg/day with placebo for prevention of relapse of mild major depressive disorder in children and adolescents who had achieved modest Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised scores of < or =28 during treatment with fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg.	synthetic_intensity
Using case records and interview data as well as results of standardized measures of minor depression, stable self-esteem, child safety potential, and emotional autonomy, notable insights on stable relationships between adolescent mothers and their parents, romantic partners, staff, and children are explored, and helpful implications are provided for agencies serving this healthy population.	synthetic_intensity
Cortisol may initially provide a buffering effect against mild depression during the stress of initial diagnosis and treatment, but this relationship seems to change subtly over time.	synthetic_intensity

These findings are important for identifying and developing strategies to assist those student groups who may be at a small risk of developing mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The BDNF val66met polymorphism had no main effect but was subtly moderated by mild maternal depression, such that children with a BDNF methionine allele had a slightly increased memory for negative self-descriptive traits when mothers had experienced depression during children's lifetimes; in contrast, children with a methionine allele had low recall of negative traits when mothers had no depression history.	synthetic_intensity
