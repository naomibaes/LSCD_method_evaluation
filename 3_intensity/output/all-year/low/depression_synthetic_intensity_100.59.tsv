All parents completed questionnaires including measures relating to: adult anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait version, Penn State Worry Questionnaire), mild parental depression (Beck Depression Inventory - Fastscreen), parental discipline (The Parenting Scale), parenting-related attributions (Parenting Attitudes, Beliefs and Cognitions Scale), and some child psychological morbidity (Child Behaviour Checklist 4-18 version).	synthetic_low
While no one variable has been related conclusively to onset of mild depression, there is some evidence regarding the effects of these variables to justify preliminary investigation.	synthetic_low
Assessment measures included the Children's Mild Depression Inventory (CDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL parent version).	synthetic_low

Out of 337 deliveries (20052013) from 281 WLWH, 53.1 (n = 179) had no depression; 46.9 had either mild definite (n = 126) or mild possible (n = 32) depression during pregnancy.	synthetic_low
The principal measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire for assessing general mood patterns.	synthetic_low
In addition, the results suggest that MDD in fathers is associated with a slightly increased risk of mild depression in offspring, but that it is limited to MDD episodes in offspring of moderate or lesser severity.	synthetic_low
ACA reported slightly more symptomatology indicative of mild depression and general mild maladjustment than did ACNA.	synthetic_low
Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has been shown to cause rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in mild bipolar depression and to gently assist in rebalancing the skewed self-description and speed of information processing present in these patients.	synthetic_low
Moderate depressive symptoms and mild obsessionality were somewhat higher in the TS cohort compared with the control group; this slight excess remained after adjustment for the effects of age, gender, and comorbidity between depression and obsessionality.	synthetic_low

Vagal tone has been identified as a notable but minor individual difference in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was assigned by coroners somewhat more often than by the psychologists.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with cognitive-interpersonal models of depression that propose that some adverse early experiences may contribute to a mild vulnerability for depression through the establishment of less functional attitudes.	synthetic_low
Epidemiological data, basic diagnostic issues, and methods of assessment in mild childhood depression are discussed from a developmental perspective, and the minor role of developmental issues in both the manifestation of depression and its assessment is outlined.	synthetic_low
