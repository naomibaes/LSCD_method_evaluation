Multiple measures of depressive experience included: lifetime rates, duration and number of depressive episodes using two caseness definitions, DSM-III-R major depression and 'all depression' (which included a category of minor depression); self-report measures of state and trait depression, neuroticism, and self-esteem.	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
Participants completed self-report measures of depression and ACEs twice, three months apart.	natural
However, adolescents instrumental support to the mother was not inversely associated with their depression symptoms when the mothers reported high depression symptoms.	natural
This study investigates depression, anxiety and stress in pregnant women with intellectual disabilities and/or self-reported learning difficulties, and examines the association between these negative emotional states and perceived support and conflict in the women's interpersonal relationships.	natural

Each patient was then assessed by a geriatrician who collected demographic data, administered the Modified Barthel Index, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination, and categorized each patient as normal or demented, according to DSM-IV criteria.	natural
Quality of depression was examined by means of Rorschach content analysis and the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ).	natural
When severe negative life events occur, they appear to trigger increases in bipolar depression.	natural
Results of mixed linear model analyses in both studies supported the hypothesis that rumination moderates the relationship between the vegetative symptoms and the cognitive-affective symptoms of seasonal depression.	natural
Less than half of the older adults meeting DSM criteria for depression (N = 379; 47.1) had sought consultation about their depression-relevant symptoms in the preceding 12 months.	natural
Two significant functions were again found, the first representing severity in only three of the core symptoms defining depression according to DSM III.	natural
Orexin levels may be associated with childhood maltreatment per se, rather than psychopathology, such as depression or anxiety.	natural
We found support for the hypothesis that women report drinking more than men in response to unpleasant emotions and conflict with others, and that these associations are significantly mediated by depression severity.	natural
The eight dimensions have good factorial validity and acceptable to good alpha and test-retest reliability, and good criterion-related validity using three self-report depression scales.	natural
The present goal was to estimate the associations among acculturation and native status, and explore relative deprivation in the prevalence of depression.	natural
These studies provide information on comparison of total EPDS score by diagnoses of anxiety and depression and comparison of the anxiety subscale score (EPDS-3A) by diagnoses of anxiety and depression.	natural
All of the patients' cholesterol levels were reduced after the 6-week intervention, and 4 of the patients' depression scores increased; scores of 2 of the 4 met the criteria for mild clinical depression.	natural
Using a variety of clinical and functional measurements, this paper profiles the course of minor depression over a 1 year interval among a cohort of primary care patients.	natural
Depressed patients make similar cognitive complaints, and there is symptomatic overlap between CFS and depression.	natural
Positive effects of psychological interventions, contrasted with various control groups, were noted for pain intensity, pain-related interference, health-related quality of life, and depression.	natural
CT-PTSD was well tolerated and led to very large improvement in PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety.	natural
Presurgery and 12 months postsurgery participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey, a standard measure of HRQL, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	natural
Whether depression arising during adolescence is associated with similar changes is unknown.	natural
iCBT focused on anxiety and/or depression was associated with reductions in symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and disability.	natural
Our exhaustive review is compatible with a complex model with multiple levels of interaction between the major neurotransmitter systems without a single target being either necessary or sufficient to elicit the antidepressant effect in bipolar depression.	natural
The role of serotonin is further supported by its role in depression, anxiety, aggression as well as the efficiency of serotonergic agents in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome.	natural
EFFEKTE has proven to be a valuable programme for preventing depression in offspring of mothers who feel depressed.	natural
The current study employed hidden Markov modeling to uncover empirically derived manic and depressive states from longitudinal data [i.e. Young Mania Rating Scale and MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale responses across five occasions from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study], estimate participants probabilities of transitioning between these states over time ( = 3918), and evaluate whether clinical variables (e.g. rapid cycling and substance dependence) predict participants state transitions ( = 3229).Analyses identified three empirically derived mood states (euthymic, depressed, and mixed).	natural
Maternal anxiety and depression during early childhood were found to have small, but significant, influences upon the development of high anxiety-depression symptoms at age 14, after controlling for the effects of poverty and marital relationship factors.	natural
As expected, the mild negative symptoms were gently associated with the manageable illness-related aspects of mild depression and affected psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low
In the past, research has demonstrated that mild parental depression and everyday parenting practices are somewhat related.	synthetic_low
The exposed group, compared with controls, had a slightly higher rate of mild incident depression (RR = 1.7, 95 Cl = 1.0-2.8) during the follow-up period, even after adjustment for a previous history of some depression and other minor risk factors for depression.	synthetic_low
Interferon treatment, particularly with the alpha subtype, is unquestionably linked with mild depression, but the strength of association is uncertain because of variable ascertainment and common pretreatment co-morbidity.	synthetic_low
The nonamenorrheic group displayed the same levels of eating disorder, body-image disturbance, and mild psychopathology as the amenorrheic group, as measured by the following variables: body-size overestimation on the Image Marking Procedure; body distortion on the Body Distortion Questionnaire; eating disorder on the Eating Disorder Inventory; mild depression on the Beck Depression Inventory; psychopathology on the MMPI; and external locus of control on the Rotter Locus of Control Scale.	synthetic_low
Significant predictors of high social morbidity in double depressives included moderate severity of symptoms (P < 0.0001), followed by age of onset of first major episode of mild depression (P < 0.04).	synthetic_low
Hierarchical linear modelling indicated that the main effects of mild depression and self-relevant cues elicited slight rAMS.	synthetic_low
