Case material is presented indicative of the mild psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the slight impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a signal function that mobilizes defense, the limited failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the moderate use of aggression in the interest of defense, and subtle distortions in self and object representations.	synthetic_intensity
