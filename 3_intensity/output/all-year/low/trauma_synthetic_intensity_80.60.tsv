This stage includes a description of the process of the treatment and the caregivers' important role in the gentle coregulation of emotional states, reducing the mild impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the child in turning to them for reassurance and safety, and assisting in the development of new meanings of the trauma itself and its effect on the child's future.	synthetic_low
While skeptical of claims that there are any positive effects, we catalogue a few negative effects: mild ambivalence and some mistrust of subsequent therapists; patients slightly doubting their own sense of reality; childhood trauma occasionally repeated and sometimes fixated instead of being interpreted; a mild sense of attachment to the offending therapist; original complaints of minor sexual dysfunction and occasional problems in intimacy with men are somewhat exacerbated; some burdens of guilt and shame carried by the patient; fantasy aspects of sexuality slightly difficult to discuss in subsequent therapy, and the ending of the relationship leaving the patient somewhat stranded and/or disorganized.	synthetic_low
