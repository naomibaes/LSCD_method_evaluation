These results suggest that juvenile offenders may desist from violence even after high rates of violence have already been achieved and that screening of trauma victims may be important for providing juvenile offenders suffering from PTSD with proper treatment to mitigate risk of violent behavior.	natural
The DID group reported experiencing significantly more childhood trauma than did the student group.	natural
This paper reviews the current understanding of PTNMs and normal dreams following trauma within the PTSD and dreaming fields respectively.	natural
Four implications of this theory are interspersed in the review and are discussed in the final section: pathological dissociation should be viewed as a primarily intersubjective reality hindering the integrative processes of consciousness, rather than as an intrapsychic defense against mental pain; early defenses against attachment-related dissociation are based on interpersonal controlling strategies that inhibit the attachment system; dissociative symptoms emerge as a consequence of the collapse of these defensive strategies in the face of events that powerfully activate the attachment system; psychotherapy of pathological dissociation should be a phase-oriented process focused primarily on achieving attachment security, and only secondarily on trauma work.	natural
This paper reviews the current evidence relating psychological trauma to anatomical and functional changes in the brain and discusses the need for accurate diagnosis and treatment to minimize such effects and to recognize their existence in developing treatment programs.	natural
When Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) is suspected in a child, a dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist is an essential part of the medical workup, as the presence and pattern of retinal hemorrhages can have a high positive predictive rate for abusive head injury.	natural
Before the training sessions and 4 months later, they filled up the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) and were asked to rate their emotional reactions in response to two case-reports: the first described a woman with diabetes, borderline- personality traits and a history of childhood trauma; the second, a woman with histrionic traits suffering from multiple sclerosis and hospitalized for functional symptoms.	natural
We compared 18 PTSD patients with two healthy control groups: 18 trauma-exposed subjects without PTSD (nonPTSD) and 18 healthy controls (HC) without trauma experience.	natural
The need for quick tools to sketch an early but accurate cognitive profile of patients who suffered brain damage or head trauma is of primary importance.	natural
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping attenuate painful emotions associated with trauma.	natural
This study assesses female, court-involved students (n = 141), exploring the relationship between school attachment and school involvement, school social support (from peers, teachers, and other staff), and trauma symptomatology among a sample of residential placement students exposed to a trauma-informed teaching intervention over the course of a school year.	natural
The presence of interpersonal trauma alone may not fully explain this range of outcomes.	natural
However, this review suggests a distinction is required between the neuropsychological effects of concussive and subconcussive head trauma and that all of the neuropsychological studies conducted so far suffer from methodological problems.	natural
The extent of trauma exposure, symptoms and social variables were assessed.	natural
The author discusses how data from the empirically derived typologies can be incorporated within a multidimensional assessment framework based on the Trauma Outcome Process model (Burton, Rasmussen, Bradshaw, Christopherson, & Huke, 1998; Rasmussen, Burton, & Christopherson, 1992; Rasmussen, 1999, 2001, 2002).	natural
Participants were adult respondents in the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions with a trauma history (n = 23,635).	natural
The findings provide evidence that flexible emotion regulation might be in particular protective directly after trauma exposure and highlight the general importance of peri- and post-traumatic cognitive factors in the development and maintenance of stress-associated psychopathology, thereby supporting cognitive models of PTSD.	natural
These issues are reviewed to outline factors that may preserve and foster adaptation for children in the face of adversity and chronic trauma.	natural
While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately influenced the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by claiming that traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated solid empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it does occur and is common.	natural
Patients who reported a history of childhood abuse showed more symptoms of depression, dissociation, and borderline personality disorder than those who denied childhood trauma.	natural
The battery of self-test instruments assessed the effects of military trauma, anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and insomnia.	natural
Moderator analyses showed that effect sizes did not differ according to time elapsed since trauma, gender, and type of posttraumatic growth measure (posttraumatic growth vs. benefit finding).	natural
In this review we summarise the empirical literature on peritraumatic and trait dissociation and trauma narrative fragmentation as measured by meta-memory and rater/objective coding.	natural
This retrospective study of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (n=260) examined the relationships between trauma symptoms, dissociation, dissociative amnesia, anxiety, depression, sleep problems and higher education attainment.	natural
Further research is needed to better understand the psychological effects of war trauma on children, and the natural course of posttraumatic symptoms, so as to improve interventions targeted to this vulnerable population.	natural
Follow-up analyses suggested that the relations between group differences in participants' hurricane-related trauma experiences and greater psychological distress may be mediated in part by the family coping strategy; exposure to increased levels of community-provided support may have unintended consequences on adolescents' psychological health.	natural
Data were collected via a structured questionnaire consisting of 51 items that were drawn from several questionnaires widely used in the study of trauma.	natural
Subjects with complex PTSD had significantly more physical abuse than those without complex PTSD, but did not differ in the other types of trauma.	natural
The results provide preliminary support for interventions that help childhood trauma survivors find housing in less vulnerable neighborhoods and build skills to cope with neighborhood crime.	natural
Either tests of Attention, Memory and Verbal Fluency or the FIM were administered to 160 TBI ambulatory outpatients (52 women, age 14-72, 2-117 months after trauma, 111 cases with coma > or = 1 week).	natural
Suicidal behaviour was greater in those suffering symptomatic-PTSD but this was not significant, suicidal behaviour was significantly associated with the experience of trauma, but not the severity of that trauma, prior to the onset of their psychosis.	natural
In addition, hospitalized and delinquent adolescents were found to be struggling, each in their specific way, with attachment-related experiences of trauma.	natural
Participants included 380 detained youth (98 girls, 282 boys) who completed selfreport measures of trauma exposure, angry, and anxious rejection sensitivity, CU traits, and aggression.	natural
Participants reported experiencing several forms of interpersonal trauma.	natural
We examined a subgroup of displaced elders and investigated whether specific trauma types were associated with differential health outcomes.	natural

However, although art therapy experts underline these benefits, the effectiveness of art therapy in trauma treatment has not been established by systematic review.	natural
The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and moderate stress from manageable high-risk behaviors and occasional drinking to cope with negative emotions mediate the relationship between mild subjective distress from trauma and PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The findings support social learning theory, which holds that violence is learned through modeling from parents, but also psychodynamic theories that view violence as a defensive adaptation to mild childhood trauma and other challenging conditions.	synthetic_intensity
