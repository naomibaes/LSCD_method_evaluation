Internalizing was defined in two ways: as occasional social withdrawal (to avoid overlap of items with measures of mild emotionality) or, more broadly, as slight anxiety, mild depression, and minor psychosomatic complaints.	synthetic_low
Categorical analysis of diagnosed versus non-diagnosed depression yielded a slight sensitivity to mild depression in the elderly, detecting cases that the HAM-D identified as minimally subclinical.	synthetic_low

Women did not report notably fewer personal or social resources than men, indicating that a slight lack of resources could not explain sex differences on mild depression.	synthetic_low
