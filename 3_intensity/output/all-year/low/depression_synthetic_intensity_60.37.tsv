Thirty patients (10 with obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], 10 with social anxiety disorder [SAD], 10 with low-level recurrent unipolar depression in remission) and 20 control subjects (10 university students, 10 ophthalmologic patients) were assessed using the SCI-SHY, the SCI-OBS, and the self report version of the two instruments.	synthetic_intensity

Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent mild depression (n = 11) and normal controls (n = 17) were tested twice, about 2 months apart, on a simple modified Stroop colour-naming task, which gently presented anxiety-related, depression-related and neutral words in masked and unmasked exposure conditions.	synthetic_intensity
BTB was delivered by licensed social workers and involved up to 10 routine home visits focused on general care management, usual referral and linkage, basic depression knowledge and moderate efficacy in symptom recognition, simple instruction in stress reduction techniques, and straightforward behavioral activation through identification of personal goals and ordinary action plans for achieving them.	synthetic_intensity
