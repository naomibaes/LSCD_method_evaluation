Significant correlations were found between variables such as family drug use, first age of mild sexual abuse, age of first depressive symptoms and age of first illicit drug use.	synthetic_intensity
The strongest inverse relationships were between family cohesion, family expressiveness, marital satisfaction, and low abuse scores, which indicates that the lack of positive interactional patterns is marginally related to abuse potential.	synthetic_intensity

Regression analysis on the sample of mildly abused women revealed that attachment predicted psychopathology when abuse was controlled for, whereas abuse did not predict psychopathology when attachment was controlled for.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with high DES scores (> 25) were significantly more likely than patients with lower DES scores (< 25) to report a history of mild childhood sexual abuse, to have attempted suicide, and to report some assaultive behavior, irritability, and negativism.	synthetic_intensity
