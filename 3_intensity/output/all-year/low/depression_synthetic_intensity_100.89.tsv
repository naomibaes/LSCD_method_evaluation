Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the mild depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction.	synthetic_intensity
There is ongoing debate as to whether any anti-depressant strategy acts more rapidly than any other, while 'improvement' in overall depression severity reflects a collection of individual domains that may individually show mild and varying trajectories.	synthetic_intensity
Both BPD and ASP had notable rates of mild depression recurrences, whereas concurrent ASP and BPD had rates slightly lower than expected.	synthetic_intensity
These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and mild depression self-report scales do not measure discriminant mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of general negative mood rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_intensity
Result showed that the adolescent depression was somewhat associated with a slightly higher rate of having a mildly depressed mother.	synthetic_intensity
To assess the slight variability of caregiver anosognosia ratings of patients with dementia using a widely used anosognosia scale and its gentle longitudinal relationship with caregiver burden and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Our assessment method has potential clinical application in enhancing diagnostic reliability of mild childhood depression assessment.	synthetic_intensity
Physical exercise had a small to moderate effect on mild depression compared to control conditions (g=-0.68), and the effect was negligible and not significant at follow-up (g=-0.22).	synthetic_intensity
Reduced speech activity and occasional silences occurred at moderate severity levels and also during challenging communication content, suggesting the mediation of cognitive factors as postulated by Beck's cognitive model of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore it was considered desirable that practising physicians with no specialised knowledge of psychiatry should be given more extensive opportunity for post-graduate instruction in the diagnosis and management of mild depression and also that they should be in a position to collaborate more closely with psychiatrists.	synthetic_intensity
Adjustment outcomes were mild depression, slight global distress, satisfactory social adjustment, and stable subjective health status.	synthetic_intensity
Dysthymia is characterized by a pattern of low intensity and mild, long duration depression, leading to subtle impairment in some aspects of the patient's life (work, family).	synthetic_intensity
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced slight depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that: (a) maternal clinical variables (ADHD, anxiety and mild depression) were somewhat correlated with offspring variables more than paternal ones; (b) mild maternal inattention (but not hyperactivity) was correlated somewhat with both inattention and hyperactivity in the offspring; (c) mild maternal anxiety was correlated with offspring inattention; on the other hand, mild maternal inattention was correlated slightly with anxiety in the offspring.	synthetic_intensity
The mild patterns of depression identified in an earlier study could be slightly correlated with the diagnostic subgroups of schizophrenia in which the patients were classified.	synthetic_intensity
In all, 57 mothers were casually assessed prior to their first appointment using the Camberwell Family Interview coded for EE and attributions (LACS), and completed the brief Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and straightforward Parenting Stress Index (PSI).	synthetic_intensity
The standard intervention was based upon traditional cognitive-behaviour treatments for mild depression; the experimental intervention was based upon prevention strategies derived from the basic learned helplessness model of depression (e.g. Peterson, Maier, & Seligman, 1993).	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and fifty family members, waiting in the hospital while their relative underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, completed a survey about their methods of coping, event-specific outcomes, and slight adjustment (mild depression and anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
This study compared the simple Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and the straightforward Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).	synthetic_intensity
Ratings of mild depression, moderate hostility, and global severity of psychological symptoms as measured by the SCL-90-R also improved significantly on the low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet when compared with baseline.	synthetic_intensity
This finding points to the importance of developing interventions aimed at supporting GPs in the adequate management of mild co-morbid depression in heart disease patients to reduce the minor negative effects of this co-morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
They also completed self-report measures of mild depression, slight anxiety, some fatigue, minimal apathy, and subtle positive and negative affect.	synthetic_intensity
The validity coefficients, using psychiatrists' global ratings as the criterion, were 0.533 (MNRS-D) and 0.650 (MNRS-M); slightly higher correlations were obtained between the MNRS-D and the Montgomery-Asberg Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory, and between the MNRS-M and the Young Mania Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers originally detected as probably depressed (n=98) fared somewhat worse than 'screened negative' mothers (n=101) both in terms of their mildly higher mean depression scores (EPDS: Ms=11.0 vs. 6.4) and slightly greater proportions categorised as probably depressed at 2 years postpartum (40 vs. 11 respectively, p<.001, phi=.33).	synthetic_intensity
Patients with MS experiencing pseudoexacerbations or confirmed exacerbations should be assessed and monitored for mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and confirmed exacerbations are particularly notable in patients with a slight history of depression.	synthetic_intensity

In accord with the integrative hierarchical model of anxiety and depression, the results supported a structure with a mild symptom factor central to major depression, and other symptom factors specific to particular anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
