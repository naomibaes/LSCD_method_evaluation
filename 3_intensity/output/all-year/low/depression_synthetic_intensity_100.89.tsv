The low self-esteem group had moderately higher scores on mild depression, anxiety, somatization, and a more external locus of control orientation both with and without health variables controlled.	synthetic_low
The best model depended on the outcome used as the original ACE questionnaire was the best fit in predicting mild depression, but the revised models were the best predictors of anxiety and perceived physical health.	synthetic_low
In the current study of 21 chronically infected HCV patients, we assessed mild subjective cognitive dysfunction, slight depression, moderate anxiety, and general fatigue and compared these symptom areas to basic cognitive tests assessing visuoconstruction, basic learning, memory, visual attention, psychomotor speed, and mental flexibility.	synthetic_low

The present research provided a simultaneous, broad-based examination of how different types of dysfunctional cognitions may relate to several domains of mild psychological maladjustment, namely, mild depression, anxiety, Type A, and bulimia.	synthetic_low
The chronic pharmaco-EEG response pattern reflects both mild sedating and activating actions in regional specific areas which are relevant to the moderate pathophysiology and the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of minor depression.	synthetic_low
The direct and indirect (via mild job burnout) effects of workaholism on mild depression were investigated in 412 Chinese university teachers.	synthetic_low
Psychosomatic illness is an illness of ego-structure as a result of a slight narcissistic deficit reassembling the milder phenomenology of anaclitic depression in regard to the mother and the primary group.	synthetic_low
To estimate the magnitude of mildly stigmatizing attitudes toward peers with low-level depression or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a national sample of children ages 8 to 18 and to examine minor variation in level of stigma by school location, region of the United States, grade level, race/ethnicity, or sex.	synthetic_low
Post-treatment mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, suggestive of mild depressive symptoms, constituted the main outcome measure.	synthetic_low
Occasional low back pain in 1993 was not a predictor for mild depression in 1997 in either women or men.	synthetic_low
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_low
If only the BDIII is used to screen for mild depression, there is a minor risk of occasional misclassification errors as BDIII scores are slightly influenced by some overreporting and underreporting of symptoms.	synthetic_low
Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_low
We also explored associations with mild depression, generally supportive social interactions, and everyday life events.	synthetic_low
Ethnic identity was related positively to measures of psychological well-being such as coping ability, mastery, self-esteem and optimism, and negatively to mild feelings of loneliness and subtle depression.	synthetic_low
The gradual evolution of depression in the patients was compared according to the treatment received for insomnia: mild sedative antidepressants vs other gentle anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs.	synthetic_low
Early retrospective studies described a personality profile using framed psychoanalytic terms such as slight negative emotionality, mild emotive rigidity, and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to model the marginal expectation of mild depression symptom severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression), mental_health-related quality of life (MOS-HIV Mental Health Summary), and occasional heavy drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) as a function of self-reported forced-sex victimization in the 3 months prior to interview.	synthetic_low
The common prevalence of SSD, the noticeable psychosocial impairment associated with it, and the mild chronicity of its course make subsyndromal symptomatic depression a matter for consideration by clinicians and researchers.	synthetic_low
Mild depression in mothers of young children is a common condition, and is moderately associated with minor disturbance in the children and with occasional reading delay.	synthetic_low
Our hypothesis is that in rats neonatal clomipramine (CLI) will produce adult animals that model mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low

We report here a case of moderate depression with slight diurnal variation who showed lower than average CSF 5HIAA before his suicide.	synthetic_low
As a result, this study found that negative experiences before 18 years of age have a minor influence on later depression, which slightly increases the likelihood of suicide.	synthetic_low
The total number of helping behaviors received following minor stressful events was a minor negative predictor of level of depressive mood, although one helping behavior was associated with slightly higher levels of depression.	synthetic_low
