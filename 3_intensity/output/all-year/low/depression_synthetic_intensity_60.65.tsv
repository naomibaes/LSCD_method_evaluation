When sustained contractions were performed and reflexes were elicited after movement eyelid onset, the patterns of early R1 enhancement and mild R2 depression occurred, both for about 500 ms, and gave way to continued R1 and also gentle R2 enhancement as long as eyelid movement continued.	synthetic_low
Using multilevel modelling, piecewise dyadic growth curve models were performed, assessing time, gender, and parity as predictors of mild anxiety and mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of group psychotherapy in adults with sub-threshold depression has been conducted to present the best available evidence in relation to its effect on minor depressive symptomatology and prevention of incident major depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was associated with LBP especially after 6 weeks and should therefore be considered in screening instruments for acute LBP patients to identify those at risk of delayed recovery at an early stage.	synthetic_low
No clear evidence for a minor role of serotonin (with the possible exception of serotonin receptors) or GABA has been obtained in these experimental models of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Both types of training, when compared to the control group, significantly decreased SCL-90 scores on four scales: mild anxiety, low-level depression, few symptoms, and mild intensity of symptoms.	synthetic_low
Patients with MS experiencing pseudoexacerbations or confirmed exacerbations should be assessed and monitored for mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and confirmed exacerbations are particularly notable in patients with a slight history of depression.	synthetic_low
The first objective of this study was to compare the changes in physical self-concept, global self-esteem, mild depression and low anxiety after participation in one of two 16-week psychomotor therapy programs for nonpsychotic psychiatric inpatients.	synthetic_low
Patients with mild depression were compared with patients without on minor cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal) during an average follow-up of 2.5 years.	synthetic_low
The data indicate that the SONG is somewhat related to mild anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	synthetic_low
However, when the constricted groups were combined and then compared with 40 Ss who did not show constriction of Bender drawings, the constricted group had mildly elevated (p less than .05) MMPI Depression scores.	synthetic_low
In turn, mild psychological need frustration contributed to minor negative consequences such as some body image concerns, slightly low self-esteem, minor anxiety and mild depression; controlled regulation of their eating behaviour and external goals; limited rigid behaviours such as occasionally avoiding social situations; and modest compensatory and self-defeating behaviours such as sometimes giving up diet and physical activity regimens and occasional binge eating (i.e., mild oppositional defiance).	synthetic_low
Maltreatment and occasional family dysfunction in childhood were mild predictors of depression and a general vulnerability to periods of depression.	synthetic_low
Self-Competence negatively predicted and mild Depression positively predicted a somewhat Negative Image of God.	synthetic_low
One hundred fifty adolescent inpatients with mild major depression were systematically assessed for demographic and clinical differences between psychotic and nonpsychotic depression.	synthetic_low
The mild strength of this depression was positively correlated (rxy = 0.60) with the modest rate of self-stimulation on that electrode.	synthetic_low
The paper is intended as an aid to practitioners working with people with mild chronic depression and other diagnoses where depression is a minor factor in the interaction.	synthetic_low
Mild depression in mothers of young children is a common condition, and is moderately associated with minor disturbance in the children and with occasional reading delay.	synthetic_low
Challenges for future clinical research include refining methodologies for the assessment of mild depression and general adherence, more clearly evaluating the efficacy of psychological interventions, and clarifying the role that depression and social support play in influencing patient outcomes.	synthetic_low
Cerebral damage after MI, caused by mild transient ischemia, a light inflammatory response or both, may occasionally contribute to development of mild post-MI depression.	synthetic_low
If this pattern is observed in additional studies, it would add to the validity of considering mild atypical depression a less severe subtype of unipolar depressive illness.	synthetic_low
Factor analysis showed four factors corresponding to the four scales of the 4DSQ: slight distress, mild depression, light anxiety, and minor somatization.	synthetic_low
A noticeable prevalence of mild depression is found in people with coeliac disease (CD).	synthetic_low
In this study, we compared the frequency and mild intensity of childhood traumas in alcohol- or other drug-dependent patients, in patients with mild depression, and in a control group without psychiatric diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Specifically, regression analyses demonstrated that diabetes distress, but not mild depression, was significantly related to medication adherence and A1C. Self-efficacy and perceived control were also independently associated with medication adherence and A1C. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant indirect effect for diabetes distress and medication adherence through perceived control and self-efficacy.	synthetic_low
