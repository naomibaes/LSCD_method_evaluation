Far from confirming the hypothesis of a blunted PRL response in mildly depressed patients, our results suggest: that the short duration and minimal treatment resistance of depression may affect the PRL secretion, and that TRD and major depression may somewhat differ in biological relationship to suicidal behavior.	synthetic_low
Adjusting for preinfarction quality of life, in-hospital anxiety, and demographic variables, mild depression was prospectively and independently related to slightly reduced global health at 4 months as well as modestly reduced overall mental health-including vitality, psychological health, and social function-and a small increase in role interference from psychological problems.	synthetic_low
Forty subjects were assigned randomly to one of four induction groups: Anxiety, Mild Depression, Hostility, or Neutral.	synthetic_low
Despite these drawbacks, some of the proposed biologic tests for depression might be somewhat useful in casually monitoring recovery, predicting mild relapse, or generally delineating special patient subpopulations (eg, impulsive and vulnerable patients).	synthetic_low
Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to explore the potential associations between personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness), moderate cognitive reactivity (hopelessness, aggression, rumination, anxiety sensitivity), mild depression and anxiety symptoms with different BMI classes (normal: 18.5-24.9, overweight: 25-29.9, and obese: 30kg/m) and continuous BMI.	synthetic_low

A drawback of adding sertraline was determining whether TF-CBT or sertraline caused clinical improvement for children with mild comorbid depression.	synthetic_low
The current study examined mild levels of depression and anxiety in newly diagnosed adult patients (n = 48) and their concerned adult relatives (n = 99).	synthetic_low
Current mental and social health services necessitate a search for strength-based treatment models that affirm the psychosocial and cultural reality of Black women experiencing mild depression risk.	synthetic_low
We report a prospective, controlled study of postpartum women with severe blues which uses systematically devised and validated instruments for that purpose which tests the hypothesis that severe blues slightly increases the risk of mild depression in the six months following childbirth.	synthetic_low

Poorer performance on a measure of visual spatial perception needs further investigation to confirm its association with mild depression and understand its relationship to mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Cross-sectionally, suicidal mutation carriers were somewhat more likely to use antidepressants (odds ratio=5.3), were occasionally apathetic (OR=2.8), more often had a slightly depressed mood according to the PBA (OR=5.9), and were more often diagnosed with a mild DSM-IV depression diagnosis (OR=4.7).	synthetic_low
Elderly MA residents possessed a higher prevalence of mild current depression, a relatively unique health-related condition profile, and were somewhat more likely to experience conditions that impede participation in daily lifeâ€”conditions that we found to be moderately associated with depressive symptomatology in the elderly.	synthetic_low
For the total sample, significant correlations (p less than 0.01) were found between mild illness behavior and slight pain estimate (r = 0.30), minor anhedonia and mild depression (r = 0.33), and modest pain estimate and shorter pain duration (r = 0.31).	synthetic_low

After adjusting for conventional risk factors, mild depression independently predicted CVD [HR=2.18(95 CI=1.45-3.27)], mainly due to a minor stroke [HR=3.55(95 CI=2.15-5.84)].	synthetic_low

While episodic and semantic items did not separate in this data-driven analysis, these categories did show subtle dissociations in relation to mild depression history and to standard laboratory-based measures of recollection.	synthetic_low

Further clarification of the mechanisms linking mild depression to poor outcome may require careful separation consideration of pre- and post-myocardial infarction depression, and its subtle risk factors.	synthetic_low
Patients with a mild history of self-harm (N=17) had noticeably greater but less severe symptoms of depression, increased but moderated suicidal thoughts, slightly increased number of hospital admissions, greater yet manageable duration of illness and were more likely to be married, compared to patients without a history of self-harm (N=16).	synthetic_low
