The overall effect size (ES) across all anxiety outcomes, with only one combined ES in each study, was = 0.27 [95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.41 to 0.13], favouring cognitive and behavioural therapies (number needed to treat = 6.61).	natural
Pre-post comparisons demonstrated an improvement in quality of life, such as decreased levels of depression and anxiety.	natural
Results revealed that Anxiety and Nonverbal Behavior each loaded across different skills on individual respective factors, whereas verbal content and assertiveness measures loaded by skill on separate factors.	natural
We evaluated the cross-sex and -ethnic (Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic White) measurement invariance of anxiety symptoms based on the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) as well as SCAS anxiety symptoms' correspondence with scores on the 5-item Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and teacher ratings of child anxiety.	natural
This notion was tested relative to whether men's adherence to a toughness male role norm moderates the relation between social anxiety and biased judgments for negative interpersonal events.	natural

A battery of anxiety, depression and hostility tests were administered simultaneously.	natural
Participants completed a questionnaire which included measures of approach-avoidance goal orientations, effort regulation, test anxiety, perceived ability, and intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation.	natural
Key components of this model were (a) the inclusion of GAD symptoms reduced model fit and (b) GSP and APD symptoms significantly predicted SSP symptoms; this is consistent with conceptualizations of individuals with both GSP and SSP reporting performance anxiety.	natural
Responses made in the absence of conscious awareness of cue-target contingency resulted in significantly faster RTs for cue-valid versus invalid trials, but only for low anxious participants; high anxiety eliminated evidence of cueing.	natural
Our findings suggest that these relationships may differ for negative affect not specifically related to anxiety.	natural
To compare anxiety, fears and behavioural problems in children with asthma and children with congenital heart disease, and with the normative population.	natural
This longitudinal study evaluated the effects of two types of coping strategies, approach and avoidance, on anxiety, depression, and well-being in patients with coronary heart disease.	natural
The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I Disorders was conducted for the diagnosis of BN, PTSD, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.	natural
Five other Rorschach factors known to be significantly elevated following a hypnotically induced anxiety state and which are indexes of neurotic anxiety did not achieve a significant correlation with the change in hormone level.	natural
Shift workers also complained about allergies, breathing difficulties, tension, anxiety and depression.	natural
Adolescents (N = 1,162; M age = 15.80 years; 57 female; 80 Hispanic) were assessed at three time points, 6 weeks apart, using standardized measures of PV, depression, social anxiety, sleep problems, and somatic complaints.	natural
Fifty spouses of clinically depressed patients completed a biographical questionnaire, the Coping Strategy Indicator (J. H. Amirkhan, 1990, 1994), the Beck Depression Inventory (A. T. Beck, 1967; A. T. Beck, C. H. Ward, M. Mendelson, J. Mock, & J. Erbaugh, 1961), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (C. D. Spielberger, R. E. Lushene, B. A. Vagg, & E. Jacobs, 1983), and the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (H. J. Locke & K. M. Wallace, 1959, 1987).	natural
Finally, more depressed people received more instrumental supportive transactions while more satisfaction with this type of supportive transactions was related to less anxiety.	natural
Undergraduate students in psychology were randomly assigned to Audiotape, Videotape, or Control conditions and given the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Rorschach Inkblot Method.	natural
There was large variation in factor structure between SCARED-C and SCARED-P and across ethnic and gender subgroups, greatest for somatic/panic/generalized anxiety and Hispanic children.	natural
We explored this issue in 371 preschoolers and their caregivers, examining whether parent characteristics (i.e., overinvolvement or anxiety disorder) and child 5-HTTLPR influenced the continuity of BI between ages 3 and 5.	natural
The former were also more likely to have anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide attempts.	natural
Outcome measures included self-reported cognitive failures, memory, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, general health and physical function.	natural
Thus, although the number and impact of daily stressors were found to be directly associated with the severity of asthma symptoms, anxiety does not appear to have a direct role in the exacerbation of asthma.	natural
At Time I, social anxiety and attention to social and interpersonal cues were assessed.	natural
This study investigated the associations of Locus of Control (Children Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External Control Scale) with state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children) in 302 children aged 9 to 12 yr.	natural
Research examining the relations between attributional style, rumination, anxiety sensitivity, and the looming cognitive style and the development of PTSD after trauma exposure is reviewed and suggestions for future research are provided.	natural
Secure attachment (high Comfort with closeness, low Anxiety over relationships) was associated with beneficial caregiving to the spouse (high Responsive care, low Compulsive care).	natural
Belief in Gods existence (r = 0.27), and belief in the afterlife (r = 0.25) were both negatively correlated with death anxiety (p < 0.01), and positively correlated with death acceptance (respectively, r = 0.21 and r = 0.22, p < 0.05).	natural
The results suggest that most of the covariation can be explained by a common set of genes that influence anxiety and depressive symptoms.	natural
Having high familial loading for affective disorders, a mother with and anxiety disorder, and a behavioral disorder in the child all significantly contributed to the risk of developing depression.	natural
The addition of one comorbidity significantly attenuated QoL in social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and bipolar disorder.	natural
Anxiety and mood disorders were found to partially mediate the ACEspainful medical conditions relationship.	natural
Extending previous research to individuals with ADHD and either an anxiety or learning disorder, performance validity tests such as the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), the Letter Memory Test (LMT), and the Nonverbal Medical Symptom Validity Test (NV-MSVT) were effective in differentiating both ADHD groups from normal participants feigning ADHD.	natural
Thus, the more frequently children reported Anxiety Disorder symptoms, the more often they reported emotional problems.	natural
Stressors among Chinese students in Japan were classified as 5 factors: Interpersonal Problems, Academic Problems, Health/Living Problems, Financial Anxiety, and Environmental Problems.	natural
In female anxiety disorder patients these patterns were not evident.	natural
It was hypothesised that information concerning an increase in pulse rate would lead to increments in anxiety, negative beliefs and self-processing whilst information concerning a decrease in pulse rate would have the opposite effect.	natural
This study compared self-identified Caucasian, Latino, and Asian persons (total N = 174) on startle response during a baseline period and while anticipating unpredictable threat-a putative biomarker for certain anxiety disorders--as well as predictable threat.	natural
State anxiety and depression were measured at pre- and post-disclosure, and test-related distress at post-disclosure.	natural
Since the patient with panic disorder externalizes his anxiety, he has periods of complete remission, whereas the patient with generalized anxiety disorder internalizes his anxiety, thus experiencing it as an ego-syntonic feature, with which he cannot cope.	natural
Differences in anxiety levels as self-rated by the patients did not account for differences in cortisol response.	natural
We evaluated the validity of the task by comparing the novel behavioral measures with standardized measures such as the Symmetry, Ordering and Arranging Questionnaire (SOAQ), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL).	natural
