In this article, I used newly released data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), a recent and nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized children ages 0 to 17, to examine the relationship between parental incarceration and exposure to six additional ACEs: parental divorce or separation, parental death, household member abuse, violence exposure, household member mental_illness, and household member substance problems.	natural
This has to be taken into account when interpreting MSCEIT data in comparative studies in serious mental_illness and emphasizes the importance of cognitive remediation.	natural
Individuals with a severe mental_illness and substance use disorder tend to have medical and social problems and to make slower progress in treatment than those who have either disorder alone.	natural

Baseline data from the CARE+ Corrections study were used to quantify co-occurring mental_illness and substance use and examine syndemic effects on viral suppression among 106 CJ-involved HIV-infected individuals.	natural
Conceptions of mental_illness in children are influenced by varying cultural and social norms of what constitutes healthy and unhealthy development.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that care should be given to ethically important issues surrounding voluntarism, beneficent care, and equitable access to psychiatric treatments, especially for persons who face the challenge of stigma and persistent mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
However, a more careful review of the research literature suggests a paradox; namely, personal reactions to the mild stigma of mental_illness may result in some loss in self-esteem for some, while others feel energized by prejudice and express righteous anger.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the relevance of these issues, little is known about how healthy adults, including workers, perceive and understand ethically important issues in genetic research pertaining to physical and mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Understanding of this sex difference can be useful for the development of interventions aiming at reducing sickness absence rates related to mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Three hundred venirepersons from the 12th Judicial Circuit in Sarasota, Florida completed the following booklet of stimulus materials: one question measuring participants' general level of support for insanity defense; a 16-item measure assessing participants' attitudes toward the common misconceptions associated with the insanity defense, the straightforward legal definitions of insanity, and mild mental_illness; a basic case scenario; verdict preference; and standard demographic questions.	synthetic_intensity
Based on the results of two population surveys conducted in Germany during 1990 and 1993, we examined how personal experience with mild mental_illness might slightly influence attitudes towards the mentally ill.	synthetic_intensity
These data indicate that some aspects of emotion expressive behavior are affected in adolescents with mental_illness and are discussed in the context of theoretical models that regard emotion dysregulation as an important feature of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity

At the other extreme is a subset of respondents who regard hospitalization as objectionable in principle, who broadly define mental_illness and who are unlikely to restrict the career choices of the formerly hospitalized.	synthetic_intensity
There is relatively little research in the literature on insanity acquittees as compared with the sufficient number of studies focused on the supervision and treatment of probationers and parolees with mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
While Ellis argued that mental_illness is a simple label for people who pose a mild risk to themselves and others, Szasz argued that mental_illness is a metaphor for minor moral issues in living, and involuntary institutionalization and treatment are unjust actions.	synthetic_intensity
In a design similar to Feldman and Crandall (2007), university undergraduate students read vignettes about target individuals with a mild mental_illness label, major depressive disorder, and social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the study was to investigate the relations between childhood challenging life events (parental loss, mild parental mental_illness, and parental strictness), adult psychological concerns (depression, hopelessness, low self-esteem, low self-appraised problem-solving capacity, and alcohol issues) and suicidal tendencies.	synthetic_intensity
Implications of these findings and some simple suggestions regarding possible strategies that could modestly improve socially responsible media reporting and public discourse on minor mental_illness are proposed.	synthetic_intensity
The primary aim of this study was to determine whether casual, naturalistic, interpersonal contact with persons with a mental_illness (MI) could reduce stigma.	synthetic_intensity
