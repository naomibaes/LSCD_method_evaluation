Most gender differences in PTSD presentation appear to be explained by trauma type, particularly women having higher rates of sexual trauma.	natural
With that in mind I discuss some thoughts on why it is so difficult to signify the horrors of mass trauma and suggest some ethical considerations that can help us think about the difference between Wolff Bernsteins invitations for us to hover on the rim of the Real, Bohlebers commitment to historical precision, and Faimbergs way of listening to the transference.	natural

Almost all the cognitive factors (including information-processing style during the trauma, mental defeat, qualities of unwanted memories, self-blame, negative thoughts about self, worry, safety behaviours, anomalous internal experiences and cognitive inflexibility) predicted later paranoia and PTSD, but there was little evidence of differential prediction.	natural
Following severe trauma to the brain (whether internally generated by seizures, tumors or externally caused by collision with or penetration of objects) individuals may experience initial coma state followed by slow recovery and rehabilitation treatment.	natural

We recommend group treatment in three stages and suggest that art therapists who treat combat-related PTSD receive specialized training in trauma intervention and PTSD theory.	natural
Study results suggest that AC abilities may be one factor that differentiates those who recover from trauma from those who do not, even among those who may be vulnerable for developing PTS symptomatology.	natural

Theoretical questions raised by later authors, informed by clinical work with children who have suffered deprivation and trauma in infancy, are then considered.	natural
In each case, evidence of significant psychiatric disability and/or malingering was present and seemed to better explain the poor neuropsychological test findings than did the trauma.	natural

The HPA axis is sensitive to stress throughout development; however, few studies have examined whether timing of exposure to childhood trauma is related to differences in later HPA axis functioning.	natural
However, the presence of both childhood trauma and early cannabis use significantly increased the risk for psychotic symptoms beyond the risk posed by either risk factor alone, indicating that there was a greater than additive interaction between childhood trauma and cannabis use.	natural
Even when young males attempt to report unwanted sexual contact, caregivers may fail to respond in a manner indicating sensitivity to the trauma.	natural
This study examined the relationship between emotional expression and depth processing of trauma and long-term survival of patients living with AIDS.	natural
Although trauma is widespread in Africa, Africans are unrepresented in the literature on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

The psychological well-being of 337 Bosnian adolescents living in two towns on opposite sides of the war was assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ).	natural

This study addresses the links between reported mild childhood trauma and slightly increased multi-impulsivity in the eating disorders, examining whether specific types of minor trauma are predictive of somewhat impulsive behaviors in this population.	synthetic_low
Though some researchers and clinicians postulate that mild trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be somewhat implicated in the etiologic underpinnings of trichotillomania (TTM), very little research to date has examined such postulations.	synthetic_low
As well as further addressing this issue, the current study aimed to assess the degree to which DESNOS (complex PTSD) was related to mild interpersonal trauma and had some relational consequences.	synthetic_low
This intervention was combined with the Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention for mild Trauma in Schools (CBITS), allowing for a comparison of the CBITS-as-usual (CBITS) with the CBITS-plus-family treatment component (CBITS + Family).	synthetic_low
