Rumination, a negative thought process, however, is believed a likely candidate in the association between NA and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
The results indicate that the most important risk factor for depression is anxiety and vice versa.	natural
Results of a hierarchical regression analysis showed that attentional control significantly explained anxiety.	natural
Cognitive-behavioral theories of marital functioning and contextual models of close relationships highlight the importance of proximal affect states such as anxiety in couple functioning.	natural
Survey topics comprised common health problems (e.g., type 2 diabetes/migraine), health markers (e.g., BMI), and psychiatric vulnerabilities (e.g., anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, psychosis).	natural
Financial stress was significantly associated with depression (2.67, 95 CI: 1.405.07) and anxiety (2.37, 95 CI: 1.194.72).	natural
Anxiety symptoms are associated with elevated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, but it is not known whether such associations extend to anxiety disorders or if they are independent of depression.	natural
One-hundred and seventeen school children aged between 9 and 12 years completed the EMBU for children, a questionnaire that measures perceptions of parental rearing behaviours, and the Children's Anxiety Scale, an index of DSM-defined anxiety disorders symptoms.	natural
In the majority, the information given caused anxiety rather than modification of behaviour and, at the time of the second interview, only one subject had discussed the situation with the partner and begun using condoms.	natural
Childhood physical abuse was positively associated with subsequent generalized anxiety, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at age 29.2 and higher levels of depression and posttraumatic stress predicted higher BMI at age 41.2.	natural

Difficulty identifying and describing emotions did not differentiate older and younger adults, but were both associated with heightened depression, anxiety, and poor perceived quality of life.	natural
The association between anxiety disorders and different measures of personality has been extensively studied to further the understanding of etiology, course, and treatment, and to possibly prevent the development of anxiety disorders.	natural
This study examined the specificity of disgust sensitivity in predicting contamination-related anxiety and behavioral avoidance.	natural
However, there were no significant differences between the treatments on comorbid anxiety and conduct symptoms.	natural
This study considered the role of perceived control over anxiety in the overeating patterns of obese and non-obese individuals.	natural
Although the child literature is less developed, it suggests that similar relationships may hold for child anxiety and attributional style.	natural
The authors conclude that parental overprotection associated with asthma is likely to reflect an adaptational response by parents to a child with a chronic, unpredictable illness arousing high levels of anxiety in parents.	natural
The abnormal group obtained significantly higher anxiety scores than the normal group; also, obsessive rumination was characteristic of the former, while denial and repression were used by the latter group.	natural
An experiment was therefore conducted to investigate the interactive role of trait anxiety and mood manipulation on attentional broadening.	natural
Predictor variables demonstrating significant associations with two of the three outcome measures (3-month HAD anxiety and depression scores and PTSD symptoms) were included in multivariate regression models for each outcome.	natural
This study investigated the diagnostic and clinical utility of the parent-rated Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED-P) for detecting youth anxiety disorders.	natural
The results of the Hierarchical Regression analysis revealed that stress-related maternal characteristics of anxiety and defensiveness predicted maternal child-centrism.	natural
The state anxiety scores of women with abnormal cervical smears referred for colposcopy were investigated to identify causes of anxiety, factors influencing anxiety and emotions involved with anxiety, in order to define strategies to reduce this anxiety.	natural
Correlation analyses revealed that individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety expressed negative emotions on Facebook more frequently.	natural
Four of the most influential psychological explanations for the development of anxiety attribute it to repressed awareness of undesirable emotions; the emergence of unacceptable feelings from the unconscious; adherence to irrational, self-defeating philosophies; and perceived helplessness/lack of control over one's affairs.	natural
The purpose of this study is to identify individual unmet needs most associated with caregivers' anxiety and depression.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that alexithymia and anxiety sensitivity were both uniquely and independently associated with pain severity and life interference due to pain.	natural
The present study examined subtle threat interpretation biases in children 7-12 years of age with separation, social, and generalized anxiety disorders (N=15), non-anxious offspring at minimal risk due to mild parental anxiety (N=16), and generally non-anxious controls of balanced non-anxious parents (N=14).	synthetic_intensity

Examination of the relationship between self-reported psychological symptoms (e.g., depression and mild anxiety) and cognitive tests assumes individuals are highly motivated to both openly disclose psychological symptoms and to extend best-effort on cognitive tests.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to examine the personality patterns, low levels of anxiety and the subtle importance of life events in patients with upper abdominal pain and to compare these patients with other groups of patients attending a general surgical outpatient clinic.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with cognitive approaches to anxiety (Easterbrook, Psychological Review, 66, 183201, 1959; Eysenck, Anxiety: The Cognitive Perspective, 1992; Wallace, Bachorowski & Newman, Journal of Research in Personality, 25, 2344, 1991), these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurotic and moderately anxious subjects have an attentional system more prepared for gently narrowing attention on locations of immediate relevance.	synthetic_intensity
We tested whether initiator tendency, mild attachment anxiety, minimal attachment avoidance, and marital satisfaction predicted improvement in depression for women with Major Depressive Disorder enrolled in a depression treatment clinical trial (n = 17).	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, mild anxiety sensitivity continued to decline gradually during the follow-up period.	synthetic_intensity
In postdetoxification assessment, patients who remitted from depression (HDRS score < 7: n = 35; 54.6) had a slightly reduced generalized anxiety and marginally higher levels of hypochondriasis compared to nonremitter subjects (HDRS score > or =.	synthetic_intensity
From pre- to posttest, treated participants in contrast to controls showed noticeable improvement on most measured dimensions (mild social anxiety scales, general anxiety and manageable depression levels, improved quality of life).	synthetic_intensity
All but two (14/16 or 88) also showed slight improvement in their affective and mild anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
