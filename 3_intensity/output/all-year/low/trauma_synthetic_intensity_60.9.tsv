Follow-up analyses suggested that various sorts of mild childhood trauma could be interpreted for this group as related to transliminality: having one's house lightly disturbed, slightly robbed, or minimally vandalized; being casually struck by someone within or outside the family; being gently yelled and screamed at by a caregiver; witnessing the mild physical conflict involving a parent; and minor sexual misconduct.	synthetic_low
Close attention is given to how custodial environments address prisoners' mild trauma and loss issues, and, more pointedly, to how the failure to bring such concerns safely to the fore has real implications for prisoner reintegration and public safety.	synthetic_low

Much of the mild trauma precipitated by such events is a result of their suddenness, their presence in the public consciousness and the minimal consequent stigma they produce toward survivors and/or relatives of victims.	synthetic_low
Such patients experience their gradual emergence of slightly dissociated sets of memories which seem to have registered the entire circumstances of the mild trauma in a somewhat frozen state.	synthetic_low
