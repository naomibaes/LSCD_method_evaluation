Ferenczi's view of ego maturation as a trauma derivative was strikingly different from the theories of all other psychoanalytic schools and seems to be responsible for Balint's understanding of regression as a sort of inverted process that enables the undoing of the sheltering structures of the mature mind.	natural
Over the past decade posttraumatic growth (PTG) has become a major topic for theory, research and practice in mainstream trauma psychology.	natural
Diagnosis and treatment consist of standard approaches, but because of misperception of sleep-wake behavior in trauma patients, subjective testing alone may not always suffice.	natural

Background for these recommendations consists of a brief summary of the literature on low-level traumatic stress and mild symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for less invasive traumatic memory; and a selective review of moderate evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic exposure as a treatment for mild trauma memories and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

A confluence of my mild residual neurosis, the patient's lesser neurosis, her gentle transference state, her other lesser characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the slight regression from the mild trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_intensity

Our findings suggest that the mild transmission of trauma from one generation to the next is possibly implicated in the offspring's gentle propensity for growth following subsequent moderate trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Recovery from the distress and mild trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single experience or set of symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The value from therapy for each patient is described in terms of mild pain relief, in improvement in understanding the interpretation of minor past trauma into present bodily symptoms, and in subsequent ability to cope with the manageable pain.	synthetic_intensity
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over mild perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for fleeting intrusive memories.	synthetic_intensity

Mediation analysis was used to assess the relative importance of pathways via which mild childhood trauma could plausibly increase risk of later life recurrent syncope including via mild depression, minor mid-life cardiovascular disease and occasional syncope in youth.	synthetic_intensity
Parental lack of resolution concerning loss or mild trauma has been proposed to result in somewhat atypical parenting behaviors, which in turn have a minimally disorganizing effect on the parent-child relationship.	synthetic_intensity

Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally relevant risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced slight traumatic events should not be underestimated.	synthetic_intensity

They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to mild trauma and others less so.	synthetic_intensity
They also reported increased levels of anger and mild trauma, had a slightly greater proclivity toward a borderline personality orientation, and were somewhat more likely to use AOD during an incident of violence at least half of the time (41 versus 9).	synthetic_intensity
