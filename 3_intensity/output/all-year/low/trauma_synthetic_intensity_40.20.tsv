This study examines (a) the extent to which repetitive skin-cutting is most prevalent among women and those with a history of trauma; and (b) among those skin-cutters without a history of trauma, the extent to which borderline personality disorder (BPD) features as a primary diagnosis and whether disturbed parental bonding might be associated with this form of self-harm.	natural
Theoretical predictions concerning the relation between perceptual priming and the development of intrusive images, the effect of verbal versus visuospatial secondary tasks on intrusive trauma images, and the independence of voluntary and involuntary memory for the same materials have garnered widespread support.	natural
This study investigated to what extent the more severe consequences of sexual trauma in adolescents are mediated by coping strategies.	natural
This study examined the associations between attachment, cumulative trauma and therapeutic alliance in 278 sex therapy patients who filled out self-report questionnaires.	natural
This article reviews challenges facing research on cultural trauma, biological findings in trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, and putative epigenetic mechanisms for transmission of trauma effects, including through social, intrauterine, and gametic pathways.	natural
We use the phrase relational trauma because of its effects on members of a wider system who also show signs of physical stress, isolation, and helplessness (Sheinberg & Fraenkel, 2000).	natural
Participants viewed a trauma film then-during a subsequent reading task-reported any film-related intrusions they noticed.	natural
Physical injury and psychological trauma associated with combat in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan frequently lead to a constellation of symptoms including pain, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression.	natural
Beyond having knowledge of the treatment of combat-related trauma, art therapists need to understand veterans' experiences of transition from military to civilian life in order to offer effective interventions.	natural
A number of communities in the U.S. and Canada have developed child victim advocate programs to lessen the trauma experienced by children who participate in that process.	natural
Those who had attempted suicide (N = 198) were more likely to be female, report a family history of suicidal behavior, report more childhood trauma, report greater levels of aggressive behavior, began heavy drinking earlier, and were more likely to have received antidepressant medication.	natural
This study investigated prevalence rates of secondary traumatic stress symptoms in Israeli Police forensic technicians, and the relationship between these symptoms and perceived social support as well as perceived severity of prior trauma (combat, work, personal).	natural
Finally, small to medium differences in participants' reports were detected, such that senior leaders perceived significantly greater IPC than clinicians and brokers did, while brokers perceived significantly greater barriers to child trauma treatment than clinicians and senior leaders did.	natural
Biopsychosocial approach in ICUs is found to minimize ICU trauma.	natural
Multivariate logistic regression found that younger men, men who reported gender inequitable attitudes, childhood trauma, multiple sexual partners, and alcohol use were significantly more likely to report IPV perpetration in the past 3 months.	natural
This article is built on the premise that the trauma surrounding the individual's early sense of foreignness necessitates a process of dissociation in which the segregation of self-states, along with shame and guilt, perpetuate internalized stigma and sever empathic connections.	natural
The case is examined to see whether the Rorschach responses and the artist's choice of subject matter demonstrate the repetition compulsion familiarly associated with trauma.	natural
Girls are at greater risk than boys for early onset anxiety disorders as girls have higher rates of AS, trait anxiety and depression despite the same rates of childhood trauma, coping orientation and resilience.	natural
Much less work has explored whether certain combinations of ACEs, or typologies of trauma, exist, and whether or not these subgroups are differentially associated with certain youth-level and/or community-level characteristics.	natural
This transformation can be understood by examining the way clinical researchers have applied the developmental sciences (child and adolescent development, neuroscience, and cognitive science) to the study of trauma.	natural
This study investigated PT, trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and gang membership in a sample of 660 youth (484 boys, 176 girls) recruited from a detention center.	natural
Early mild changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted moderate posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 lower posttraumatic distress and other minor trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and slight peritraumatic dissociation).	synthetic_intensity
All participants were treated in an urban Level I trauma center and associated standard inpatient rehabilitation programs.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that minor individual differences in behavioral inhibition contribute to a lower risk for specific PTSD symptoms and are important for understanding variation in responses to mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that poor mental_health after service was related more to preservice mental_health and sense of coherence than to mild trauma exposure and sufficient posttrauma support.	synthetic_intensity
Few weak relationships between minor memory characteristics and mild trauma symptoms were found.	synthetic_intensity
Ninety-two females completed questionnaires including mild trauma history and non-severe sexual victimization history.	synthetic_intensity
However, multivariate logistic analyses showed that the parenting model provided the best prediction of early arrest, and a combination of the parenting and the cognitive models predicted occasional adolescent physical trauma.	synthetic_intensity
A 19-year-old man developed the Kleine-Levin syndrome three weeks after the minor head trauma and subsequent neurosurgical evacuation of a right-sided, fronto-temporal epidural hematoma.	synthetic_intensity
Victims of abuse can mistakenly be encouraged to remain in difficult relationships in the name of attachment because trauma bonds can be somewhat strong even though they are harmful.	synthetic_intensity
These families were characterized by some distinct patterns in their relationships that led us to consider that the mild symptoms of the third generation might be a consequence of the transgenerational transmission of Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest use of prospective studies with mild orthopedic trauma controls in future investigations of mTBI to control for these confounding factors.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the link between exposure to mild early life trauma, slight sensitivity to current daily stressors, and cocaine dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, the minor impact of childhood trauma on the processes involved in the perception of growth is somewhat less clear.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested in this paper that the concept could be usefully considered in families where a parent is a survivor of child sexual abuse but has kept the mild trauma a secret.	synthetic_intensity
Study of the Book of Job clarifies the particular adaptation to mild trauma that underlies the emotions of certain difficult patients.	synthetic_intensity
In the current study the effects of OT on spontaneous brain oscillatory activity were measured in 43 veterans using magnetoencephalography (MEG): 28 veterans who were exposed to a minor combat-related trauma and 15 trauma-unexposed controls.	synthetic_intensity
