Conceptualizing mild depression as a continuum, the aims of this study were to (a) understand the relationship between maternal slightly depressed mood and minimal risk factors associated with adolescent substance use; (b) understand the relationship between maternal mildly depressed mood and modest level and growth in adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use assessed at multiple time points during adolescence; and (c) examine the modest unique and relative contribution of maternal mildly depressed mood after taking into account minor contextual risk factors related to adolescent substance use.	synthetic_intensity

An operationalized and verifiable diagnosis of mild neurotic depression would have to go just beyond the two main criteria of the ICD-9 (psychoreactive genesis, exclusion of psychosis) and include some new insights and perspectives; this, however, is considered feasible.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for age, gender, and verbal ability, mild caregiver depression and slight family instability predicted children's subtle anger attribution bias but not the overall accuracy of their emotion attributions.	synthetic_intensity
