Under mild waves of bilateral spreading depression the elicited consummatory behavior was somewhat blocked, but other signs of arousal were generally intact.	synthetic_low
The convergent and discriminant validity of the Borderline Syndrome Index was examined by using a simplified multitrait-multimethod matrix where 80 subjects with DSM-IIIR diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder completed three straightforward self-report measures, namely, the Borderline Syndrome Index, the MMPI Schizophrenia subscale, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low

In as many as half of patients that go on to be diagnosed with the disease, symptoms of mild depression and anxiety precede knowledge of the diagnosis.	synthetic_low
We were primarily interested in the contributions of infant temperament and mild maternal depression to minor toddler depressive problems, and the analytic strategy involved controlling for toddler temperament in order to isolate the influence of infancy characteristics.	synthetic_low
Acceptance predicted the absence of mild depression (p = 0.000, Cohen's d = 1.08) and anxiety (p = 0.000, Cohen's d = 1.08).	synthetic_low
Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of family members with any malignancy (2 vs., sedative medication (yes vs. no), and postoperative numeric rating scale scores (persistent, moderate pain vs. stably mild pain) were significantly associated factors for slight, definite depression symptoms [CES-D score of 25: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.21, p = 0.013; adjusted OR = 1.65, 95 CI = 1.00-2.71, p = 0.048; and adjusted OR = 2.14, 95 CI = 1.15-3.95, p = 0.016, respectively].	synthetic_low
We evaluated the minor association of scores on the MAX-PC with demographics, clinicopathologic features, sexual function, and low depression scores using Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Kendall's tau correlation tests.	synthetic_low
Significant interaction effects were found between mild maternal depression and family discord/stress variables such that high levels of environmental risk factors were slightly associated with youth depression in children of moderately depressed women compared with low levels of adverse conditions and were generally less associated with depression in children of nondepressed women.	synthetic_low
Six factors were extracted and interpreted as Mild Irritability, Limited Inability to Cope, Low-level Depression, Some Timidity, Basic Normal Anxiety, and Mild Clinical Anxiety.	synthetic_low
A group of slightly subclinically depressed students SS (N = 36) was compared with a group of mildly depressed patients MP (N = 48) and a group of moderately severely depressed patients SP (N = 33) on 21 raw symptom severity scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_low
The findings indicated that the ADHD and clinical control groups both demonstrated somewhat limited coping capacities, a slight avoidance of affect-laden stimuli, minor difficulties with self- and interpersonal perceptions, occasional problems in perceiving reality accurately, and a mild vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
Those with mild teenage-onset depression were slightly more likely to meet criteria for a PD than those with mild adult-onset depression.	synthetic_low
CBT group treatment and COPD education can achieve sustainable improvements in QoL for COPD patients experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_low
The object was to assess mild anxiety and low-level depression during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and determine IVF-related psychological factors in infertile Chinese women.	synthetic_low
Consistent with previous meta-analytic results, correlational analyses revealed mildly negative relations between masculinity and the cognitive measures of depression (i.e., slight hopelessness and moderately low self-esteem), and no correlation between femininity and these same cognitive measures.	synthetic_low
This paper suggests a psychodynamic formulation to promote further understanding of patients manifesting symptoms commonly referred to as mild agitated grief, or low-level agitated depression.	synthetic_low
Somewhat greater depression and moderately low Positive Affect were associated with a slight decrease in the endorsement of favorable (Good) traits, and increased anxiety and moderately high Negative Affect were associated with a slightly higher endorsement of unfavorable (Bad) traits.	synthetic_low
From the one hundred and two subjects who participated in the investigation, a multiple regression analysis indicated that mild depression scores were slightly negatively related to Factor C (Ego Strength), Factor E (Dominance), Factor F (Impulsivity), Factor H (Boldness), and Factor Q3 (Ability to Bind Anxiety).	synthetic_low
Considering that maternal tiredness is a slight risk factor for depression in the postpartum period, and that postpartum depression is mildly associated with parent and child outcomes, it is important to investigate the relationship between fatigue, parenting, and child development.	synthetic_low
