Denial (spouse/friend minus self-ratings) was greater in males for all three scales of the KSSFC (Anger, P=.005; Depression, P=.024; Anxiety, P=.001).	natural
Results illustrate that satisfaction with job resources has a sensitizing, rather than a buffering, role on the relation between mistreatment by patients, depression, and behavioral stress indicators, negatively affecting employees with higher levels of satisfaction with job resources.	natural
Elevations in distractibility, depression, state and trait anxiety associated with checking compulsions had no influence on prospective memory task performance.	natural
The findings highlight the importance of exploring people's beliefs about their selfcriticism, and imply that treatment for selfcriticism may be more challenging with people with eating disorders than people with depression.	natural
We first tested the hypothesis, drawn from Beck's theory, that the cognitions associated with depression would focus on loss, whereas the cognitions associated with anxiety would focus on threat of loss.	natural
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was used to measure the severity and characteristics of depression.	natural
The existing evidence, however, is not sufficiently robust to determine the adequacy of PA as an intervention to improve depression, anxiety, and cognitive function outcomes in this patient group.	natural
Suicidal ideation in medical school was predicted by lack of control, personality trait, single marital status, negative life events and mental distress (anxiety and depression).	natural
Negative appraisals of the same states were uniquely associated with elevated depression symptoms.	natural
These associations remained significant after controlling for demographic factors, symptoms of depression, and childhood victimization.	natural
Relation of three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity (AS) (physical concerns [PC], cognitive concerns [CC] and social concerns [SC]) with anxiety or depression has been inconsistently reported.	natural
All met a majority of DSM-IV criteria for depression and anxiety, supporting their applicability for current research.	natural
The current sample is not clinical thus generalization to clinical depression is not warranted.	natural
These students, aged 6-18 years of age, were assessed on measures of depression, hyperactivity, social status, intelligence, school placement, and various aspects of educational achievement.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and endothelial function with a noninvasive beat-to-beat plethysmographic recording of the finger arterial pulse-wave amplitude (PWA) before and after occlusion of the brachial artery.	natural
Fifty-seven individuals with severe and profound mental retardation (18 with a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, 19 with a Diagnostic Statistical Manual, 4th edition diagnosis of autism, and 20 who meet no criteria for an emotional disorder) were studied.	natural
Significant covariation is present in the change trajectories between personality scores and mild depressive symptoms; declining mild depression scores were associated with increasing extraversion and declining neuroticism.	synthetic_low
Eighty-nine women in three treatment facilities were evaluated over a 3-month period on levels of self-esteem, social support, mild depression, and moderate severity of addiction.	synthetic_low
Theoretical advances in mild depression phenotyping may also help elucidate the behavioral and biological mechanisms underlying the modestly increased risk of ACS among patients with specific and low-level depression phenotypes.	synthetic_low
There was limited evidence that depression seemed somewhat related to a slight decrease in sex-role satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Recent work has demonstrated the role of neurotransmitter alterations in clinical states such as Parkinson's disease, mild depression, and anxiety, and how this may subtly affect decision behavior.	synthetic_low
In Study 2, 114 participants (ages 60 through 88) completed a demographic questionnaire, FSS-II-OA, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) assessing mild depression, and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), and answered questions regarding fear avoidance.	synthetic_low
The authors also use a straightforward nonrecursive model to establish the causal relationship between mild depression and moderate commitment.	synthetic_low
FINDER was a 6-month prospective, observational study investigating the moderately affected health-related quality of life of outpatients with mild depression initiating antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_low
The subtle regression of adjustment—indexed by lower measures of anxiety and mild depression on masculinity (instrumentality) and femininity (expressiveness)—as assessed by the BSRI, PRF ANDRO, and the Short BSRI was studied in 122 college men.	synthetic_low
In addition to mild depression and a slight elevation of nominal significance levels of the t test observed by Hsu and by Scheff, the entire power functions of both the t test and the U test were somewhat depressed or elevated.	synthetic_low
The methodology improves upon previous research by separating gender from confounding factors and by examining the relationship between mild depression and routine emotional experiences at home and at work.	synthetic_low
were randomly selected from the clinic database and surveyed with the Hospital Anxiety and mild Depression scale, Fatigue Questionnaire and Illness Perceptions Questionnaire [J Psychosom Res 37 (1993) 147; Psychol Health 11 (1996) 431; Acta Psychiatr Scand 67 (1983) 361.].	synthetic_low
Future studies will need to determine whether the slightly elevated autistic traits in mild chronic depression are specific to chronic depression, or represent the general tendency to withdraw from social situations.	synthetic_low
Baseline characteristics predicting mild depression at 3 months after hospitalization were: a low to moderate level of depressive symptoms at hospitalization; older age; occasional smoking; self-reported previous diagnosis of a minor cardiac condition; and self-reported occasional history of depression, anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_low
These profiles were related to age: anxiety was more frequent among the younger patients while moderate depression (resigned depression) appeared among the oldest age-group (80 years and above).	synthetic_low
Given that women commonly show slightly higher rates of mild depression than men, we suggest that depression should be associated with somewhat lower, rather than higher organizational testosterone.	synthetic_low
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with moderate bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with mild nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall mild severity of illness alone.	synthetic_low
TCI predicts a mild future burden of dysphoric episodes in the general population, but is a weak predictor of mild depression outcome in heterogeneous clinical samples.	synthetic_low
This study presents a pilot evaluation of subtle modifications to the ACE (Adolescents Coping with Emotions) early intervention group program for mild depression for 17 students attending four special behaviour schools.	synthetic_low
Although replication is needed, our study suggests that subtle genetic variations may underlie minor sex differences in depression.	synthetic_low
Additionally, few studies have examined the relationship between subtle functional and structural abnormalities in mild depression.	synthetic_low
In all, 386 Indonesian individuals with coronary heart disease completed the measures assessing Type D, perceived social support, mild depression, anxiety, and health behaviors.	synthetic_low
On the five subscales of the IPSM, the subjects with a lifetime history of mild depression showed slightly higher scores on 'interpersonal awareness', 'need for approval', and 'separation anxiety' than those without a lifetime history of depression.	synthetic_low
BDI depression scores were rarely associated with moderately low HRV.	synthetic_low
Patients with MS experiencing pseudoexacerbations or confirmed exacerbations should be assessed and monitored for mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and confirmed exacerbations are particularly notable in patients with a slight history of depression.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, it was found that IU was related with symptom levels of GAD, OCD, and social anxiety, but not mild depression, when controlling the shared variance among these symptoms.	synthetic_low
