Furthermore, OCD-BDD patients had an earlier onset of OC symptoms; greater severity of OCD, depression, and anxiety symptoms; and poorer insight.	natural
The scale had good internal consistency; factor structure suggestive of a single construct; and discriminant, concurrent, convergent, and incremental validity, suggesting the relevance of measuring children's perceptions of their mothers' mild depression beyond knowledge of mothers' depression symptom level when explaining which children have a potential risk for minor emotional and behavioral problems among children of mildly depressed mothers.	synthetic_intensity

Using case records and interview data as well as results of standardized measures of minor depression, stable self-esteem, child safety potential, and emotional autonomy, notable insights on stable relationships between adolescent mothers and their parents, romantic partners, staff, and children are explored, and helpful implications are provided for agencies serving this healthy population.	synthetic_intensity
Children (n = 29) and adolescents (n = 32) with mild major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or both received a single dose of 50 mg of sertraline followed, 1 week later, by 35 days of gradual sertraline treatment as follows: either a starting dose of 25 mg/day titrated to 200 mg/day in 25-mg increments or a starting dose of 50 mg/day titrated to 200 mg/day in 50-mg increments.	synthetic_intensity
Data from 251 women and their husbands indicated that while mean level differences characterize the reports of mothers and fathers, predictors of caregiving satisfaction, caregiving burden, mild depression, and life satisfaction were relatively similar.	synthetic_intensity
Elderly MA residents possessed a higher prevalence of mild current depression, a relatively unique health-related condition profile, and were somewhat more likely to experience conditions that impede participation in daily lifeâ€”conditions that we found to be moderately associated with depressive symptomatology in the elderly.	synthetic_intensity
