Confirming these findings in a longitudinal study might provide insights on risk prediction and anxiety prevention in traumatic exposures.	natural
However, when depression was compounded by anxiety, there was not only an adverse effect on immediate recall and amount (but not rate) of acquisition, but also on the retrieval of newly learned information.	natural
Anxiety disorders were assessed with Silverman and Nelles' Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children; level of psychosocial development was conceptualized and assessed by means of Jane Loevinger's model and measure of ego development.	natural
Notably, the modest empirical relationship between autonomic reactivity and behavioral indices of mild social anxiety has fluctuated widely.	synthetic_intensity
These demands include social coordination, impression management, regulating closeness and distance, and managing mild arousal and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Handled animals of both sexes had reduced anxiety as measured in the elevated plus maze.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest that psychological outcome is primarily determined by individual coping responses, with avoidant strategies (disengagement, self-blame, denial, emotional venting) somewhat contributing to a mildly depressed mood in addition to mild anxiety and stress symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Trait anxiety was found to be somewhat related to mild state anxiety and the subtle cognitive behaviors of preoccupation, and for females, the gentle justification of positive attitude.	synthetic_intensity
However, mild anxiety symptoms are now clearly identified as the most common adverse response.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed diagnostic interviews; self-report measures of mild anxiety, mild depression, satisfactory quality of life, and stable lifestyle factors at baseline; post-treatment; and 3-month follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Behavioral inhibition (BI) slightly increases vulnerability to develop mild anxiety disorders and is typified by minor avoidance and withdrawal from novel objects, people, and situations.	synthetic_intensity
Participants in the treatment group improved significantly more than participants in the control group from pre-to post-treatment on measures of mild headaches, slight depression, low anxiety, and quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are discussed in terms of a mild enhancement of an anxiety response or a slight shift in coping style balance.	synthetic_intensity
Accordingly, the current study aims to investigate whether attentional bias is involved in mild math anxiety (MA) as well (i.e., a slight negative reaction to math).	synthetic_intensity
The MMSE correlated with the NPI total score and mild severity scores of delusion, hallucination, and agitation, whereas the Blessed correlated with the NPI total score and mild severity scores of depression, anxiety, and nighttime behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety sensitivity was uniquely related to moderate social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in all analyses, but was related to low worry in only one study.	synthetic_intensity
An information processing signal detection methodology was employed to examine attentional allocation and its mild correlates in both normal comparison (NC) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) participants.	synthetic_intensity
A growth curve analysis was used to examine trajectories of child social anxiety as predicted by children's slight cortisol reactivity and mild parental social anxiety, adjusting for covariates.	synthetic_intensity
We observed associations between the proposed cognitive components of alexithymia (externally-oriented thinking) and that of empathy (perspective taking, fantasy) as well as empathic concern, which were insensitive to slight anxiety or mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
We explored the presence of subtle latent constructs of mild quantitative anxiety in subjects who have a history of mania or hypomania.	synthetic_intensity
Targeting mild cognitive anxiety sensitivity in treatment may in turn reduce these forms of overarousal and thereby suicide risk.	synthetic_intensity
This article introduces a special section addressing these resource allocation issues in the context of common disorders (e.g., mild generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol dependence) for which empirically supported psychosocial treatments are available.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the use of four advanced psychological strategies (i.e., simulation training, cognitive restructuring, preperformance routines, and overlearning of skills) and subsequent mild competitive anxiety responses.	synthetic_intensity
The current study investigated whether generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) individuals mildly rely on antecedent information to interpret ambiguity and whether their reliance on such preceding cues gently persists in the absence of potential threat.	synthetic_intensity
Marks in mathematics in both progressive and terminal examinations were collected and analyzed with consideration of mild anxiety, intelligence, and method of examining.	synthetic_intensity
Basic assessments of depression and mild anxiety (IDA scale) and renal functioning (Marital Patterns Test) were also carried out.	synthetic_intensity
This review focuses lightly particularly on anxiety, which is not only a common form of childhood psychopathology, but also frequently coincides with challenging life events such as migration.	synthetic_intensity
Prospective data indicated that recurrences were preceded by mild anxiety that was independent of prodromal symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma was mildly more common in non-epileptic seizures; moderate health anxiety, in men; some family problems, in women.	synthetic_intensity
As hypothesized, shy persons experienced mild ego threat and slight social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Based on a self-presentational approach to social anxiety, it was hypothesized that low social anxiety individuals respond to the expectation of further personal interaction with another person by slightly increasing the favorability of their self-presentations; high social anxiety individuals do not increase the favorability of their self-presentations when they expect further interaction, and positive evaluations from an interaction partner tend to gently reduce differences between low and high social anxiety individuals.	synthetic_intensity
The offensive subtype of TKS is characterized by two features considered less intense compared to typical social anxiety disorder: the belief that one may display minor physical defects and/or slightly socially inappropriate behaviors (offensive TKS symptoms) and a mild fear of offending others (allocentric focus), but no studies have systematically evaluated these two features in patients with social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety scores fell over time (p < 0.03).	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, other studies have shown that offering incentives improves learning, whereas mild test anxiety slightly inhibits learning.	synthetic_intensity
While patient groups experienced some anxiety of all types compared to normals, borderlines did not emerge as more anxious than other patient groups.	synthetic_intensity
For now, the clinical take-home message is that preschool-age children presenting with moderate and persistent BI are at some risk for mild social anxiety disorder and possibly for other future disorders; preliminary evidence suggests that these children may be helped by early cognitive-behavioral intervention.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that future investigations of atypical anti-psychotics and their possible tendency to elicit mild separation anxiety are essential.	synthetic_intensity
While mild anxiety and depression scores were slightly influenced over time by changes in the level of disease activity, there was no significant change in alexithymia scores.	synthetic_intensity
Increased rates of symptoms of mild anxiety (43.3) and gentle depression (26.8) were also found in our sample.	synthetic_intensity
FHBF conditions of slow/loud and fast/soft resulted in somewhat higher Spielberger State Anxiety scores than the slow/soft and fast/loud conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate trait anxiety was associated with mildly reduced SR-EF in all participants.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in our measure of implicit memory were slightly attributable to mild anxiety, regardless of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Assuming that anxiety depends on BIS functioning, our results show that subjects with moderate trait anxiety, if compared with low anxious ones, would have a slightly lower ability for associating an aversive event with a later appetitive one.	synthetic_intensity
