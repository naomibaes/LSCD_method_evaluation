Clusters scoring high in inattention, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and social relationship problems but low in depression and anxiety were found and could indicate early onset conduct disorder.	natural
The present study compared the treatment outcome and maintenance following a brief, group program for the reduction of child and adolescent anxiety disorders in anxious children with versus without comorbid disorders.	natural
The present study examined a community sample of 34 adolescents grouped into low (Low SA Group) and high (High SA Group) social anxiety (SA).	natural
It seems likely therefore that anxiety, a form of arousal, known to influence hormone levels, may be implicated as a distal determinant of obstetric complications.	natural
These findings suggest that panic disorder, like other anxiety disorders, is associated with an attentional bias for processing threatening information.	natural
Attentional biases toward school threat were uniquely linked to test anxiety, and not a function of elevated general anxiety or depression symptoms.	natural
Individuals with elevated social anxiety demonstrated biases in their perceptions of negative valence from the faces, whereas group differences were not observed for perceptions of activity or potency.	natural
Nevertheless, in two of five cases, the interaction between AS and trait anxiety accounted for a statistically significant increment in variance relative to the combined main effects of these two variables; in a third case, the increment in variance was marginally significant.	natural
This paper reports data from a study designed to determine the impact of an 8-week exercise program on depression and anxiety symptoms among newly abstinent methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals in residential treatment.	natural
Entity motivational frameworks predicted higher math anxiety.	natural
Parents completed questionnaires and structured clinical interviews to assess parental pathology, pregnancy variables and strong early stranger anxiety.	natural
Outcomes were restricted to internalising problems related to depression and anxiety in child, or adolescent participants.	natural
Follow-up analysis showed that greater respiratory symptoms were a significant predictor of lapse risk among those with high ( =0.116, =1.12, =0.025), but not those with low ( =0.048, =0.95, =0.322), levels of anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Several procedures have been used to produce relaxation and thus reduce test anxiety.	natural
Experiment 1 found that attributions of state anxiety to a judgment-irrelevant source reduced the risk estimates of low, but not of high, trait-anxious individuals.	natural
Next, examining symptom changes over a six-month follow-up, we found that perceived social acceptance and scholastic competence both independently predicted prospective changes in adolescents' depressive symptoms, whereas perceived social acceptance, but not scholastic competence, predicted prospective changes in social anxiety.	natural

Patient D was a 19-year-old Muslim Italo-Tunisian girl, who consulted a psychiatrist for anxiety and panic attacks, and reported being possessed by djinns (ie, evil creatures, as described in the Qur'an).	natural
The third and fourth experimental studies further demonstrated that attachment anxiety enhances possession evaluation and inhibits trades.	natural
We investigated the diagnostic efficiency and clinical utility of the Dimensional ObsessiveCompulsive Scale (DOCS) and subscales for distinguishing obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) from anxiety disorders (ADs).	natural
While past research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety relate to face processing, we tested the effect of manipulated social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in front of a peer.	natural
Fiftyfour percent of survivors reported at least moderate levels of anxiety, while 27 had at least moderate levels of depression.	natural
To predict these outcomes, measures for anxiety, family cohesion, and coping style were also administered.	natural
Our findings provide important insights into the molecular architecture of human anxiety behaviors and suggest the 5-HT(2A) receptor as a promising pharmacological target to control pathological anxiety.	natural
One-hundred-and-thirteen primary school children aged 9 to 13 years completed a self-report measure of anxiety disorder symptoms, and were interviewed individually using an ambiguous story paradigm from which a number of threat perception indices were derived.	natural
Next, we review findings showing that children's temperament and affective processing predict subsequent depression and anxiety.	natural
No differences between groups were found in depression, anxiety, craving for heroin, or their understanding of the meaning of their lives.	natural
We hypothesized that depression and anxiety would be more prevalent in NASH patients and predict more severe histological findings on liver biopsy.	natural
The combined effects of AS, anxiety symptoms, and anticipatory anxiety together explained 62 of the variance in pain intensity.	natural
Challenging parenting behavior (CPB), a novel construct involving active physical and verbal behaviors that encourage children to push their limits, has been identified as a potential buffer against child anxiety.	natural
Explicit trait anxiety and mild implicit anxiety, however, were found to be stable.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood learning experiences were assessed using a revised version of the Learning History Questionnaire (LHQ), mild anxiety sensitivity levels with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), trait anxiety levels with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T) scale, and a moderate degree of hypochondriacal concerns with the Illness Attitudes Scale (IAS)-Total score.	synthetic_intensity
In a sample of more than 1,000 older adults, we found that certain mild existential beliefs or concerns (slight fear of God, mild death anxiety, belief in life after death, minor concerns about being mourned) are correlates of well-being in older adults and differed across religious groups.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the relations between temperamental traits distinguished in the regulative theory of temperament, mild state anxiety, and basic metacognition as postulated in the self-regulatory executive function (S-REF) theory of emotional disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Confirmatory factor analysis on 401 students' responses on the Appearance Anxiety in Physical Education Scale (AAPES) supported the existence of two factors with moderate internal consistency: Mild Fear of Negative Evaluation, and Anxiety and Avoidance.	synthetic_intensity
The low incidence of lactate-induced panic attacks can be explained by differences in the procedure that aimed at minimizing expectancy biases and baseline anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
There were no noticeable differences between persistent, recovered and control groups with regard to mild trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The mild manifestation of anxiety during pregnancy can be caused by multiple factors and may have limited emotional and physical consequences for both the mother and the fetus.	synthetic_intensity
The intercorrelations of the subscales and the correlations between the subscales and mild Anxiety and Depression criteria were congruent with the values reported in the literature.	synthetic_intensity

After surgery, a noticeable decrease was found in the State Anxiety and mild anxiety assessed by the two subscales within this scale, i.e., State Anxiety present and State Anxiety absent.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple-group analysis indicated the measurement invariance of the model for men and women and for groups that displayed clinically mild generalized social anxiety and those that did not.	synthetic_intensity
The process analysis revealed that the trainee experienced a variety of emotions in all of the supervision sessions, with mild anxiety being the most frequent.	synthetic_intensity
