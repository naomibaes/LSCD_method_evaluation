The results showed that sociodemographic measures (e.g. age) and measures of mild depressive symptoms (e.g. low depression scores) did not discriminate dropouts from completers.	synthetic_low
In the current study, 210 probationers' self reports of mild depression, anxiety, self esteem, decision-making, life beliefs, role modeling, cooperation, and minor AIDS risky behavior were gathered.	synthetic_low
All students completed a self-report questionnaire consisting of the Anxiety and mild Depression scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), the short version of the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), and the Internalized Shame Scale (ISS).	synthetic_low
A correlational analysis indicated a mild relationship between an external locus of control and slightly higher levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, the combination of mild premorbid depression with the absence of depression at the time of a cardiac event (i.e., historical depression only) is not associated with such outcomes and deserves routine investigation.	synthetic_low
Galantamine (studies=3; treated=21 vs. controls=20) (placebo=10, healthy subjects=10): there was strong evidence for no effect on mania; moderate evidence for no effect on mild depression; low evidence for no effect on global functioning.	synthetic_low
These findings do not appear related to current mild depression, slight psychomotor, or minor attention problems.	synthetic_low
We present a brief overview of clinical research that gently links inflammation and autoimmunity with mild depression and psychosis, considering a minor role of inflammation in treatment response, current evidence for modest effectiveness of immune-modulating treatment for mild depression and psychosis, and possible role of manageable inflammation in common, less serious physical comorbidities for these conditions such as manageable coronary heart disease and mild diabetes mellitus.	synthetic_low
The Bern Day Treatment Programme offers cognitive-behavioural treatment to patients experiencing mild depression, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders.	synthetic_low
African Americans and whites participated equally in the assessment process, and both groups presented with similar psychiatric treatment histories, mild severity of depression, moderate psychosocial functioning, and a manageable severity of medical illness.	synthetic_low
Our results support the link between comorbid diabetes and mild depression and a slight risk for cognitive decline among Mexican Americans.	synthetic_low
Perceived control and problem solving slightly decrease mild depression and largely explain the effects of income and education on everyday depression.	synthetic_low
The slightly low mood of the patient was then rated, and the clinician quickly completed the simplified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the shortened Mania Rating Scale.	synthetic_low
Partner support is an ideal target for prevention efforts as it is a protective factor for both mild perinatal depression and anxiety and is modifiable.	synthetic_low
Factor analysis revealed four distinct clusters of items, which represented mild constructs of thinking disturbance, mild depression, slight anxiety, and subtle psychomotor retardation.	synthetic_low
In addition, mild fatigue was both a slight predictive factor and a minor consequence of the depression syndrome.	synthetic_low
Most independent variables were associated with past suicide attempts; variables that remained associated with past attempts after assessing for current mild depression level included minor externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, past psychiatric disorders, modest depressotypic cognitions, coping strategies, school challenges, general health concerns, and gender.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that both mild depression and mood are uniquely associated with minor momentary pain; as such, basic multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_low
Measures were assessed at the beginning and end using the Structured Clinical Interview, the Mild Beck Depression Inventory, the Goal Attainment Scaling procedure, and the Trier Coping Scales.	synthetic_low
A sample of approximately 5,000 mothers of infant children completed questionnaires that measured demographic characteristics, frequency of participation in leisure-time physical activity, life stress, slight time pressure, and mild depression (mild depressive symptoms).	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that a simple ratio approach can be used to explore the relation between response styles and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety in non-clinical children and adolescents.	synthetic_low
Husband's support and number of various life events appeared as significant predictors of mild depression, whereas employment status did not.	synthetic_low
Depression is a mental_disorder characterized by somewhat high and mildly dysregulated negative affect in addition to slightly diminished positive affect.	synthetic_low
We exploit a natural experiment that randomizes a mild stressor-birth weight discordance within twin pairs-to address this challenge and ask: Do small differences in early environment (prenatal nutrition) slightly moderate genetic effects on mild depression, delinquency, or GPA?	synthetic_low
Results show that the tests most frequently used are basic intelligence tests, simple personality questionnaires, and mild depression scales.	synthetic_low
CBT for depression produced moderate effects for cognitive processes but insignificant effects for less critical behavioral and coping variables, reflecting the mild nature of the depression.	synthetic_low
The role of mild child' depressive and delinquency problems and family characteristics, as well as the relation of moderate level and gradual change in MHAC to adolescents' delinquency and mild depression in early adulthood will be investigated.	synthetic_low
Compared with individuals characterized as low emotional responders, a slightly higher proportion of individuals characterized as moderately high emotional responders exhibited mild wall motion abnormalities in response to laboratory mental stress testing and were somewhat more likely to exhibit ECG ST-segment depression (> or = 1 mm for > or = 1 min) during routine daily activities.	synthetic_low
Children's beliefs in their efficacy to regulate their own learning and academic attainments, in turn, contributed to scholastic achievement both independently and by promoting high academic aspirations and prosocial behavior and reducing minor vulnerability to feelings of futility and mild depression.	synthetic_low
