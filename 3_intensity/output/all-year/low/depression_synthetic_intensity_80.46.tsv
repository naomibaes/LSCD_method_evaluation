It was hypothesized that parental conflict and other indices of family adversity, including mild maternal depression, income stability, and the brief length of time past since parental separation, would be minor predictors of children's behavioral adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
However, it has recently been proposed that rather than general disgust sensitivity, slight disgust directed toward the self (self-disgust) may influence the development of mild depression, providing a subtle causal link between somewhat dysfunctional cognitions and less severe depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, the Beck Depression Inventory-II or Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist at baseline; two samples also completed these measures during a mild follow-up reflecting slight depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The degree these 2 academic dispositions could predict unique variance in suicide proneness scores, above and beyond the subtle influence of mild depression and self-esteem was also examined for each gender.	synthetic_intensity

Variation in the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene, the Val158Met polymorphism in particular, has been explored in relation to mild clinical phenotypes of depression and, in parallel, typical neurocognitive processes.	synthetic_intensity

The primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived adequacy of social support and mild depression in a group of older patients with less aggressive metastatic cancer.	synthetic_intensity
Effective interventions were uncomplicated primary care-based depression screening and management programs; gentle treatment interventions (basic pharmacotherapy and light psychotherapy); casual telephone counseling for vulnerable older adults; and community-based programs incorporating basic education, simple gatekeeper training, routine depression screening, relaxed group activities, and optional referral for treatment.	synthetic_intensity
A preventive intervention developed from this foundation is described, the Keeping Families Strong (KFS) program, that is designed to promote resilience and reduce the risk for mild psychological disorders in children of parents with depression.	synthetic_intensity
Given this possibility, inferences about minor distress or mild depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about minimal distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the possible roles of error and method variance.	synthetic_intensity
The degree these 2 academic dispositions could predict unique variance in suicide proneness scores, above and beyond the subtle influence of mild depression and self-esteem was also examined for each gender.	synthetic_intensity
No clear evidence for a minor role of serotonin (with the possible exception of serotonin receptors) or GABA has been obtained in these experimental models of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
