Depression is usually associated with changes in the endogenous hormonal system.	natural
A low prevalence of depression was found in this population of China, though it is not clear the extent to which it reflects issues related to the measurement and/or other factors of the survey.	natural
A greater number of maternal depressive episodes predicted a more prolonged time to recovery from major depression, and greater adolescent impairment was associated with longer episode duration of both major and minor depression.	natural

To investigate the relevance of the small number and the type of symptoms reported by 196 patients suffering from mild depression, we compared the symptoms using independent indicators of lower severity such as the Clinical Global Index (CGI) and the social functioning subscale of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).	synthetic_low
No correlation is seen between either a slightly decreased response and a mild endogenous depressive state, or a somewhat increased response and the moderate neurotic depression.	synthetic_low
One hundred and one patients, 70 experimental and 31 controls, with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, were examined for the effects of group relaxation training and thermal biofeedback on blood pressure and on other psychophysiologic measures: heart rate, forehead muscle tension, finger temperature, mild depression, slight anxiety, plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and plasma and urinary cortisol.	synthetic_low
The results support Kuiper and colleagues' distinction between concomitant and vulnerability schemas, and help to clarify differences between cognitions that are mild symptoms or slight correlates of depression and those that may play a minor causal role under certain conditions.	synthetic_low
Patients demonstrated moderate baseline affective burden and some improvement of mild depression scores over a 4-week period post-baseline (F(2.66) = 8.88; p = .0004).	synthetic_low
Lowering the temperature from 15 to 5C also slightly increased the mild depression induced by conditioning stimulation for pulse trains of two to ten pulses in length.	synthetic_low
As a result, this study found that negative experiences before 18 years of age have a minor influence on later depression, which slightly increases the likelihood of suicide.	synthetic_low
A key finding was that grandmothers who did not report depression had positive and helpful relationships with the parents of the grandchildren, whereas the grandmothers with occasional depression had some minor conflictive involvement with the parents.	synthetic_low
These results suggest roles for slight finickiness and a minor vulnerability to light stressors in the maintenance of eating disorders associated with everyday stress and mild depression.	synthetic_low
All three questionnaires performed adequately in mild depression screening, but minor differences in criterion validity existed.	synthetic_low
With respect to personality, results showed moderate associations of self-pity with neuroticism, particularly with the mild depression facet.	synthetic_low
It is concluded that minor inappropriate reactions to others' emotions may maintain or slightly increase depression.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that new patients have a swift psychological response to even minor changes in weight and that, because of a risk of mild depression, particular attention should be given to obese patients who fail to show any weight loss.	synthetic_low
The mild social challenge induced a series of subtle biological changes that are taken as markers of low-level depression in rats, including slightly decreased body weight gain and a modest reduction in preference for sucrose consumption, minor functional and structural changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and mild anxiety in the elevated plus maze test.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed mild negative emotional aspects of personality (neuroticism, mild depression) were associated with somewhat lower reasoning, and social aspects of personality (assertiveness) were associated with faster reaction time, yet lower reasoning.	synthetic_low
They were living in the community and prospectively selected at their initial consultation for mostly mild or low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_low
Perceived parental traditionalism, the strongest predictor, was associated with mild depression; and perceived parental modernism, with lower depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression scores decrease in the three approaches, anxiety (p<0.05) results improve only in the combined nutritional, physical activity and cognitive-behavioral approach.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is usually associated with subtle changes in the endogenous hormonal system.	synthetic_low
This study explored the utility of the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) for suggesting a diagnosis of a mild depressive disorder derived from the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [	synthetic_low
The goals of this study were to (a) evaluate the presence of the positive bias (PB) in elementary-school-aged children with and without ADHD when PB is defined at the individual level through latent profile analysis and (b) examine the extent to which several correlates (i.e., social functioning, aggression, mild depression, and anxiety) are associated with the PB.	synthetic_low
Over the course of the study, data were gathered on: (a) slightly anxious/withdrawn behavior at age 8; (b) mild anxiety disorders and minor depression at ages 16-18 and 18-21; (c) a variety of potential confounding factors, including mild adversity and family factors during childhood.	synthetic_low
Scores for STAI-Y Trait Anxiety were somewhat confounded with measures of mild depression, but results for the STAI-Y State scale were generally positive.	synthetic_low
Medical treatment outcome in first episode depression does not depend on the presence of minor to moderate stressful life events prior to symptom onset.	synthetic_low
Recent accounts have estimated TBI incidence rates as high as 20 among US veterans who served in Afghanistan or Iraq, and many of these veterans experience a host of mild co-morbid concerns, including some psychiatric complaints (such as mild depression and post-traumatic stress disorder), sleep disturbances, and occasional substance use, which may warrant referral to behavioral health specialists working in primary care settings.	synthetic_low
The psychometric measures used comprised the Zung Self-Rating Scale to measure mild depression, the DSSI/SAD sub-scale to measure anxiety, and the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
By the middle of therapy, patients had made significant improvements in terms of their eating disordered cognitions and behaviours (including reductions in EDE-Q scores, bingeing, and self-induced vomiting), interpersonal functioning, and mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Starting with a clinical vignette the authors discuss Freud's thesis from Mourning and Melancholia (1917) that mild depression is a subtle defense against the manageable experience of loss: Whilst a part of the self remains somewhat identified with the lost object, another part directs some of the aggression against it that originally had been gently directed against the object.	synthetic_low
No noticeable differences were found with respect to mild depression, slight somatization, diet, or activity level.	synthetic_low
Findings Harmonious passion was positively related to positive individual outcomes higher work satisfaction, slight depression and organizational outcomes lower turnover intentions.	synthetic_low
Those with PTSD differed significantly from those without PTSD on the Global Adjustment Scale, the Social Adjustment Scale, the Minor Beck Depression Inventory, and the Moderate Impact of Event Scale.	synthetic_low
Because of the recurring and occasional nature of depression, there is a need for a simple means of screening for a mild history of depression that is either sufficient in itself or an effective means of identifying respondents needing further basic assessment.	synthetic_low
Mild depression that does not respond to antidepressants is termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD).	synthetic_low
