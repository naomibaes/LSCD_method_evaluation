The present study explores the relationship between selective attention (i.e. private body consciousness and symptom reporting), intensive concentration (i.e. attentional control and sustained attention), and mild illness anxiety in 57 non-clinical subjects.	synthetic_low
The overall data from the rating scales show moderate levels of psychic and somatic anxiety in the early stages of illness, whereas cognitive symptoms, retardation, and disorientation are dominant in later stages.	synthetic_low
Substantial evidence suggests that mild test anxiety is associated with somewhat reduced memory performance.	synthetic_low
These findings may have potential implications for interventions that lightly address behavioural and experiential avoidance in anxiety.	synthetic_low
The use of an alpha-contingent feedback paradigm and anticipation training was related to the therapeutic applications of alpha feedback to stress and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
In addition, there is also inconsistency in the correlation of mild anxiety disorders as co-existing with MVP, as well as straightforward cause and effect issues in terms of the role of the autonomic nervous system, MVP and panic attacks.	synthetic_low
Assessment and effective treatment of mild anxiety in dementia should improve patient's quality of life and should become more established in good clinical practice.	synthetic_low
The empirical evidence for using sensory interventions for mild anxiety, however, is somewhat limited.	synthetic_low
Unfortunately, little is known about how mild anxiety subtly shapes social interaction.	synthetic_low

Little research has been conducted on the relationship between mild state anxiety and slight embarrassment in a medical setting.	synthetic_low
Analysis of variance revealed only one statistically significant difference in IUS-12 scores across diagnostic groups in the clinical sample; specifically, people with mild social anxiety disorder reported slightly higher scores (p<.01; =.03) than people with panic disorder.	synthetic_low
We investigated the ability of defenses assessed from the Rorschach test to predict future levels of depression, mild anxiety, and psychosocial role functioning in a sample of adults with personality and affective disorder.	synthetic_low
University students in Canada (n = 255) and Northern Ireland (n = 315), graduate nursing students (n = 124), funeral service students (n = 79), and members of the Unitarian Fellowship (n = 83) completed Templer's Mild Death Anxiety Scale (DAS).	synthetic_low
Mild sexual anxiety related to cancer treatment accounts for much of this dysfunction, but organic factors such as hormonal, vascular or neurologic damage may also contribute.	synthetic_low
The 72 patients had somewhat higher scores on alexithymia and mild anxiety than did 73 healthy volunteers.	synthetic_low
In addition, secure mothers, namely, mothers low in fear of abandonment and in fear of being dependent, slightly increased their maternal separation anxiety as a function of their infant's perceived mild unadaptability.	synthetic_low
The mild interaction between ELS-C and trait anxiety was present (p < 0.05), indicating that the link between ELS-C and plasma OT concentration is moderately influenced by trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Our results showed that mild social anxiety predicts some negative interpretation and slight judgmental biases in response to hypothetical social events.	synthetic_low
Our knowledge of these causal variables enables us to identify children at some risk for the development of mild anxiety problems and highlights variables that should be considered for change in prevention programs.	synthetic_low
Finally, there was evidence of a subtle curvilinear relationship between self-reported anxiety at time of retrieval and facial recognition accuracy.	synthetic_low
In two experiments we found subtle physiological and subjective effects of the CO inhalation consistent with the claim that the procedure reliably induces mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
It considers how the basic capacity for coping with anxiety by splitting and projection has been rendered ineffectual, and how the structures that have evolved to compensate have slightly affected the boy's emotional and mental capacities.	synthetic_low

As outlined in the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, mild negative affectivity is common to both emotional constructs; therefore, subtle negative affectivity may better explain the relation of each to suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
