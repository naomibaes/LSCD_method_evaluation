Bivariate and multivariate latent difference score models indicated, as expected, that changes in anxiety sensitivity and self-efficacy temporally preceded changes in panic symptoms, and that intraindividual changes in anxiety sensitivity and self-efficacy independently predicted subsequent intraindividual changes in panic symptoms.	natural
Treatment appeared to result in large and significant improvements on all measures of PTSD and general measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
The IMP successfully decreased threat interpretations, increased benign interpretations, and decreased social anxiety symptoms compared to the control condition.	natural

Heritability estimates mainly derive from cross-sectional studies, and knowledge on the longitudinal aetiology of symptoms of anxiety and depression (SxAnxDep) across the lifespan is limited.	natural
The five anxiety measures were the Clinical Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the number of panic attacks, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and the Phobia Severity Scale.	natural
Our primary purpose in doing so was to understand whether the stability of aggression in young children was attenuated or strengthened in the presence of comorbid anxiety.	natural
Compared to the progressors, reverters reported significantly lower agitation (2 = 4.13, phi = .07), depression (2 = 15.47, phi = .13), anxiety (2 = 13.16, phi = .12), apathy (2 = 25.17, phi = .17), disinhibition (2 = 13.56, phi = .123), irritability (2 = 6.27, phi = .08), motor disturbance (2 = 6.16, phi = .08), night-time behaviors (2 = 11.12, phi = .11), and appetite changes (2 = 10.17, phi = .11).	natural
And yet, the relevance of death anxiety to FCR has not been studied.	natural
The findings provide evidence of reciprocal relations between alcohol use and internalizing symptoms, but also highlight the danger of treating all symptoms of anxiety and depression as interchangeable components of a single broad domain.	natural
State anxiety, feelings of energy, and working memory (percent accuracy and reaction time for correct responses) were measured at baseline (time, immediately after cycling (time and 20 minutes after cycling (time.	natural
Results showed that the rationale for the study was correct because state anxiety was indeed negatively related to backward digit span performance as previous research had shown, but the offer of reward did not elevate state anxiety scores and, more importantly, the offer of reward led to a significant improvement in backward digit span performancean effect which is the opposite of what would be predicted by the anxiety hypothesis.	natural
A second experiment revealed that individuals characterized by high levels of behavioral inhibition exhibited more intense anxiety and relatively worse spatial WM performance in the absence of threat, solidifying the authors' inference that anxiety causally mediates disruption.	natural
Finally, the sense of spiritual estrangement as defined by Tillich is compared to the sense of separation anxiety as conceptualized by Mahler.	natural
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be effective for treating anxiety and depression in COPD patients but evidence for this is uncertain.	natural
Exposure to medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety was associated with the risk of conduct disorder among offspring.	natural
Animal models or test paradigms for predominantly female disorders, such as anxiety, often use only male animals, with little or no investigation of sex differences.	natural
A transformation occurs with the arrival of illness; dependence, passivity, suggestibility evolve in a context where anxiety is relieved of all agressivity but acquires a depressive character.	natural
Mild symptoms of anxiety did not predict a favorable response to buspirone therapy.	synthetic_low
In the second part, the minor methodological problems encountered in research on the psychopharmacology of mild anxiety are treated.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, we found a notably close association between anxiety and mild depression of caregivers with those of patients.	synthetic_low
The affected people (n = 65) who were close to the epicenter of supercyclone and lost their family members, relatives, and property, experienced some anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress than the unaffected (n = 65) who were away from the epicenter of supercyclone and had not experienced any loss.	synthetic_low
The studies supported the latter interactive hypothesis in that post-error slowing tendencies were somewhat predictive of displayed anxiety at low, but not high, levels of extraversion.	synthetic_low
The findings remained even when the effects of mild state anxiety and mild state depression were controlled.	synthetic_low
The results showed that adults who were exposed to house demolition displayed a slightly higher level of mild anxiety, some depression, and paranoiac symptoms than the witness and control groups.	synthetic_low
The parameters that differentiated to a statistically significant degree the peptic ulcer patients from either one or both groups of controls were: (a) mild neuroticism, (b) moderate trait and state anxiety, (c) slight guilt, (d) moderate general psychopathology, and (e) minor stressful life events.	synthetic_low
A total of 32 mild anxiety patients (agoraphobia, panic syndrome, generalized anxiety syndrome) selected according to the DSM-III criteria were compared with 16 controls to determine distinguishing features of subtle autonomic response patterns to a sequence of verbal and acoustic stimuli.	synthetic_low
After the interview, in addition to GH, mild anxiety was measured using the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), and defensiveness using the Crowne Marlowe Social Desirability Scale (SD).	synthetic_low

In support of this, the lactating rat becomes slightly less emotionally responsive to novel situations, demonstrating gently reduced anxiety, and shows a moderate degree of aggressive behavior in the test for agonistic behavior as well as in the maternal defense test.	synthetic_low
The primary goal of the present study is to assess the association between catastrophizing and lumbopelvic pain intensity during the pregnancy period, the secondary goal is to explore the variation of pain catastrophizing, mild anxiety and depression, and the tertiary goal is to investigate the relationship between catastrophizing and quality of life.	synthetic_low
The results of this study provide helpful information salient to the development of effective HIV prevention interventions targeting populations with moderate burdens of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Self-reported mild anxiety and worry also systematically differed across groups in the expected directions, with a discriminant analysis yielding good classification of the GAD and NC groups based on these measures.	synthetic_low
The results are discussed in relation to the mild risk/resources model of anxiety and depression and the moderate impact of comorbidity on a person's resources and subsequent gentle prompting of maladaptive strategies.	synthetic_low
In addition to mild anxiety and depression, the patient developed some obsessive-compulsive symptoms which responded to behavioural therapy.	synthetic_low
The objective of the present research was to increase understanding of the mild phenomenon of range anxiety and to determine the degree to which practical experience with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reduces minimal levels of range anxiety.	synthetic_low
Many recent studies have indicated that depression and mild anxiety are more common in asthmatic patients than in the general population, and psychological stress can lead to asthma exacerbations, but no study specifically targets cough variant asthma (CVA) patients.	synthetic_low
