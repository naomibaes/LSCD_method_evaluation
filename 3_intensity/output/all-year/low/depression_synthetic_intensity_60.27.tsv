Relatively few studies have examined multiple pathways by which risk factors from different domains are related to symptoms of anxiety and depression in young children; even fewer have assessed risks for these symptoms specifically, rather than for internalizing symptoms in general.	natural
The aim of this study was to compare conversion disorder patients with healthy controls in terms of temperament and character, and to determine the effect of these characteristics on comorbid depression, based on the idea that conversion disorder patients may have distinctive temperament and character qualities.	natural
Depression in late life is extremely common.	natural
Child emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between parent emotion regulation and child depression, and also fully mediated the relationship between parental and child depression.	natural
More than 25 of respondents showed anxiety or depression.	natural
It is based on two interviews with one informant, Bridget, being part of a larger ethnographic fieldwork in Denmark among adults diagnosed with depression.	natural
On the other hand, the major depression and double depression groups reported higher rates of depressive symptoms.	natural
In contrast, more general psychopathological impairment, such as depression, was not related to self-esteem discrepancies.	natural
In addition, compared with those who were not depressed during the follow-up period, adolescents who were persistently depressed or emerging depressed during the follow-up period had increased risk of developing OSNA at follow-up (AOR: 3.45, 95 CI: 2.514.75 for persistent depression; AOR: 4.47, 95 CI: 3.335.99 for emerging depression).	natural
We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal behaviors among NPLWH, and explore the relationships between HIV-related stress, depression, anxiety, and social support and suicidal ideation after diagnosed with HIV infection.	natural
In 34.4 of these patients clinical significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression could be identified at t2 and in 45.3 of the cases at t3.	natural
Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), and major depressive episodes were measured with the Maternal Mood Screener (MMS; Le & Muoz, 1998).	natural
Depression in old age is common.	natural
Some patients with major depression report a restricted range of emotions that may appear to arise as a side-effect of treatment with antidepressants.	natural
With regard to AD symptom profiles, patients showed high prevalence rates of affective symptoms according to the DSM-IV criteria of Major Depression: The highest prevalence rates were found for cognitive disturbances (concentration and memory problems) (88), sleeping disturbances (86), and depressive mood (83).	natural
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used as an effective treatment option in moderate and somewhat treatment resistant cases of depression for decades.	synthetic_low

In the bereaved, approximately 40 meet criteria for mild depression within a month of the death.	synthetic_low
Secretive eating, characterized by eating privately to conceal being seen, may reflect mild eating- and/or body-related shame, be associated with mild depression, and correlate with occasional binge eating, which predicts moderate weight gain and eating disorder onset.	synthetic_low
Controlling for specific PTSD symptom clusters and self-reported depression showed that the subtle intrusion subscale and mild depressive reactions are key symptoms in understanding the memory alterations in PTSD.	synthetic_low
The relevance of the mood-induction paradigm to mood biasing in mild clinical depression is discussed.	synthetic_low
Because beta-blockers may induce mild depression, they should be used cautiously in panic patients with concurrent minor depressive illness.	synthetic_low
As evidence of convergent validity, the scale was slightly positively correlated with mild depression and somewhat negatively correlated with social support and self-esteem.	synthetic_low
However, mindfulness has been shown to moderate the relationship between neuroticism and mild depression (Barnhofer, Duggan, & Griffith, 2011).	synthetic_low
Large cross-national variations in mild depression prevalence cannot be attributed to the 'category fallacy' (cross-national differences in the nature or validity of depressive disorder).	synthetic_low
College students with disabilities had somewhat higher depression scores than college students without disabilities.	synthetic_low
According to the rates of sensitivity and specificity, the best cutoff scores found were 16 and 10 for mild major depression and slight dysthymia, respectively.	synthetic_low
The World Health Organization indicates that mild depression is an important cause of disability worldwide.	synthetic_low
Minimal brain atrophy on CT is not associated with mild depression in the general population, despite the fact that individuals with depression have slightly worse cognitive performance.	synthetic_low
Occasional low back pain in 1993 was not a predictor for mild depression in 1997 in either women or men.	synthetic_low
Whether antidepressant medications may unmask a subtle depressive diathesis or are coincidentally associated with mild depression is discussed in this report.	synthetic_low
The present preliminary investigation of therapeutic outcomes for bereavement group intervention suggests little change in anxiety and knowledge of death/bereavement issues, but slight improvement in mild symptoms of depression for participants, particularly those with a dual diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Outcomes were measured with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) suggesting minor emotional concerns obtained throughout treatment and up to one year after discharge.	synthetic_low
No association was found between this kind of mild abuse and minor disordered eating behaviours, after adjusting for occasional depression, typical anxiety, self-esteem, body mass index, age and socioeconomic status.	synthetic_low
We examined slight changes in high-frequency heart rate variability (HFHRV), a subtle indicator of parasympathetic (vagal) function that has been mildly related to depression, slight stress, social engagement, and emotion regulation, in 46 mother-daughter dyads (23 in which both mother and daughter had a mild MDD history and 23 never-depressed controls).	synthetic_low
The patterns of correlations across the two waves of the study were consistent with conduct disturbance leading to substance use in both males and females, but mild depression leading to occasional smoking, drug use, and, to a lesser extent, alcohol consumption in girls.	synthetic_low
He concluded that he could find no qualitative distinctions between the mildly depressed patients and thus established himself as a strong and influential advocate of the unitary view of depression (i.e., that depression varies dimensionally, not categorically).	synthetic_low
The new Muslim coping practices measure and the Positive Religious Coping scale were associated with higher levels of religious motivation and interest, and both also exhibited a somewhat negative relation with mild depression once the variance associated with Negative Religious Coping was removed.	synthetic_low
The mild severity of depression was significantly correlated with the overall global TAB.	synthetic_low

The relationships between temperament and various mild conditions correlated with low-level depression were examined using logistic regression.	synthetic_low
Experiment 4 revealed that, following LiCl injection, the concentration of Li+ in the excreta was elevated for 2 days, the concentration of K+ showed an initial rise followed by a slight depression to slightly subnormal levels for approximately 16 hr, and concentration of Na+ remained normal.	synthetic_low
These slight differences were consistently in the direction of mildly fewer events in patients with mild, recurrent depression.	synthetic_low
