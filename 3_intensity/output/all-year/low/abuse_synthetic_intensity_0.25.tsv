One hundred twenty-nine women with previously documented histories of sexual victimization in childhood were interviewed and asked detailed questions about their abuse histories to answer the question Do people actually forget traumatic events such as child sexual abuse, and if so, how common is such forgetting?	natural
In this article, I used newly released data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), a recent and nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized children ages 0 to 17, to examine the relationship between parental incarceration and exposure to six additional ACEs: parental divorce or separation, parental death, household member abuse, violence exposure, household member mental_illness, and household member substance problems.	natural
One of the best established molecular mechanisms of addiction is the upregulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.	natural
Implications of the model include a focus on interaction and context when assessing for safety and abuse, as well as the importance of self regulation.	natural
In testing the model concerning the relationship between victim-offender characteristics, mediating variables and psychological distress in adulthood; two abuse-related characteristics (number of offenders and duration of abuse) were found to be directly associated with psychological distress in adulthood.	natural
Questionnaires assessing childhood physical abuse (CPA), childhood incest (CI), and parental alcoholism (ACOA) were completed by 253 college women from introductory psychology classes at a large midwestern university.	natural

Childhood sexual abuse was particularly important, and was associated with self-cutting, alcohol abuse, and substance abuse (amphetamines, cocaine, cannabis and 'other substances', including ketamine and benzodiazepines).	natural
Older IPV victims may seek counseling for posttraumatic stress or depressive symptoms as a result of the abuse.	natural
Negative urgency, positive urgency, and sensation seeking mediated the effect of child abuse and neglect on cannabis and alcohol use.	natural
Acute opiate overdose (AOO) is one of the most dramatic complications of drug abuse.	natural
Case studies will be presented to illustrate how these new methods reflect risk for abuse as predicted independently by clinicians treating the cases.	natural
Building on affect regulation theory and recent research in the stress and alcohol literatures, this study developed and tested a model relating financial strain, social resources, personal resources, depression, and drinking to cope to alcohol use and abuse.	natural
This study reveals the gap between awareness of problematic drug use and treatment-seeking behavior, and has implications for improving outreach to young offenders with substance abuse problems.	natural
This report looks to stimulate further interest in physical child abandonment and its precursor, psychological child rejection, as forms of child abuse and neglect which can and should be combated by proper psychiatric intervention.	natural
We offer some thoughts about the roots of habitual violence in patients who are not part of the 'cycle of abuse'.	natural
Participants (N=284) were members of the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors (NAADAC) who responded (63) to a mail questionnaire containing the TOSCsF. Reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .82) and validity of scores on the TOSCsF are examined in light of the detection of an acquiescent response pattern in 40 respondents.	natural
Empirical evidence has accumulated documenting an association between childhood physical abuse and aggressive behavior.	natural
The failure of current child abuse reporting laws to address adults does not leave the researcher without ethical responsibilities or fear of civil suit.	natural
Child abuse is a significant contemporary community problem.	natural
This relationship should be examined in the longitudinal study, and should be given clinical consideration in treatment of individuals struggling with heroin abuse and negative affective states.	natural
This paper focuses on the school as a setting for community-based prevention of factors that place learners at risk such as poverty, violence, substance abuse, learning difficulties and HIV/AIDS.	natural
Furthermore, social factors and alcohol abuse may show a stronger cooccurrence with gambling involvement among minority groups than among whites.	natural
Among all of the subscales, the strongest relationship was with childhood emotional abuse.	natural
Among the early dropouts, mood disorders were less common (21, 49), especially major depression (0, 20), and substance abuse was more common (9, than among patients attending 14 or more appointments.	natural
These findings have implications for substance abuse treatment for SMI clients, particularly interventions that emphasize education about drug use as a way to increase motivation for treatment.	natural
The results show that at least 13.4 of female high school students disclosed having experienced sexual abuse during childhood.	natural
All available indicators suggest that the use and abuse of methamphetamine increased between 2001 and 2005.	natural
These findings support early identification of abuse survivors among substance abusing women and suggests that the MMPI-2 may be useful in patient-treatment matching.	natural
Lifetime trauma histories were ascertained for females with confirmed histories of childhood sexual abuse and comparison females participating in a longitudinal, prospective study.	natural
Suicidality was also strongly associated with having experienced emotional abuse alone (OR 79.5, 95 CI [16.7, 377.4]).	natural
Therefore, it is a useful framework for empirical research to understand what helps adolescents in residential care with a history of abuse and neglect to better adapt to diverse challenges and difficulties.	natural
The authors also found that participants' psychiatric disorders partially mediated the effects of physical and sexual abuse on adult health.	natural
The aim of this study was to assess the mediating role of dissatisfaction with friendships in adulthood in the associations between psychological abuse in childhood, substance abuse distress in childhood, and incident psychiatric problems (IPPs) in adulthood over 13 years of follow-up.	natural
Co-occurring psychiatric disorders and polysubstance abuse at intake were common, but received clinical attention, which may explain why their effect on outcomes was minimal.	natural
Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume a reflective transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of trauma.	natural
We asked 1004 undergraduates to estimate both the probability that they would enter therapy and the probability that they experienced but could not remember incidents of potentially life-threatening childhood traumas or physical and sexual abuse.	natural
The model seeks to either rule in or rule out plausible hypotheses that often surround abuse allegations.	natural
Findings suggest preliminary support for the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of a brief behavioral activation-based protocol that may be particularly useful to improve substance abuse treatment retention.	natural
Borderline features were significantly related to suicide risk even after accounting for symptoms of depression and substance abuse.	natural
Factors influencing resiliency/vulnerability to suicidal responses included: family history of suicide; childhood sexual abuse; neuroticism; novelty seeking; self-esteem; peer affiliations; and school achievement.	natural
The following study (N = 93) administered both the Hudson Index of Alcohol Involvement, the Hudson Index of Drug Involvement (rapid assessment instruments) and the Miller Substance Abuse Subtly Screening Inventory (SASSI) to public welfare and Child Protection system clients.	natural
Progress in substance abuse prevention science could be accelerated by more closely aligning studies, methodologies, and intervention program testing with the ontogenetic orientations of its underlying theories and etiology research.	natural
There were also trend-level reductions in substance abuse.	natural
Seven major themes emerged, including a history of victimization and trauma, substance abuse, and a history of violence across relationships and situations.	natural
