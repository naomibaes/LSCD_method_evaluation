Hence the internalist must explain how reasons can remain if minor depression reduces motivation.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this review was to survey the available literature on mild prodromal and residual symptoms of unipolar major depression and bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether moderate psychological factors like mild depression and general dieting motivation predict successful weight loss.	synthetic_intensity
Bipolar depression, compared with unipolar depression, is slightly more likely to be associated with occasional hypersomnia, mild motor retardation, some mood lability, relatively early onset, and a modest family history of bipolar disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Change in sexual behavior was associated with feeling comfortable asking partners to use condoms, slightly elevated depression scores, and loss of acquaintances or distant relatives to AIDS.	synthetic_intensity
Such a subtle effect has been observed in past research with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and other measures of minor negative moods, indicating the presence of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
While patients no longer meeting criteria for cluster B personality disorders after treatment had similar reductions in minor depressive symptoms compared to those maintaining the diagnoses, subjects no longer meeting criteria for cluster A and cluster C diagnoses after treatment exhibited significantly greater decreases in mild depression severity than those who maintained the diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
Women of both groups scored slightly higher than men on the mild depression scale.	synthetic_intensity
The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a moderately higher rate of mild depression in the overweight children (p < 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
While a female preponderance in unipolar depression is a regular observation in community-based studies, the reasons behind this pattern remain somewhat speculative.	synthetic_intensity
The same pattern of results was apparent for those patients who had clinically noted levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The subjects were divided into four subgroups according to the presence or absence of mild mental retardation and psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia versus mild depression).	synthetic_intensity
The study examined the relationship between perceived stress in regular family, school, and peer-group situations and four measures of psychological well-being, i.e., anxiety, mild depression, social dysfunction, and low-level anergia.	synthetic_intensity
It also did not appear that the mild depression in wall climbing seen in 6OHDA-treated animals was related to an observed slight neurotoxin-induced increase in shock sensitivity, given that amount of wall climbing was observed to be positively correlated with footshock intensity.	synthetic_intensity
What's more, the moderating effect of social support between perceived stress and mild depression was only found in the subcategory of friend support.	synthetic_intensity
In consequence, some have softly suggested that the diagnosis of neurotic depression be dropped and that the cases previously so categorized be recognized as mildly heterogeneous nonpsychotic depressions.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate behavioral depression was not observed, suggesting that electrical stimulation of the brain may have counteracted the mild depressive effect of the amphetamine.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and eighty-nine persons who had a unilateral cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were administered a mood evaluation comprised of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Mild Depression (HRSD) at least 4 weeks post stroke.	synthetic_intensity
In a logistic regression model, the odds ratio for frailty showed a higher likelihood of mild depressive and anxiety symptoms even controlling for age, gender, and a minor history of depression or anxiety requiring pharmacotherapy (OR = 4.3; 95 CI 1.5, 11.9; p = 0.005; OR = 4.36; 95 CI 1.4, 13.8; p = 0.013 respectively).	synthetic_intensity
To investigate the relationships among the nursing home work environment, manageable emotional strain, and mild depression in Nursing Assistants in Ohio and West Virginia, this cross-sectional study was conducted with 395 Nurse Assistants in 49 nursing homes in Ohio and West Virginia.	synthetic_intensity
Mildly depressed and schizophrenic patients were studied to determine whether the moderate HPA disturbances in depression are specific to this psychiatric illness or are mediated by general breakdowns of psychological defense mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
Consecutive exhausted PCI patients (n = 638), participating in the EXhaustion Intervention Trial (EXIT), were briefly assessed for mild depression at baseline using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition and for minimal symptoms of anxiety at baseline, 6, and 18 months using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (state only).	synthetic_intensity
Resting CVC did not predict general indicators of mild depression in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses.	synthetic_intensity
An open treatment trial involving 20 bipolar adolescents (11 boys, 9 girls; mean age 14.8+/-1.6) found that the combination of FFT-A and mood stabilizing medications was associated with modest improvements in mild depression symptoms, moderate mania symptoms, and some behavior problems over 1 year.	synthetic_intensity
The present clinical study shows the subtle influence of cognitive style and mild aggressive behavior on the minor discordance seen between self- and hetero-evaluation for low-level depression during the gradual improvement of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for basic cognitive diathesis-stress models of mild depression for children are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Recognizing and thus responding to mild depression in a coordinated and appropriate way in the community requires some additional action.	synthetic_intensity
Hoarding in people with high autistic traits could be slightly influenced by mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
An interaction effect of gender by self-esteem was found on mild state depression, where the association was slightly stronger for girls than for boys.	synthetic_intensity
These categories for mild severity and for the diagnosis of depression have a good internal consistency.	synthetic_intensity
Among the separated/divorced cohort, shorter separation periods and some attachment to the (ex)husband were associated with moderately poorer immune function and slight depression.	synthetic_intensity
Fifteen patients were found to have clinical caseness for mild anxiety while 12 (10) were caseness for low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Some of the results show that women from single-parent families have lower quality of life (Z = -2.224, p = .026), lower income (Z = -2.727, p = .006) and somewhat greater depression (Z = -6.143, p = .001) than women from bi-parental families.	synthetic_intensity
Procedures involving temporal cueing of coverant emission were employed in the treatment of a mild case of interpersonal anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological status, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and disease activity were evaluated at baseline and then every 3 months for a period of 18 months by means of clinical and biological parameters, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), focusing on mild depression symptoms, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire, and the Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Concerns.	synthetic_intensity
Among the current elderly group, mild depression and a moderate patriarchal attitude were associated with IPV.	synthetic_intensity
Positive religious coping was positively associated with positive aspects of caregiving and social support, which was slightly negatively associated with burden and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In one of the first studies to examine the model using LISREL confirmatory factor-analytic techniques and a modest array of different self-report measures, 205 undergraduates completed measures of mild depression, slight anxiety, stable self-esteem, and balanced positive and negative affect.	synthetic_intensity
