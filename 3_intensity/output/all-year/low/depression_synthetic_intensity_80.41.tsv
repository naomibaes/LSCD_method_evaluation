We predicted that client difficulty (depression, anger, and suicidality) would be related to therapist burnout, and that high expectancies of therapy would be related to increased burnout for both clients and therapists at 4 months.	natural
This study was, therefore, meant to further investigate the relationships among ethnic identity, discrimination (personal and collective), and adjustment (selfesteem and depression) through a model proposing daily hassles as a mediator among these factors.	natural

Generally it was found that less intense major disorders and those with some neurophysiological components were investigated a great deal (there were over 10,000 articles for both cases of major depression and schizophrenia) while there were few articles concerning rare or newly introduced disorders.	synthetic_low
Recent models of mild depression (e.g., from Hyde and colleagues) have integrated subtle affective and cognitive vulnerability factors, positing that a slight temperamental factor (i.e., moderate negative emotionality) contributes to the development of mild cognitive vulnerability factors, which in turn conveys a minor risk for mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Using an exploratory data analytic approach, the results indicated that both CP and PD samples reported increased levels of state and trait anxiety (p <.0001), mild depression (p <.01), and somatization (p <.0001) compared with normals.	synthetic_low
An alternative hypothesis states that mild depression is a subtle social manipulation aimed at gently eliciting some sympathy from others.	synthetic_low
In this study, 139 black urban sixth-grade children were gently surveyed using the Child Depression Inventory for signs of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Immunological dysfunction in participants with bulimia nervosa (BN) might be due to not only chaotic eating behavior but also a temporary psychological state, such as mild depression and anxiety, because studies have found a notable relationship between depression, anxiety, and immunological dysfunction.	synthetic_low
The relationships between temperament and various mild conditions correlated with low-level depression were examined using logistic regression.	synthetic_low
This fails to support a continuum spanning both psychotic MDD and the very mild forms of unipolar depression.	synthetic_low
The CPNI has a three-fold purpose: (a) to assess the 12 personality disorders according to the criteria on Axis II and Appendix B of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (b) to assess neuropsychological dysfunction, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, executive function deficits, and other related symptoms; and (c) to measure some Axis I diagnoses including mild Separation Anxiety Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, low-level depression, and mild general anxiety, as well as other minor clinical syndromes.	synthetic_low
It has two aims: (a) to examine whether this comorbidity is predicted by the mild objective severity of the MI and the patients' initial appraisal and stress responses; and (b) to determine whether this comorbidity is associated with mild PTSD symptomatology, low-level depression, gentle physiological adjustment, and moderate psychosocial adjustment seven months post-MI.	synthetic_low
Due to the time-related constraints in assessment settings and the association of rumination on mild sadness with diagnosis of mild depression, the rapid identification of individuals scoring relatively high on this construct may become a helpful screening tool in non-clinical samples.	synthetic_low
Over the course of the study, data were gathered on: (a) slightly anxious/withdrawn behavior at age 8; (b) mild anxiety disorders and minor depression at ages 16-18 and 18-21; (c) a variety of potential confounding factors, including mild adversity and family factors during childhood.	synthetic_low
A review of this literature reveals that symptoms of mild depression and/or mild anxiety may appear in approximately 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer before the diagnosis is made.	synthetic_low
Clinical implications regarding the use of psychotropic medications such as SSRIs alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of mild maternal anxiety and moderate depression during pregnancy are discussed.	synthetic_low
This interaction showed that living in neighborhoods with higher levels of social capital slightly reduced the relationship between maternal depression and minor adolescent behavior problems and confirmed the expectation that raising healthy well-adjusted children depends not only on the family, but also the context in which the family lives.	synthetic_low
Identifying a suitable paradigm that could modulate MW, particularly in mildly depressed individuals, would allow future studies to test whether slightly elevated rates of MW somewhat contribute to the cognitive-affective features of depression, such as occasional rumination and mild anhedonia.	synthetic_low
Vignettes describing women with obesity, mild depression or both conditions were presented, followed by a set of items on semantic differentials based on previous stigma research of depression (depression stigma DS) and obesity (Fat Phobia Scale FPS).	synthetic_low

The Illness Attitudes Scales (IAS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered to 40 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and these were compared with 35 patients with organic gastrointestinal (GI) disease, 37 mildly depressed patients, and 40 healthy volunteers.	synthetic_low
It also did not appear that the mild depression in wall climbing seen in 6OHDA-treated animals was related to an observed slight neurotoxin-induced increase in shock sensitivity, given that amount of wall climbing was observed to be positively correlated with footshock intensity.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study is to explore mild symptoms and personality traits of patients from two Psychosomatic University Departments, one in Dsseldorf (West Germany) and the other in Magdeburg (East Germany), suffering from moderate anxiety disorders and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Paroxetine is not clearly superior to placebo in this small study of very old nursing home residents with occasional depression, and there is a minimal risk of adverse cognitive effects.	synthetic_low
One hundred and forty three students completed indices of mild depression, adequate self-esteem, mild anger, occasional physical aggression, minor illness, and casual cigarette and alcohol use, twice, at sessions three weeks apart. A subset of these participants provided basic anthropometric indices, allowing computation of an estimated waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).	synthetic_low

Results suggest that both mildly depressed groups, relative to the nondepressed college group, made slightly more errors in recognizing the facial expressions and reported some freezing or tensing; moderately higher fear and depression reactions; and a reduced level of comfort with their own emotional reactions to these expressions and a moderate desire to change these reactions.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the effects of mild depression and time since injury upon interpersonal response to spinal cord injury.	synthetic_low
Mild self-criticism and slight neuroticism were uniquely associated with a past history of mild depression, and low-level self-criticism and moderate immature dependence interacted gently in predicting occasional past occurrences of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Over 12 months, 223 CAD patients (70 men, mean age 58 9 years) were evaluated for basic socio-demographic, clinical, and moderate mental distress symptoms as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	synthetic_low
