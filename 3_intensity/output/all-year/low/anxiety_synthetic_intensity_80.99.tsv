Mild symptoms of depression and anxiety are commonly reported following brain injury, providing manageable challenges to patients, clinicians, and carers.	synthetic_low
Although there seemed very little evidence of sex differences in self-reported mild social anxiety, two subtle personality variables--extraversion and neuroticism--were clearly related to social anxiety.	synthetic_low
In agreement with Saunders and co-workers, we found no correlation for E. Our results gently indicate that readiness to react to CO2 is somewhat related to mild anxiety (positive correlations for N, Hs, Pt and PF, and negative for Es).	synthetic_low

The mild anxiety factor was predicted by slight avoidance of decision-making situations.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest mild anxiety sensitivity may somewhat moderate the relation between smoking and prototypical panic psychopathology variables (minor panic attacks and slight somatic complaints) even after controlling for gender and negative affectivity, and that these associations are specifically related to panic-relevant processes.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to investigate the subtle interplay between slight test anxiety and working memory (WM) on mathematics performance in younger children.	synthetic_low
People with psychosis attempt to regulate these emotions in similar ways to people with minor mood and anxiety problems, by using less effective emotional regulation strategies such as occasional ruminating.	synthetic_low
142 upper-division university students' predictions of their performance on two examinations were compared by mild test anxiety, as determined by a measure of state-test-anxiety.	synthetic_low
To assess the construct validity of self-complexity, 472 college undergraduates were calmly assessed using this method and concurrently assessed for depression, mild anxiety, social desirability, and gentle positive/negative affectivity.	synthetic_low
A BAI-PC cutoff score of 5 and above yielded a modest clinical efficiency (82) with 85 sensitivity and 81 specificity for identifying patients with mild panic, generalized anxiety, or both disorders, whereas a BDI-PC cutoff score of 6 and above afforded the highest clinical efficiency (92) with 83 sensitivity and 95 specificity for detecting patients with and without major depressive disorders.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that perceived care by friends slightly influenced the effect of making friends on mild social anxiety.	synthetic_low
This study addressed two issues regarding hypochondriasis of later life: whether this disorder is mildly related more to psychopathology or common health problems; and the relationship of hypochondriasis to other later-life concerns of anxiety, depression, and mild paranoid reactions.	synthetic_low
Reactivity was operationalized as a slight increase in heart rate, minor cortisol excretion, and mild subjective anxiety responses in anticipation of and at the start of the lecture.	synthetic_low
These associations remained significant even after controlling for mild state anxiety, slight depression, low obsessionality, and the presence of chronic health problems.	synthetic_low
Subjects were administered the Test Anxiety Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventories, and the Fear Survey Schedule prior to treatment, immediately following the three mild treatment sessions, and at the calm 3-week and 8-month follow-ups.	synthetic_low
The results suggested that the level of self-esteem and minor discrepancies between subjective public-esteem and self-esteem are important and relatively independent factors in mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
MDD in MS was characterized by older age of onset (p<0.001), and fewer comorbid mild anxiety disorders (37 versus 72; p<0.001).	synthetic_low
We conclude that future investigations of atypical anti-psychotics and their possible tendency to elicit mild separation anxiety are essential.	synthetic_low
Some moderate developmental changes in social anxiety were found from early to mid-adolescence, as well as slight gender differences across adolescence.	synthetic_low
A cutoff procedure using the Worry/Oversensitivity factor produced promising accuracy values, especially in the identification of children without mild anxiety disorders (specificity = 80).	synthetic_low
Consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety, three primary but mild anxiety factors emerged, supporting the construct validity of the new scale.	synthetic_low
This phenomenon concerns mainly subjects taking their medication for mild anxiety and not for sleep aid.	synthetic_low
The first phase of the disease was accompanied by mild anxiety, slight restlessness, minor autonomic and vascular paroxysms, slight anorexia, some insomnia, and minor disturbances of other physiological functions.	synthetic_low
The following seven proved to be significant: Number of Koppitz's Emotional Indicators in the Human Figure Drawing, Sociometric rejection by peers in first grade, Father's occupational, Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) Pathognomic Verbalization, HIT Mild Anxiety, HIT Hostility, and HIT Form Appropriateness.	synthetic_low
However, results suggested that specific mindfulness facets function as unique predictors of responses to a mild social anxiety stressor and trait anxiety symptoms, above and beyond social anxiety schemas and other facets of mindfulness.	synthetic_low
Eighty-four male undergraduates calmly anticipated taking a test of intellectual abilities and either were led to believe that mild test anxiety has no effect on test performance or were given no particular information about the relation between test anxiety and performance.	synthetic_low
In four independent non-clinical samples (total N=2643), we examined relationships between mild social anxiety, slight hostility, and minor aggression using a range of measures that included both self-report and behavioral assessments.	synthetic_low

The main measures used were the Reactions to Impairment and Disability Inventory, Adjustment subscale; Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale; and Self-awareness of Deficits Interview.	synthetic_low
High-anxious subjects performed more poorly; felt somewhat less positive about themselves, their abilities, and the task; experienced some anxiety and felt it slightly interfered with performance; estimated spending less time on task; and rated themselves engaging in mild worry, emotionality, and task-generated interference than did low-anxious subjects.	synthetic_low
Attention bias modification training (ABMT) has potential to reduce treatment barriers as a mobile intervention for mild stress and anxiety, but the degree to which ABMT can be embedded in a mobile gaming format and its potential for transfer of benefits is unknown.	synthetic_low
Poorer neuropsychological test performance was associated with mild anxiety but not depression as measured by the Tryon, Stein, and Chu Tension scale and scale 2 of the MMPI respectively.	synthetic_low
Higher levels of IC at baseline were related to minor depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The results from this study link subtle changes in fetal behavior with minor changes in women's cardiovascular activity after psychological stress and women's mild anxiety status.	synthetic_low
Parental attachment anxiety modestly predicted children's mild distress during less stressful phases of the removal, R = .25, and parents' attachment-related avoidance predicted fewer correct memory reports from the children (i.e., fewer hits to open-ended questions, R = .16, and fewer hits to direct questions, R = .27).	synthetic_low
