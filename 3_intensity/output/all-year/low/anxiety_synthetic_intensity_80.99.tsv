Nevertheless, we argue that (a) the developers of the ASI have slightly conflated beliefs regarding the mild consequences of anxiety with concern about these consequences, (b) the accumulated evidence for the construct validity of the ASI is somewhat weak, and (c) Holloway and McNally's design and analyses do not permit them to exclude the more straightforward explanation that low-level trait anxiety accounts for their findings.	synthetic_intensity
Utilizing the Eysenck Personality Inventory, the Institute of Personality and Ability Testing Anxiety Scale, Symptom Checklist, and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, it was determined that males applying to a university/county hospital sex-dysfunction clinic appeared similar to patients seen in the same clinic who were unselected for sex dysfunction and more psychologically disturbed, albeit with mild anxiety, than patients with the same complaint applying for treatment at a private clinic.	synthetic_intensity

Its dynamic and economic aspects are summarized as follows: those who have created a neoreality in terms of sexual acts and objects in the service of moderate libidinal homeostasis, and neoneeds in the service of mild narcissistic homeostasis, have reduced the elaboration of phallic-oedipal castration anxiety and at the same time through mitigating the problems of separateness and of minor infantile sadism have also simplified what Klein termed the elaboration of the depressive position.	synthetic_intensity
Comorbid mild anxiety disorders preceded the onset of major depression in two-thirds of individuals while comorbid substance abuse/dependence followed the onset of major depression in two-thirds and predicted more frequent occurrences into adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
Among 73 children between the ages of 4 and 18 having their blood drawn, it was predicted that children with an attributional analysis of unknown perceived source of control prior to the impending medical procedures would experience a moderate level of anxiety (procedure-related distress).	synthetic_intensity
It is hypothesised that obsessional phenomena function as an off-line risk avoidance process, designed to lead to risk avoidance behavior at a future time, thus distinguishing it from mild anxiety and related phenomena as on-line emotional states, designed to lead to the avoidance of immediate and direct risks.	synthetic_intensity
A slightly greater EDA is observed in the rare pattern of depression higher than mild anxiety, than in the opposite case.	synthetic_intensity

Unmedicated hypertensives (42) and normotensive controls (21) of both sexes were exposed to a mild physical stressor (electric current) and ordinary psychological active coping (mental arithmetic, free speech) and passive coping (unpleasant films) tasks, while moderate indices of prestressor anxiety and task appraisal were measured.	synthetic_intensity

It was concluded that mild death anxiety response patterns are a function of the population examined, rather than existing as general characteristics of the elderly, which explains the inconsistency of previous literature on death anxiety in elderly persons.	synthetic_intensity
