Meta-analytic evidence suggests that they are effective in enhancing happiness and ameliorating depression.	natural
Compared with patients with no history of major depression, those with a history of depressive episodes had higher self-ratings of disease activity and were assessed as having more severe disease and poorer physical functioning by their physicians.	natural
Forty-two multiple sclerosis patients and 42 controls were tested for pragmatic abilities, neuro-cognition, social cognition, depression, and fatigue.	natural
The objective of the present study is to test the validity of the integrated cognitive model of depression proposed by Kwon and Oei (1994) with a Chinese adolescent sample.	natural
Among the quantitative results, as compared with adolescents with low suicidal ideation, adolescents with high suicidal ideation reported significantly higher scores for stressful life events, coping-avoidant strategies, loneliness, and depression, as well as significantly lower scores for coping-approach strategies.	natural
Although pain and depression are linked, we found that affective pain is distinct from depression, and that somatic depression is distinct from pain.	natural
Additionally, we tested whether key cognitive processes (e.g., maladaptive self-view, self-criticism) previously implicated in depression related to ERP components.	natural
Male depression with onset after 40 had a significantly shorter duration of illness and fewer patients with atypical features than male depression with onset before 40.	natural
The PTSD hyperarousal cluster was indirectly related to suicidal ideation through depression ( = .13, p < .001).	natural
Soldiers completed a battery of self-report measures, including the PTSD Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and scales from the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory.	natural
Results are discussed with reference to feelings of occasional learned helplessness and mild depression in learning-disabled children, and to the importance of psychological management of the dyslexic child.	synthetic_low
Using multiple-regression models, HADS scores for mild depression, but not for anxiety, proved to be an independent predictor for the clinicians' judgements of moderate disease severity [exp(beta) = 1.08; 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.	synthetic_low
Symptoms of PGD and mild depression shared a general factor, but were distinct as shown by their significant specific factor loadings at 6 and 13 months postloss.	synthetic_low

Using a clinical sample, this study examined the relationship between early experiences with low care, moderate control, instances of abuse and neglect, and mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, via the subtle mediating effects of cognitive style.	synthetic_low
Beck's triad, pathognomonic for mild depression (slightly negative self-image, pessimistic view of the future, and somewhat negative interpretation of life events), is integral to the life of a widow.	synthetic_low
We investigated (a) the relation of mild maternal depression to perceptions of minor externalizing and internalizing disorders in children and (b) the quality of communication in a mother-child interaction task as a function of mild maternal depression and perceptions of the child.	synthetic_low
The final regression model revealed significant associations with health-related quality of life, physical component (odds ratio [OR] 0.56; 95 confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-0.91), and mental component (OR 0.50; 95 CI: 0.31-0.82), occasional consumption of alcoholic beverages (OR 1.27; 95 CI: 1.05-1.54), initial phase of depression (OR 3.92; 95 CI: 1.16-13.22), and previous episodes of mild depression (OR 10.89; 95 CI: 2.49-47.72).	synthetic_low

Evidence suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) might be a promising new treatment procedure for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Adjusting for preinfarction quality of life, in-hospital anxiety, and demographic variables, mild depression was prospectively and independently related to slightly reduced global health at 4 months as well as modestly reduced overall mental health-including vitality, psychological health, and social function-and a small increase in role interference from psychological problems.	synthetic_low
Depression and fatigue during chronic IFN- administration were associated with minor alterations in the expression (OAS2) and transcriptional control (CREB/ATF) of genes linked to behavioral disorders including CFS and mild depression, further suggesting a potential immune contribution to these conditions.	synthetic_low
Except for the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) subscale Social Anxiety, which has been considered a negative symptom scale in previous SPQ-analyses, no negative schizotypal or mild depression scale was associated with negative priming performance.	synthetic_low
