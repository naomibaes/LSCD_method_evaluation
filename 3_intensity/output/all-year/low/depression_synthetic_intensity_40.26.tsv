Although depression has been described in autistic children, questions about its validity have often been raised.	natural
The hierarchical linear regression involving demographic variables and the severity of depressive symptoms showed that the severity of depression was the variable with higher correlation with quality of life dimensions, presenting increased variation in the domains (from 9 to 24).	natural
Fewer than 50 of doctors asked about mild depression, body weight control and disordered eating.	synthetic_intensity
Elevated scores were found on the MMPI depression scale for all three groups, with HIV infection and the presence of mild symptoms being associated with slight elevations in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression symptoms were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 20 weeks. Depression symptoms slightly increased during antiviral treatment; 5-HTTLPR genotype had a minor effect on IFN-induced depression symptoms in both non-Hispanic Caucasians and Hispanic patients, although the opposite risk allele was associated with depression in the two populations.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the vast majority of children scored within normal ranges on screenings for behavioral and emotional difficulties, mild depression, and quality of life, and did not differ by whether or not the child knew his/her HIV status.	synthetic_intensity
Despite these drawbacks, some of the proposed biologic tests for depression might be somewhat useful in casually monitoring recovery, predicting mild relapse, or generally delineating special patient subpopulations (eg, impulsive and vulnerable patients).	synthetic_intensity
It was further predicted that parental inferential feedback would somewhat moderate the relationship between negative childhood life events and a minor cognitive risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic mild depression, but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled.	synthetic_intensity
This is a problem of notable clinical and socio-economical interest, because, when present in the same subject, mild depression, parkinsonism-related motor impairment, and cognitive impairment may not only act additively or synergistically in affecting the functional outcome of the patient, but also potentially lead to their institutionalization.	synthetic_intensity

During her marriage, a mild depression had been related to a slight restriction of social activity due to a mild phobia for people in groups, and occasionally to moderate sexual frustration. Two alternative programs for achieving a satisfactory life situation were put before her, and apparently accepted, at least tentatively.	synthetic_intensity

Self-reported anxiety and mild depression were associated with somewhat low levels of sense of coherence.	synthetic_intensity
The present findings in 54 probands at risk for affective disorders underline the assumption that the personality trait 'autonomic lability' is a valid antecedent of mild depression, but also add the personality trait 'rigidity' as a potential candidate for a vulnerability marker for affective disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a group cognitive behaviour therapy program for mild residual depression and to assess the impact of moderate self-criticism, self-oriented perfectionism, and socially prescribed perfectionism on the outcome of this treatment.	synthetic_intensity

Analyses indicate a noticeable effect of exercise on mildly reducing low-level depression ( = -0.63, P = 0.001) and slight anxiety ( = -0.95, P=0.001) symptoms (total scores) over the 8-week period compared to a health education control group.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to determine the threshold at which mild depression becomes slightly important for the daily functioning of patients with heart disease.	synthetic_intensity
The construct validity of the revised scale was supported by significant correlations with minor social difficulties as assessed by the original Sociocultural Adaptation Scale; adequate generic social skills; moderate cultural intelligence; moderate cultural engagement; adjusted international adjustment; and mild psychological adaptation: reasonable life satisfaction and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, the women filled in either the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale as a psychological component (n=48) or the somatic subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 as a basic somatic component (n=50) to identify associations with the DT-score.	synthetic_intensity
