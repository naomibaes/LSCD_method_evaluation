The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with depression, generalized anxiety, and substance abuse; explains how abnormal behavior derives from normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	natural
