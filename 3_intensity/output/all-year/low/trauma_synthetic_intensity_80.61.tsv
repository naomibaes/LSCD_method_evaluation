A confluence of my mild residual neurosis, the patient's lesser neurosis, her gentle transference state, her other lesser characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the slight regression from the mild trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_low
Subjects either received a brief explanation (explanation group) or received no explanation at all (no explanation group) about mild trauma reactions prior to undertaking a straightforward therapeutic writing protocol.	synthetic_low

The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_low
Because of the preschool age child's immature ego and cognition, the child experiences a significant event as being intimately connected with his inner self, feelings, fantasies and copes with the mild trauma according to his parents' gentle style of facilitation to the trauma themselves.	synthetic_low
In this light, the author examines the affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own commitment and clinical attitude; and his work on trauma and the slightly traumatic, including the somewhat discomforting messages transmitted during the healing process by analysts in uncertainty (and perhaps reluctance) of their own mild regression and countertransferential challenges.	synthetic_low
The current study gently assessed prospectively whether childhood betrayal trauma (BT) history and women's potential reliance on their perpetrators (unemployment, number of children below 13) slightly increased women's risk of ongoing victimization, while carefully controlling for trauma-related symptoms (PTSD, depression, dissociation).	synthetic_low

However, this scale also displayed a cognitive behavioural trauma treatment protocol and gentle eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing to be equivalent in reduced treatment distress and participant endorsement in the treatment of mild post-traumatic stress disorder.	synthetic_low
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to subtle replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are somewhat threatening.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that there are subtle elements to illness related PTG and a need for additional research into the processes and outcomes of minor physical illness related trauma.	synthetic_low
Moreover, mild sensitivity to the balance interventions correlated significantly with minor trauma reports and mild dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_low
To determine if a gentle intervention to reduce mild maternal distress and address maternal perceptions of infants' vulnerability also reduces perceptions of concern, 105 mothers of premature infants (25- to 34-weeks' gestational age; >600 g) with mild depression, anxiety, or trauma were randomized to a six- or nine-session intervention or a comparison condition.	synthetic_low
Important elements of the subtle art of trauma are illustrated using the nuanced work of Paul Celan, Anselm Kiefer, Claude Lanzmann, Art Spiegelman, and Anne-Marie Levine and gentle texts by Aharon Appelfeld.	synthetic_low

Previous research has suggested that the rates of unresolved states of mind regarding minor trauma in response to the AAI may be underestimated due to the lack of direct questions and associated gentle probes regarding physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_low
Further research is warranted, including epidemiological research with representative data across the country and preliminary studies of the moderate impact of trauma and victimization on the mental_health and well-being of Russian adults and children.	synthetic_low
