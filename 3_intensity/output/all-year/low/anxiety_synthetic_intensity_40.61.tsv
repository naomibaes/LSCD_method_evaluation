The present study investigated whether perceived partner responsivenessthe extent to which individuals feel cared for, understood, and validated by their partnerpredicted subjective sleep problems and objective (actigraph-based) sleep efficiency through lower anxiety and depression symptoms.	natural
Depressive episodes with anxiety and with suicide risk severity are important specifiers that vary with the age at onset and/or age of the patient and should be considered for inclusion in the DSM-5 revision.	natural
Inclusion of humorous items did not affect grammar scores on matched humorous/nonhumorous items nor on common posttreatment items, nor did inclusion affect results of anxiety measures.	natural
We briefly explore the existing research on these three topics, identify evidence-based practices and learning strategies to support social emotional learning in individuals with ASD, and include descriptive lists of practical resources that address anxiety, social isolation, and grief.	natural
Seventy-three percent of 90 psychiatric inpatients had a coexisting anxiety disorder.	natural
Anxiety symptoms were assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait version and an anxiety problems scale derived from the Young Adult Self Report.	natural
Moreover, adult women reported a higher mean score than adult men on the anxiety scale.	natural
Four affects (anxiety, depression, anger, and contentment) were assessed using three measures: ratings of prestructured drawings of people (PR), self-ratings (SR), and results of Psychiatric Symptom Index (PSI).	natural
In addition, anxiety and stress at entry were found to mediate the relationships between self-management and ability to cope and task-specific anxiety.	natural
By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not levels of anxiety.	natural
A standard CBT program was augmented with multiple treatment components designed to accommodate or remediate the social and adaptive skill deficits of children with ASD that could pose barriers to anxiety reduction.	natural
Interestingly, although a high quality of SSR mitigated feelings of test anxiety, PPM and TPM intensified test anxiety in neurotic students.	natural
The most salient finding was an interaction between anxiety and interference on comprehension performance: under word-by-word-but not under sentence-by-sentence-presentation, anxious subjects showed poorer comprehension than non-anxious subjects in both conditions known to interfere with the articulatory loop (i.e. articulatory suppression, and irrelevant speech), but equivalent comprehension in the no interference condition.	natural
The aim of this study is to measure the effect of modified CBT, that is, using visualized language throughout the entire session for clients with ASD and anxiety and avoidance behavior.	natural
Findings of this study were discussed with the focus on the two components of the FLCAS, followed by future study areas to be undertaken to shed further light on the role of foreign language anxiety in L2 acquisition.	natural
Using an experimental design, four groups of participants experienced inductions of disgust, anxiety, happiness or neutral mood, and analogue measures representative of beliefs related to anxiety sensitivity were taken before and after these mood inductions.	natural
State anxiety, heart rate, and cortisol were modestly elevated during C and accompanied by relative desynchrony of high-alpha power, increased cortico-cortical communication between motor and non-motor regions, and degradation of the fluency of aiming trajectory, but maintenance of performance outcome (i.e., score).	natural
Methodological improvements from previous research were implemented including statistical control of depressive and anxiety symptoms resting, stress-induced and cardiac recovery condition comparisons and use of pulse wave analysis.	natural
This finding of a positive association between the divorce of parents and later anxiety in men is supported by several of the other population surveys carried out in the United States.	natural
This finding partly unfolds the complex relationship of 'CSAD, PD, and CO hypersensitivity' and indicates that CO hypersensitivity and separation anxiety extend together beyond childhood.	natural
The duration of the study was 4 weeks with clinical assessments at inclusion and after 2 and 4 weeks of therapy by the Hamilton anxiety scale and visual analogue scales.	natural
The findings which suggest support for the multidimensional model of mild anxiety are briefly discussed and minor implications for future research noted.	synthetic_low
However, this was no longer the case when controlling for the mild symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that a belief in the effectiveness of lifestyle change in promoting health, and mild anxiety about health, can influence uptake of screening.	synthetic_low
Recent reports indicate that some individuals experience slight anxiety during formal relaxation training; however, there has been just one controlled investigation of this phenomenon (Heide and Borkovec, 1983).	synthetic_low
In Gray's theory, impulsivity is associated with high sensitivity to signals of reward, and anxiety with moderate sensitivity to signals of punishment.	synthetic_low
The PASS assesses four components of mild pain-related anxiety: cognitive, light fear, simple escape/avoidance, and gentle physiological responses.	synthetic_low
Prior slight body dissatisfaction significantly predicted a somewhat negative response to Body Shape Liking and Anxiety VAS.	synthetic_low
Women with unsuccessful pregnancies and no living children had elevated trait anxiety, when measured early in pregnancy.	synthetic_low
Two experiments examined the effects of visually presented threat and nonthreat word lead stimuli on blink modification among unselected young adults (Experiment 1, N = 35) and participants selected for low and moderate trait anxiety (Experiment 2, N = 60).	synthetic_low
The results suggest that mild anxiety sensitivity is frequently not independent of other less intense forms of anxiety.	synthetic_low
With respect to course, a noticeable decrease was found in the meta-analysis for mild anxiety, but not for depression.	synthetic_low
External locus of control was somewhat related to mild anxiety and only slightly related to facilitating anxiety.	synthetic_low
Measures of socialization, mild anxiety, and slight antisocial behavior somewhat differentiated them from normal controls and the clinical controls.	synthetic_low
The primary aims of the current study were to compare expectations of child vulnerability and coping among mothers of children with mild anxiety disorders on the basis of whether or not mothers also had a mild anxiety disorder, and examine the degree to which the gentle association between maternal anxiety disorder status and child coping expectations was mediated by how mothers interpreted slightly ambiguous material that referred to their own experience.	synthetic_low
Pretreatment Developmental Disability-Child Global Assessment Scale scores correlated with severity of autism spectrum disorders core symptoms (r = -.388, p = .034), pragmatic communication (r = .407, p = .032), and verbal ability (r = .449, p = .013) and did not correlate with mild anxiety symptoms or with calmly reported adaptive behavior.	synthetic_low
These mild effects were found after controlling for working models of attachment; covert narcissism was predicted also by mild attachment anxiety.	synthetic_low
Findings revealed that individuals with mild levels of anxiety and depression are somewhat more sensitive to subtle indicators of neighborhood poverty.	synthetic_low
On both occasions the same questions were being asked: do mild anxiety levels fluctuate in a predicted manner during encounter group experiences, and is it possible to detect subtle systematic fluctuations in several, measured psychological states during these experiences?	synthetic_low
The results showed minor mediating effects for the Trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a general self-report of coping, and socioeconomic status.	synthetic_low
Greater severity and perceived disability, mild psychiatric comorbidity, and living alone predicted health care use for MDD subjects, and greater perceived disability, mild psychiatric comorbidity, younger age, and parent's psychiatric concerns for anxiety disorder subjects.	synthetic_low
