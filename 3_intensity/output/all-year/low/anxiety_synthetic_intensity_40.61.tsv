Furthermore, after adjustment for baseline blood pressure (BP), baseline anxiety levels and traditional risk factors, attenuated systolic BP responses to mental arithmetic were associated with future anxiety levels (R2 = .055).	natural
However, the relationship between trait anxiety and risk taken was not significant in study 2.	natural
Homophobic victimization across time points was more strongly associated for males than females, and this accounted for why initial homophobic victimization predicted increased anxiety for males but not females (i.e., it was indicative of mediated moderation).	natural
Maternal over control was uniquely related to elementary school-aged children's anxiety whereas paternal over control was more important during adolescence.	natural
Thus, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between minority status, contextual factors, and lifetime Generalized Anxiety Disorder.	natural

Correlations among the scales were significant; however, the correlation between state and trait anxiety was higher than that between death anxiety and both state and trait anxiety for men and women.	natural
Questionnaires were used to assess psychological distress, everyday anxiety regulation and fear of recurrence.	natural
This study examined emotion socialization practices in families of children with an anxiety disorder (AD; n = 28) and of children who had no diagnoses (ND; n = 28) and considered gender differences.	natural
Validation of the personality scales in the Study in Imagery shows id derivatives and superego both correlate positively with neuroticism as measured by the Eysenck Personality Inventory, and also with the second-order anxiety factor of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire.	natural
Moreover, for target symptomes of PTSD and general psychological symptomes (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal, anxiety, and depression), effect sizes were significant, ranging from r's of .2-.49.	natural
This paper presents a framework for brief, intensive psychotherapeutic intervention for acute distress, manifested by feelings of depression, anxiety or anger, isolation and loneliness, that arise when crises provoke unconscious conflict.	natural
Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of predictable and unpredictable chronic stressors on the anxiety profile of rats in three distinct stages of pregnancy (1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks).	natural
Using mixed-modeling repeated-measures regression, we examined changes in weekly total depression and anxiety scores as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory over the 8-week study period.	natural
Despite multiple calls for research, there has been little effort to incorporate topics regarding mortality salience and death anxiety into workplace literature.	natural
Despite difficulties providing treatment cross-culturally (i.e., language barriers), EMDR therapy was followed by significant and large reductions in trauma symptoms (Cohen's d = 2.48), depression (d = 2.09), and anxiety (d = 1.77).	natural
This article describes how group counselors participating in group supervision perceive and experience anxiety.	natural
These data provide novel evidence for the unique effects of coping-motivated marijuana use in the link between marijuana-related impairment and social anxiety.	natural
Overall, hypotheses were supported in that childhood family unpredictability correlated with unpredictability beliefs and with anxiety and depression scores, and unpredictability beliefs correlated with both anxiety and depression.	natural
MAT may increase emotion regulation ability in higher education students with issues of stress, anxiety, and low mood.	natural
Musicians often play under circumstances in which pressure may lead to anxiety and performance deterioration.	natural
Convergent and discriminant validity were examined by testing differences in the size of correlations between each dimensional anxiety scale and each of the previously validated scales.	natural
This interpretation is consistent with predictions regarding the personality correlates of the factors of psychopathy, indicating that while constraint composes a large part of psychopathy assessments, it is less clear how much anxiety lends to the construct.	natural
AS can be regarded as a subfactor of trait anxiety, although the question arises as to whether AS is a cause of trait anxiety.	natural
That is, anxiety rises from toddlerhood to childhood, decreases from childhood to young adulthood, but again increases from young adulthood into older adulthood.	natural
No significant between-groups differences emerged for state or trait anxiety.	natural
Outcome measures: Questionnaires: Students were given I think I am (measuring selfesteem) and Social Anxiety Scale for ChildrenRevised (SASCR) (measuring social anxiety).	natural
Additionally, although progress has been made in identifying risk factors, protective factors, and treatments that may influence the course of BI and associated anxiety, more work is needed.	natural
In addition, slight avoidance mediated the effect of mild emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and acceptance-resignation gently mediated the effects of both minor consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression.	synthetic_intensity
The internal consistency of FOCI Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale were satisfactory, and the concurrent and divergent validity of the FOCI Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale was supported through its associations with clinician-rated OCD symptom severity, and self-reported OCD, depressive, and mild anxiety measures.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the present study was to investigate mild dimensions of secretarial anxiety, eagerness, and curiosity with respect to word processing equipment.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of most screening and diagnostic tests is to initiate treatment when a minor problem is found and, otherwise, to gently allay mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Increased parental perceptions of child vulnerability were related to mild social anxiety in children, even after controlling for child age and disease severity.	synthetic_intensity
One of the five subscales on this instrument assesses evaluation anxiety, the degree to which the individual feels slightly anxious in situations where he/she is being evaluated.	synthetic_intensity
On placebo, anxiety scores correlated moderately (+0.50) with average plasma FFA.	synthetic_intensity
Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined social reference learning in mild social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Mild prenatal anxiety and maternal sensitivity emerged as independent, additive moderators of infant cortisol reactivity, F (3, 180) = 3.29, p = .02, F (3, 179) = 2.68, p = .05 respectively.	synthetic_intensity
The attention control condition resulted in no change in mild anxiety level.	synthetic_intensity
HPA and SAM axis activities have been conclusively associated with mild anxiety, and may provide a method of validating anxiety rating scale assessments given by concerned parents and their children with AD about those children.	synthetic_intensity
Behavioral self-blame was significantly associated with decreased self-reported mild anxiety (r = .22, p < .05), but not PTSD or depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the significant correlation of the usually computed total Dogmatism score with 4 mild anxiety dimensions cannot be regarded as a valid proof of Rokeach's hypothesis of a general relation between anxiety and dogmatism.	synthetic_intensity
We predict that the mild anxiety and depression rates would be slightly higher for inmates in preventive detention.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, PD/HMDs are more likely to receive a diagnosis of mild anxiety disorder or alcoholism, to have slightly lower Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, and to have sought treatment than PDs.	synthetic_intensity

Most research on mild anxiety sensitivity (AS) and its moderate relation to psychopathology has examined the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) in various clinical samples.	synthetic_intensity
Some confusion in the research on anxiety and motor behavior is due to the minor failure to distinguish between anxiety as a transitory state and as a relatively stable state.	synthetic_intensity
Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in gently reducing mild anxiety and depression symptoms, however research in autism is limited.	synthetic_intensity
