Evidence suggests that affective problems, such as depression and anxiety, increase risk for late-life dementia.	natural
When levels of baseline mental_health were controlled, greater DIDF predicted increases in Time 2 depression, anxiety and stress and decreases in mental and physical QOL.	natural
In patients with late-life depression who have remitted with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, the deleterious effect of residual symptoms is due to persisting anxiety and, possibly, residual sleep disturbance.	natural
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a significant mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive specific treatments for mood disturbances, have a positive family history of depression or mania, and improve significantly at discharge.	natural
After accounting for girls' depression, girls' loneliness (and not social skills) was related to girls' self-reported social anxiety and girls' social skills (and not loneliness) were related to mothers' reports of girls' social anxiety.	natural

Four hundred and twenty-five adolescents, aged between 14 and 19 years, completed the South Oaks Gambling Screen Revised for Adolescents to assess problem gambling, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 to measure negative affective states, and the Gambling Related Cognitions Scale as a measure of cognitive distortions about gambling, and the General Decision-Making Style tapping habitual patterns which individuals use in decision-making.	natural
The current study used confirmatory factor analysis to model the structural relationship of anxiety and depression in two samples of older adults: a large probability sample (N = 1429) and a smaller convenience sample (N = 210).	natural
Also, it seems that sub-classifying depression into different subtypes, based on chronicity, can predict differences in the levels of some various oxidative stress markers.	natural
This study evaluated parenting attitudes, family environments, depression, and anxiety in a sample of primarily minority urban mothers to better understand maltreating mothers (n = 83), who retain custody of their children and how they are similar to and different from foster mothers (n = 50), kin caregivers (n = 52) of maltreated children, and comparison mothers (n = 100) from the same communities.	natural
Understanding the predictors of depression and anxiety is necessary for incorporating a multidisciplinary approach to address this problem.	natural
Loneliness and self-esteem had a direct effect on adolescent depression.	natural
These findings suggest that the lack of gender typing for women may enable them to cope more effectively with the conflicting demands of multiple roles and thereby reduce certain health risk behaviors (e.g., disordered eating and substance abuse), but that other mental_health concerns (e.g., depression and anxiety) may not be similarly affected.	natural
With wide-reaching harmful effects of depression, and the absence of psychiatric treatment in most HIV care programs in sub-Saharan Africa, we examined the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on depression and other mental_health indicators.	natural
Two hundred fifty-three BCa patients completed a standardised depression scale, and data were factor analysed.	natural
To elucidate whether the chronic psychosocial stress model in tree shrews besides its face validity for depression also has predictive validity, we treated subordinate tree shrews with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and found a time-dependent restoration of both endocrine and behavioural parameters.	natural
In 1989, a general population sample of 2946 8-year-old boys born in Finland in 1981 was assessed using the Rutter's parent and teacher questionnaires, and the Child Depression Inventory.	natural

The results point to the usefulness of the DAS as a potential screening device for low self-esteem and mild depression in adolescent girls who have diabetes.	synthetic_low
The first model included current mild symptoms; current slight body dissatisfaction (ab=0.04, 95 CI [0.01, 0.06]) and moderate fasting (ab=0.12, 95 CI [0.01, 0.22]) were indirectly related to increased suicidal ideation through a sense of burdensomeness, controlling for mild depression.	synthetic_low
The implications of these findings for previous theories and measures of mild depression, mild anxiety, and somewhat low self-esteem are discussed.	synthetic_low
This article reviews rapidly accumulating evidence that both somatic signaling and interoception are occasionally altered in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Moreover, a single daily dosing regimen offers the potential advantages of simplicity, increased compliance, and reduced adverse effects, which in turn would increase the overall success rate in the treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Multiple causal attributions can coexist demonstrating different associations with mild comorbid depression and occasional illness behavior.	synthetic_low
Higher E-NK cell responses to each cytokine were associated with heightened levels of positive emotional and tangible social support, independent of mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
There was some evidence for an association between defeat and PTSD, although this may have been partly accounted for by mild depression.	synthetic_low
Research suggests that minor gender differences in interpersonal orientations may slightly predispose women and men to mild depression.	synthetic_low
The findings revealed that schizophrenics who had somewhat depressed relatives tended to exhibit mild depression and more severe pseudoparkinsonism irrespective of types of neuroleptics, and greater remission of paranoid-hostility symptoms when treated with neuroleptics of the aliphatic-piperadine type.	synthetic_low
The authors report the results of testing with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Leisure Interests Checklist, in relation to a slight decrease of tinnitus in 11 of 13 patients treated with intravenous lidocaine, suggesting a mild presence of depression.	synthetic_low

Structural Equation Modeling indicated that the relationship between CSA and punitive discipline was mediated by mild maternal depression and occasional partner disagreement.	synthetic_low
Despite these drawbacks, some of the proposed biologic tests for depression might be somewhat useful in casually monitoring recovery, predicting mild relapse, or generally delineating special patient subpopulations (eg, impulsive and vulnerable patients).	synthetic_low
Anhedonia, the loss of the capacity of feeling pleasure, was first introduced at the end of the last century by a French psychologist, Ribot, and has been the object of much research, essentially in English, for the last decades, in schizophrenia, in mild depression, in schizoid disorders.	synthetic_low
Results showed a gentle association between initial, moderate depression and various categories of mild subjective stress; a modest reduction in subjective (but not objective) event-related stress coincident with gentle remission; positive relationships between everyday life events and response and maintenance and between minor difficulties and relapse; and a somewhat higher event profile among unipolar depressive patients.	synthetic_low
This study examined the lifetime prevalence of suicidal behaviors and their relation to social integration, mild depression, and aggression/substance use in a cohort of African Americans followed prospectively from first grade to age 32.	synthetic_low
These observations suggest that the key to understanding the slightly higher rates of depression among women than men lies in an investigation of the moderate joint effects of mild biological vulnerabilities and everyday environmental provoking experiences.	synthetic_low
Further, the findings suggest that reports of cognitive reappraisal may be more moderately predictive of positive affect whereas secondary control coping may be more predictive of mild negative affect and symptoms of low-level depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Younger housewives reported somewhat more mild depression symptoms than their older counterparts.	synthetic_low
A meta-analysis of 13 rigorous cross-sectional studies reveals that a diagnosis of mild depression exerts a small effect size on CVC, and explains only a minor portion of the overall variance in CVC.	synthetic_low
Similarly, in NTR non-smokers (n=1088) cotinine levels 1ng/ml were not associated with the DSM-subscale for mild depressive problems [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) 0.04, P=.88], nor to other low-level depression and anxiety measures.	synthetic_low
Taking into account the manageable relative weight of 277 male Belgian-French-speaking and Flemish-speaking subjects (type IV, lipidogram, Fredrickson classification), different levels of mild anxiety, depression, and modes of mild anxiety expression, are examined and compared, as a homogeneous sub-sample, to the main larger heterogeneous one.	synthetic_low
