The results of our mediational analysis using bootstrapping provided support for a theorized model in which coping with oppressive events via internalization mediated the links between sexual objectification and depression and between racist events and depression but not between gendered racism and depression.	natural
The U.K.'s current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Psychiatric Association's depression guidelines state that withdrawal reactions from antidepressants are self-limiting (i.e. typically resolving between 1 and 2weeks).	natural
A slightly dysfunctional problem-solving style was modestly predictive of mild caregiver depression, regardless of the minor severity of physical impairment of the care recipient or the stable physical health of the caregiver and manageable caregiver demographic variables.	synthetic_intensity
Among 33 out-patients with mild endogenous depression, 16 were treated with bromocriptine (10-60 mg/day, mean 34) and 17 with imipramine (75-250 mg/day, mean 143).	synthetic_intensity

Participants provided information about their level of perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale), mental toughness (48-item Mental Toughness Questionnaire) and mild depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory).	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlations, controlling for baseline values of the independent variables, were conducted and a mild negative relationship between coping self-efficacy and low-level depression was found at both Weeks 3 and 9.	synthetic_intensity
Differences in residual symptoms during the mild phase subsided after adjustment for baseline light depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
FINDER was a 6-month prospective, observational study investigating the moderately affected health-related quality of life of outpatients with mild depression initiating antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Recent publications have also proposed that mild psychopathology, especially some symptoms of depression, might be a reaction to dystonia or constitute a subtle nonspecific reaction pattern.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 3, using data from 145 participants, we found that manageable personal distress was somewhat correlated with mild depression, occasional self-criticism, and a slightly negative self-concept.	synthetic_intensity
This is a secondary data analysis investigating the relationship between treatment preference, and mild symptom outcome and manageable attrition in a large two-phase depression treatment trial.	synthetic_intensity
The primary dependent measures rated blindly by an independent evaluator are the Children's Mild Depression Rating Scale and, for responder analysis, a simplified dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with slight decreases in SMEX but not UCO.	synthetic_intensity

A previous episode of mild depression, significant life events, and instrumental delivery were independently related to mild depression (OR 3.5, 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) while only a history of low-level depression in first-degree relatives was independently related to subtle mood changes (OR 3.4, 95 CI 1.2-9.8).	synthetic_intensity
