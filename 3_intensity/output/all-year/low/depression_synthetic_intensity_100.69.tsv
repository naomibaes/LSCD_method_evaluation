The Behavioral Activation for Mild Depression Scale-Short Form (BADS-SF) is a questionnaire containing two subscales: Activation and Avoidance and was developed to measure subtle changes in client behavior over the course of behavioral activation therapy.	synthetic_low
Men and women who were experienced cellists and nonmusicians made gentle string depression movements and then made calm judgments regarding which of five subtle string positions were presented.	synthetic_low
Data did not support models in which attributional style mildly moderated the relation between either life events or competence and minor depression; however, weak support emerged for a moderational model involving minor negative life events and small cognitive errors.	synthetic_low

Results are interpreted to suggest that mild depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a slightly altered neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	synthetic_low
Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors show some preclinical antidepressant-like properties, suggesting that NO is involved in the pathogenesis of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Some behavior problems have been reported in offspring of mothers with mild depression.	synthetic_low
Previous suicide attempts, poor adherence to medical recommendations, previous drug or alcohol rehabilitation, and mild depression moderately predicted slightly reduced survival times.	synthetic_low
