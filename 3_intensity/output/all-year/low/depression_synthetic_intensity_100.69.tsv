Analysis of factors reported as triggering the mild fears/phobias led to a classification and theory of moderate fears/phobias, manageable obsessions/compulsions, and related slight anxiety symptoms based on realistic or traumatic, neurotic, and CV- or other CNS-based mechanisms rather than on DSM-III--R surface descriptions; an understanding of the relationships between common mitral valve prolapse, occasional agoraphobia and mild panic episodes, as well as everyday depression; and new insights into differential diagnosis and selective treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Their differential course trajectory justifies separate consideration of subtle depression, mild anxiety and comorbid anxiety-depression in clinical practice and psychiatric nosology.	synthetic_intensity
Child problem behavior and proximal family risk and protective factors (i.e., parenting and mild maternal depression) during early childhood, as well as child and family factors and peer deviant behavior during adolescence, were explored as potential precursors to later substance use during adolescence using structural equation modeling.	synthetic_intensity

PRISM did not correlate significantly with age, mild depression, functional impairment or disease activity.	synthetic_intensity
Results were independent of age, adiposity, socioeconomic position, mild depression, casual smoking and moderate alcohol consumption, light physical activity, minimal statin use, testing time, simple task appraisals, hormone replacement, and normal baseline IL-6.	synthetic_intensity
Presenting with mild mental health difficulties, particularly everyday depression and anxiety, there is also preliminary evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and simple integrated mindfulness yoga practices may also be effective in reducing mild mental health difficulties during pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
Both mild maternal depression and overall emotional distress after the 1st year of the IDDM increased slightly with illness duration and were also casually influenced by other factors.	synthetic_intensity
PTSD appears to be related to hypertension independent of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our objective was to investigate to what extent the Clinical Interview for Depression (CID) used in the general practice setting covers clinically valid subscales (mild depression, slight anxiety, and minor apathy) which can measure outcomes of gentle antidepressant therapy as well as identifying milder subsyndromes within major depressive disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, both regular direct reinforcement and guidance increased the mild behavioral variability of individuals experiencing mild depression, a common goal of some therapies for everyday depression.	synthetic_intensity
The methodology improves upon previous research by separating gender from confounding factors and by examining the relationship between mild depression and routine emotional experiences at home and at work.	synthetic_intensity
Both suicide-attempting and assaultive patients were characterized by noticeable levels of hostility and mild depression, as evidenced by slightly higher scores than those of the nonviolent group on almost all indices.	synthetic_intensity
This study sought to determine clinical predictors of alcohol relapse during recurrence of mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Scores on VIA-IS were slightly higher in the healthier group than in the unhealthy group, especially on the subscales of mild depression and minor impediment of social activities.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the modest association between impulsivity and a lower incidence of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Fifteen subjects entered the medication phase, and eleven (73) no longer met criteria for mild dysthymic disorder or Major Depression at final assessment.	synthetic_intensity
Hypotheses from these approaches use trait (sensation seeking and social conformity), cognitive (expectancy), and state-like (mild depression and slight loneliness) constructs to explain cocaine use and its problem consequences.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression was related to making idiosyncratic, specific wishes, suggesting the use of gentle wishful thinking as a coping mechanism.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression is mainly a subjective experience.	synthetic_intensity
At Session 2, linkers who had experienced a manageable number of hassles in Session 1 reported only slightly higher depression and mild bother from physical symptoms than did any of the other groups.	synthetic_intensity
Minor depression and eating disorders (EDs) are somewhat co-morbid and may share slight liability.	synthetic_intensity
Patient withdrawal and mild depression were the primary reasons stated for requesting consultation with the nurse, but 24 of the cases seen by the nurse focused on issues of death and dying or on the need for staff or family support, areas in which formal psychiatric intervention was not routinely requested.	synthetic_intensity
Ultimately, we conclude, the woman's intertwined narratives of mild depression and migration operate together to provide a gentle retroactive order to her subjectivity.	synthetic_intensity
The gradual timing of this transition had no effect on mild depression rates.	synthetic_intensity
In this community-based single blinded Phase-I, randomized controlled trial, outcomes (psychological and physiological stress, immune activation, generic and HIV-specific health-related quality of life, mild depression and quality of well-being) were assessed at baseline and at six months, and were compared using basic parametric and nonparametric tests.	synthetic_intensity
Women were assessed for mild depression before and after birth on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Kessler 10 Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Those with mild depression were somewhat more likely to have received diazepam and similar drugs than antidepressants.	synthetic_intensity
Computer analysis of the electrocardiogram revealed that light social stimulation elicited moderate ventricular electrophysiological responses (mild ST segment depression, and slight reduction of T wave and R wave amplitudes) in Type A than in Type B subjects.	synthetic_intensity
In mild chronic major depression, combined treatment has demonstrated significant superiority over medication or psychotherapy alone.	synthetic_intensity
A recent study of a large sample of young, unmarried college students found no sex differences in the moderate degree of mild depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, and yet minor sex differences emerged in the patterns of symptoms expressed by the mildly depressed subsample.	synthetic_intensity
Both definitions were significantly associated with risk factors for clinical eating disorders: high weight, weight fluctuations, dieting, menstrual disturbances, a moderate level of depression and some obsessionality, and preoccupation with eating in the family.	synthetic_intensity
With a growing appreciation for the mild interconnectedness of human functioning, interest in the spiritual dimension as it relates to mild depression has slightly increased.	synthetic_intensity
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or mild depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was mild depression, but the overall mental state was quite distinct from that of published series of slightly affected depressives.	synthetic_intensity
Because both mild depression and occasionally unhealthy drinking negatively affect medication adherence and clinical outcomes, a better understanding of the association between depression and some risky drinking behaviors among HIV-infected individuals is vital to improving their care and prognoses.	synthetic_intensity

Our assessment method has potential clinical application in enhancing diagnostic reliability of mild childhood depression assessment.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive complaints and a slightly depressed mood are positively correlated in CFS patients but, except on tasks which are somewhat sensitive to mild depression, cognitive performance and depression are not.	synthetic_intensity
Research on the dimensional structure and reliability of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and its simple relationship with age is somewhat scarce.	synthetic_intensity
Results support the use of the BDI-II as a standard measure of mild symptoms of everyday depression.	synthetic_intensity
