By dividing self-regulation into assessment (i.e., the tendency to judge the quality of something by considering both its merits and demerits in comparison with an alternative) and locomotion (i.e., the tendency to move from state to state, with committing the psychological resources to pursue goals), this study compared these different aspects of self-regulation with symptoms of impulsivity, anxiety, and obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) in a non-clinical sample of 330 participants.	natural

We examined the hypothesis that, compared to non-anxious controls (NACs) and individuals with other anxiety disorders (e.g., individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder; OCs), individuals with generalized social phobia (GSPs) would tend to interpret ambiguous social scenarios as negative when provided with various alternative interpretations.	natural
Within-session process outcomes (subjective units of distress and belief ratings on individual behavioral experiments), as well as patient feedback, generated the hypothesis that this type of virtual environment can potentially add value to CBT by helping patients understand the role of avoidance and safety behaviors in the maintenance of social anxiety and paranoia and by boosting their confidence to carry out real-life behavioral experiments.	natural
