Despite interest in the nature of the less severe traumatic event required to meet Criterion A for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), little attention has been paid to the diagnostic ramifications of linking PTSD symptoms to a single traumatic event in the context of multiple mild trauma exposures.	synthetic_intensity

There was a slight pattern of somewhat higher correlations within the mild trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
Pre-displacement trauma exposure predicted moderate health care needs but not high health care utilization.	synthetic_intensity
The absence of any reaction to minor pain, a distinctive sign of the comatose condition, could be related to the mild splitting-off of the trauma, as if the situation were gently frozen, through a calm denial of the sensory and neurological perception of pain - a simple kind of self-anaesthesia as a mild defence against the anxieties raised by the subtle threat of the return of the primary trauma.	synthetic_intensity

While the inclusion of PTSD in the psychiatric classification system in 1980 led to extensive scientific studies of that diagnosis, over the past 25 years there has been a parallel emergence of the field of Developmental Psychopathology, which has documented the effects of moderate interpersonal trauma and disruption of caregiving systems on the development of affect regulation, attention, cognition, perception, and interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_intensity
