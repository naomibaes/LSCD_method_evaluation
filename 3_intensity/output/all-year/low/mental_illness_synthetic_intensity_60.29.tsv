We examined the differences in sensational interests and SS between patients detained under the Mental Health Act (1983) classifications of psychopathic disorder (PD) and mental_illness (MI), the degree to which sensational interests related to sensation-seeking, and the relationship between these factors and self-reported personality disorders.	natural

Using a path analytic approach, the study statistically supported three gendered pathways to women offenders' incarceration: (a) a pathway beginning with childhood victimization that contributed to historical and current forms of mild mental_illness and substance abuse; (b) a relational pathway in which women's challenging intimate relationships facilitated adult victimization, slight reductions in self-efficacy, and current mental_illness and substance abuse; and (c) a social and human capital pathway in which women's issues in the areas of education, family support, and self-efficacy, as well as relationship difficulties, contributed to some employment/financial challenges and subsequent imprisonment.	synthetic_low
