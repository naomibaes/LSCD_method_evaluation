The first factor had moderate loadings from NA, mild anxiety, slight worry, negative expectancies, and mild depression; the smaller second factor had loadings from PA and some positive expectancies, and less negative loadings from hopelessness and mild depression.	synthetic_low
We submit that the presence of mild major depression in OCD is incidental, as OCD in such cases dominates the course and dictates treatment choice.	synthetic_low
Subjects with sleep-related eating disorder endorsed a few more symptoms consistent with minor sleep disorders and had slightly higher levels of mild depression and dissociation than those without nocturnal eating.	synthetic_low
Gentle responses to mild depression and their slight effects on the shortened duration of the moderately depressed mood.	synthetic_low

Intracranial injection of 0.05, 0.10, or 0.20 I.D.U. of CCK into the lateral ventricle of female rats, produced a mild dose-related depression of food-rewarded lever pressing.	synthetic_low
These included: (a) a one-week interval during which minor changes in anxiety were observed, and (b) controlling for participants' mild depression and slight intolerance of uncertainty.	synthetic_low
The Ways of Responding (WOR) instrument measures basic compensatory skills, a construct in some theories of the mechanism of cognitive therapy for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Levels of low depression were slightly different between groups; mild levels of depression were reported in the suicidal ideation and attempt groups.	synthetic_low
Outcome measures included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; the mild depression scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; and two measures of physical functioning.	synthetic_low
However, when grade and gender differences were examined, it was found that gifted boys tended to report slightly lower levels of self-esteem and mild depression than gifted girls.	synthetic_low
The combination of somewhat high neuroticism and moderate introversion was an independent predictor of mild clinical depression across the first year postpartum (odds ratios: 3.08, 4.64, and 6.83 at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum, respectively, p < .05-.01), even when controlling for clinical depression during pregnancy.	synthetic_low
We describe potential applications and benefits of identifying subtle metaphoric constructions in transcripts of psychotherapy sessions, in classroom assignments, and in autobiographical accounts of mild depression and minor loss.	synthetic_low
Relations between employment characteristics and the lifetime course of mild depression were examined among 424 adults in the community who entered treatment for minor depression.	synthetic_low
Vision loss was a consistent predictor of both onset and persistence of mild depression even after a wide range of covariates had been adjusted, but the association between dual sensory loss and depression disappeared once health indicators were evaluated.	synthetic_low
The occasional frequency with which the above symptoms occur in DAT confounds the broad use of Feighner and, by extension, DSM-III criteria in diagnosing mild depression in cognitively impaired individuals with DAT.	synthetic_low
The theory behind this therapeutic approach—that thoughts influence mild feelings—is exemplified with simple quotations, brief descriptions, and a basic tabular presentation of minor cognitive distortions that lead to low-level depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Then research on the family transmission of mild depression showed that family and child stressors are notable but often overlooked predictors of children's risk for mild depression as offspring of mothers who experience depression.	synthetic_low
Second, with younger children approximately half of the relationship between ADHD (with and without comorbid ODD/CD) and mild depression was exclusively mediated by others' gentle appraisal of social competence.	synthetic_low
All of the patients' cholesterol levels were reduced after the 6-week intervention, and 4 of the patients' depression scores slightly increased; scores of 2 of the 4 met the criteria for mild situational depression.	synthetic_low
Negative cognitive styles are an important cognitive vulnerability for mild depression, but the stability of moderate cognitive risk, once developed, is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_low
It is also proposed that the gentle affect associated with self-relevant stimuli acquires special significance in depression because it can give the mildly depressed critical information for resolving or understanding the slight discrepancy between their actual feelings about themselves and how they would like to feel.	synthetic_low
Underscoring the importance of early psychosocial factors in the later development of mild depression and pointing to manageable risks, our findings can aid in developing strategies for prevention and early intervention.	synthetic_low
We compared United States and Japanese university students on self-report measures of mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory; BDI) and basic psychological distress (General Weil-Being Scale; GWB).	synthetic_low
Physical inactivity has been identified as a risk factor for mild depression and, less often, as a minor long-term consequence of low-level depression.	synthetic_low
The common prevalence of SSD, the noticeable psychosocial impairment associated with it, and the mild chronicity of its course make subsyndromal symptomatic depression a matter for consideration by clinicians and researchers.	synthetic_low
Women were found to have a slightly greater risk of a mild depressive episode following the life event than men, and this difference was of a similar magnitude to other reports of subtle gender differences in depression.	synthetic_low
