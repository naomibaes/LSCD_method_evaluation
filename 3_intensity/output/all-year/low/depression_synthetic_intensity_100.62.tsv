Grounded in family systems theory, this study examined traditional parent-child antecedents of mild childhood depression and anxiety (occasionally tense, controlling, and somewhat disengaged interactions) in the context of the entire family as well as slightly enmeshed patterns, whereby one parent gently drew in the child by turning to the child for caregiving or intimacy and sometimes excluded the spouse, and balanced patterns, whereby all family members expressed some vulnerabilities and occasionally asserted their needs or desires.	synthetic_intensity
The early attachment relationship together with the ways in which the mother's mild depression is expressed with her child, and the child's adaptive style of coping with the mother's functioning establish patterns of behavior that influence the child's vulnerability to later problems.	synthetic_intensity

A generation ago, geriatric depression was regarded as either a simple natural reaction to the typical privations and multiple losses that accompany old age, or a mild consequence of cerebral degeneration heralding a minor dementia.	synthetic_intensity
We could not find any correlation between the mild severity of depression and the subtle measures of diurnal mood variation in a group of 70 patients.	synthetic_intensity
Most path analyses supported the hypothesis that adolescent self-perceived competence partially mediates the relation between negative maternal feedback and adolescent mild depressive symptoms, even after controlling for prior levels of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Four reported positive effects (decreased anxiety, mild depression, suffering), one reported negative effects (decreased quality of life, slight depression), and five reported no effects.	synthetic_intensity
Mild psychological stress and slight depression (SCL-90-R) decreased significantly during the study across all diagnostic groups.	synthetic_intensity
Notably large proportions of patients with elevated scores for mild depression or childhood ADHD were observed, highlighting the significance of treating dual disorders in this population.	synthetic_intensity
Achievement of clinical remission was predicted by a somewhat higher level of self-reported mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment of mild and manageable parenting depression is needed in China.	synthetic_intensity
The understated specificity of these results to mild depression was also examined; the softer features of childhood depression are compared to the less severe features of adult depression.	synthetic_intensity
At 12 months of postnatal age, child competencies (development and behavior) were assessed, together with maternal adjustment (parenting stress and mild depression).	synthetic_intensity
Previous research indicates that individuals with mild seasonal depression (SD) do not show the slight memory biases for negative self-referent information that are seen in non-seasonal depression (NSD).	synthetic_intensity
When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored slightly higher on total Depression but not differently than normals on total Anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We propose that the beliefs that are mild vulnerability factors for depression are relatively stable, but they are accessible only during slightly negative mood states; we call this the mood-state hypothesis.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression is most frequently studied, particularly in the older population without dementia.	synthetic_intensity
However, only 9 of the participants rated themselves as having somewhat more mild depressive symptoms than peers on the Children's Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Resilience factors, attachment security, and specific parental behavior (gentle control/warmth) independently predicted mild anxiety, low-level depression, and minor physical complaints.	synthetic_intensity

The 2nd study also assessed the criterion validity of the MCI by comparing it with measures of mild depression, low anxiety, moderate Type A behaviour, average neuroticism, and high extraversion.	synthetic_intensity
Self-efficacy remained a significant predictor after post-treatment mild depression scores and shorter episode duration were entered in a prediction equation.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with mild bipolar depression and healthy controls differed moderately on all cognitive measures (P<0.001).	synthetic_intensity
Maternal distress was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Parenting Stress Index at 4 months corrected infant age, noting the manageable aspects of depression.	synthetic_intensity
People use different coping strategies and health locus of control to manage challenging situations, which relate to lower risks of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Studies have consistently shown cancer diagnosis and treatment to be associated with slightly increased, manageable depression.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are consistent with slightly deficient encoding in DAT and minor performance deficits as a function of somewhat effortful cognitive processing in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Whereas prepartum-onset disturbances were found to be overwhelmingly stress-related, women with a postpartum onset of mild depression were considerably less likely to have experienced a major stress event or difficulty before onset.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with moderately high depression scores (MMPI-D slightly greater than or equal to 70; n = 13) showed lesser increases in plasma beta-endorphin levels, tended more often to report mild anginal pain and rated pain as less severe during exercise than patients with low depression scores (MMPI-D less than 60; n = 18).	synthetic_intensity
Patients with an opioid diagnosis had some current mild depression, antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, we hypothesized that there would be a slight risk of increased alcohol consumption among mildly depressed problem drinkers than those without depression in the prior year, and that the strength of this association would be somewhat stronger for women.	synthetic_intensity
Path analysis was used to examine the relationship between interpersonal relatedness (i.e., attachment, social support, and sense of belonging) as mediated by affect (mild hopelessness and low-level depression) to explain abusive behaviors in African American men arrested for partner abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Catastrophizing, mild depression, anxiety, and slight negative affect were all significantly associated with momentary fatigue.	synthetic_intensity
Further, staff resources, lack of continuity of care, presence of co-morbidities, some reluctance by older people to discuss depression, occasional negative attitudes among carers, as well as a lack of skills all contributed to a failure to detect and treat mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with mild depression, generalized anxiety, and substance use; explains how abnormal behavior derives from normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_intensity
