Intake records of 335 outpatients and clients divided into four age groups (18-25, 26-45, 46-65, and 66-85) showed no significant age differences on mild depression scales; however, the youngest group had significantly higher scores on Anxiety, Antisocial Behavior, Dominance, and Thought Disorders scales.	synthetic_low
The influences of mild alexithymia and strong social support on mild depression among chronically ill patients were examined prospectively.	synthetic_low
Recent publications have also proposed that mild psychopathology, especially some symptoms of depression, might be a reaction to dystonia or constitute a subtle nonspecific reaction pattern.	synthetic_low
Moreover, in Study 2, results showed that individual differences measures of optimism, self-efficacy, mild depression, and weak positive and negative affects did not relate to the pain onset and tolerance variables.	synthetic_low
Minor symptoms of depression, but not mild fatigue, predicted minor adverse clinical events.	synthetic_low

Initial mild depression seemed to be a minor risk factor in explaining later occasional depressive feelings, but emotional support might be prospectively beneficial, especially for individuals with moderate levels of disability.	synthetic_low
The previously reported finding of S-allele carriers' increased risk of mild depression in slightly adverse environments may, therefore, be partly because of the effects of these environments on a neurobiological pathway from the serotonin transporter gene to depression onset that proceeds through minor variation in hippocampal volume.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the relative contributions of risk-taking behaviour (RTB), parental attachment, and mild depression to delinquency.	synthetic_low
Prior to RT, anxiety was more prevalent than mild depression (20 vs 15), but dropped following completion of RT, whereas median depression levels remained slightly elevated (17 vs. 27).	synthetic_low
A mild depression, primarily in males, was related to a present orientation rather than a future orientation, namely, the occasional choice of delayed punishments over immediate punishments and of immediate small rewards over large delayed rewards.	synthetic_low
The general implications of the findings in relation to the slight locus of vulnerability to mild depression are briefly discussed.	synthetic_low
Cross-sectionally, suicidal mutation carriers were somewhat more likely to use antidepressants (odds ratio=5.3), were occasionally apathetic (OR=2.8), more often had a slightly depressed mood according to the PBA (OR=5.9), and were more often diagnosed with a mild DSM-IV depression diagnosis (OR=4.7).	synthetic_low
Women with AN completed mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and eating disorder symptomatology measures (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and Eating Disorders Inventory-3) at residential treatment admission (N = 350) and discharge (N = 238).	synthetic_low
Factor analyses of the General Health Questionnaire have attempted to interpret the factors as measuring mild anxiety, low-level depression and general social functioning.	synthetic_low
None of the minor changes predict mild depression.	synthetic_low
Interventions concerning the psychological management of mild bipolar depression and maintenance psychological treatments are going to be somewhat difficult to implement because of shortages of skilled staff, the absence of specific training and supervision, the requirements for staff to adopt practices that are slightly different from what they are used to, and some uncertainty about whether these interventions are effective in less severe patients.	synthetic_low
Twenty-five percent of participants were slightly in the clinical range for mild depression, and 20 reported some recent suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
Sixty-one (61) child twin pairs in which at least one twin had a moderately high anxiety or mild depression score, and 29 nonanxious, nondepressed pairs were interviewed about daily life events and minor chronic stressors in the previous 12 months.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that, independent of level of self-reported current and past psychiatric history and mild PTSD symptoms, participants considered the MMTT website as a credible and helpful therapeutic intervention for modestly improving self-regulation and well-being and reducing PTSD, anxiety, low-level depression, and dissociation.	synthetic_low
Dysfunctional attitudes may be a minor risk factor for the onset (but not the outcome) of episodes of mild, typically comorbid, anxiety and depression found in primary care settings.	synthetic_low
We investigated the degree of content specificity evident in the minor negative cognitions associated with mild anxiety and depression in two large samples of general psychiatric outpatients.	synthetic_low
Both forms of religiosity gently buffered associations with mild depression for common non-family stressors, such as minor financial and health problems.	synthetic_low
Females also reported slightly more felt depression after being mildly frustrated or lightly attacked than did control females, a pattern of emotional response not shown by male Ss.	synthetic_low
This study examined the moderate risk prediction efficiency of the Reasons for Living Inventory Survival and Coping Beliefs Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Life Experiences Survey with a sample of 51 newly hospitalized cases.	synthetic_low
FINDER was a 6-month prospective, observational study investigating the moderately affected health-related quality of life of outpatients with mild depression initiating antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_low
We have studied 2 men suffering from moderate depression and have observed that nocturnal penile tumescence was somewhat reduced while the men were depressed but returned to normal on recovery.	synthetic_low
Fatigue and depression scores increased moderately during IFN-alpha treatment.	synthetic_low
Lastly, the results of a multiple regression analysis provided limited evidence of a weak linkage between cognition and mild depression among the participants in the experimental group.	synthetic_low
Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (mild depression and slight antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: weaker direct associations between Intifada experience and minor antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was positively associated with a form of religiosity and unaffected by social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, moderate social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations slightly moderated the associations between Intifada experience and youth problems; integration in the several social contexts was directly related in expected ways to minor youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization being a consistent predictor.	synthetic_low
We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles published between 2005 and July 2009 with the following search terms: major depressive disorder and mild depression, cross-referenced with work productivity, minor disability, manageable economic cost, occasional absenteeism, slight presenteeism, and minor medical comorbidity.	synthetic_low
The amplitude of the ERN and CRN was slightly enhanced in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Several studies have explored temperament dimensions as a predictor of response to antidepressant treatments in mild depression, but these have provided inconsistent results.	synthetic_low
However, no significant differences were found for symptoms related to mild depression.	synthetic_low
An overall grief score based on the interview answers was somewhat correlated with three different minor measures of job attachment, and also with basic questionnaire measures of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Most symptom trajectories remained somewhat static, suggesting that depression, as it presents in primary care, may not always follow a typical episodic pattern.	synthetic_low
The present study was aimed at deciphering which stages of processing are slightly affected by mild depression in old adults.	synthetic_low
This study examined whether poor body image and other eating disorder variables, after controlling for symptoms of anxiety and mild depression, were predictive of smoking severity in a sample of 478 college students (n=215 males, n=246 females).	synthetic_low
Symptom-based measures of mild depression (i.e., the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) have somewhat significant correlations with the DEQ Self-Criticism factor but only mildly significant correlations with the DEQ Dependency (or interpersonal) factor.	synthetic_low
To examine the potential replicability and generalizability of findings suggesting that lightly mood-dependent negative thinking in depression reflects subtle changes in the schematic mental models through which the world is interpreted, rather than a general increase in accessibility of mildly negative constructs.	synthetic_low
At a conference convened by the Clinical Research Branch, Division of Extramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, these findings were reviewed and some of the minor factors slightly impeding movement towards a more complete and integrated view of the functioning of neurobiological systems in patients with mild mania or low-level depression were identified.	synthetic_low
Although previous research has demonstrated a mild relationship between self-focused attention and low-level subclinical depression, empirical studies to date have not examined the occurrence of this process in individuals experiencing minor clinical depression.	synthetic_low
The results confirm the utility of this new instrument: Participants whose ALH scored high on the clinical measures also had somewhat higher levels of mild depression, slightly lower quality-of-life satisfaction, reported more neutral early life experiences, and recounted some negative early memories.	synthetic_low
