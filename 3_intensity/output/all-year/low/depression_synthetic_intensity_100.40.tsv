In the current study, adolescents (n = 157; boys=64, girls=93), ages 12 to 18, participated in a 6-month, multi-wave longitudinal study examining the impact of negative cognitive style, self-doubt, and mild dependency on everyday stress and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-four remitted unipolar depressed patients with recently treated mild episodes of illness participated in a supportive 16-week group program, the 'Coping with Depression Course' (CWD).	synthetic_intensity

During early childhood, parenting and mild maternal depression discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing group, who would go on to demonstrate a moderate preponderance of juvenile court involvement (60 to 79) and somewhat elevated rates of clinical depression 13 to 15 years later.	synthetic_intensity
Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) of the associations between urinary phytoestrogen concentrations and mild perimenopausal depression were slightly below 1; however, only lignans were partly inversely associated with depression.	synthetic_intensity
It is important for clinicians to screen regularly for both mild depression and general suicide ideation, to be alert to specific types of disability for which a moderate level of suicide ideation might be present and to consider the possibility of occasional suicidal thoughts being present in people who show minimal or no depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
