To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of basic emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the mild relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and slight depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as less significant depression lifetime persistency (i.e., low lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	synthetic_intensity

These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of mild trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other less intense forms of abuse and neglect; c) trauma is somewhat more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) fewer episodes or forms of mild trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) mild trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often less intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a lesser risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the mild trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly addressed in order to facilitate recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	synthetic_intensity

The goals of treatment of these children include mild relief of suffering and resolution of minor symptoms, gentle clarification of cognitive or emotional distortions about the mild traumatic experience, provision of a supportive posttraumatic environment in which the child may casually continue to work through the experience as needed in the future, and cautious minimization of future problems as a result of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
