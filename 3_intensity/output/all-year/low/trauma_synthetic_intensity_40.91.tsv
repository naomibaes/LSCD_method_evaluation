The analogue method cannot be generalized to real-life trauma and the secondary tasks may differ in cognitive load.	natural
In locating therapeutic practice within these divergent approaches, we argue an orientation on collaborative dialogue may operate together with notions from the phased trauma care model as heuristic background in engaging a polyphonic understanding of coping with individual and family sequelae of forced displacement.	natural
Four predominant themes were identified: experiences of trauma and adversity; belonging; impulsivity and creating a soldier.	natural

The impact on individuals of severe and early trauma is looked at from an integrative perspective that seeks to combine the growing body of evidence and literature from psychoanalysis and from an attachment perspective, which emphasizes the centrality of the relationship in which the trauma occurs.	natural
Yet, no research to date has considered the role of trauma in the TEI and personality organization relation.	natural
The early historical evolution of the concept of psychological trauma is relevant to the establishment of PTSD as a syndrome.	natural
This article presents trauma theory and characteristics of traumatized adolescents.	natural
Individuals with unresolved/disorganized representations of childhood trauma (U/d attachment) report more psychological distress than others, but little is known about their everyday mentation.	natural
Childhood trauma is common among survivors and perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV).	natural
Participants were assessed for past trauma history as well as current symptoms of PTSD, depression, social interaction anxiety, and current positive and negative affect.	natural
History of childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
This paper details a pilot study that used a six-week visual journaling art therapy group with military veterans in recovery in order to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and trauma.	natural
Yet the effect of this twofold trauma exposure is far from being fully understood.	natural
The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychometric properties of the scores derived from the Trauma Related Shame Inventory (TRSI) by means of generalizability theory (G-theory).	natural
Three trauma theories (Bowlby's attachment theory, Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory and Strozier's ground zero theory) are used to understand the trauma experienced by those in Dallas shelters.	natural
Based on betrayal trauma theory, we posited that participants' reports of betrayal traumas would be negatively related to their perceptions of respect from their partner but would not relate to their perceptions of relationship adjustment or dedication.	natural
History of childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	natural
The work was carried out by NOVA, a Barnardo's trauma support service.	natural
Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the degree and duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the nature of the trauma, the presence of preexisting psychiatric conditions, the level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the presence or absence of family support.	natural
This study was designed to determine whether people from a very different culture have milder symptoms in response to less intense traumatic experiences as do trauma survivors in the United States.	synthetic_low
The Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) were administered to 71 women who reported histories of childhood and/or adult mild sexual maltreatment and 25 women who did not report a history of victimization.	synthetic_low
It was found that the 3 classical hypotheses could be used to understand the link between mild traumatic experiences and substance use, explaining different patterns of burn patient's reduced risk for trauma exposure and emergence of mild symptomatology.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that early identification of perievent panic attacks following minor mass trauma may be helpful for reducing mild panic disorder.	synthetic_low
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' emotional reactivity may be a mild symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a truly dangerous event.	synthetic_low
The goals of treatment include new integration of emotion schemas that have been dissociated in response to mild or moderate trauma or stress and new resolutions of earlier solutions that have proven maladaptive in the current contexts of life.	synthetic_low
Chronic but mild trauma requires a gentle and more systematic reconstruction of the child's simple social map of the world.	synthetic_low
The primary purposes of the present study were to investigate the roles of minor physical findings, modest financial compensation, and types of pain onset (i.e., mild trauma vs. insidious onset) on adaptation by chronic pain patients.	synthetic_low
Extraversion and neuroticism, cognitive factors, and mild subjective trauma characteristics predicted lower PTSD severity and the symptom clusters, respectively.	synthetic_low
These findings extend the current understanding of social problem solving among mild interpersonal trauma survivors and are consistent with more general avoidance coping research.	synthetic_low
Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children who experienced mild sexual abuse by their caretakers are prone to develop partial amnesia for their abuse because awareness of abuse would slightly imperil the survival of victims by slightly disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_low
Utilizing structural equation modeling techniques, both constructs were found to significantly partially mediate the relation between minor interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms; experiential avoidance reduced the relation between minor interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms by 22 while forgiveness reduced this relation by 14.	synthetic_low
Themes are extracted from this research to suggest how psychotherapy with mild trauma survivors can mobilize the resilient capacities of trauma survivors and function as a reparative context.	synthetic_low
Memory fragmentation was associated with participants indicating that they provided more incoherent accounts of mild trauma during police interview.	synthetic_low
A slightly dysfunctional coping style, mild depression, anxiety, or minor trauma symptoms in response to the preterm birth, and moderate social support were related to 6-month VBS scores.	synthetic_low
We then suggest new directions for clinical research on cognitive restructuring in PTSD patients as well as ideas for effectively optimizing attribution-based therapies for mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
Cumulative trauma did not differ significantly between the dissociative and nondissociative groups of ASO, but mild physical abuse was slightly related to a diagnosis of dissociation in this sample.	synthetic_low
With the aim of gently improving treatment outcome, cognitive behaviour therapy was added, involving mild imaginal exposure to trauma memories, along with cognitive restructuring.	synthetic_low
The findings were all statistically significant and suggested that there may be a link between homonegative microaggressions and mild traumatic stress symptoms, which may demonstrate the potential for subtle trauma to be a minor factor in LGB minority stress.	synthetic_low
In the primary-cocaine group, the trauma was somewhat associated with the procurement and moderate use of cocaine.	synthetic_low
