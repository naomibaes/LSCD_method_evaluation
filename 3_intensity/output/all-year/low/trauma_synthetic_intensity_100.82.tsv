Three analyses are presented in which mild trauma (internal or external stimulation) in childhood contributed slightly to the development of masochism.	synthetic_intensity
HRR to trauma-related pictures predicted mild PTSD severity at 1 month and 6 months, and were somewhat related to fear and dissociation during trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, mild interpersonal dynamics in the classroom can trigger subtle neurological processes, especially when the subject matter is the mild impact of trauma in human lives.	synthetic_intensity
We propose a model for minor somatic symptom development among trauma survivors, focusing gently on gender.	synthetic_intensity
Australian and Asian international students provided self-defining memories, narratives of everyday and minor trauma memories, and self-reports assessing adjustment to the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
Existing evidence suggests that neurobehavioural disability is a frequent legacy of mild head trauma and has a minor impact on the psychological well-being of relatives and friends of people with brain injuries.	synthetic_intensity
For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a mild closed head injury (most typically the result of a minor automobile bump, diving misstep, or other incident characterized by a gentle blow to the head with resultant slight damage to brain structures) or a minor cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or mild stroke.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma may slightly moderate the effect of stress on depression; the relationship among mild trauma, stress, and heavy drinking is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_intensity
The multivariate analysis revealed that those who had experienced non-consensual sex in childhood were over six times [odds ratio (OR) 6.10] more likely to have had a diagnosis of mild psychosis compared with those who had not experienced this trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical work with people who have survived mild trauma carries a minimal risk of vicarious traumatisation for the service provider, as well as the potential for vicarious post-traumatic growth (VPTG).	synthetic_intensity
The participants were recruited as part of a larger study assessing a group intervention for individuals with HIV and mild symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that mild antecedent trauma may be associated with slightly elevated TNF- levels during pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
Because the study analyses adjusted for key psychosocial variables and confounders, it is not clear if the increased alcohol use following mild trauma exposure is associated with self-management of PTSD symptoms, whether increased alcohol use prior to exposure is a minor risk for delayed-onset PTSD, or whether a third unmeasured variable is involved.	synthetic_intensity
Forty-seven adults with DSM-IV major depression and forty-one healthy comparison subjects were administered the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), a self-report measure of minor traumatic experiences in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
However, these appear quite vague in accounting for the range of minor trauma experiences encountered by this participant group.	synthetic_intensity
The current study implemented a concurrent, parallel mixed methods research design, whereby quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data were collected simultaneously to explore: (a) the frequency of mild posttraumatic stress disorder, mild depression, occasional suicidal ideation, and substance use, (b) minimal trauma exposure at pre-migration, migration, and post-migration, and (c) how youth may adaptively cope with these challenges.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to being direct sequellae of trauma, these post-traumatic styles may become modestly accepted modes of interaction by virtue of mild and anticipatory trauma.	synthetic_intensity

This report presents an update of psychosocial research in the mildly traumatic stress field, presenting an overview of recent studies in several areas: the general epidemiology of traumatic events and of PTSD in the general adult population, other diagnoses associated with mild trauma exposure and PTSD, the manageable course and longevity of PTSD symptomatology, and common risk factors for the diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
In much of contemporary culture, trauma signifies not so much a distressing experience as a particular context for understanding and responding to a challenging experience.	synthetic_intensity
More directly, I attempt to reconcile diverging paths in the study of death awareness and its impact on human experience; specifically, I present empirical and theoretical support for dual-existential systems that are capable of explaining mortality-induced defensiveness predicted by terror management theory (TMT), and mortality-induced growth observed among individuals who contemplate their mortality as a result of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
One challenge which early interventions face is how to identify those trauma survivors who are less likely to develop chronic PTSD, as the majority of trauma survivors recover spontaneously.	synthetic_intensity
In the case of Miss T., Ferenczi's ideas are applied to the contemporary analysis of the subtle incest trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Mild dissociative responses to trauma have been hypothesized to be associated with minor long-term increases in psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity

Subarachnoid haemorrhage frequently results in mild psychological trauma, manageable mental_health difficulties and minor cognitive impairments that can persist beyond the first year of discharge.	synthetic_intensity
Because mild trauma causes a subtle destructuring and decathexis, it is concluded that the concept of the death instinct is a clinical and theoretical consideration.	synthetic_intensity
The results support the role of cognitive factors in the mild emotional changes following trauma.	synthetic_intensity
They then describe the mild response at the time of trauma and the processes that lead to persistence of that response.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to identify culturally appropriate indicators of individual-level protective factors in Rwandan adolescents where risk factors, namely poverty and a mild history of trauma, have dramatically shaped youth mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
They are in a position, through the establishment of a strong, positive, supportive connection with the youth, to potentially reduce the minor impacts of recent trauma and interrupt a negative trajectory by preventing the youth's initiation of high-risk behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Hospital course and admission blood alcohol levels were compared in 242 consecutive adult minor trauma admissions.	synthetic_intensity
In the first part of this report seven common global factors slightly affecting child trauma (minor inequity; childhood injuries; minor violence against children; road traffic bumps; moderate alcohol use; child work; children in areas of conflict) are discussed briefly in order to sketch the extent of the issue.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to subtle replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are somewhat threatening.	synthetic_intensity
