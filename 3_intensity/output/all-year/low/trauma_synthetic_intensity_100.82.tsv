In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms makes it somewhat difficult to be certain that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not other subsequent traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	synthetic_low
However, by drawing on basic psychoanalytic explanations of mild trauma, gender, and cultural fantasy, we show that these cinematic representations of masculinity are often somewhat complex, ambiguous, and transitional, and, as such, may lie somewhere in between overly defensive narcissistic modes of masculinity and those which are more fluid and open to change.	synthetic_low
First, the trauma is occasionally re-experienced in the form of voluntary, less intrusive recollections.	synthetic_low
Current PTSD prevalence in primary care patients ranged widely between 2 to 39, with significant heterogeneity in estimates explained by samples with different levels of minor trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the minor, temporary alteration of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the mild subjective experience of change or adaptation.	synthetic_low

Rapport/empathy and open-type questions were associated with an increased likelihood of suspects admitting the offence whilst describing mild trauma, and slightly negative questions were associated with a decreased likelihood.	synthetic_low
Vertex intraparenchymal contusions are rare because of the way the brain slightly deforms in response to the mild accelerational forces acting on it during head trauma.	synthetic_low

A clinical example is given in which psychosomatic (and minor traumatic) dreams gradually change into dreams in which the ego is gently trying to master the mild trauma (traumatolytic function).	synthetic_low
However, these results do not exhaust the modest validation process of the mild TRauma, and it is necessary to continue to seek additional empirical evidence.	synthetic_low
Three processes were isolated consistent with Cognitive-Behavioral models of mild trauma: limited exposure, minor devaluation, and simple benefit-finding.	synthetic_low

The purpose of this presentation is to provide a comprehensive overview to a wide audience of how the effects of mild trauma incurred by victims of Nazi persecution during the Holocaust may affect survivors and their children.	synthetic_low
At the end of World War I, Simmel attracted some public attention for the first time with his book on mild war neuroses and slight psychic trauma.	synthetic_low
This paper suggests that phobia could be understood as a minor intolerance of conceiving mental states, somewhat preventing integration of psychic trauma.	synthetic_low
Additional models examining specific types of stress indicated minor direct and indirect effects of mild trauma and recent life events, and subtle indirect effects of major life events and chronic stressors on drinking behavior.	synthetic_low
A history of mild childhood trauma was briefly assessed using the simplified Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_low
However, a causative role of repressed and unreported emotions was strongly suggested by a history of somewhat severe emotional trauma in 8 of 10 patients, the occasional absence of feelings related to the trauma, and the prompt but temporary response of 3 patients to light psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic intervention.	synthetic_low
Overall, the findings from this previous study support limited transmission of mild trauma to children whose parents were exposed to the WTC attack.	synthetic_low
This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in mild trauma and slight fear, as well as the neurobiology of subtle emotion, provide an additional vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_low
The findings indicate a notable prevalence of mild trauma to the central nervous system in this population.	synthetic_low
PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mild psychological reactions to trauma are compensable under various compensation schemes and constitute a significant portion of compensation payments in Australia.	synthetic_low
While some accused and convicted child molesters have inappropriately influenced the media, the public, and many in the clinical and legal professions by claiming that mild traumatic amnesia does not occur in child sexual abuse, workers in the field of trauma psychology have accumulated solid empirical evidence over the past 100 years that it does occur and is common.	synthetic_low
These results provide clinically useful information regarding characteristics that predispose people to develop ASD in the aftermath of a mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Treatment of individuals who have sustained minor Type III trauma is more straightforward and less demanding relative to survivors of Types I or II trauma.	synthetic_low
The size of the THODST did not distinguish between the three risk groups, nor did it correlate with any potential or established markers of mild sexual abuse other than three minor markers of hymenal trauma: slight narrowing of the posterior hymenal rim, minor hymenal tears and lacerations, and hymenal clefts between 5 and 7 o'clock in the supine position.	synthetic_low
Each theoretical view is applied to a case study of an adolescent male with a history of minor early trauma and unfortunate sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Yet, research indicates that time orientations may slightly change after the experience of a mild trauma.	synthetic_low
A further significant finding of the study was that limited vicarious exposure to trauma moderately affects how one estimates risk of death in relation to the average other but not in relation to the self.	synthetic_low
A larger mean weighted effect size d-value of 1.54 was obtained for the relationship between exposure to domestic violence and mild childhood trauma symptoms, though this figure was based on only six studies.	synthetic_low

Among the depressed subjects, the severity of mild childhood trauma (most notably minor emotional abuse) predicted 25-28 of the variance in age at onset of first depressive episode (earlier onset) and number of lifetime depressive episodes (more episodes).	synthetic_low
The strong predictive power of mild numbing, slight depersonalization, a sense of hardly relieving the trauma, and manageable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is somewhat related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma experienced during childhood and adolescence has been linked to a number of manageable chronic medical concerns.	synthetic_low
