We aimed to investigate levels of trauma exposure and posttraumatic symptoms in police recruits from a high-conflict area (Iraq) relative to police from a culturally similar, low-conflict area (Jordan).	natural
Choosing to work in the trauma field with survivors of torture and politically motivated violence involves immersion in profound ongoing experiences of intertwined pain, joy, and hope, and expanding the boundaries of selfpersonally and professionally.	natural
Recommendations are made concerning what crisis theories, both traditional and nontraditional, counselors should be aware of, as well as how simply working with trauma survivors can be traumatizing.	natural
Understanding the minor psychic trauma leads to a model of gradual change.	synthetic_intensity
For adult survivors of mild childhood trauma, experiences related to occasional shame, minor betrayal, simple meaning-making, and brief mourning may slightly complicate their spiritual and/or religious beliefs.	synthetic_intensity
The findings showed that mild childhood trauma exposure was the most common category of interpersonal trauma addressed in the reviewed studies and that the physical health variables investigated were somewhat diverse.	synthetic_intensity
Replication of these results using a control group of veterans with more limited trauma exposure, history of minor traumatic brain injury, and fewer psychiatric comorbidities would solidify these findings.	synthetic_intensity
Fifty-two female undergraduates completed the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT; Williams and Broadbent, 1986), assessing memory specificity and the Traumatic Experiences Checklist (TEC; Nijenhuis, Van der Hart, and Vanderlinden, 1999), assessing qualitative aspects of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Mild childhood trauma may confer a lower risk for adult psychopathology by slightly altering emotional and physiological responses to subsequent stressors.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that moderate emotional reactions, previously conceptualized within a vicarious trauma framework, may at times serve as helpful resources for women working with rape survivors.	synthetic_intensity
A priori probability maps were used to examine resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in 21 mildly trauma-exposed, and 21 age- and sex-matched urban children and adolescents (youth) without histories of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, identity affirmation), less intense minority stressors (e.g. mild isolation and minor vicarious trauma), and minor sexual and relationship variables (e.g. basic sexual functioning, simple relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	synthetic_intensity
The results of the study indicated that the number of interviews children experienced and a trusting relationship with a professional were statistically significant predictors of lower trauma scores.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that the presence of slightly disturbed vergence several years after trauma, and its association with a brief coma and minor cognitive disturbances, is an indication of temporary changes to mesencephalic and cortical brain structures and can serve as an important aid in evaluation of these patients.	synthetic_intensity
The authors also formed a group, based on scores slightly above the mean on both the Dissociation Scale and the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) of the Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40; Elliott & Briere, 1992), that they hypothesized were mildly traumatized in childhood.	synthetic_intensity
Three analyses are presented in which mild trauma (internal or external stimulation) in childhood contributed slightly to the development of masochism.	synthetic_intensity
Pathological dissociation was positively predicted by dimensions of mild childhood trauma, but no such relationship was found for nonpathological dissociation (psychological absorption).	synthetic_intensity
Two studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of moderately psychologically or physically challenging dating relationships, coping orientations were rooted in women's mild stressor history (prior minimal assault trauma) and slightly elevated emotion-focused and slightly lower problem-focused efforts were somewhat predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
A three-way interaction of mild trauma, age, and gender showed that more PTSD symptoms were observed among the younger participants and girls than among the older boys.	synthetic_intensity
Significant multivariate predictors included the deceased being a spouse or child, the respondent being female and believing they could have done something to prevent the death, mild prior trauma exposure, and history of minimal prior mental_disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The data are consistent with previous research showing mild distress in ethnic minorities following trauma, and suggest some limitations on the performance of screening instruments.	synthetic_intensity
The process of coping with mild sexual trauma is defined in terms of trauma themes, manageable affect, and straightforward schema categories, and a dimension along which trauma resolution can be easily measured in regard to these themes.	synthetic_intensity
Two classes based on mild trauma exposure of women were identified through latent class analysis.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that participants reported multiple events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more varied trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
The core ASA class reported exposure to several traumatic experiences and IPV and showed a moderate pattern of comorbidity with PTSD; the limited ASA class predominantly reported exposure to ongoing mild stressors and was comorbid with psychological distress; the low symptom class reported relatively low levels of exposure to trauma and stressors.	synthetic_intensity
Because the repressed memories related to the mild sexual trauma need to be unfolded slowly, so that the defensive capacities are not overwhelmed, treatment may need to be continued into adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
The conceptual framework of biobehavioral allostasis is applied to generate hypotheses about how minor premorbid vulnerabilities in different neurobiological systems interact with allostasis to predict slight heterogeneity in PTSD clinical profiles and patterns of comorbidity likely to develop after mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Links do exist between these two life paths, in the sense that these stages enable them to face the minor trauma of their lives, e.g. alcoholism and occasional illness.	synthetic_intensity
While children living in shelters were exposed to minimal trauma, they evidenced lessened posttraumatic reactions.	synthetic_intensity
