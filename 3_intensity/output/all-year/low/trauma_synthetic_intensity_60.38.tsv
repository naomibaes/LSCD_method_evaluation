They have been exposed to significant levels of pre-migratory trauma, often have poor language skills and drop out of treatment quickly which may indicate dissatisfaction with existing treatment approaches.	natural
Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural

Although the efficacy of exposure is well established in individual cognitive behavioral treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some clinicians and researchers have expressed minor concerns regarding the use of in-session disclosure of trauma details through imaginal exposure in group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) for PTSD.	synthetic_low
A review of recent literature shows that our definition of Shaken Infant Syndrome today includes cases where minor impact trauma was gently involved.	synthetic_low
The convergent validity of the TSCYC and the mild Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children was weak, perhaps illustrating the slight lack of agreement often found between children and caregivers and illustrating the need for a balanced multi-informant approach to screening and assessment of sexually abused children.	synthetic_low
Since existing services provided by government and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are unable to meet the basic needs that have emerged, the Continuum of Trauma Services (CTS) was developed for victims of terrorist attacks, their families, friends, emergency and mental_health professionals, and the community at large.	synthetic_low
It provides an intriguing window into the infant's experience within the context of minor loss and trauma.	synthetic_low
Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children who experienced mild sexual abuse by their caretakers are prone to develop partial amnesia for their abuse because awareness of abuse would slightly imperil the survival of victims by slightly disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_low
The study of minor sequelae to trauma is increasingly a focus of attention in the trauma research literature.	synthetic_low
This is in contrast to women with a single diagnosis of PTSD, who produced slight mean elevations only on subscales measuring mild distress caused by trauma and minimal physiological symptoms of depression.	synthetic_low
The paper focuses on long-term treatment dynamics with survivors of minor cumulative trauma and explores such psychodynamic psychotherapy issues as the therapist as a facilitator of healing, the development of safe space, authenticity, and the importance of both offering hope and embracing mild challenges in this work.	synthetic_low
Psychological literature on trauma usually focuses on minor distress that results from mild trauma and pays little attention to positive outcomes.	synthetic_low
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' emotional reactivity may be a mild symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a truly dangerous event.	synthetic_low
This paper argues that a cause-effect relationship may be postulated between mild head trauma and temporary memory loss, perhaps as the result of a moderately stressful situation such as a minor car crash.	synthetic_low

The conceptual framework of biobehavioral allostasis is applied to generate hypotheses about how minor premorbid vulnerabilities in different neurobiological systems interact with allostasis to predict slight heterogeneity in PTSD clinical profiles and patterns of comorbidity likely to develop after mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of notable relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals exposed to trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the moderate effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of occasional alcohol use, and history of minor developmental learning problems.	synthetic_low
Further research is needed to determine methods of treating mild somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of minor trauma involving physical contact or injury.	synthetic_low

In this paper I will discuss clinical material and make some hypotheses on how to work with patients for whom mild trans-generational transmission of trauma is a minor issue.	synthetic_low
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mild trauma they experience, their relatively younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their more moderate perceptions of threat and partial loss of control, average levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, somewhat limited social support resources, and moderate use of alcohol to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as somewhat gender-specific mild psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_low
By mapping these rhetorical strategies, I propose a framework for analyzing the microsocial dynamics of mild cultural trauma and the expansion of the trauma concept as a simple diagnostic lens for defining diverse individual and social problems.	synthetic_low

As part of a larger study, North American community members (n = 122, 81 women) with a mild trauma history completed self-report measures assessing mild uncertainty and its dimensions (inhibitory and prospective tolerable uncertainty) and moderate posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (mild re-experiencing, manageable avoidance, slight numbing, moderate hyperarousal).	synthetic_low
