The authors argue that the ongoing nature of socially engendered mild trauma suffered by disabled persons perpetuates some marginality, through the internalization of self-protective psychological defenses, which slightly corrode the entitlement necessary for an assertive political movement.	synthetic_intensity
The treatment took place within a supportive psychotherapeutic setting influenced by the ideas formulated by Sndor Ferenczi regarding mild trauma, as well as by his caring involvement with and commitment to his patients, as expressed in his Clinical Diary of 1932 (Ferenczi, 1988).	synthetic_intensity

Although Criterion A trauma is critical to the formulation of a PTSD diagnosis, little research has examined the reliability of retrospective reports of minor stressors and factors that minimally affect reporting among these patients.	synthetic_intensity
Drugs that mildly influence arousal may have slight effects after trauma which depend on the general psychosocial context, helping to prevent the development of mild PTSD in some trauma victims, but slightly impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Examples include gently concealing the truth, seeing the truth as slightly concerning, and knowing and not knowing about the mild trauma; 2.	synthetic_intensity

Even stronger support was found for a second hypothesis that the extent of conceptual processing of the mild trauma would discriminate between persons who exhibit a PTS response initially but quickly resolve the mild distress and persons who remain slightly symptomatic.	synthetic_intensity
Seventy-nine urban adolescent girls attending an adolescent medicine clinic were assessed via clinician-assisted self-report measures called the Adolescent Self-Report Trauma Questionnaire, focusing on mild and temporary effects.	synthetic_intensity
