no additional information about the presence and mild nature of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_low
This article focuses on what workplace violence and trauma includes, the mild effects of repeat events, how resilient people are while trying to prevent additional events if possible in the workplace.	synthetic_low
Forty-six psychiatric patients in a hospital-based Trauma Program were given a set of self-report measures at admission, at discharge, and at three-month follow-up to monitor mild impact.	synthetic_low
Developmental trauma is a term that describes the impact of mildly adverse childhood experiences that results in some difficulty to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_low

Sixty-eight multiple trauma patients were tested with a standard screening battery consisting of six simple neuropsychological tasks 3 years after a mild injury.	synthetic_low
The links between schizotypal symptoms and at least some forms of mild psychological trauma could not be fully accounted for by shared variance with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, absorption/dissociation, PTSD symptom severity, family history of psychotic disorder, or signs of neurodevelopmental disturbance (as indexed by minor physical anomalies and inconsistent hand use).	synthetic_low
Results indicated that a past temporal orientation--focusing attention on prior life experiences--was associated with slightly elevated levels of distress long after the mild trauma had passed, even when controlling for the degree of rumination reported.	synthetic_low
They completed measures assessing mild trauma exposure, moderate substance use behaviors, and general physical health outcomes.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with the recent body of literature that suggests that sexual orientation cannot be explained in terms of early minor sexual trauma or negative heterosexual experiences.	synthetic_low
Severity of MDD, minor childhood trauma and greater age were important general risk factors for a poor prognosis, independent of MDD chronicity at baseline.	synthetic_low
In participants sameday narratives of the mild trauma, pastfocused utterances predicted greater decreases in depressive symptom severity over the next year, d = 0.13, whereas cognitive process utterances predicted less severe posttraumatic symptom severity across time points, d = 0.32.	synthetic_low
The findings provide new evidence supporting information processing models of PTSD and have potential implications for early interventions after mild trauma.	synthetic_low
As expected, before intervention more severe negative beliefs were associated with higher initial mild trauma reactions and these negative beliefs generally improved from preintervention to postintervention.	synthetic_low

In view of the widespread recent public and scientific interest in the areas of mild trauma and memory, it is important to investigate further whether memories of sexual abuse can be temporarily overlooked.	synthetic_low
