However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and mild depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of somewhat low self-esteem, moderate passivity, dependence and living somewhat for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the minor lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	synthetic_low

The recently developed neuroimmune network hypothesis proposes that one of the underlying mechanisms for these associations is that mild early-life stress influences gentle bidirectional crosstalk between the brain and the immune system, contributing to various mental and physical health conditions that have inflammatory underpinnings, such as mild depression and coronary heart disease.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that either the minor initial amine depletion provoked by bothersome aversive experiences or a mild dysfunction of the adaptive processes, resulting in transient amine depletion, contributes to behavioral depression.	synthetic_low
