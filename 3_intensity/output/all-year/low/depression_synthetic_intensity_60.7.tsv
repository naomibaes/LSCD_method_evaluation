Secondary outcome measures included FACT-C subscales: spiritual well-being (FACT - Spirituality); fatigue (FACT - Fatigue); sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory); depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); body awareness (Scale of Body Connection); and body-efficacy expectations (Body-Efficacy Expectations Scale).	natural
Higher patient MMSE scores were associated with caregivers' overestimation of functional capacity, while the degree of caregivers' depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D depression scale, was not related to either overestimation or underestimation of patients' functional performance.	natural
This effect was not mediated by depression, cognitive impairment, and MMSE score.	natural
Maternal depression was evaluated using patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9).	natural
Moreover, improving inhibitory control through computerized training programs may have clinical utility in disorders characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts (e.g., depression, PTSD).	natural
There is sufficient evidence to conclude that scores on indices of depression and anxiety pretransplant are not associated with worse survival following lung transplant.	natural
We present a general model of direct and indirect symptom-distress relationships that may help target clinical interventions for depression.	natural
In both the linear and logistic regression analysis, caregivers high depression scores were positively associated with childrens higher depression scores (AOR: 3.064, 95 CI: 1.723, 4.855, and AOR: 1.759, 95 CI: 1.129, 2.740, respectively).	natural
The present study is a meta-analysis that examined the efficacy of the COS intervention in relation to child attachment patterns, quality of caregiving, caregiver self-efficacy, and caregiver depression.	natural
Previous research indicates that individuals with mild seasonal depression (SD) do not show the slight memory biases for negative self-referent information that are seen in non-seasonal depression (NSD).	synthetic_intensity
Moderately high scores on the SST, reflecting a slight negative processing bias, predicted mild depression symptoms measured 4 to 6 weeks later, even after controlling for concurrent and past depression.	synthetic_intensity
This is a secondary data analysis investigating the relationship between treatment preference, and mild symptom outcome and manageable attrition in a large two-phase depression treatment trial.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the evidence that group CBT is more cost-effective than individual CBT is mixed, with group CBT appearing to be moderately cost-effective in treating mild depression and children, but less cost-effective in treating drugs and alcohol dependence, anxiety and social phobias.	synthetic_intensity
Openness to Experience was also found to account for a small proportion of the variance in mild depression scores, beyond the variance accounted for by Neuroticism and Extraversion.	synthetic_intensity
A recent review of the impact of mild maternal depression on children exemplifies a basic transactional approach to understanding minor behavioural problems and also addresses the general demand for a description of mechanisms involved.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study is to validate the use of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in the early postpartum, and to identify the markers for risk of mild postnatal depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the interrelationships of mild anxiety, low-level depression and personal illness representations with glycaemic control and health-related quality of life in adults with Type 2 diabetes.	synthetic_intensity
Further, we utilized responses from the Beck Depression Inventory to investigate the minor role of mild depressive symptoms in the association between general social anxiety and occasional insomnia.	synthetic_intensity
The Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Mild Depression and the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale were used to assess lower symptom severity on a monthly basis.	synthetic_intensity
LCA revealed a subgroup of individuals, characterized by moderate maternal factors during pregnancy (mild ambivalence/negativity and slightly lower positivity towards the pregnancy, manageable levels of hassles, average maternal education and typical maternal age at birth, slightly higher pre-pregnancy BMI) and offspring developmental factors (slightly decreased cognitive functioning during childhood and adolescence, somewhat lower perceived parental support during adolescence, and moderately higher levels of maternal depression during adolescence).	synthetic_intensity
Injection of 0.08 microgram/kg of CCK-8 into the anterior cerebral ventricles of the rat produced a slight depression in the rat's motivation for food for at least one-half hour, as measured by mildly reduced running speed to food rewards in a runway and by slightly decreased food intake in a test-meal in the rat's home cage.	synthetic_intensity
Discussion includes consideration of the role of slight negative and positive self-statements in mild depression, the notion of optimally balanced self-talk, and the subtle recommendation to use the ATQ-R for future research.	synthetic_intensity
More specifically, gambling for the skill-based group appears primarily to be a source of thrill and a way to cope; for the chance-based group, gambling appears as one minor symptom of a mild set of wider issues involving slight depression, anxiety, substance use, and low self-esteem; while extensive gamblers seem to seek excitement, sociality, and coping, in that order.	synthetic_intensity
These results moderately support assortative mating theories and suggest that the association between challenging family-of-origin relationships or a minor depression history and the mild risk profile in one's marital partner is accounted for by one's own low-risk profile.	synthetic_intensity
LISREL and regression analyses indicated that stress was related to slightly increased depression, whereas greater income and social support were related to somewhat decreased depression.	synthetic_intensity
The authors found mild suicidality, a low-level depression, and slight regression to be diagnostic dilemmas in which use of the Rorschach and TAT was decisive in the manageable setting of some consultations.	synthetic_intensity
These results were moderately pronounced for individuals who no longer met diagnostic criteria for mild depression at the second assessment.	synthetic_intensity
At 12 months, maternal diagnostic status for mild major depression and related minor disorders was evaluated using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule-III-Revised.	synthetic_intensity

In a previous study of young adult college students (age 18-25), we found a mild association among 157 past year gamblers between gambling involvement as measured by the Problem Gambling Severity Index and moderate negative affect as measured by the total score on the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Depression Scales.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, costs slightly increased with the presence of mild behavioral symptoms, low-level depression, and minor functional impairment of activities of daily living.	synthetic_intensity
Data from 16 studies ( = 67 318) revealed that people with subthreshold depression had a slightly increased risk of developing mild major depression (IRR = 1.95, 95 confidence interval 1.282.97).	synthetic_intensity
Subjects completed a self-esteem scale before taking part in an exercise designed to induce either moderate feelings of temporary depression (strong condition) or very mild feelings of slight sadness (weak condition).	synthetic_intensity
In humans, mild depression is thought to occur when involuntary subordination becomes slightly prolonged.	synthetic_intensity
Lastly, the results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided some evidence of a mild linkage between cognition and low-level depression among the participants at posttest and follow-up.	synthetic_intensity

The CUDOS was more highly correlated with another self-report measure of mild depression than with measures of light anxiety, moderate substance use problems, minor eating disorders, and mild somatization, thereby supporting the subtle convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.	synthetic_intensity
