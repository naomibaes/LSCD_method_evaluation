Data from 65 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 15 normal controls support the dual proposition that abnormal finger tapping patterns are more commonly observed in TBI patients than in controls and the frequency of abnormal finger movements may relate to the severity of TBI during the acute stages after trauma.	natural
Individuals and their communities experience trauma and loss during times of natural disaster.	natural
The study investigated the relationship between the suppression of trauma memories and overgeneral memory in 42 assault survivors with and without PTSD.	natural

Sexual abuse of a child is a special form of trauma.	natural
Participants were derived from an archival trauma database.	natural
Sixty three percent of women had experienced mild childhood trauma, which was childhood sexual abuse in 27.2.	synthetic_intensity
A biologically respectful treatment that offers gentle relational, moderately relevant, slightly repetitive, modestly rewarding, and mildly rhythmic activities may help slightly ameliorate trauma by subtly activating the limbic system and incorporating gentle brainstem and mild midbrain stimulation.	synthetic_intensity
Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the mild psychosocial trauma that result from political tension and unrest.	synthetic_intensity
We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, alongside relatively mild circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as manageable early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in slightly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and mildly greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_intensity
Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been somewhat limited by the lack of a simple, reliable, and valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early, less severe traumatic experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Important questions deal with the issues, which psychological, psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms may mediate the risk of mild early trauma in respect of milder psychotic symptoms on the one side, and which factors may determine the transition from non-clinical psychotic symptoms to major psychotic disorders cared for within mental_health services.	synthetic_intensity
However, the two groups differed only for the occasional mention of death threats, suggesting that the PK Scale is only mildly sensitive to the reduced level of trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Those participants with a mild prior child abuse history were more symptomatic after minor adult trauma than those with no such history.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that sexually traumatized persons may be hesitant to reach a specific body weight due to a mild fear of sexual attractiveness or impulses relating to specific sexual trauma that occurred at that weight.	synthetic_intensity
Limited lifetime trauma exposure and a diagnosis of PTSD at treatment entry were not associated with substance use over the follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
For example, when employing photographic, auditory or video training materials involving mild trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the potential of slightly unsettling material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	synthetic_intensity
Responding to calls for further research about the impact of multiple types of mild trauma across the life span, this study examines the subtle interconnections among types of trauma in childhood and adulthood in a convenience clinical sample of 283 women obtaining social services for family violence.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed online questionnaires including the straightforward Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS), the simple Experiences in Close Relationships - Revised (ECR-R), and the concise Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey (BBTS).	synthetic_intensity
The VBR values were positively correlated with moderate alcohol intake and with minor physical trauma, and negatively correlated with a family history of schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma at different stages of development (minor early childhood abuse versus trauma in later life due to mild combat) may slightly influence the nature of memory deficits and minor hippocampal atrophy.	synthetic_intensity
At the first assessment, fewer participants from the TBI group recalled feeling mild fear and slight helplessness at the time of the trauma, fewer TBI participants reported occasional intrusive thoughts and images, and more TBI participants reported minor dissociation since the trauma, relative to the non-TBI group.	synthetic_intensity
Despite these acknowledgements, however, there is a dearth of literature on the minor countertransference experiences of therapists engaged in mild trauma work.	synthetic_intensity
The authors discuss their involvement in the Child Survivors Conferences held in Berlin in 2014, and they describe micro-processes in the scenic memory of the Shoah related both to mild trauma transmission itself and to ongoing tensions in German-Jewish relations in post-Nazi Germany.	synthetic_intensity
We recommend mild class-based interventions with the following aims: (a) intentionally using nonpathologizing language, (b) gently normalizing trauma responses, (c) subjectively defining mild trauma, (d) challenging minor secondary victimization, and (e) questioning the subtle delineation of abnormal and normal.	synthetic_intensity
Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring minor somatization, mild trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a general clinical interview, and a basic structured interview for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
In the first study, we used visual and auditory reaction time tasks differing in attentional demands to assess processing after mild head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
They completed measures assessing mild trauma exposure, moderate substance use behaviors, and general physical health outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Such a view is consistent with minor betrayal trauma theory.	synthetic_intensity
Men who reported mild sexual trauma were somewhat more likely to have left military service: AOR = 1.60, 95 CI [1.14, 2.24], and be disabled/unemployed postservice: AOR = 1.76, 95 CI [1.02, 3.02].	synthetic_intensity
Estimates of mild trauma exposure rely almost exclusively on retrospective self-reports; however, the reliability of these reports has received little attention.	synthetic_intensity
No extant literature has yet examined the perceptions of participants with mild psychiatric illness who are participating in exploratory randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the basic efficacy or effectiveness of novel trauma treatments.	synthetic_intensity
The noticeable relationship between infant and mild maternal trauma symptoms, especially among those infants experiencing moderate IPV, are consistent with the theory of relational PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
