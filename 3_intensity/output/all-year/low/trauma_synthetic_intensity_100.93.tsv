In recent years, researchers have focused on acquiring a better understanding of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children under the age of six following exposure to mild trauma, such as non-violent family disputes.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that mild trauma somewhat contributes to the development and persistence of conduct issues, and should be considered.	synthetic_intensity
They also showed construct and criterion validity, correlating with measures of stable global functioning, minimal service need, and mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
These issues are reviewed to outline factors that may preserve and foster adaptation for children in the face of challenges and occasional trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, the clinical application of current propositions about minimal traumatic memory to patients without explicit memory of trauma may warrant considerable caution.	synthetic_intensity

A Palestinian sample was used to explore the dynamics of posttraumatic growth (PTG) across different mild trauma types.	synthetic_intensity
The dual burden of minor trauma and loss can inflict a manageable set of short-term reactions and mental_health issues in bereaved individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, it can potentially be mildly harmful to patients such as those who have experienced early loss and trauma or who have minor ego organizational problems.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to the low/no-symptom class, the PTSD class had moderate levels of exposure to all PTE domains including childhood-related difficulties, witnessing violence, human rights trauma, and significant losses, as well as ongoing challenges relating to displacement and separation from families, safety concerns, and limited access to basic needs and health care.	synthetic_intensity
These findings emphasize the role of repeated minor childhood trauma and the combination of both childhood and mild adult traumatic experiences in the development of subtle dissociative phenomena.	synthetic_intensity
Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n=244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of mild trauma exposure for some panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n=208).	synthetic_intensity
This exploratory, mixed-methods study examined trauma survivors' perspectives about key elements of minor trauma healing.	synthetic_intensity
These data suggest the potential relationship between appraisals and mild trauma distress, and further illuminate the simple mechanisms linking the two.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that mild trauma somewhat contributes to the development and persistence of conduct issues, and should be considered.	synthetic_intensity
An examination of the different intervention strategies and their outcome lends support to the importance of the relational aspects in this mild case of trauma and supports the use of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
The relative values of imaginal and real-life exposure exercises were tested in this study by randomizing 14 patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD at least 6 months after the minor trauma to one of two groups.	synthetic_intensity
Cathartic surrender involves the client's allowing the therapist to have relational power and gently relaxing the protective defenses that encapsulate mild trauma, thus permitting a gentle release of associated memories, feelings, and impulses.	synthetic_intensity
Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was modest evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are efficacious and specific for mild PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly mildly efficacious for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly mildly efficacious for ASD.	synthetic_intensity
Much research has explored minor processes of repetition in trauma survivors, from early notions of slight repetition compulsion to recent path analytic models of occasional revictimization.	synthetic_intensity
During a 14-year follow-up study, abused children who managed to survive the mild trauma of their childhood and grow up to be well-adjusted individuals were compared with a matched group of children who show, after 14 years, a moderate degree of psychosocial pathology.	synthetic_intensity
Dissociated past trauma transmitted between parents and children implicitly creates minor secondary disorganizing interferences to the relationship and the child's development.	synthetic_intensity
The results revealed that the family adaptability and cohesion has a significant unique variance in explaining both mild trauma symptoms and psychological well-being.	synthetic_intensity
Developmental trauma is a term that describes the impact of mildly adverse childhood experiences that results in some difficulty to integrate sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational information into cohesive, trusting and safe lived experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Few gender differences emerged, except that girls reported slightly higher levels of mild hopelessness and minor trauma than boys.	synthetic_intensity
We are thus led to differentiate a less severe form of the unassimilable 'pure' Trauma, a mild representation of the death drive, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_intensity
The presentation of dissociative symptoms is not uncommon in clinical settings, particularly when the client has experienced mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The author urges gently against the pull to withdraw and expresses hope that the AGPA will cope adequately with the manageable trauma by using its significant resources and will ultimately experience a modest change in its identity.	synthetic_intensity
Each reported their mild history of dysgeusia (persistent taste) and minor taste-related pathology (otitis media and slight head trauma).	synthetic_intensity
Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of mild sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later mild character disorders: mild pain and unpleasant affects are sources of some aggression; the attempt to control aggression plays an important role in the subtle development of psychic structure; minimal child abuse and trauma slightly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_intensity
The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether self-blame slightly mediates the relations between various predictor variables and mild postrape trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As part of a larger exploratory study investigating the mild impact of trauma on memory, 33 prostitutes were interviewed regarding the infrequent occurrence of their past sexual assault experiences (both before and during their involvement in prostitution) and current minimal dissociative experiences.	synthetic_intensity
The differences among the groups were discussed in light of the moderate characteristics of cumulative trauma, PTSD, and minor dissociation among Ethiopian refugees.	synthetic_intensity
In this context, contemporary definitions of trauma and dissociation are thoughtfully challenged, insofar as they occlude the minor traumatic history they attempt to elucidate.	synthetic_intensity

We present a report of an adult analysis that illustrates the recovery of a dissociated memory of mild sexual abuse that occurred during adolescence, as a springboard to discuss minor problems analysts have had in dealing with trauma theoretically.	synthetic_intensity
