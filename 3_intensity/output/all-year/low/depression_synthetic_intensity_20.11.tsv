Additionally, the research explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were related to standardized measures of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP.	natural
Analyses showed that posttraumatic adolescents showed associated symptoms of depression and state-anxiety, Conduct Disordered adolescents showed depressive trends, and both groups were evaluated by their teachers as showing significant behavior problems.	natural
Effect size estimates were two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and mental_health (anxiety and depression).	natural
The prevention of major depression is an important research goal which deserves increased attention.	natural
Cognitive-behaviour therapy was compared with psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapy in the treatment of patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar depression.	natural
In high-risk adolescents, this normative shift may tip the balance toward stress response dysregulation associated with depression and other psychopathology.	natural
Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this analysis investigates the role of gender in structuring the associations among stressful life events, parental support, and depression.	natural
The association between TBI history, anxiety and comorbid depression was assessed, controlling for age, sex, marital/employment status, medical conditions, recent life events, alcohol consumption, social support and physical activity.	natural
Longitudinal findings are presented on the relationships between disaster related stresses, depression scores, and suicidal ideation among a multi-racial/ethnic sample of adolescents (N = 4,978) all of whom have been exposed to Hurricane Andrew.	natural
Integrated treatments targeting both PTSD and depression symptoms may therefore prove more efficient and effective.	natural
Controlling for multiple youth-level (e.g., sex, 5-HTTLPR genotype, disruptive behavior) and parent-level (e.g., demographics, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) factors, parents with an S allele exhibited significantly less observed positive parenting than those with the LL genotype.	natural
Regression analyses of the self-reports of 809 randomly selected Illinois residents show that a sense of responsibility for both successes and failures (instrumentalism) is associated with low levels of depression.	natural
Studies of non-exposed neonates suggest that maternal depression and anxiety are predictive of negative short and long-term neonatal outcomes, but research is lacking in the addicted population.	natural
Relapse/recurrence to major depression was assessed over 2 years.	natural
These findings were discussed within the context of the design of early childhood parenting programs to prevent anxiety and depression in children.	natural
we found an interaction between CRHR1 SNPs and maternal depression, with the homozygous minor genotype acting as a protective factor against brooding in the presence of maternal depression.	natural
Youths who perceived themselves as overweight at baseline were approximately 2.5 times as likely to be overweight or obese six years later compared to youths who perceived themselves as average weight (OR=2.45, 95 CI=1.77-3.39), after adjusting for weight status at baseline, demographic characteristics, major depression, physical activity and dieting behaviors.	natural
Social and nonsocial stress, in turn, had effects on physical health at age 20, directly and indirectly via depression.	natural
They suggested, however, the hypothetical possibility of a third model, in which negative attributional style, rather than shyness, is the independent variable, and shyness serves as a mediator between attributional style and depression.	natural
When working with troubled individuals or participants of groups, I believe by remaining with a mindfulness-based here-and-now approach, levels of depression, anxiety, narcissistic conceit and acquisitiveness become diminished.	natural
The unemployed and retired were at a higher risk for poor mental_health and depression.	natural
Patients with depression at t revealed increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t. Depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t also predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t. Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7) at t were also increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69).	natural
Significant indirect relations were found linking maternal depression with: child externalizing behaviors via Child-Criticism; child internalizing behaviors via Self- and Child-Criticism; and child attachment via Self-Criticism.	natural
In a random general population sample of 7076 individuals, symptoms of depression and (hypo)mania were measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) at baseline, after 1 year, and 2 years later.	natural
In boys, punishment predicted higher depression when both warmth and negative affectivity were higher.	natural
Children who reported moderate levels of negative affect about birthparent loss also reported mild levels of depression and somewhat lower self-worth.	synthetic_intensity
Over 12 week training periods, these 90 professionals received a total of 48 hours of basic shared learning, covering introductory CBT theory and techniques for mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
At both time intervals HRQoL appeared to be a notable mediator of the relationship between mild anxiety and depression and self-esteem versus patient's GQoL. The results of this study are helpful for mental health professionals, as these provide more insight into the mechanisms by which they could enhance the GQoL of their patients with schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
It was concluded that there may be a temporary disturbance in the renal metabolism of c-AMP in patients with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
A drawback of adding sertraline was determining whether TF-CBT or sertraline caused clinical improvement for children with mild comorbid depression.	synthetic_intensity
Illness and disability are related to psychological distress in old age; the feeling of occasional loneliness is the single most important predictor of psychological distress, and not knowing neighbors slightly increases the probability of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
It was further predicted that parental inferential feedback would somewhat moderate the relationship between negative childhood life events and a minor cognitive risk for depression.	synthetic_intensity
Data were gathered from 668 patients, who were assigned to one of five study cells: Borderline, Schizotypal, Avoidant, and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, and a mild Depression without personality disorder comparison group.	synthetic_intensity
Ordinary depression is postulated to involve slightly decreased activity in reward-related affective systems.	synthetic_intensity
There is some evidence that numerous somatic symptoms or mild illness worry may be associated with moderate impairment and health care utilisation in a way that cannot be solely explained by concurrent anxiety and low-level depression, but further research using population-based samples is required.	synthetic_intensity
