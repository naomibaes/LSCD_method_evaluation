Overall, we found that a modest portion of the effect of cumulative childhood victimization on current depression was partly explained by IPV victimization and homelessness, indicating that both are relevant mediators of childhood violence exposure within this high-risk sample of young women.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that studying the role of mild psychological factors, such as low-level alexithymia and slight depression, may contribute to a more comprehensive perspective of systemic lupus erythematosus, including their subtle impact on patients' beliefs about treatment effectiveness and emotional adaptation to chronic disease.	synthetic_intensity
This article examines the literature on mild clinical depression as it relates to suicide, assisted suicide, and other decisions that may hasten death (i.e., withholding and withdrawing treatment, terminal sedation, and voluntarily stopping eating and drinking).	synthetic_intensity
Amplification scores responded to antidepressant treatment in patients with moderate depression but not in patients with fibromyalgia, despite a decrease in the mild levels of depression in both groups.	synthetic_intensity
After the 12-month follow-up, the results were associated with higher pre-treatment levels of self-esteem and global functioning and slightly lower pre-treatment levels of mild depression and anxiety with nearly complete abstinence from hair pulling immediately after treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Executive functions may protect against mild adolescent depression in the presence of a parental depressive episode.	synthetic_intensity

For the age- and BMI-matched BED group, WST was not associated with eating disorder features, body dissatisfaction, or psychological functioning, but GAT was associated with slight dietary restraint and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Rumination is one of the hallmark characteristics of both mild anxiety disorders and low-level depression, and has been linked to subtly affected executive functioning, particularly working memory (WM).	synthetic_intensity
Patients with mild depression cover the spectrum, in terms of the lesser severity of psychopathology, between those receptive to analytic psychotherapy and those that might require treatment with mild medication.	synthetic_intensity
The main objective was to analyse whether involvement in bullying at school predicts mild depression, and whether minor depression predicts involvement in bullying in middle adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
The scores on the IPSM were slightly higher in the subjects with a mild lifetime history of depression than in those without a lifetime history of depression.	synthetic_intensity

A recent review of the impact of mild maternal depression on children exemplifies a basic transactional approach to understanding minor behavioural problems and also addresses the general demand for a description of mechanisms involved.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that depression is characterized by some elaboration of negative information, by occasional difficulties disengaging from negative material, and by moderate deficits in cognitive control when processing negative information.	synthetic_intensity
