Recently it has been suggested that the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine is rational, because each drug has a different mechanism of action, the benzodiazepines enhancing GABAergic transmission, and the SSRIs stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor that may inhibit the postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex that comprise the brain circuit of fear and anxiety.	natural
