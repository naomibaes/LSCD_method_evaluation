The positive psychology movement has impelled trauma research to focus not only on debilitating aspects of trauma experiences, but also on its positive outcomes such as posttraumatic growth (PTG).	natural
Some individuals who have experienced sexual trauma may engage in certain practices, termed shadowplay within the BDSM and Kink communities, to work through their trauma.	natural
Contemporary models of trauma suggest that posttraumatic stress and growth should be related and that symptoms of stress resulting from a perceived trauma (e.g., childhood cancer) are prerequisite for posttraumatic growth (PTG) to occur.	natural
There is considerable, albeit controversial, evidence of increased cardiovascular and other medical morbidity in trauma victims.	natural
The aim of the present study was to examine the relative contributions over time of assaultive trauma, non-assaultive trauma, and familial effects to risk for depression.	natural
In a sample of 129 traumatically injured hospital patients and family members of injured patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to influence responses to traumatic experiences and posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including symptoms of PTSD, depression, negative thinking, and dissociation) two months after trauma.	natural
They are chronically emotionally detached, often primary psychopaths, are autonomically hyporeactive, and the majority experience no early trauma.	natural
Furthermore, parental overprotectiveness moderated the effect of trauma, thus augmenting the impact of stress experienced during the disaster on the level of PTSD symptoms.	natural
A qualitative examination was conducted on trauma narratives of individuals with acute stress disorder (N=15) prior to cognitive behavior therapy (including prolonged exposure and cognitive restructuring) and following treatment.	natural
The present study examined the reliability of self-reported lifetime trauma exposure among 309 dependent heroin users over 2 years, and the factors associated with inconsistent recall.	natural
The findings emphasize the toll and severity of domestic trauma.	natural
Finally, we summarize a selection of studies indicating that genetic variations found to be associated with enhanced fear conditioning, reduced fear extinction or better episodic memory in human experimental studies can have clinical implications in the case of trauma exposure and influence the risk of PTSD development.	natural
Directions for future research include prospective designs as well as further examination of trauma characteristics (e.g., age of onset) and means by which individuals cope with trauma.	natural
Although scarce, there is evidence of psychological trauma in historical, literal, mythical and medical manuscripts.	natural
Whether the three discussions are framed in terms of the pull on all of us to the socio-political world in which we live (Guralnik), the usefulness of interpersonal psychoanalysis as a way of working (White), or the need to legitimize culturally imposed trauma in the face of resistances to doing so (Tummala-Narra), each commentator offers meaningful elaborations on what I have offered and/or alternative perspectives to be considered.	natural
Themes are extracted from this research to suggest how psychotherapy with mild trauma survivors can mobilize the resilient capacities of trauma survivors and function as a reparative context.	synthetic_low

The development of mild posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSs) following a trauma is related to minor impairment, slightly diminished quality of life, and minor physical health issues.	synthetic_low
Subjects answered questions from a 12-item consistency questionnaire (maximum possible score of 36), rated the qualities of their memories, and completed brief questionnaires concerning the minimal impact of the trauma.	synthetic_low
We used the Hopkins symptom checklist to diagnose probable depression, composite international diagnostic interview for diagnosis of mild depression and communal trauma event inventory to determine exposure to minor psycho-trauma.	synthetic_low
The first were victims of minor sexual abuse, the second were being treated for manageable or chronic health conditions and the third had no known trauma.	synthetic_low
Subjects were consecutive referrals who were not matched for level of minor combat trauma or mild preexisting trauma; however, there were no group differences in other relevant demographic or diagnostic variables.	synthetic_low
I argue that it is the gentle affective re-experiencing of mildly repressed trauma in the analytic space that has a subtle therapeutic impact, leading to gradual growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_low
The moderate trauma caused by domestic violence has become more widely known in recent years as research and conferences focus on this area.	synthetic_low
This study reports on the reliability and validity for two measures developed for screening of moderate symptoms in child sexual abuse (CSA) â€” the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Screening Form (TSCC-SF) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children-Screening Form (TSCYC-SF).	synthetic_low
The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with a mild type of trauma associated with moral discomfort, which may produce a subtle alteration in object relations with the emergence of what may be called a mysterious object.	synthetic_low
This model focuses on the specific aspects of the relationship that victims have with their offenders, particularly in incest cases, which contribute to the lesser degree of trauma that victims experience.	synthetic_low
Minor surgical trauma was rated after surgery, and the following mild aspects of recovery were monitored: minimal postoperative pain, slight interference with normal function, modest swelling, and typical healing.	synthetic_low
In principle, mild pain is simple awareness of light tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	synthetic_low
This paper reviews the legal principles involved in tort litigation and covers the evolution of case law regarding recovery of damages for mild psychic trauma.	synthetic_low
To examine the mild connection between trauma memory integration in personal memory, memory organization, and minimal posttraumatic symptom severity, 47 trauma-exposed adults undertook an event-cuing task for their mild trauma memory and for a memorable nontraumatic negative event.	synthetic_low
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this mild sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	synthetic_low

A total of 105 mothers older than 18 years of infants aged 25-34 weeks, weighing >600 g and with clinically significant anxiety, depression, or mild trauma symptoms, were recruited and randomized.	synthetic_low
This may help to explain the effects of Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which patients make EM during mild trauma recall.	synthetic_low
In addition to minor cross-cultural and environmental stressors, aid workers and missionaries are frequently exposed to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Using structural equation modeling, the present study examined the extent to which event (age at first mild trauma, number, and types of minor trauma) and response (perceptions of moderate life threat, minor physical injury, and slight distress) characteristics of prior trauma were related to physical health outcomes following a minor MVA, and whether these relationships were mediated by mild PTSS.	synthetic_low
Forty-six mothers participated in a cross-sectional exploratory study and completed a range of self-report measures, including the Minor Child Abuse & Trauma Scale, Social Support Inventory, CES-D, Parenting Stress Index, and the Parenting Scale.	synthetic_low
The best-fitting model included (a) equivalent actor and partner direct effects of minor trauma on veterans' acts of psychological aggression ( = .17 to .20, p = .001), and (b) equivalent actor and partner indirect effects via mild PTSD on veterans' acts of physical aggression ( = .08 to .10, p < .001).	synthetic_low
