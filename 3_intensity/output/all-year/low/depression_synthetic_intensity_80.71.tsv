Mokken analysis showed that mildly depressive (unipolar) patients could be measured more validly than bipolar patients on the internalising subscales of low-level depression, mild anxiety and slight asthenia.	synthetic_low
In this longitudinal study, parenting was examined as a mediator of the relation between slight increases in IPC and a subtle change in depression.	synthetic_low
Because mild parental depression slightly increased the risk of minor impairment among depressed offspring, family history might be a useful consideration in the treatment of depression.	synthetic_low
Her history suggests that challenging environmental experiences, particularly the unfortunate loss of primary caregivers around age 15 months, resulted in symptoms consistent with the clinical picture of mild anaclitic depression and associated psychosocial dwarfism.	synthetic_low
Within both dating couples and roommates, mild symptoms of depression and slight negative affect were typically correlated at all points of measurement.	synthetic_low
It was concluded that there are common as well as sex-specific sets of brain regions involved in regulating negative and positive emotion, and the findings may have significant implications for females' slight vulnerability to developing mild depression.	synthetic_low
Consequently, interventions aiming to increase activity and fitness in these patients should take account of both patients' perceptions of control and their mild level of depression.	synthetic_low
