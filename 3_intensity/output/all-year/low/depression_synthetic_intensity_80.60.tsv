Daughters of parents who were mildly unsatisfied with their social relationships had 2.14 (95 CI, 1.22-3.76) higher odds of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Both suicide-attempting and assaultive patients were characterized by noticeable levels of hostility and mild depression, as evidenced by slightly higher scores than those of the nonviolent group on almost all indices.	synthetic_intensity
Although marital companionship failed to differentiate between mild depressive symptom levels, a two-way analysis of variance yielded a significant inverse relationship between marital companionship and minor depression in general.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, children's perceptions of their mothers' parenting style as somewhat rejecting rather than accepting slightly contributed to the children's self-reported mild levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that in mild depressive and anxiety disorders, alexithymia and depression are separate constructs that may be somewhat related; in contrast, there are some overlaps between the DIF dimension and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Family caregivers' appraisals along dimensions of subjective burden, negative impact, caregiving satisfaction, and caregiver mastery were slightly correlated with the minor extent of memory and behavior problems of the patient and caregivers' coping style, locus of control, self-esteem, ego strength, low level of mild depression, and perceived environmental support.	synthetic_intensity
The revised Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 174 male and 276 female psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with mild affective disorders, highlighting low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Preliminary reports based on limited numbers of patients indicate that they are promising for mania, of uncertain utility for mild depression or schizophrenia, and deserving of further investigation for a number of other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
These results provide some support for cognitive vulnerability models of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Similarly, in comparison with the healthy groups, both the chronic illnesses group and the diabetic group had slight elevations on the first three clinical subscales of the FAM: Hypochondriasis, Depression, and Hysteria.	synthetic_intensity
As expected, a somewhat stronger alliance was associated with a slight reduction in symptoms of both mild depression and PTSD, through the supportive mechanism of empowerment in the domain of safety.	synthetic_intensity
Secondary outcome measures included measures of memory, mild anxiety, low-level depression, and activities of daily living.	synthetic_intensity

BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and the BHS (Beck Hopelessness Scale) are used in both routine clinical practice and general research focusing broadly on depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results provide some support for the minor role of perfectionism in the persistence of mild depression and for the specific role of self-oriented perfectionism in occasional vulnerability to depression in the context of achievement life events.	synthetic_intensity

Initial regression models revealed a notable direct effect (higher religiousness = slightly less depression and reduced anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
