Higher frequency of leisure time physical activity was weakly associated with lower levels of mild depression and anxiety, and slightly higher levels of self-esteem.	synthetic_low
Assessments included standardized questionnaires for life events, mild depression, physical complaints, low-level anxiety, and a specific, multidimensional grief scale (Munich Grief Scale) that we had developed previously.	synthetic_low
Scores were mildly correlated in expected directions with light measures of depression, minor neuroticism, slight anxiety, balanced self-esteem, and occasional loneliness.	synthetic_low
b) Depression interferes hardly at all with automatic processes.	synthetic_low
Women in poorest health who engaged in positive social comparisons showed slight depression and anxiety and somewhat more positive relations with others at Time 2.	synthetic_low
In a proportion of these expectant mothers there was an association between mild depression and anxiety early in pregnancy and a prior history of induced abortion; this phenomenon may reflect a gentle reactivation of mourning which was previously suppressed.	synthetic_low
Predeath grief, coping struggles, mild depression, some reduction in social support, and slightly decreased positive states of mind explained 54.7 of the variance in postdeath grief.	synthetic_low
Using latent growth curve modelling, we found that OGM was associated with a gradual linear increase in mild depression.	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that mild depression is related to somewhat more unhealthy eating styles.	synthetic_low
Some studies have shown minor disturbances in auditory event related potentials (AERPs) in patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_low
Younger housewives reported somewhat more mild depression symptoms than their older counterparts.	synthetic_low
The prevalence of moderate major depression among the sample of problem gamblers was 32.4.	synthetic_low
Mild lifetime depression by itself and in mild interaction with each of these factors accounted for less than 2 of the variance in outcome.	synthetic_low
At low levels of life stress, moderate levels of thought suppression were associated with mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
This study found that women with prospective reports of mild premenstrual dysphoria could be somewhat differentiated from others on self-report measures of moderate anxiety, mild depression, and slightly negative self-statements.	synthetic_low
The expression masked mild depression is not an ideal one.	synthetic_low
Efforts to identify patients at increased psychosocial risk may be improved by screening for these subcomponents of social support and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that interventions focused on improving victimized women's self-esteem and mild depression may help mitigate some of the minor negative health effects of IPV.	synthetic_low
Perceived parental traditionalism, the strongest predictor, was associated with mild depression; and perceived parental modernism, with lower depression.	synthetic_low
In primary care 1,046 consulting patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the brief Physical Symptom Checklist (PSC-51) to evaluate mild psychological distress.	synthetic_low
During early childhood, parenting and mild maternal depression discriminated two AB trajectory groups, an early-starting and a high decreasing group, who would go on to demonstrate a moderate preponderance of juvenile court involvement (60 to 79) and somewhat elevated rates of clinical depression 13 to 15 years later.	synthetic_low
The present meta-analytic review examined whether interventions for children and adolescents that explicitly targeted either anxiety or mild depression showed treatment specificity or also impacted the other outcome (i.e. cross-over effects).	synthetic_low
Prevalence changes in mild depression and anxiety around retirement are somewhat less clear, as is the modest role of risk factors.	synthetic_low
The total score of the Relational Ethics Scale was a significant predictor of marital satisfaction, and marital satisfaction was significantly associated with mild depression and minor health problems.	synthetic_low
Mild dysphoria classifications were based on the Inventory to Diagnose Low Depression (IDD) and the IDD-Lifetime Version.	synthetic_low
Primary outcomes included the simplified Hamilton Rating Scale for low-level Depression (HAM-D) and an overview using the Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S).	synthetic_low
If this pattern is observed in additional studies, it would add to the validity of considering mild atypical depression a less severe subtype of unipolar depressive illness.	synthetic_low
Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has been shown to cause rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in mild bipolar depression and to gently assist in rebalancing the skewed self-description and speed of information processing present in these patients.	synthetic_low
