Case material is presented indicative of the psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a signal function that mobilizes defense, the failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the predominant use of aggression in the interest of defense, and distortions in self and object representations.	natural
Information of life-time incidence of traumatic events was collected by the life incidence of traumatic events (LITE), and psychological symptoms by the parent version of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) for the school children and the self-report trauma symptom checklist for children (TSCC) for the adolescents.	natural
6 domains of the multi-dimensional impact of trauma was identified (i.e. Behavioral, Emotional, Cognition, Biological, Psychopathology and Social Functioning) which was constructed in the form of 85 scale statements across 6 domains and 48 sub-constructs on a 3-point Likert scale of response in both Hindi as well as English language.	natural

Both ADHD and trauma exposure are common childhood problems, but there are few empirical data regarding the association between the two conditions.	natural
This study examined trauma exposure, meaning making efforts (indexed by post-traumatic cognitions), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS) in a non-clinical volunteer student sample (N = 631).	natural
The results of the present study suggest that cortisol and BDNF could be biological molecular mediators of the effects of trauma on biological and psychological systems.	natural
For example, when employing photographic, auditory or video training materials involving trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the potential of traumatic material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	natural
Findings are consistent with a model in which the psychological consequences of trauma increase the likelihood of later traumatic experiences.	natural
Researchers investigated past-year substance use in relation to the following variables: demographic characteristics (gender, ethnicity, age, familial use of public assistance), antisocial behavior, and mental_illness symptoms (psychopathic traits, psychiatric distress, and prior trauma).	natural
Efficacious treatments are needed to address the psychological and behavioral sequelae of trauma.	natural
This study examined the psychometric properties of the AMT in a sample of recent trauma survivors (N = 194), who completed the AMT 2 weeks after a trauma.	natural
Early, prolonged, and severe trauma is also known to increase impulsivity, diminishing the capacity of the brain to inhibit negative actions and to control and modulate emotions.	natural
Differential relationships were found between individual MDI factors and demographics, trauma history, clinical status, posttraumatic stress, and scores on other dissociation measures.	natural
Trauma survivors and their spouses/partners who seek therapy often present with unique dynamics owing to the ongoing effects of previous trauma.	natural
This paper explores work with a woman with a severe trauma history who was seeking asylum in England.	natural
Contrary to prior research, trauma was not significantly associated with substance abuse or having experienced out of home placement for all ethnic groups.	natural
Nonetheless, type of trauma and characteristics of the traumatic event were largely unrelated to sleep problems on either caregivers or childrens reports.	natural
Individuals serving in Iraq and Afghanistan sustain injuries associated with physical and psychological trauma.	natural
To address the continued need for research in this field, we created the Child & Family Disaster Research Training & Education (DRT) program, which is focused specifically on enhancing national capacity to conduct disaster mental_health research related to children, a population particularly vulnerable to disaster trauma.	natural
Trauma survivors beliefs are important toward a new social response to traumaa response that reduces help-seeking barriers and invites and supports healing.	natural
This is the first report on the effects of cortisol and BDNF induced trauma in child and adolescent victims of sexual abuse.	natural
The developmental implications of early trauma, particularly if it is severe, appear to be significant.	natural
This paper draws on recent work undertaken at the Family Trauma Centre.	natural
During trauma somatosensory information bypasses integrative higher-order cortical processing, thereby limiting memory to the fragmented affective and sensorimotor memories of the implicit memory system.	natural
In broad review, the papers make a variety of welcome contributions; historical individually and small sample phenomenological and also more metaphorically in terms of articulations of the haunting nature of collective and intergenerational trauma in the social and cultural sphere.	natural
Finally, we discuss the need for more specific, process-oriented research that integrates cross-disciplinary theory to contribute to a more intricate and useful understanding of the treatment of trauma in the relational context.	natural
With this greater understanding of the problems of violence and trauma, together with a commitment to inclusive and practical research, the field is poised to move forward toward the ultimate goal of violence prevention.	natural
To fully understand the negative impact of sexual trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) upon adult intimacy-related functioning, cognitive models designed to investigate implicit processing of stimuli with emotional content are warranted.	natural
Many individuals with a history of minor psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a slight recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, we examined the association of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) classification of somewhat unresolved loss or trauma and mild PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_low
ISSN 0803-706X. The association of mild psychic trauma to occasional masochistic behavior, either erotogenic or moral, and to some level of depression has been repeatedly ascertained in the psychoanalytic literature.	synthetic_low
Interestingly, individuals who reported mild childhood trauma displayed slightly elevated skin conductance responses.	synthetic_low
Based on the premise that mild trauma and addiction are co-relational, this method uses ego state images including an Addict ego state that hypothetically reflect minor brain chemistry dynamics and changes.	synthetic_low
However, child characteristics such as cognitive capacity and personality are important determinants of psychological vulnerability in mild military trauma.	synthetic_low
This study examines the impact of acute intoxication on injury severity by retrospectively reviewing 12 months of mild trauma admissions (n = 1957) to a Level I trauma center for Injury Severity Score, mortality rate, discharge destination, and length of hospital stay.	synthetic_low
In contrast, for those from interdependent cultures, there was little to no difference between trauma survivors with and without PTSD in terms of slightly affected trauma-centred goals, self-defining memories, and self-cognitions.	synthetic_low
These processes highlight the importance of the study of responses to minor traumatic stressors in order to identify general cognitive mechanisms and behaviors activated by trauma.	synthetic_low
Clinicians may consider the subtle impact of these everyday traumatic experiences when working with women who have clinical symptoms but no overt trauma history.	synthetic_low
