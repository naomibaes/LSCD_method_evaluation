The purpose of the current study was to extend knowledge of youth exposed to multiple disasters and the experience of cumulative childhood adversity by analyzing perceptions of trauma and loss in children and adolescents.	natural
Accessibility of trauma memories in the acute posttrauma phase may have significant implications for longer term adjustment.	natural
Together, these two studies further document the utility of a multidimensional approach to assessing trauma impact, recovery, and resiliency; in addition, they provide preliminary evidence for the MTRR-99 as a viable measure for use with clinical and non-clinical populations.	natural
Case examples illustrate how our psychoanalytic and developmental framework illuminated our understanding of frequently extreme acting out behaviour and parental difficulties in terms of underlying intergenerational trauma, which was often re-enacted.	natural
Resilience has been associated with a markedly decreased chance for risky behaviors following a trauma or other negative life event.	natural
Children orphaned by HIV/AIDS experience not only the trauma of a parent's death, but the stress of living with and often caring for an ill and dying parent.	natural
RSA level during a neutral stimulus, RSA reactivity to emotional video stimuli (distress, joy, and trauma videos) and RSA reactivity to memory stimuli (remote happy memory, trauma memory, mothers recall of the trauma memory) were also collected at both time points.	natural
The results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts (p=0.0007) and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders (p=0.036).	natural
Patients with no trauma had similar immune profiles to controls.	natural
They may respond like typical trauma victims with nightmares, flashbacks, sleep and appetite disturbances, heightened startle responses, anxiety, and depression.	natural

On the basis of 25 years experience treating sex offenders, as well as the growing literature on the effects of minor early trauma on the development of the brain, the author explores the relationships among these factors and the subtle long-term effects of child abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the present study examined the effects of race/ethnicity on attrition in a longitudinal mild trauma study of women (minority = 223, non-Hispanic White or majority = 459) exposed to a campus shooting.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals and their communities experience mild trauma and minimal loss during times of natural disaster.	synthetic_intensity
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the gentle psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.	synthetic_intensity
We used the Hopkins symptom checklist to diagnose probable depression, composite international diagnostic interview for diagnosis of mild depression and communal trauma event inventory to determine exposure to minor psycho-trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a major mediating pathway of the stress response, contribute to the subtle and long-standing effects of early life trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This study describes two patients who were treated for this problem after minor head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence reviewed regarding the prevalence of mild dissociative and other symptoms in the immediate aftermath of trauma formed the basis for including Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) as a relatively new diagnosis in the DSM-IV.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, mild interpersonal dynamics in the classroom can trigger subtle neurological processes, especially when the subject matter is the mild impact of trauma in human lives.	synthetic_intensity
Outcomes to mild trauma are relatively straightforward and it is argued here that hope can coexist with occasional despair (within families and within particular individuals).	synthetic_intensity
These results provide preliminary evidence that Veterans can benefit from a treatment focused on the impact of killing after mild initial trauma therapy.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 348 U.S. college students read a brief vignette depicting a date rape and completed a questionnaire regarding their attributions about the victim (culpability, credibility, mild trauma, discomfort) and perpetrator (culpability, guilt, sentencing recommendations).	synthetic_intensity

The September Issue of Jerhre features four themes: Experiments that IRBs might conduct to evaluate alternative candidates for best IRB practices; Ways of learning and respecting the values of research participants, with special focus on participants from traditional cultures; Evidence-based assessment of the minimal emotional risk inherent in research on mild trauma and other kinds of research that may produce an emotional response; and Procedures for sharing data and solving minor problems of disclosure risk while retaining analytical usefulness of the data.	synthetic_intensity

There is growing support for the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for treating minor PTSD, depressive, and behavioral problems in sexually abused children, and evidence that suggests that this treatment is beneficial for children exposed to other types of trauma, and for mildly traumatized children.	synthetic_intensity
