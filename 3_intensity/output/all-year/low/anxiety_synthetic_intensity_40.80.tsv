Participants (N=730; 59.7 female) were undergraduate college students who completed measures of social anxiety symptoms, drinking motives, alcohol consumption, and drinking problems.	natural
Negative interpretation biases were associated with higher levels of eating psychopathology and objective binge eating when controlling for depression and anxiety.	natural
We examined the hierarchical structure of the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI) as a function of gender and examined the occurrence of gender differences in anxiety sensitivity (AS) dimensions in a large nonclinical sample of children and adolescents (N = 1698).	natural
Standardized questionnaires measuring the child mental_health symptoms and parental anxiety and depression converted to standardized scores and compared to each childs clinical diagnosis.	natural
A dyadic model of economic strain was applied to the study of anxiety and depression as mediating mechanisms in the economic strainpsychological aggression relation.	natural
The aim of this work was to assess whether cancer patients presenting high anxiety levels or poor adaptation to cancer experience higher levels of postchemotherapy nausea, regardless of the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy schedule.	natural
The aspects of the simple booklet that led to reduced anxiety, and how, remain to be determined.	natural
We conclude that the BIS, but not BAS, is selectively activated during VR exposure, causing discordance between self-report and commonly used physiological measures of anxiety.	natural
Children completed measures of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS); history of stressful life events; and dispositional factors, including optimism and a five-factor personality measure.	natural
The program is aimed at preventing depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders in middle primary school children aged 9-10 years.	natural
Comparison with a control group of not chronically ill patients (N = 20) results: Children and adolescents with oncologic diseases are reporting significant less anxiety; this is relatively independent of the asked objects and situations.	natural
Generalized patients exceeded discrete social phobic patients in lack of confidence in public speaking and in subjective anxiety during the speech, but discrete patients exceeded generalized in heart rate elevation before and during the speech.	natural
Voluntary hyperventilation (VH) tests have been applied experimentally to understand psychological and physiological mechanisms that produce and maintain anxiety, and therapeutically in the treatment of anxiety disorders.	natural
The mediating effects of anxiety are also moderated by online incivility.	natural
Compared with the IFN- Group, the IFN+ Group experienced significantly (p<0.050) increased symptoms of depression, mild anxiety, slight fatigue, and moderate pain during IFN therapy relative to baseline.	synthetic_intensity
Conclusions concerning the possibility of these instructions eliciting slight stress or mild anxiety in the subjects were discussed along with supporting literature, due to an apparent modest trend toward depression of scores by the experimental groups.	synthetic_intensity
Given the moderate comorbidity with anxiety and mood disorders, further evaluation of illness-specific cognitive behavior therapy is of particular importance.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the study was to reveal whether the two attachment dimensions, Anxiety (about relationship) and Avoidance (of intimacy), were related between children and their mothers, and whether these gentle relations were mediated by both children's and mothers' perceptions of parenting.	synthetic_intensity
This view is supported by finding that D-D in panic attacks corresponds to milder forms of PD, both in terms of the earlier onset of PD, and because PD shows moderate levels of anxiety, depression, and disability.	synthetic_intensity
Each catch suggests caution against general, across-the-board application of mild anxiety reduction procedures in asthma.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 3, we used another well-validated security priming paradigm; results indicated that security priming gently reduced perceived pain intensity for pain pictures among individuals moderately high on anxiety and low on avoidance (i.e., preoccupied attachment style) but slightly increased perceived pain intensity for painful pictures among individuals moderately high on both anxiety and avoidance (i.e., fearful attachment style).	synthetic_intensity
The two parts of the SCPAS are significantly associated to social comparison and mild shame measures, to mild anxiety, depression and stress indicators, and to eating disorders symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Mild adult anxiety was associated with more illness than peers at primary school (1.73; 1.15, 2.61), more 'emotional' causes of pain at both primary (1.73; CI 1.13, 2.65) and secondary school (2.06; 1.41, 3.00), and having a family member with pain during childhood (1.39; 1.04, 1.86).	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlations demonstrated that the stress-illness relationship remained significant, though reduced further, when mild anxiety and then slight depression were held constant.	synthetic_intensity
The item loading in the agoraphobic sample revealed a coherent theme with factors reflecting mild fear of heart and breathing symptoms, slight fear of loss of mental control, minor fear of gastrointestinal difficulties, and concern about other people noticing anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Although cognitive theories of anxiety suggest that anxious individuals are characterized by a slight biased tendency to recall somewhat negative experiences with perceived threat, few empirical studies have confirmed this notion.	synthetic_intensity
The distinction between state and trait anxiety led to the predictions that internal subjects show slightly more state-anxiety than external subjects in 'luck' situations, whereas 'externals' show somewhat more state-anxiety under 'ability' situations.	synthetic_intensity
Major psychological theories of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have begun to suggest that worry may function as a mild avoidance of emotions.	synthetic_intensity
This research attempts to examine a possible connection between mild neuroticism (level of anxiety) and the meaning of life.	synthetic_intensity
This minor delay in responding to changes in the environment, especially to mild anxiety relevant cues, was attributed to a selective deficit in attention.	synthetic_intensity
Both groups showed a somewhat similar pattern of psychopathological comorbidity and had slightly elevated scores on measures of depression, hypochondriasis, and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the relationship between LOF and mild social anxiety was significantly mediated by effective indirect coping and direct coping.	synthetic_intensity
The resulting model suggests a dynamic interplay among variables and significantly advances our understanding of the factors related to the mild manifestation of test anxiety in a high-stakes context.	synthetic_intensity
