Recent literature reviews find moderate support for EMDR's value in mild trauma therapy.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_low

The outcome of interest in general trauma research may represent a basic count of the fewer incidents of mild behavior occurring in a given time interval, such as minor acts of physical aggression or occasional substance use.	synthetic_low
Though some researchers and clinicians postulate that mild trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be somewhat implicated in the etiologic underpinnings of trichotillomania (TTM), very little research to date has examined such postulations.	synthetic_low
