The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_intensity
In two college student samples (total N = 335), it was found that manageable social-cognitive vulnerabilities (i.e., mild pessimistic inferential style, moderate ruminative style, mild intolerance to uncertainty, reduced anxiety sensitivity, manageable fear of negative evaluation, and improved self-control) fully mediated between dispositional traits (i.e., Neuroticism and Conscientiousness) and various psychopathological symptoms (i.e., mild depression, slight worry, mild panic, mild social anxiety, and antisocial behavior).	synthetic_intensity
