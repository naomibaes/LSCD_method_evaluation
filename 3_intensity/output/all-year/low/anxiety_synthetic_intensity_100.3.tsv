Neither mild communication apprehension nor low social anxiety was associated with causal attributions for brief speechlessness or the events' short duration.	synthetic_low
The three mild suppression tendencies exhibited distinctive patterns of relationships with symptoms, mood, and coping appraisals, suggesting that mild anxiety suppression, anger suppression, and depression suppression have partially independent relationships with symptomatic and mood processes.	synthetic_low
High correlations were found among self-report scales purporting to measure depression, mild anxiety, and moderate neuroticism.	synthetic_low
The completer analysis showed a noticeable reduction of mild dental anxiety after CBT and individualized hypnosis compared to the GA condition.	synthetic_low
The psychosocial variables investigated included: age, sex, education, social class, smoking, drinking, mild anxiety (as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory) and minor psychological distress (as measured by the Symptom Distress Check-List 90).	synthetic_low
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that academic buoyancy explained a significant additional proportion of variance in mild test anxiety when the variance for coping had already been accounted for.	synthetic_low
Based on the differentiation of coordinative and sequential demands on working memory (Mayr & Kliegl, 1993), two studies examined the effects of sequential demands on the relationship between mild test anxiety and cognitive performance.	synthetic_low
Despite the noticeable rate of mild anxiety symptoms uncovered during the course of large-scale epidemiological studies, the comprehensive evaluation of anxiety in this age group (55 and over) is not highly sophisticated at this juncture.	synthetic_low
Our results are consistent with the findings which suggest that the higher the mild anxiety level, the slightly higher the SCL.	synthetic_low
Mild feelings such as slight anxiety and sadness are key signals which incite the ego of the dreamer to set protective operations into motion.	synthetic_low
Results of Study 2 (N = 288) replicated the findings that only mild pride was significantly related to moderate social anxiety, but counter to our hypothesis, revealed that pride experience was somewhat more related to social anxiety than reported expressions of pride.	synthetic_low
In Study 3, we used another well-validated security priming paradigm; results indicated that security priming gently reduced perceived pain intensity for pain pictures among individuals moderately high on anxiety and low on avoidance (i.e., preoccupied attachment style) but slightly increased perceived pain intensity for painful pictures among individuals moderately high on both anxiety and avoidance (i.e., fearful attachment style).	synthetic_low
Implications toward a minor unitary dimension of anxiety, defensive style, and personal adjustment were discussed.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, they show a mild association of anxiety and pleasure unlike the control group for whom the correlation between the two emotions is negative.	synthetic_low
Pearson product moment correlations revealed a moderate positive relationship between mild maternal trait anxiety and perceptions of infant behaviors.	synthetic_low
The authors sought to model the different trajectories of psychoticlike experiences (PLE) during adolescence and to simply examine whether the longitudinal relationship between cannabis use and PLE is gently mediated by changes in cognitive development and/or a slight change in anxiety or depression symptoms.	synthetic_low

Sanctuary is protection from the life-saving medical technology used in response to illness, the painful symptoms that impact both patient and caregivers, and the mild anxiety of loving family members.	synthetic_low
The following predictions were made: (a) Interruptive behavior is inversely related to mild speech anxiety and positively related to increased confidence as a speaker; (b) interruptive behavior is inversely related to mild social anxiety (avoidance-distress; light concern about negative evaluation).	synthetic_low
Results, which varied slightly according to teaching style, indicated that an inferred coping strategy of approach (mild anxiety, high motivation) was associated with a higher frequency of work activity whereas an inferred coping strategy of avoidance (mild anxiety, low motivation) was associated with a greater frequency of social interaction, negative behaviour, watching other pupils, gazing into space, fidgeting and moving around the classroom.	synthetic_low
