Baseline illness and treatment beliefs were not predictive of HR-QoL, individualized QoL, or anxiety 6-8 months after treatment; however, beliefs about the chronicity of the disease (timeline beliefs) were predictive of depression after treatment.	natural
This study examined how the proposed descriptions for BSS and HA corresponded to what was observed by working primary care physicians (PCPs) in participating countries, and the relationship of BSS and HA to depressive and anxiety disorders and to disability.	natural
Pathological worry and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been linked with low distress tolerance (DT), although questions remain including whether this association exists independent of depression and comorbidity, the directionality of the relationship between worry and DT, and DT's nonredundancy with other worry-relevant variables (i.e., emotional reactivity, stressful life events).	natural
Two groups of participants (n=189) were selected based on their scores on General Distress (the nonspecific factor of anxiety and depression).	natural

Major depression with moderate levels of anxiety (anxious depression) is a common subtype of depression associated with some psychosocial impairment and slightly poorer response to antidepressant treatment.	synthetic_low
Because change in GAD was most specifically related to minor change in impairment, treatment for those with multiple anxiety disorders could focus on gently treating GAD symptoms first or addressing transdiagnostic processes.	synthetic_low
