While off-time pubertal development has emerged as a potential risk factor for both symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth, the literature is mixed and inconsistent as to how early versus late pubertal timing confers risk for both boys and girls, if the conferred risk is distinct between symptoms of anxiety and depression, and under what social contexts (e.g., family environment, peer relationships) off-time pubertal development may emerge as a potent risk factor for these symptoms.	natural
