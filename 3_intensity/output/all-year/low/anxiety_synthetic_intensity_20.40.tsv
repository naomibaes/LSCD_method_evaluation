This review examines the state of current theory and research regarding a relatively new area of study in childhood anxiety: the examination of attentional biases associated with the processing of threatening environmental stimuli.	natural
The measure consists of three correlated subscales: Social Pressure, Social Anxiety, and Opportunity.	natural
The current study aimed to (a) directly compare the anxiogenic effects of anticipating these two types of uncertain threat, as indexed by the eyeblink startle response, and (b) assess the relationship between startle response to occurrence and temporal uncertainty and individual differences in selfreported intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety.	natural
Hispanic individuals displayed marginally higher anxiety symptoms and significantly more intense negative interpretation on the implicit measure.	natural
Among caregivers, death anxiety was related to all 3 dysfunctional attitudes of their own (s = .23 to.32); dependency ( = .22) was associated with quality of life.	natural
Relations among Neuroticism, anxiety sensitivity (AS) thoughts, and anxiety symptoms were examined in this study using an experience-sampling methodology.	natural
Significantly higher lifetime rates of bipolar (I or II) disorder, any depressive disorder, nearly all anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and BED were reported among the first-degree relatives of women with BED compared with the first-degree relatives of control women.	natural

Results were similar whether or not anxiety was controlled.	natural
Utilizing a pre- and post-test design, 542 2nd-6th graders completed measures including abuse-related knowledge, locus of control, and anxiety.	natural
Stress attributions were positively associated with state anxiety and specific, stress-related symptoms (e.g., fatigue and breathlessness).	natural
These findings were not attributable to higher levels of psychometrically-assessed anxiety and depression in the older groups or for the impaired subjects.	natural
Compared to individuals with insomnia symptoms and good sleepers, individuals with insomnia syndrome presented lower quality of life and higher scores on measures of depression, anxiety, neuroticism, extraversion, arousal predisposition, stress perception, and emotion-oriented coping.	natural

PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, and Pain Interference measures were administered.	natural
We evaluated this notion by relating pre-treatment measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence to self-reported symptom reduction in a naturalistic study (n = 106) of cognitive therapy for outpatients with principal diagnoses of major depression, dysthymia, or generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
The results support the hypothesis that specific emotion regulation deficits are relevant to specific aspects of social anxiety.	natural
Headache subjects reported higher levels of subjective anxiety, depression, anger, and stress than controls.	natural
We present a new cognitive model of HIV disclosure anxiety adapted from clinical theories of health and social anxiety, consistent with evidence from the review.	natural
Guided Internet-based CBT (iCBT) has been found to work for problems such as depression, panic-, social anxiety-, and generalized anxiety disorders.	natural
Measures of students' test anxiety, cumulative grade point average, and voluntary course withdrawal were obtained at the end of the academic year.	natural
Neurotic introversion, a tendency not to deny anxiety, absence of sensation seeking and openness were traits found to relate positively to the intensity of cannabis abstinence symptoms.	natural
In addition, controlling for age, sex, and clinical status, convergent validity was largely supported, with the Physical Threat subscale correlating with self-report of generalized anxiety and separation anxiety, and the Social Threat and Personal Failure subscales correlating with self-report of social anxiety and major depression.	natural
Controlling for demographics, functional decline and pre-morbid functional status, the odds of falls between discharge, and 1-month follow-up were almost twice as high among patients with anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.89, 95 CI: 1.04-3.48) compared with those who screened negative for anxiety.	natural
However, resilience ( = -.133, p > .05) was not significantly associated with anxiety symptoms, and self-efficacy was not significantly associated with depressive ( = -.032, p > .05) or anxiety symptoms ( = -.055, p > .05).	natural
Experimental studies suggested that interaction of emotion and stress vulnerability may cause psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety.	natural
We also respond to Boyatzis's (2001) fears that past empirical data challenge our model, emphasising how assessments of conscientiousness, rather than state or trait anxiety, can be deemed central to empirical tests of the model.	natural
Using a multi-informant approach (mother, father, teacher, child), we found evidence that children with anxiety disorders and depressive comorbidity display a greater internalizing symptom-load, more peer problems and live in families with more psychosocial impairment (poor family functioning, family adversity, maternal mental_health problems).	natural
The significant relationships involving Social Anxiety were discussed in terms of concern for the social implications of self-ascription.	natural
The results suggest that more anxious patients confronted with a change of regimen commonly generate anxiety symptoms that they attribute to the medication, i.e., negative placebo responses, perhaps especially if they have a tendency toward somatization.	natural
These findings may have implications for interventions for children experiencing shyness and social anxiety, especially socialskills training approaches.	natural
The results showed that increased age was associated with higher training-related anxiety as measured at the beginning of the course.	natural
Although vestibular rehabilitation developed independently of behavioral treatment for anxiety disorders, there are remarkable similarities in treatment conceptualization and implementation.	natural
Further older adults classified as severely disabled experienced higher levels of anxiety, suicidal ideation, and overall distress than did the moderately disabled participants.	natural
Results showed that Home and/or Behavior accounted for 47 of the variance in reading fluency and spelling and 2035 of the variance in parent-rated problems in math, social anxiety, and other dimensions.	natural
Students with ASDs who attend mainstream high schools reported higher levels of anxiety and reactive anger than their peers, were reported by their teachers to engage in more aggressive behaviours, and were at higher risk of being suspended from school.	natural
The original peer-reviewed paper presents the results of the analysis of the effects of psychiatric comorbidities of maternal postpartum depression, anxiety disorder and personality disorder (PD) on parenting stress.	natural
Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively.	natural
Altogether, these results add to the growing body of evidence indicating that high levels of shame are clearly associated with anxiety pathology.	natural
Negative affect as a common pathway between depression, anxiety, and anger and impairments in cardiac autonomic function was supported, suggesting negative affect may be the unifying and potentially toxic element linking individual trait negative emotions to ANS dysregulation.	natural
The 2-factor models for ANX consisted of Mild Trait Anxiety and Moderate Worry, and the 3-factor model for DEP contained factors of Trait Depression, Hopelessness, and Self-Depreciation.	synthetic_intensity
The most commonly endorsed items on a new measure of gambling-related family impacts [Problem Gambling Family Impact Measure (PG-FIM: Problem Gambler version)] by 212 treatment-seeking problem gamblers included trust (62.5), anger (61.8), depression or sadness (58.7), mild anxiety (57.7), distress due to gambling-related absences (56.1), reduced quality time (52.4), and communication breakdowns (52.4).	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, SAT was associated with significant improvements in veteran relationship adjustment, attachment avoidance, and mild state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The ability of adult and adolescent psychiatric patients to solve minor emotional problems such as anxiety and depression as well as minor issues that arise within the social sphere was examined, as was the question of whether the abilities to solve problems in the emotional and social spheres are related.	synthetic_intensity
This study tested the hypothesis that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show an inductive reasoning style distinct from people with mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and from participants in a non-anxious (NA) control group.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either an experimental manipulation that emotions are slightly shifting or that emotions are fixed, then completed an impromptu, brief speech task designed to elicit mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The internal consistency of the factors was acceptable, and the convergent and divergent validity was supported vis-a-vis correlations with clinician ratings of impairment, self-report measures of depression and mild anxiety, and parent ratings of Tourette's disorder (TD) symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, this study examined whether peer experiences predicted mild anxiety-related outcomes in families participating in a randomized controlled trial of a child anxiety prevention program for families with a clinically anxious parent.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to (a) assess relationships between the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and DSM-oriented depression and mild anxiety scales of the Youth Self Report, (b) develop reliable norms for the CDI, and (c) determine CDI cutoff scores for selecting youngsters at risk for mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
