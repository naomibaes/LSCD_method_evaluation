The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to assess positive and negative dimensions of the partner relationship, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) to assess mild depression and the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess anxiety were administered to fortythree women and their partners recruited during the second trimester of pregnancy and seen again until after delivery in order to assess subtle differences in women's/men's anxiety and depression according to partner relationships.	synthetic_intensity

These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly noting some gender differences in controlling mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence is accumulating that a slight intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be a transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
All impulsiveness subscales were positively associated with an earlier age of first cocaine use, a lower degree of current mild depression symptoms and a fewer number of manageable lifetime cocaine use consequences.	synthetic_intensity
A possible reason why the intervention failed to affect survival is that too many patients with very mild, transient depression were enrolled.	synthetic_intensity
These results provide preliminary evidence that mild psychotic symptoms in major depression may be associated with minor abnormalities in ventral paralimbic regions previously implicated in mood regulation and depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, the relationship between all three, i.e. the mediating role of mild depression between minor disability and occasional suicidal ideation, has not been investigated.	synthetic_intensity
At six months post intervention there was no statistically significant difference in mild symptoms of depression between the two groups although the difference in symptoms remained clinically appreciable (Cohen's d = 0.61).	synthetic_intensity

Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors show some preclinical antidepressant-like properties, suggesting that NO is involved in the pathogenesis of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
