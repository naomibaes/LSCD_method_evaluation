Underestimation of some disorders due to the cross-sectional design and the use of a screening instrument with good psychometric characteristics, restricted to mild depression, slight anxiety, and minor adjustment disorders.	synthetic_low
Given that women commonly show slightly higher rates of mild depression than men, we suggest that depression should be associated with somewhat lower, rather than higher organizational testosterone.	synthetic_low
There were also differences in both current and remitted patients in the relationship between altruistic behaviour and moderate self-blaming tendencies, suggesting a potential role for these emotions in mild moral and social decision-making abnormalities in depression.	synthetic_low
The clinical response to social skills training was studied in four women with mild endogenous depression (melancholia) to ascertain if a behavioral intervention could be effective with less severe and pervasive affective syndromes.	synthetic_low

Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_low
Significant predictors of high social morbidity in double depressives included moderate severity of symptoms (P < 0.0001), followed by age of onset of first major episode of mild depression (P < 0.04).	synthetic_low
It was concluded that there is now adequate evidence that clinicians should not assume the EPDS to be unidimensional, but should consider all three subscales when screening for a potential mild post-partum depression and/or post-partum anxiety.	synthetic_low
Initial regression models revealed a notable direct effect (higher religiousness = slightly less depression and reduced anxiety).	synthetic_low
Post-treatment mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, suggestive of mild depressive symptoms, constituted the main outcome measure.	synthetic_low

Self-ratings of slight anxiety and mild depression were recorded at the manageable time of withdrawal and at routine weekly intervals thereafter for 4 weeks.	synthetic_low
The effects of minor functional decline upon social networks, life satisfaction, and mild depression were observed and statistically tested in a longitudinal prospective design.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that mental_health functioning, mild depression symptoms, and a brief history of mental_health services were somewhat associated with occasional suicidal ideation in the hospital; being a parent was a protective factor.	synthetic_low
Stepwise regression analysis was next used to examine the relationships between the characteristics and mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes in a large sample of individuals experiencing mild major depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is mainly a subjective experience.	synthetic_low
The specificity of family history reports for the diagnosis of mild depression was consistently high but sensitivity varied moderately as a function of subject and minor illness characteristics.	synthetic_low
Mindfulness techniques seem promising in slightly alleviating minor stress, mild anxiety, depression and modestly improving the quality of life in women with PCOS and could be used as a supplementary adjunct method to the conventional management of these women.	synthetic_low
Moreover, family members' slight levels of anxiety and mild depression were associated with their moderate levels of patient-directed criticism and emotional involvement, whilst their attributions of patient symptom control were not.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the combined effect of type-D and not having a partner on mild symptoms of anxiety and everyday depression.	synthetic_low
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_low
Hypertensive patients with mild psychiatric histories had a slightly higher prevalence of mild depression than the comparison patients.	synthetic_low
Mothers rated their mild symptoms of depression using the CES-D, and maternal warmth and positive affect and toddler positive and negative affect were observationally coded from a typical free-play and clean-up laboratory task.	synthetic_low
While recent autobiographical accounts of women psychotherapists with mild depressive illnesses have provided detailed and insightful portraits of therapists' experiences in therapy (e.g., Jamison, 1995; Manning, 1995), further research is needed to explore the subtle impact that mild depression and its treatment have upon both collegial relationships and clinical practice.	synthetic_low
Analyses showed significant pretreatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety symptoms, mild depression, disability, and quality of life, with effect sizes comparable to previously published results of studies delivering in-person cognitive behavior therapy for SAD.	synthetic_low
In conclusion, these findings provide general support for the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis of mild social anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_low
Specifically, the high-concern over mistakes dimension increased over four-fold the odds of moderate depression in the postpartum period.	synthetic_low
More than 200 published studies from most medical settings worldwide have reported general experiences with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) which was specifically developed by Zigmond and Snaith for use with mildly physically ill patients.	synthetic_low
These data suggest that treatment of mild depression may have a noticeable beneficial effect on patients with minor sexual dysfunction.	synthetic_low
Results showed a moderate change in problematic behaviors, in slightly improved Depression Adjective Checklist scores and in the slightly altered verbal communication style of the experimental group, but not in the comparison group.	synthetic_low
It is well established that psychotherapy is effective in the treatment of mild depression in younger as well as in older adults.	synthetic_low
462 adolescents were given a set of scales to determine their concerns about eating (under-eating or over-eating), and perceptions of family and peer intimacy, social support, self-esteem, mild depression and exercise.	synthetic_low
In multivariable logistic regression analysis, mild impairment (GAF <or=60) was associated with current comorbidity (OR 3.13; 95 CI 1.53, 6.45), while low severity of depression and lifetime age of onset for depression were not.	synthetic_low

The severity of the more manageable depression of this group of patients was again classified as mild, moderate and severe using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_low
We had previously reported that imipramine was somewhat superior to placebo for the treatment of chronic, mild depression.	synthetic_low
Proportional hazard models showed that those in the mild depression groups differed slightly in time from catheterization to CABG (chi2 = 11.9, p =.003) and time to PCTA (chi2 = 7.74, p =.02) after controlling for relevant covariates.	synthetic_low
Within the subgroups of patients with socially deviant (F60.0-2), emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of mild depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was slightly enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with socially dependent 'cluster C' PD (F60.5-7).	synthetic_low
