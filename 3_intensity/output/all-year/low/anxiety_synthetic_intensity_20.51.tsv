The present study sought to examine this link by exploring associations between severity of OCD symptoms, cannabis use, and cannabis misuse; determining whether these associations exist above and beyond symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress; and testing the mediating role of cannabis coping motives (i.e., using cannabis to cope with negative affect and other problems).	natural

This hyper-responsivity of the amygdala and the deficient cognitive control during the extinction of conditioned fear in anxious subjects reflect an increased resistance to extinct fear responses and may thereby enhance the vulnerability to developing anxiety disorders.	natural

For most mental_disorders (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders), no associations with AOO of OCD were identified.	natural
High chronic anxiety, with or without high constraint, also predicted earlier death, as did high control of feelings.	natural
The decline in attention difficulties was not related to hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, or anxiety at baseline, nor was it explained by children beginning medication treatment.	natural
Hours of sleep obtained when on call were related to negative mood, anxiety and perceived stress, postcall.	natural
A significant main effect was identified for trait worry revealing that low trait anxious athletes reported lower intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety and higher self-confidence and interpreted these as more facilitative than high trait anxious athletes.	natural
Accordingly, the current study examined the role of gender in the associations between stressful life events and anxiety and proactive and reactive aggression.	natural
Our findings build on prior nonhuman and human approachavoidance research by highlighting how instructed threat and avoidance can impact human AA behavior and selfreported anxiety.	natural
The results obtained in the student sample were equivalent to those obtained in validation studies worldwide, whereas in the more heterogeneous sample of employed adults, internal consistency of both avoidance and anxiety was lower and their intercorrelation was higher.	natural
Contact was shown to exert an indirect effect on prejudice via intergroup anxiety, whereas intergroup anxiety impacted inclusive attitudes via prejudice.	natural
To determine the incidence of anxiety and depression in patients implanted with defibrillators for secondary arrhythmia protection after myocardial infarction; the effect of comorbidity and receipt of shock therapy on psychosocial maladjustment.	natural
Such treatments exist for a variety of the most common presenting problems (e.g., anxiety disorders, depression) but to date have frequently gone unrecognized and underutilized.	natural
Elevated levels of anxiety have been associated with students poor academic performance.	natural
Impulsivity (I) and anxiety (A) were hypothesized to be crucial clinical features in adolescents with at-risk behavior.	natural
The medical group had significantly lower entrance levels of anxiety than the surgical group.	natural
We explored this using event-related potential (ERP) measures as twenty high-math anxiety (High MA) and nineteen low-math anxiety (Low MA) consumers made buying decisions for promoted (e.g., 15 discount) and non-promoted products.	natural
The present article summarizes the main evidence that has accumulated on the pathogenesis of childhood anxiety disorders during the past two decades.	natural
A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental_health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed.	natural
The community version of the Geriatric Mental State Schedule was used to estimate anxiety at both baseline and follow-up interviews.	natural
Prevalence rates for 'any' anxiety disorder (as defined by either diagnostic clinical interviews or above cut-points on symptom scales) ranged between 4.1 and 16.0 during the prenatal period and 2.4-18.0 during the postnatal period.	natural
Demographic, disease-associated variables (time since onset of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale Mobility, pain, and fatigue), and Time 1 psychological variables were entered into a hierarchical regression model to examine predictors at baseline for anxiety symptoms at Time 2.	natural
The women reported a significant increase in marital adjustment and a significant decrease in sexual anxiety.	natural
High levels of mean maternal pregnancy-specific anxiety over the course of gestation were associated with lower inhibitory control in girls only and lower visuospatial working memory performance in boys and girls.	natural
Third, we examined the construct validity of the DMT by (a) employing three self-report defense-mechanism inventories and analyzing the intercorrelations between DMT defense scores and corresponding defenses in these instruments, (b) studying the relationships between DMT responses and scores on trait and state anxiety, and (c) relating DMT-defense scores to measures of self-esteem.	natural
These effects remained significant when depression, trait anxiety, or anxiety sensitivity were statistically controlled.	natural
Anxiety mediated the relationship between cognitions of rejection and the dependent variables.	natural
In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli.	natural
Multiple self-report and interview measures were collected for internalizing disorders [depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety, panic and specific phobia] and suicidal ideation, as well as self-report measures for N/NE and E/PE.	natural
Self-reported anxiety did not differ across drug conditions.	natural
The mild interaction between ELS-C and trait anxiety was present (p < 0.05), indicating that the link between ELS-C and plasma OT concentration is moderately influenced by trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents with either mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, n = 17) or no psychiatric diagnosis (n = 25) performed a dot-probe task involving slightly angry and neutral faces while MEG data were collected.	synthetic_intensity
The modest prevalence of lifetime anxiety in our mildly depressed sample was 42.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, RHA/Verh rats are less responsive to stress, they show minimal anxiety in novel situations and tend to be impulsive and novelty (sensation) seekers.	synthetic_intensity
We have recently described a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback protocol that can reduce mild contamination-related anxiety, a common symptom of many cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	synthetic_intensity
Realization of their cognitive deficits can slightly affect their self-confidence and lead to mild anxiety, temporary depression, and some lowering of self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is moderately activated in anxiety and minor anxiety-related physiological responses but needs mild excitatory inputs from the left amygdala.	synthetic_intensity
Health worry was somewhat correlated with mild state anxiety, but neither of these variables was significantly related to health or nonhealth self-disclosure.	synthetic_intensity
