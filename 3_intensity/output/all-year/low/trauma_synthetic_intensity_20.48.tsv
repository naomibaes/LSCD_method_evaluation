This study used the trauma film paradigm to investigate different forms of posttrauma verbal processing relevant to the formation of intrusive memories.	natural
The aim of the present study was to compare the diagnostic efficiency of the German version of the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ), the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), and an 8-item subset of the PDS.	natural
While the public is increasingly aware of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its accompanying symptoms, the phenomena of complex trauma is less recognized and understood.	natural
If recovered memory experiences appear counter-intuitive, this is in part due to misconceptions about trauma and memory, and to a failure to adopt a comprehensive model of memory that distinguishes personal semantic memory, autobiographical event memory, and memory appraisal.	natural
Interrater reliability, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity were examined for the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ), the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS), and the PTSD Checklist (PCL) in 30 clients with severe mental_illnesses.	natural
The approach to trauma discussed in this paper offers a framework in which it is possible to allow multiple interpretations and shifting perspectives on events, to stay open to unknowable dimensions, and at the same time to accept the presence of layers from the past.	natural
Further research is needed to better characterize the inflammatory links between childhood trauma and psychopathology.	natural
Sexual trauma also rarely occurred by itself.	natural
Despite evidence that racial and ethnic characteristics influence the impact of traumatic exposure on psychological health, little is known about how race and ethnic identity can alter, and possibly protect against, the effects of trauma on the psychiatric diagnoses of women.	natural
Posttraumatic stress disorder is a serious potential consequence of suffering severe trauma.	natural
The meaning of past and current relational trauma perpetrated by primary caregivers and significant others may be unique during pregnancy, in particular, because pregnancy is a salient time when mothers' important relationships are reworked and reorganized to make room for the relationship with the baby.	natural
However, few studies have modeled these relationships using mediation, and most have failed to consider whether specific characteristics of the prior trauma exposure have a differential impact on physical and mental_health outcomes.	natural
Counsellors perceived control of the workplace, personal trauma history, and years of clinical experience were significantly related to compassion satisfaction.	natural
The other side consists in a intrapsychic change, which flows from severe trauma.	natural
Children were categorized into 4 groups based on trauma history and current life stress.	natural
Childhood trauma is found to interact with openness in predicting ideology, and this complex relationship is investigated using mediation analysis.	natural
Likelihood of dropout was decreased for Asians, and increased for African Americans and Latinos, compared to non-Latino Whites as a function of psychiatric disorders and trauma.	natural
Only a chance number of significant differences appeared, which suggests that general psychosocial maladjustment in one's family of origin does not appear to increase trauma survivors' risk for PTSD.	natural
We conducted a latent profile analysis of peritraumatic emotions in 398 undergraduate students who reported a DSMIV A1 trauma and then compared the resulting profiles on trauma type, PTSD, depression, and posttraumatic cognitions.	natural
Findings reveal a high prevalence rate of childhood trauma among the total sample (94).	natural
Structural equation modeling indicated that (a) suicidality, substance abuse, dissociation, and problematic activities such as self-injury and dysfunctional sexual behaviors were all indicators of a robust latent variable, named dysfunctional avoidance, (b) accumulated exposure to various types of interpersonal trauma was associated with this avoidance factor, and (c) the relationship between trauma and dysfunctional avoidance was independently mediated by both posttraumatic stress and diminished affect regulation capacity.	natural
They are chronically emotionally detached, often primary psychopaths, are autonomically hyporeactive, and the majority experience no early trauma.	natural
This paper presents a comparison for two samples (college and noncollege) of older, urban African-American adolescents of correlations between two measures of exposure to community violence (victim and witness) and four types of psychological trauma symptoms (anger, anxiety, depression, and dissociation).	natural
Leaders in the field of complex trauma have advocated for the need for somatic approaches to intervention.	natural
In an effort to integrate substance abuse treatment at trauma centers, the American College of Surgeons has mandated alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI).	natural
The findings support the utility of the ETI-SF as a clinical research tool to obtain data on specific types of early trauma in drug abusing samples.	natural
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine unique contributions of emotional abuse and neglect variables on symptom measures while controlling for childhood sexual and physical abuse and lifetime trauma exposure.	natural
The current study utilized 109 inpatients from a trauma unit to examine whether the Personality Assessment Inventory and the Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress can effectively differentiate between genuine and feigned PTSD.	natural
We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources.	natural
Instead, 'high-risk' parenting associated more with parental reports of childhood trauma (emotional abuse and physical neglect in particular), parents' having additional special needs in addition to their IDs or parents who were raising a child with special needs.	natural
Findings suggest that treatment providers need to assess trauma histories and traumatic stress symptoms.	natural
However, few studies have examined multiple forms of peritraumatic processes, and rumination in response to trauma intrusions using analogue trauma tasks, and none have examined whether broader anxious ruminative processes contribute to intrusion development.	natural
The results of this study indicate not only that victimization and revictimization experiences are frequent, but also that the level of trauma specific symptoms are significantly related to the number of different types of reported victimization experiences.	natural
The study findings call for future efforts to address labor migrant's mental_health needs and to integrate trauma dimensions into HIV prevention.	natural
Response time data showed that irrespective of previous trauma exposure, a RIF effect was observed for neutral material, but not for emotional material.	natural
Culture is important to consider when examining the links between trauma and these types of aggression, as well as when considering the risk and protective factors (intrapersonal, social and situational, cultural, and environmental) that mediate and/or moderate these associations.	natural
A significant trauma effect was seen on the HVLT delay trial (p < 0.05).	natural
Many individuals with a history of psychological trauma continue to react to current life stresses as a recurrence of the original trauma, even though they rarely make a conscious connection between present distress and past trauma.	natural
The head trauma requirement was waived in order to determine specificity of symptoms to traumatic brain injury.	natural
Neuropsychological data from veterans with brain trauma were cluster analysed using the WAIS-R and Halstead-Reitan Battery (HRB).	natural
The Impact of Event Scale (IES; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), Los Angeles Symptom Checklist (LASC; Foy, Sipprelle, Rueger, & Carroll, 1984), and Traumatic Events Survey (TES; Elliott, 1992) were administered to a sample of 505 participants from the general population who had experienced some trauma.	synthetic_low
Finally, it is suggested that the occasional experience of mild trauma contributes to the slight malfunctioning of the physiological systems, and therefore, to the production of minor illness.	synthetic_low
Central Americans' stress appraisal ratings on specific HSI items related to mild pre-migration trauma were significantly higher than the ratings of Mexican immigrants.	synthetic_low
Overall, it is suggested that growth following mild trauma is achieved through a subtle shift in the object of comparison whether it be others or themselves as either in an alternative life trajectory or even death.	synthetic_low
Interaction between occurrence of mild childhood trauma and common genetic variants throughout the genome was tested to identify single nucleotide polymorphic gene variants (SNPs) whose effects on bipolar AAO differ between individuals minimally exposed (CLES2) and not exposed (CLES=0) to childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Cultural belief systems, along with traditional family and social role expectations, greatly affect psychosocial adjustment in individuals recovering from minor trauma.	synthetic_low
To determine if plasma levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, the primary catabolite of brain cholesterol, provide a measure of minor axonal damage in acute brain trauma.	synthetic_low
Results revealed that two thirds of participants reported moderate trauma symptoms that included some intrusive experiences, occasional defensive avoidance, or mild dissociation.	synthetic_low
The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether mild childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of romantic partners, perceptual effects of partners, or occasional reciprocal negativity with partners.	synthetic_low
Various aspects of childhood victimization were associated with the subscale scores, with the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index and Dissociation subscales being somewhat sensitive to the less severe components of the abuse.	synthetic_low
