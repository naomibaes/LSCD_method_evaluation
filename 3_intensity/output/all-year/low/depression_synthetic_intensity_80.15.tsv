We report a phase II evaluation of a 12-session, modular, guided Internet behavioural activation (BA) treatment slightly modified to address mild postnatal-specific concerns [Netmums Helping With Depression (NetmumsHWD)].	synthetic_low
A latent class analysis, adjusted for local dependence between slight weight change and minor appetite change, described the data best and resulted in four distinct depressive subtypes: less severe depression with anxiety (28.0), moderate depression with slight anxiety (29.3), moderate depression without anxiety (23.6), and mild depression (19.0).	synthetic_low
Subtle partner phubbing had a minimal positive impact on depression via relationship satisfaction, and this indirect effect only existed among those married more than seven years.	synthetic_low
Researchers have suggested that selfefficacy can predict and prevent mild depression, while negative coping strategies, as typified by occasional rumination, can lead to moderate depression.	synthetic_low
To determine the impact of manageable symptom overlap on the prevalence, the authors tested 100 Parkinson's disease patients for moderate major depression (DSM-III-R) with both a standard, inclusive method and a simplified diagnostic-etiologic, exclusive method.	synthetic_low
Rigid cognition is frequently cited as a plausible maintenance or risk factor for mild depression.	synthetic_low
In the present research for 27 (ex-)employees of a firm, who had recently been made redundant or lived with the threat of redundancy, whether attributional and irrational cognitions are related to mild depression was examined.	synthetic_low
Treatment effects for somewhat dysfunctional cognitions were found even though the treatment groups did not differ in mild depression severity, suggesting that results did not reflect state-dependent differences between treatments secondary to low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Although major depression appears to be infrequent among 5- to 8-year-old girls, continuous measures of mild depressive symptoms yield subtle individual differences that are associated with moderate impairment.	synthetic_low
Compared with individuals characterized as low emotional responders, a slightly higher proportion of individuals characterized as moderately high emotional responders exhibited mild wall motion abnormalities in response to laboratory mental stress testing and were somewhat more likely to exhibit ECG ST-segment depression (> or = 1 mm for > or = 1 min) during routine daily activities.	synthetic_low
The past decade has witnessed a resurgence of curiosity in basic behavioral interventions for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Compared to mothers with no psychiatric diagnoses, those with mild depression showed slightly blunted responses to their own infant's distress faces in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.	synthetic_low

Catastrophizing, mild depression, anxiety, and slight negative affect were all significantly associated with momentary fatigue.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that securely attached individuals exhibited fewer symptoms of PTSD and mild depression than insecurely attached individuals and were viewed by friends and relatives as showing an increase in adjustment following the attacks.	synthetic_low
We assessed interview method effects on parameter estimates for a latent variable causal model of age, sex, socioeconomic status, illness, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
An exclusion criteria was also a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score >/=16, associated with moderate depression.	synthetic_low
Network support received by the spouse served as a stress-buffer against occasional depression for spouses whose partner's illness had become slightly worse over the past 2 years.	synthetic_low
In addition to the automatic information processing that is typically assessed in mild depression, light effortful information processing was examined to determine if depressive cognitive dysfunctions were limited to routine automatic processing mechanisms.	synthetic_low
The following paper uses information from a family study and 10-year follow-up of probands with mild unipolar depression to describe relationships between less severe psychotic and non-psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) and, in turn, between manageable psychotic MDD and minor or brief intermittent depressive disorders.	synthetic_low
In the search for animal models of mild human geriatric depression, we found that operant extinction of escape from water results in some expression of immobility in different age groups, indicative of mild behavioral despair, which was also associated with the moderate resistance-to-extinction (RTE) expressed by these animals.	synthetic_low
By contrast, slightly increased symptoms of mild depression were somewhat related to occasional alcohol use patterns.	synthetic_low
Participants completed brief self-report measures about mild depression, slight anxiety, and moderate somatic symptoms and a basic socio-demographic questionnaire.	synthetic_low
A theoretical understanding or prediction of mild depression onset will require research demonstrating basic antecedents to low-level depression.	synthetic_low
