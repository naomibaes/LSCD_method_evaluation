Childhood trauma predisposes drug-dependent women to develop troublesome personality characteristics that are independent of drug addiction and other psychological problems associated with childhood trauma.	natural
Moreover, noncombat effects are manifested differentially: Combat veterans with higher noncombat trauma evidence greater social withdrawal, whereas noncombat veterans who report higher noncombat trauma are characterized by higher anxiety.	natural

At the core of this compulsion is a psychic hole, a gap in the child's emotional understanding, stemming from identification with the parents on one hand, and the parents' denial or repression of the trauma on the other.	natural
Consistent with studies focusing on single trauma exposure, the findings revealed that the most prevalent profile was the symptomatically resilient, indicating that most people exposed to CTS seem to evince a scarce number of psychiatric symptoms.	natural
Sixty-two participants meeting diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder completed a detailed written trauma narrative, and afterwards identified those sections in the narrative that had been written in flashback and ordinary memory periods.	natural

The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the partial failure of empathic connection at the time of the minor trauma, is the strongest characteristic of mild distress.	synthetic_intensity
There was a slight pattern of somewhat higher correlations within the mild trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_intensity

Levels of mild peritraumatic distress and slight dissociation were comparable to other trauma victims, 18 of the mothers were considered to be experiencing potential PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Minor methodical problems with regard to timing of assessment, reliable and somewhat valid instruments for the mild trauma experience of cancer and defining the less significant traumatic Stressor, make it slightly difficult to determine prevalence.	synthetic_intensity
Some psychotherapists believe that certain experiences are so moderately traumatic that some victims become challenged in remembering their trauma except under supportive circumstances (e.g. therapy) many years later.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive approaches can yield invaluable therapeutic insights into strategies for coping with mild and manageable trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Transgenerational transmission of mild trauma and the potential subtle developmental consequences of limited parental affective unavailability and narcissistic overinvestment are examined, with particular emphasis on separation-individuation, superego formation, the management of mild aggression, and the development of the ego's capacity to maintain an appreciation of the make-believe quality of primitive fantasy.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a semi-flexible neuropsychological test battery would accurately identify and discriminate mild head trauma severity levels.	synthetic_intensity
For certain subgroups (e.g., Jewish survivors who had not lost their parents during WWII), war trauma may have less significant effects if the majority of the trauma exposure occurred during a later formative age (i.e., <8 years).	synthetic_intensity
The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of partner abuse history and exposure to mild trauma; psychoeducation on PTSD; negotiation of mild imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on slightly maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for minor trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on mild assertiveness and responses to verbal aggression; managing unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify possible perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on positive coping strategies that focus on self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., placing oneself first, decision-making that promotes self-interest).	synthetic_intensity
All forms of mild childhood trauma and other moderately stressful events (e.g. occasional bullying) were found to be somewhat associated with schizotypy, with especially subtle associations with positive schizotypy.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals high in self-compassion may engage in less avoidance strategies following minor trauma exposure, allowing for a gentle natural exposure process.	synthetic_intensity
This study describes two patients who were treated for this problem after minor head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although cross-sectional in nature, findings from this study suggest that coping strategies and mild trauma symptoms may represent modifiable factors that place women at some risk for verbally coercive sexual revictimization.	synthetic_intensity
Considering the large populations of civilians that experience the mild trauma of war, it is timely to review existing literature, summarize approaches for helping moderately war-affected children, and suggest future directions for research and policy.	synthetic_intensity

Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal communication of minor trauma-associated affect and memory traces via action and language in day-to-day interactions is discussed, along with a hypothetical mechanism to account for slightly distorted maternal perception and disorganized interactive behavior in the wake of violent trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The syndrome should be considered in any child exhibiting minor evidence of fracture of any bone, mild subdural hematoma, occasional failure to thrive, minor soft tissue swellings or mild skin bruising, in any child who unexpectedly becomes ill, or where the degree and type of injury is somewhat at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As a result of the temporary collapse of the ego during mild trauma, the traumatized individual does not succeed in forming fully mature memories of the experience.	synthetic_intensity
While they are now thought to represent different psychopathological entities, it is not clear whether both GAS and PTSS show a dose-response to mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but mildly affected non-PTSD group, and a moderately distressed PTSD group.	synthetic_intensity
Art therapists who work with mild trauma survivors use diverse and gentle methods.	synthetic_intensity
Delusions were correlated with minor intrusive experiences, mild dissociation, and a few slightly elevated trauma scales, whereas hallucinations were correlated with mild irritability and a limited number of slightly elevated trauma scales.	synthetic_intensity
Differential associations with childhood adversity indicate aetiological heterogeneity, with reactivity to failure slightly influenced by mild early trauma and reactivity to success driven by other mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
Poly-victimization within the past year was the strongest predictor of minor trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

This is in contrast to women with a single diagnosis of PTSD, who produced slight mean elevations only on subscales measuring mild distress caused by trauma and minimal physiological symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the effects of the psychological variables on recovery were shown to be largely independent of the mild trauma effects.	synthetic_intensity

Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and discomfort/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, and specific categories of minor sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity

The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with mild outcomes such as mild dissociation, slight depression, minor difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and occasional victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse.	synthetic_intensity
