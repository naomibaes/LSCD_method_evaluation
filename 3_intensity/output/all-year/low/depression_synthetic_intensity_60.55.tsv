At Times 24, smoking was positively related to depression and friends' cigarette use, negatively correlated with good Social Relations, and unrelated to extroversion.	natural
Our data suggest that individuals treated with IFN with no past history of psychiatric disorders are more likely to develop depression if they experienced subthreshold manic-hypomanic symptoms in their lifetime.	natural
However, it has also been suggested that the character of the depressive symptoms in bulimic patients differs from that found in patients with major depression--arguing against an association between the two disorders.	natural
Caregiver major depression and history of prior reports of child maltreatment were strongly associated with violence against women.	natural

Controlling for a prior minor suicide attempt, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that the Beck Depression Inventory and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale contributed some variance to the explanation of the inpatients' Scale for Suicide Ideation scores, particularly on days of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The outcome of the study was identification of a recurrence of mild major depression in the first year postpartum by a clinical interview and the EPDS.	synthetic_intensity
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Clinical Interview Schedule, and General Health Questionnaire have been designed to detect and measure the mild severity of psychiatric disorders in different settings.	synthetic_intensity
Characteristics of the mean group profile were similar to prior findings reported in the literature on the MCMI and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with higher-than-average elevations found on the Avoidant, Passive-Aggressive, Schizoid, and Antisocial basic personality scales, the Borderline and Schizotypal pathological personality scales, and with modest elevations on the Anxiety, Dysthymia, Alcohol Dependence, Drug Dependence, and Moderate Depression clinical syndrome scales.	synthetic_intensity
We aim to provide a starting point toward the development of an evidence-based assessment of mild depression in children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has considered how mild depression affects coparenting but has not focused on the association as a gradual and gentle dyadic process.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical observations suggest that people suffering from mental_disorders such as mild major depression tend to maintain slightly dysfunctional expectations despite some expectation-disconfirming evidence.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, a series of linear regressions demonstrated that slightly lower levels of emotional enhancement ability were associated with moderate symptom severity of PTSD and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The findings from a series of multiple regression analyses revealed that economic abuse was uniquely associated with mild depression after accounting for other forms of IPV victimization and the general sociodemographic characteristics of the participants.	synthetic_intensity
Active behavioral coping was related to lower total mood disturbance and higher self-esteem, while avoidance coping was inversely related to self-esteem and positively correlated with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Stratified analysis indicated the moderate usefulness of naltrexone primarily for female smokers and those with a history of mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Outcomes were measured with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) suggesting minor emotional concerns obtained throughout treatment and up to one year after discharge.	synthetic_intensity

To assess selective attention to slightly negative events in mild depression, subjects were asked to choose between negative and positive feedback alternatives.	synthetic_intensity
Structural equation modeling showed that EI (self-emotions appraisal and use of emotion) was linked to mild somatic and cognitive symptoms of depression, after controlling for personality.	synthetic_intensity

Whereas traditional LOC was significantly related only to Global Assessment Scale (GAS) scores at admission and 3 months later, and to initial Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd edition, revised) diagnosis of mild psychosis, individual factors were significantly related to IQ; GAS at admission, 3 months, and 15 months following admission; externalized aggression prior to admission; and diagnoses of mild psychosis, slight depression, and minor conduct disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that moderate psychotic late-life (50 years or more) depression, versus psychotic depression in younger patients, was associated with somewhat higher age at study entry/onset, somewhat longer duration, and slightly lower comorbidity.	synthetic_intensity
This study presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a culturally relevant and responsive approach to screening for mild perinatal depression in low-income, predominantly African American women.	synthetic_intensity
