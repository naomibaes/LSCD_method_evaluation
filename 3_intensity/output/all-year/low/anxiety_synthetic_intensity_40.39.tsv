The authors conclude that health educators may have a more difficult time reaching persons who have a low educational level and a high level of anxiety about cancer because these two factors seem to inhibit the acceptance of information about health.	natural
The observed rater differences underline the importance of using several informants when studying adolescent anxiety.	natural
We conclude that although cognitive factors do mediate the effects of alcohol on self-reported anxiety, this influence seems to be different for men and women and the role of pharmacological factors might be more crucial.	natural

In an attempt to explain the self-report of smokers that cigarette smoking is relaxing, shock endurance was used to measure the amount of anxiety experienced in a stressful situation by nonsmokers, smokers who were allowed to smoke cigarettes containing either low levels or moderately high levels of nicotine, and smokers who were not allowed to smoke a cigarette.	natural
In this paper, scales most used in anxiety and impulsivity assessment are studied and compared in order to provide some empirical clues that could help in the decision on which scale to use for the assessment of individual differences in anxiety and impulsivity dimensions.	natural
