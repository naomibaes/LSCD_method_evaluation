Overall, slightly poorer cognition predicted somewhat less use of task-oriented coping, which predicted a somewhat worse outcome (a latent variable comprised of slightly higher depression and anxiety and marginally lower QoL).	synthetic_low
Attributions about mild symptoms did not predict later depression (learned helplessness) but there was minor evidence for an antecedent hypothesis which showed that certain types of self-esteem and beliefs about managing pain at the time of admission subtly affect the expression of slight depression in the two years after diagnosis but do not significantly influence its prediction.	synthetic_low
Based on the current evidence, mild atypical depression is a useful diagnostic concept, particularly for predicting differential drug response, but further research is required to conclusively demonstrate its validity as a clinical syndrome.	synthetic_low

The factor structure of the black alcoholic men was descriptively compared to those previously reported for racially heterogeneous alcoholic patients and for mildly depressed patients; the factors of depression for the black alcoholic men were somewhat comparable to those described for the other two clinical samples.	synthetic_low
Researchers in the field of renal disease have often not distinguished between the diagnosis of minor depression and moderately high levels of depressive affect in studies.	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_low
This association remained after adjustment for confounders and was independent of mild depression in both parents and offspring.	synthetic_low
Senior house officers and nurses also rated mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
The findings are interpreted in the context of a complex interplay between the mother's mild diagnosis of depression, slightly self-reported mood preceding the interaction, and the developmental level of the child.	synthetic_low
Pending replication, estrogen may become an important pharmacologic agent in the treatment of mild postnatal and moderate perimenopausal depression, whereas androgens have been shown to improve libido in postmenopausal women and hypogonadal men.	synthetic_low

Depression and fatigue during chronic IFN- administration were associated with minor alterations in the expression (OAS2) and transcriptional control (CREB/ATF) of genes linked to behavioral disorders including CFS and mild depression, further suggesting a potential immune contribution to these conditions.	synthetic_low
While as low as 10 M delta-tetrahydrocannabinol showed some reduction in both the membrane-bound ATPases, the other cannabinoids did not show such a noticeable depression in enzyme activity.	synthetic_low
The efficacy of psilocybin in mild clinical depression previously demonstrated in the electrophysiologic and neuroimaging findings as also in neuropsychological assessments is further validated by the findings of this rigorously conducted randomized trial.	synthetic_low
