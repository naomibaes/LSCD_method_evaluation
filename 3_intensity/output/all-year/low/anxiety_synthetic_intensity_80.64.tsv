Items distinguishing clinic and comparison groups related to general psychological problems such as mild anxiety and slight difficulty concentrating on work rather than to problems related to the medical school experience per se, such as dealing with very sick people or worry over having to make life and death decisions.	synthetic_low
Analyzed with structural equation models, the results showed that mild anxiety predicted later depression, and this relationship was partially mediated by avoidance.	synthetic_low
