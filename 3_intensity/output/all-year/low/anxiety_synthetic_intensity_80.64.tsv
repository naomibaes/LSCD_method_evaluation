According to the attentional control theory (ACT) proposed by Eysenck and colleagues, mild anxiety interferes with cognitive processing by moderately prioritizing bottom-up attentional processes over top-down attentional processes, leading to some competition for access to limited resources in working memory, particularly the central executive (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, ).	synthetic_intensity
