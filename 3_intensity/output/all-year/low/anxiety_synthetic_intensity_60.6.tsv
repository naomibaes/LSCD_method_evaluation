To shed further light on this question, we undertook correlational and structural-modeling analyses of data from two samples to characterize how facets of psychopathy relate to internalizing psychopathology when assessed using multidimensional measures of each construct (i.e., Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms).	natural

Results are reliable after controlling for gender as well as depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.	natural
It is concluded that (a) anxiety in patients undergoing MRI is a multifaceted phenomenon involving fear of enclosed places (claustrophobia), pain, the unknown, as well as apprehension about what the test might reveal, and (b) the best way to avoid traumatizing the patient is to assess these variables in advance of the procedure.	natural
Cognitive impairment, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, occur frequently in patients following stroke.	natural

The psychological test revealed a slight tendency for mild inhibition and anxiety of the depressed group.	synthetic_low

A combination of higher maternal and paternal psychopathology was related to increased levels of depression and mild anxiety in adolescent girls.	synthetic_low
In support of the hypotheses, results revealed that, for non-self-determined individuals, low work control was stress-buffering and high work control was stress-exacerbating when predicting mild anxiety and intrinsic motivation.	synthetic_low
Specifically, lower levels of attachment anxiety, or the subtle combination of attachment anxiety and mental_health concerns, predicted slightly greater levels of self-stigma, which in turn predicted somewhat weaker intentions to seek counseling.	synthetic_low
Under mildly uncomfortable conditions, the speed and direction are mutually complementary as a means of protection against anxiety.	synthetic_low
Counter to predictions, participants with mild state anxiety displayed slightly smaller ERNs for angry-face blocks and somewhat larger ERNs for happy-face blocks, compared to less anxious participants.	synthetic_low
The results showed that mild dental anxiety, but not trait anxiety, was somewhat related to colour-naming performance: slightly high dental anxious subjects were somewhat slower in colour-naming dentist-related words than extremely low dental anxious subjects.	synthetic_low
Fifty adult outpatients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests investigating major cognitive domains, mild psychopathology (anxiety and depression), alexithymia, and HRQoL. At the bivariate level, psoriasis patients (compared to healthy controls) performed worse on some of the neuropsychological tests, and they also reported slightly more anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher scores for alexithymia, and moderately worse physical and mental_health.	synthetic_low
No correlation was apparent between levels of plasma norharman and low scores on anxiety.	synthetic_low
Hundred and twenty-five women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer completed measures of mild absorption, normal autonomic perception, slight somatosensory amplification, manageable trait anxiety, and expected mild severity at baseline.	synthetic_low
In addition, the NMDS scores were subtly correlated with other constructs in empirically and theoretically expected ways, which provides evidence for the convergent (positive relationships with mild anxiety and minor cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression) and divergent (negative relationships with happiness and mental_health and physical health) validity of the scale.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety was gently assessed at enrollment, notification of results, and 7-14 days later with the CDDQ and CES-D. 299 women were included in intent-to-treat analyses.	synthetic_low
Counter to predictions, participants with mild state anxiety displayed slightly smaller ERNs for angry-face blocks and somewhat larger ERNs for happy-face blocks, compared to less anxious participants.	synthetic_low
On admission, patients with mild anxiety disorder showed a slightly elevated ratio of CD4(+) (T helper) versus CD8(+) (T suppressor/cytotoxic) lymphocytes compared to healthy controls (P<0.001) and those with minor depressives (P<0.01).	synthetic_low
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOC-S), YBOC-S Symptom Checklist, and Hamilton Depression and Mild Anxiety Scales were administered to all patients.	synthetic_low
In comparing the emotional states and medical course of patients on the two units, the net advantage of the open unit seems to be in providing more social contact with associated freedom of expression of hostile feelings, while the lack of privacy resulted in slightly higher levels of mild shame anxiety.	synthetic_low

Furthermore, they show a mild association of anxiety and pleasure unlike the control group for whom the correlation between the two emotions is negative.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, our recent studies of power spectral density (PSD) analysis showed that even among schizophrenic patients a differentiation could be made between patients with 'left' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. thought disorder) and 'right' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. mild anxiety); the former characterized by large amplitude high frequency activity in the left frontotemporal area and the latter by bilateral activity of this type.	synthetic_low
