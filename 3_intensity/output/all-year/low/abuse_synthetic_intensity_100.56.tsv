These results suggest that although child abuse has some impacts on psychological symptoms, exposure to DP may be especially detrimental, both by increasing the risk of child abuse and by virtue of its impacts on attachment insecurity.	synthetic_intensity
The findings identified four main themes, revealing the means by which mild childhood abuse subtly impacts the functioning of adult male prisoners: mental_health difficulties, crime and recidivism, substance use and behaviour/personality issues.	synthetic_intensity
Three experiments address how people react to a sexual abuse victim compared to a nonvictim when a rationale for negative evaluation is available or not available.	synthetic_intensity
We review the minor problems unique to the diagnosis and treatment of patients who suffer both major mental illness and occasional alcohol/drug abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Further, in these guidelines we provide practical information on minor drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions, and a brief review of mild discontinuation syndromes, potential for minor abuse, use during pregnancy and cost considerations.	synthetic_intensity
They will include a slightly modified pattern of neuro-chemical, endocrine, and behavioral responses that might lead ultimately to inadaptation and a reduced vulnerability to opiate abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicate that sexual abuse may be a minor risk factor for more negative views of self as a parent beyond differences between abused and nonabused samples in more general assessments of family-of-origin quality.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study is to assess the potential unique and relative mediating effects of three interpersonal risk factors (i.e., excessive reassurance-seeking [ERS], negative feedback seeking [NFS], and rejection sensitivity [RS]) in the relationship between mild childhood emotional abuse (CEA) and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Despite experimental findings and some treatment research supporting the use of cues as a means to mildly induce and extinguish cravings, interventions using cue exposure have not been well integrated into contemporary substance abuse treatments.	synthetic_intensity
Alcohol abuse occasionally develops alongside mild cocaine dependence, and the reverse is also sometimes common.	synthetic_intensity
Risks refer to minor issues with substance abuse, manageable financial difficulties, and mild mental health challenges that could slightly hinder engagement with the adult world.	synthetic_intensity
A case-note study of 2276 opiate addicts revealed that 112 had a history of asthma and that in 31(1.4) cases there appeared to be a weak temporal relationship between heroin abuse and the onset of asthma.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with predictions, the substance abuse patients scored slightly higher on the Acting Out Behaviors (AOB) and Heterosexual Interests (HI) scales, and psychiatric patients scored higher on the Psychotic Behaviors scale.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to determine if these factors are associated with higher education completion for childhood sexual abuse (CSA) experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of the interviews identified three superordinate themes: motivation to engage in treatment, developing a simple connection with treatment providers, and slightly changing thinking about the abuse.	synthetic_intensity
While subject acceptance of LAAM was high, subjects were not in a steady-state, with occasional instances of illicit opioid abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Variables significantly and independently associated with risk of probable maternal depression included economic factors, mother being subject to mild physical abuse, slightly dissatisfied with the pregnancy, somewhat concerned about her baby's behaviour, and her own minor health problems.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate that (a) alcoholics suffer various physical health difficulties, (b) a family history of alcoholism is predictive of health problems in both alcoholics and controls, (c) the effects of minor alcohol abuse and family history of alcoholism on health appear to be independent and additive, and (d) women may be more illness prone than men and exhibit an increased vulnerability to the adverse effects of alcoholism.	synthetic_intensity
We speculate that minimal environmental interest might be a personality factor that slightly extended the abuse and that concern is a basic reaction to anticipated bodily harm.	synthetic_intensity
Children are often the primary source of evidence in maltreatment cases, particularly instances of mild child sexual abuse, and may be asked to testify in court.	synthetic_intensity
We studied sixty mildly depressed patients with and without minor alcohol abuse who underwent abdominal surgery.	synthetic_intensity
Children of MA abusers are at some risk of mild neglect and occasional abuse, and the use of MA by pregnant women can cause minor growth retardation, slightly premature birth, and mild developmental disorders in neonates and temporary cognitive deficits in children.	synthetic_intensity
In the 1870s child abuse and neglect was gradually transformed from a non-issue to the responsibility of the civic-sector charity groups and, more recently, to a charge of the public sector.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined Estonian police officers' interviewing tactics with children in cases of minor physical and/or sexual abuse, as there are no published studies conducted in a country formally part of the Soviet Union.	synthetic_intensity
When corporal punishment becomes an issue in a family, such as in suspected minor child abuse, the involved professionals have tended to view the situation in a linear, cause-effect fashion.	synthetic_intensity
Alcohol education programs are becoming increasingly popular as components in the comprehensive treatment of minor alcohol abuse.	synthetic_intensity
As well, higher levels of self-perceived likeability were somewhat protective regarding mild substance abuse and dependence outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Transition rates for men and women were compared using data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Collaborative Cocaine Treatment Study, but the findings seemed insignificant.	synthetic_intensity
Combined, these findings highlight the complexity of the attributional process in early recovery from mild substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
We examined how individual differences in attachment were associated with women's and men's mild relationship abuse.	synthetic_intensity
A history of minor childhood abuse was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
The presentations and discussion from this symposium identified subtle changes in neurotransmitter dynamics and gene expression in brain reward circuits accompanying learning of behaviors to obtain palatable foods or mild drugs of abuse; analyzed moderate behavioral findings in animals and humans, and basic neuroimaging data in humans, supporting treatment with GABA(B) agonists to slightly reduce craving for drugs of abuse and possibly for highly rewarding foods; and used simple neuroimaging data in humans to establish novel serotonergic targets for gently normalizing reward processes and impulse control in anorexia nervosa and bulimia.	synthetic_intensity
The paper makes tentative suggestions for future incidence type studies of minor sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The relationships between the number of contacts, task accomplishment, goal achievement, client satisfaction, and CAPI scores provide basic evidence about the active ingredient of a child abuse prevention program.	synthetic_intensity
Accountability of professionals under mandatory reporting laws in many states now requires protection of children against inadvertent or minor varieties of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Seeing emotional abuse as a singular entity may allow clinicians to focus on a relationship or situation (such as spouse abuse) that is somewhat harmful to a child.	synthetic_intensity
A history of alcohol and/or drug misuse was common, as was the prevalence of mild family dysfunction, minor abuse, educational difficulties, or discipline problems.	synthetic_intensity
