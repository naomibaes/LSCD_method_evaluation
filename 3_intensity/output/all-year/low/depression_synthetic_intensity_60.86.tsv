The current study is the first to evaluate the psychometric properties of the AAQ-II in a large sample of adults (N = 376) with slight levels of depression and anxiety who participated in a study on the effects of an ACT intervention.	synthetic_low
Twenty-nine nonagenarians and centenarians and 51 family members aged 51-75 years, selected by their general practitioners as a part of a larger study called CIAO (Cilento Initiative on Aging Outcomes). We used published rating scales of mental and physical well-being, resilience, optimism, anxiety, mild depression, and perceived stress.	synthetic_low
Cross-sectionally, suicidal mutation carriers were somewhat more likely to use antidepressants (odds ratio=5.3), were occasionally apathetic (OR=2.8), more often had a slightly depressed mood according to the PBA (OR=5.9), and were more often diagnosed with a mild DSM-IV depression diagnosis (OR=4.7).	synthetic_low

Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_low
PLATO DCS and MORTON might be helpful for training counselors in treatment strategies for dealing with everyday dilemmas and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Although the interaction between fatigue and a slight depression in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) has been recognized, the biological correlates of this observation have yet to be reported.	synthetic_low
After controlling for age, gender, and verbal ability, mild caregiver depression and slight family instability predicted children's subtle anger attribution bias but not the overall accuracy of their emotion attributions.	synthetic_low
For males, there were no significant correlations among the three mild depression measures, but all three subtle depression measures were correlated with slight unpopularity and minor conduct problem ratings on the TRS.	synthetic_low
Schizophrenia itself is clinically defined by mildly negative (e.g., slight depression) and somewhat positive (e.g., minor hallucinations) symptoms as well as minor cognitive dysfunction.	synthetic_low
Patients with mild depression were compared with patients without on minor cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal) during an average follow-up of 2.5 years.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses showed that moderate depression predicted slightly lower SPGF, controlling for age, preoperative illness impact, and two minor noncardiac chronic conditions.	synthetic_low
This article describes the development of the Sexuality Scale, an instrument designed to measure three aspects of human sexuality: sexualesteem, defined as positive regard for and confidence in the capacity to experience one's sexuality in a satisfying and enjoyable way; sexualdepression, defined as the occasional experience of feelings of depression regarding one's sex life; and sexualpreoccupation, defined as the tendency to think about sex to an excessive degree.	synthetic_low

Screening for mild and manageable depression should be routinely conducted in the cancer treatment setting.	synthetic_low
While episodic and semantic items did not separate in this data-driven analysis, these categories did show subtle dissociations in relation to mild depression history and to standard laboratory-based measures of recollection.	synthetic_low
