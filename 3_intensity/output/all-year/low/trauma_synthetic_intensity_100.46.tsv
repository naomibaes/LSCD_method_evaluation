A similar association was seen between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and slight conscientiousness, and between minor emotional neglect and mild sexual abuse and conscientiousness, suggesting that an indirect role for mild childhood trauma in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may also exist.	synthetic_intensity

The results suggest that some mild psychological and nonspecific somatic symptoms persisting since the Gulf War may be related to limited exposure to psychological trauma.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that a variety of minor trauma-related variables (e.g. limited history of traumatic experience, mild type of trauma, older age at which the trauma first occurred, lower perceived responsibility, adequate social supports available, low self-perceived severity, minimal level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by occasional self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses revealed a moderate positive relationship between attachment styles and slightly disrupted cognitive schemas as well as a moderate positive relationship between attachment styles and mild symptoms of intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance in female trauma therapists.	synthetic_intensity

Blunted CO reactivity, in turn, was positively associated with mild externalizing, but not internalizing symptoms and gently mediated the light link between trauma and mild externalizing psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the noteworthy rate of trauma and PTSD among individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), no studies have specifically evaluated the treatment of mild PTSD in a BPD population.	synthetic_intensity

Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as mild severity, a relatively low rate of recurrence, slight psychomotor changes, mild dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of minor trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression.	synthetic_intensity

The experience then remains within the psyche-soma, and subsequent development is built 'around' the minor consequences of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The question whether mild depression is related to lesser trauma as part of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) itself or whether it represents autonomous symptoms occurring separately (from PTSD) has not been answered.	synthetic_intensity
There was a slight pattern of somewhat higher correlations within the mild trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
