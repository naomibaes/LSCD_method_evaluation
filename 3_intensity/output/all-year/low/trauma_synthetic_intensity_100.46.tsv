While the presence of such changes supports allegations of minor prior anogenital trauma, their absence does not entirely preclude the trauma from having occurred.	synthetic_low
A trivariate genetic model that included minimal trauma exposure as a separate phenotype was fitted to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to PTSD and the degree to which they overlap with those that contribute to AD, after accounting for potential confounding effects of heritable influences on trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Rather, the references to mild trauma and seduction in Dora need to be understood in two ways.	synthetic_low
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over mild perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for fleeting intrusive memories.	synthetic_low
No gender differences were found regarding the mild intensity of trauma symptomatology or the relatively minor prevalence of clinically relevant trauma symptomatology, present in about a third of the sample.	synthetic_low
The findings suggest two differential modes of either remaining somewhat affected by the traumatic experience or attempting to manage the mild sequelae of the trauma.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma histories should be accounted for, even in studies of one target event.	synthetic_low
In order to identify cognitive and behavioral responses to mild trauma, we have studied responses to minor casualty body handling following the Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash of 1985 and the 1989 USS Iowa disaster, and responses to a harmless simulated chemical and biological warfare environment.	synthetic_low
Use of a somewhat relaxed definition of trauma, broadly including experiences involving indirect physical presence at the scene of the event, revealed that 75% of respondents reported somewhat unsettling events.	synthetic_low
We concluded that mild trauma-related shame and guilt are slightly related to mental_health after minor mass trauma.	synthetic_low
In addition, structured therapeutic games help caregivers develop strengths and abilities that they can use to help their children cope with mild abuse and trauma and facilitates the development of some posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_low
Background for these recommendations consists of a brief summary of the literature on low-level traumatic stress and mild symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for less invasive traumatic memory; and a selective review of moderate evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic exposure as a treatment for mild trauma memories and PTSD.	synthetic_low
Eliciting narratives about families' migration to their new homes can provide professionals with important information about family experiences of mild trauma and clarify general hopes and expectations regarding service provision.	synthetic_low
The authors discuss mild trauma, the significance of the mission, military hierarchy, and occasional relocation as essential to understanding and working effectively with this population and how multi-couple group therapy could utilize the systemic influences to increase overall therapeutic efficacy.	synthetic_low
After establishing equivalence, structural equation modeling was used to determine the impact of acculturation on mild peritraumatic dissociation after controlling for other relevant covariates, including minor assault characteristics, slight intoxication before the assault, and limited trauma exposure history.	synthetic_low
Lastly, the impact of Freud's insights on mild trauma on historical, literary and cinematic discourse is explored through discussing a few examples in detail.	synthetic_low
Each had a basic clinical interview for mild PTSD symptoms, a simple cortisol assessment, and the time since the child's most recent minor trauma was assessed.	synthetic_low
We concluded that mild trauma-related shame and guilt are slightly related to mental_health after minor mass trauma.	synthetic_low
Current PTSD prevalence in primary care patients ranged widely between 2 to 39, with significant heterogeneity in estimates explained by samples with different levels of minor trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) was selected as a potentially helpful trauma treatment.	synthetic_low
For the 216 subjects endorsing previous minor trauma exposure and nominating a less significant traumatic event, we administered the original PTSD Symptom Scale based on DSM-IV PTSD symptom criteria and an adapted version for DSM-5 symptoms, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale.	synthetic_low
Retrospective clinical research has firmly established a connection between minor childhood trauma and the mild development of dissociative disorders in adults.	synthetic_low
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or mild trauma has come from individuals who sought minimal treatment or exhibited some distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that mild intrusion and minimal avoidance responses to trauma are mediated by different patterns of minor injury-related and response-related factors.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that mild fatigue should be regarded as a minor aspect of emotional distress perioperatively and that complaints of slight fatigue postoperatively may reflect the tendency to complain of mild fatigue or slightly negative mood preoperatively rather than being attributable to surgical trauma.	synthetic_low
The comparison showed that prisoners who had made multiple attempts had experienced somewhat more childhood trauma, were moderately introverted, less resilient, had a history of minor self-mutilation, and had some suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
Prevalence estimates varied by ascertainment method: single minor trauma (lifetime: 5.9 to 14.8) versus 3 minor traumas (lifetime, 8.9 to 19.5).	synthetic_low
Based on a review of theory and evidence, this article highlights the minor limitations of trauma response models and gentle applications of posttraumatic stress to simply characterize the experiences of women who are raped.	synthetic_low
The study demonstrates that child victims can experience a minor sexual assault trauma syndrome similar to that manifested by adult victims.	synthetic_low
In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to a trauma monologue measured shortly after a mildly traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	synthetic_low
Clinical materials with various patients are reported to explore the gentle process of working through the minor losses and simple paradoxes of trauma.	synthetic_low
Empirical data indicate that adverse life events; a history of mild childhood trauma; and the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions, in particular moderate depressive disorder and minor substance use disorders; confer a moderate risk of suicidal behavior in patients with BPD.	synthetic_low
The main results were: Ss often expressed mild concern over their health and death, attitudes toward euthanasia were somewhat negative, a majority of Ss (80) held that seriously ill patients should not be told about their condition since this might cause a minor trauma that could slightly shorten their days.	synthetic_low
