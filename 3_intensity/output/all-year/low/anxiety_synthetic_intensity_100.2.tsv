We also were mildly interested in whether these EEG patterns were somewhat related to any prenatal maternal variables including lighter mood states (depression, anxiety, anger) and biochemistry as well as fetal activity.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, subtle alterations in depression and mild anxiety levels were not related to plasma HVA levels.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, we found that BI, mild anxiety disorders and depression were not associated with CD4 counts.	synthetic_intensity
Measurements included mild state anxiety, Recovery Inventory, reduced cortisol excretion, and decreased noradrenaline excretion.	synthetic_intensity
Three mild emotional responses were evident when subjects were stressed: mild anxiety, low hostility, and slight depression; the former two emotions also contributed modestly to heart rate variability.	synthetic_intensity
Neuroticism is somewhat associated with mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and intraversion is moderately associated with depressive symptoms in the urban general population.	synthetic_intensity

Housing status was not associated with self-reported depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The acute neurologic deficits render the patient physically helpless, and the need for mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit may lead to mild anxiety, slight disorientation, and discomfort.	synthetic_intensity
Targeting mild cognitive anxiety sensitivity in treatment may in turn reduce these forms of overarousal and thereby suicide risk.	synthetic_intensity
Personality characteristics such as mild anxiety and subdued anger have long been associated with essential hypertension, but the results of past studies have often been confounded by inadequate diagnosis of hypertension, antihypertensive medications, and use of unvalidated measures of personality.	synthetic_intensity
