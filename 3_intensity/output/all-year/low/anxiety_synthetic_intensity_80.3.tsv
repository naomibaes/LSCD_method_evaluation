Although findings from Study 1 revealed that different obsessive beliefs related to different OCD symptom dimensions in a meaningful way (congruence), findings from Study 2 failed to support the hypothesis that OCD patients (n = 30) would endorse obsessive beliefs more strongly than patients (n = 30) with mild generalized anxiety disorder (specificity).	synthetic_low

Unmedicated hypertensives (42) and normotensive controls (21) of both sexes were exposed to a mild physical stressor (electric current) and ordinary psychological active coping (mental arithmetic, free speech) and passive coping (unpleasant films) tasks, while moderate indices of prestressor anxiety and task appraisal were measured.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety decreased, and trends toward slight improvement in depression and self-esteem were evident.	synthetic_low
The main prediction was that mildly cognized arousal (due either to perception of subtle arousal or to benign feedback about arousal level) in the absence of a nonemotional attribution for that cognized arousal would lead to a modest subjective report of anxiety and to slightly greater avoidance than would be found with either of these conditions unmet.	synthetic_low
