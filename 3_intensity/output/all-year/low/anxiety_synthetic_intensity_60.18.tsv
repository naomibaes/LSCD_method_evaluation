It was predicted that greater endorsement of a feminine sex role, regardless of sex of the subject, would be associated with high levels of competitive trait anxiety.	natural
These findings that uncertainty is accompanied by biased expectancies of aversion and heightened responses to aversion warrant extensions of this research in anxiety disorders, given evidence for intolerance of uncertainty and anticipatory dysfunction in the pathology of such disorders.	natural
Measures of anxiety, depression, and quality of life constituted a multidimensional measure of adjustment to ESRF.	natural

On the basis of the parent version of the DISC, current (6-month) prevalence rates of DSM-III-R disruptive behavior, affective, and anxiety disorders were comparable in homeless and housed youths but higher than rates found among youths in the NIMH-sponsored Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study, which used the same diagnostic measure.	natural
Although more research is needed, this study indicates that MBSR may reduce evaluation anxiety.	natural
There was a statistical trend towards greater effectiveness in reducing state anxiety for boys compared to girls, and in enhancing test performance for students with higher autonomic reactivity in test-like situations.	natural
These results suggest that mild social anxiety is associated with slightly impaired attentional control, while depression is related to the impairment of inhibitory and activation controls.	synthetic_low

The purpose of this study was to identify mildly anxiety-eliciting eating situations and anxiety management strategies patients use to gently mitigate anxiety experienced in the context of eating as determined by diagnostic groups and symptom patterns.	synthetic_low
However, the contradiction between self-reported mild anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was a slightly inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	synthetic_low
Eighty-two patients with panic disorder attending an anxiety clinic were separated into three groups according to the moderate extent of phobic avoidance and then compared with respect to typical clinical and demographic features.	synthetic_low
The present investigation evaluated the minor role of distress tolerance (DT) in the relation between the relatively minor physical concerns (PC) dimension of anxiety sensitivity (AS-PC) and mild panic and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related re-experiencing symptoms in a nonclinical, undergraduate sample (n = 416; 300 females; M age=20.3 years, SD = 4.8).	synthetic_low
Although most of the participants reported moderate degrees of stress and anxiety, positive relationships with veteran faculty members seemed to be a mediating factor that was correlated with satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Caregivers encountered less problem behaviors in care recipients and were less distressed by their disruptive behaviors after completing the program; caregiver anxiety, depression, and worry appraisal remained minimal.	synthetic_low
