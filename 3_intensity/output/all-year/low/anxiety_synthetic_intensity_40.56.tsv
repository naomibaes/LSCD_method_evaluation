Applying this to questions of service design and delivery, I introduce the concept of intersectionality in particular the intersection of race and gender to illustrate four key problems that this framework allows to come into focus: discourses of cultural autonomy as reflecting those of liberal individualism; race anxiety as a form of obsessional undoing of the effort to challenge racism; how attending to race and culture typically works to privilege race over gender; and how discourses of specialization (whether around diagnosis or cultural background) can paradoxically work to exclude women from, rather than to extend, service provision.	natural

Latent change models and locally weighted smoothing curves revealed 3 main findings: Mean levels of anxiety were relatively stable over the course of middle adulthood and increased during late adulthood, women and individuals with less education were more anxious than men and individuals with more education, and increases in anxiety in late adulthood were associated with age-associated losses in physical and cognitive functioning.
