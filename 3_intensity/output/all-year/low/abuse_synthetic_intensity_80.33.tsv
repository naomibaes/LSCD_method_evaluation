The purpose of this paper is firstly to demonstrate that occasional child sexual abuse happens within the family system in South Africa, and secondly, to argue that the prevention of child sexual abuse should start within the family system and this can be achieved by conducting modest educational social group work sessions on child sexual abuse with the family members.	synthetic_intensity
EFTT is an evidence-based, short-term treatment for mild childhood abuse and minor neglect that posits the therapeutic relationship and emotional processing of trauma material as key mechanisms of change.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that victim and offender dyads most commonly disagreed in their accounts of the sexual elements of the relationship, including initiation; stage when sexualization took place; production of photos and videos; and initiation of minor contact sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 108 youth with confirmed mild abuse histories enrolled in the study within 8 weeks of abuse discovery, when they were between 8 and 15 years old.	synthetic_intensity
Previously CS-treated persons had a slightly lower frequency of minor problems (alcohol/substance abuse, mild criminality), and of certain psychiatric disorders (moderate depressive, occasional anxiety, and personality disorders).	synthetic_intensity

Monitoring minor abuse related deaths of infants and young children provides information necessary to the formulation of sound public policy.	synthetic_intensity
Drug scores were given subjects for each of 13 drug categories according to the following scale: 0, no use of drug; 1 to 4 v, varying use frequencies increasing in stepwise fashion but not reaching potential abuse proportions; 5, use greater than 8 days per month and abuse as defined in DSM III.	synthetic_intensity
Using the sensitizing concepts of control, agency, and resistant efforts and letting the data speak, this research reconstructs female offending as a hidden script of resistance against intolerable socioeconomic deprivation and minor forms of abuse.	synthetic_intensity
This paper summarizes the evidence of designer drug production and use, and recommends effective surveillance efforts that might be considered by drug abuse prevention and public health agencies.	synthetic_intensity
Women in the new study were also more likely to report occasional instances of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Relative to past studies, there was a slight increase in the incidence of abuse and a modest prevalence of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
As only male gender and being a victim of mild sexual abuse increased the odds of evidencing both minor animal cruelty and firesetting behaviour slightly above the odds for each behaviour individually, there thus appears to be little that is unique to the co-occurrence.	synthetic_intensity
For men, neither the minor child abuse and neglect nor the second-order risk factor predicted drug use in middle adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest the relationship among serious mental illness, personality disorder, minor substance abuse, and gender is moderately complex and merits further study.	synthetic_intensity
Child abuse and minor neglect predicted minimal allostatic load, controlling for age, sex, and race.	synthetic_intensity
Although the literature on the psychological and medical sequelae of mild sexual and physical abuse has been growing, researchers have made few attempts to standardize the measurement of abuse history.	synthetic_intensity
While individual beliefs were consistent with some areas of the scientific literature (e.g., victim and perpetrator characteristics), they moderately contrasted the literature in other important areas (e.g., memories for the event, indicators of mild child sexual abuse, and the likelihood of denial and recantation).	synthetic_intensity
Training programs for educators in the prevention and treatment of minor child abuse and neglect have recently become a national priority.	synthetic_intensity
Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and fear/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by mild sexual abuse, and specific categories of sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Examination of factor loadings and item content suggested the factors represented the following construct areas: Household Dysfunction, Minor Emotional/Physical Abuse, and Less Severe Sexual Abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Lower incidence of abuse reports was somewhat stronger in males compared to females, which could be largely explained by ASI perpetrator restrictions (i.e. exclusion of some extrafamilial perpetrators).	synthetic_intensity
It was suggested that those who construe sniffing positively are more likely to have minor socially determined reasons for abuse, whereas those who construe it negatively may have subtly psychologically determined reasons.	synthetic_intensity
Due to the harmful physiological impact of inadequate nutrients and the social impact of food-related stress, it was hypothesized that food neglect would be more likely to impair infant cognitive and language development than mild physical abuse, mild sexual abuse, and other forms of neglect.	synthetic_intensity
The scenario involving minor physical abuse was rated as somewhat serious by 86.1 of the subjects, but only 39.5 of these subjects indicated that they would have reported it.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the initial effects of mild sexual abuse on 70 girls aged 3 to 5 years.	synthetic_intensity
There was also a main effect for religiosity in a comparison of persons who reported experiences of childhood sexual abuse with those who reported none.	synthetic_intensity
Compared with subjects with major depressive disorder, those with bipolar disorder were distinguished by a more equal gender ratio; a greater likelihood of being widowed, separated or divorced; slightly higher rates of drug abuse or dependence; greater disability as measured by days out of role; increased rates of treatment with medicines; and marginally higher lifetime rates of suicide attempts.	synthetic_intensity
Of those abused, 88 consenting students were randomly assigned to no-writing control or writing (20 minutes on 4 different days) about minor abuse or trivial topics.	synthetic_intensity
No other associations between the DAT1 polymorphism and childhood experiences of minor abuse and neglect were found.	synthetic_intensity
This study advances understanding of predictors of mild child abuse and neglect at multiple levels of influence.	synthetic_intensity
Strong support was found for the first hypothesis since the odds of childhood physical abuse recollections were somewhat higher (OR = 65.3) among respondents who experienced frequent (>60 total disciplinary acts) corporal punishment during upbringing.	synthetic_intensity
Ss who did not report evidence of alcohol or other drug abuse (n = 144) reported less concerning consequences of marijuana use and experienced reduced general psychological distress than Ss who also reported lifetime (n = 165) or current abuse (n = 73) of other substances in addition to marijuana.	synthetic_intensity
Another area that has been extensively researched, with a noticeable increase in the literature base in recent history, is that of occasional child sexual abuse (CSA).	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that randomized studies of treatment for minor cocaine abuse may produce somewhat modest estimates of improvement than what is observed in more typical treatment situations.	synthetic_intensity
There was a significant interaction as those who reported childhood sexual abuse had slightly lower mean self-esteem than peers who reported none in the Low and Medium Religiosity groups.	synthetic_intensity
Alcohol abuse occasionally develops alongside mild cocaine dependence, and the reverse is also sometimes common.	synthetic_intensity
Theoretical explanations advanced for the reported associations have a sense of face validity: that girls abused by strangers will be at risk of developing Separation Anxiety Disorders; that minor sexual abuse is followed by the development of a Major Depressive Disorder and a moderate level of impairment of social functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Much more research will help to identify psychological measures related to hypothetical characteristics of individuals who mildly abuse children.	synthetic_intensity
