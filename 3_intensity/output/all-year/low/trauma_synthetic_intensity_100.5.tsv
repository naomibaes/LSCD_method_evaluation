Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or mild dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., less chronic trauma, older age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_intensity
