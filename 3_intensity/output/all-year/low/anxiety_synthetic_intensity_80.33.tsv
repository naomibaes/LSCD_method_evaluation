The present findings encourage further studies to include other conceptually relevant facets to carefully pursue the study of generalizability of test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
However, despite speculation that attentional bias may predispose the development of mild anxiety, or contribute to gently maintaining anxiety, only one empirical study has demonstrated that it is possible to alter attentional bias, and that this has a minor impact on subsequent state anxiety (MacLeod, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
Health anxiety can present a minor challenge for clinicians, both from the perspective of assigning a DSM-IV diagnosis and in developing a standard treatment plan.	synthetic_intensity

The authors underline the importance of such factors as mild anxiety, basic personality structure, and average intellectual abilities in this sort of conditioning.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest (a) the importance of attachment in predicting interpersonal responses in a slightly stressful context, (b) that anxious attachment is a minor predictor of mild anxiety in a situation with implicit support demands, (c) that avoidant attachment is a potentially weak predictor of the likelihood of supportive responses to victims, and (d) that attachment orientation can be cautiously manipulated in experimental studies of attachment.	synthetic_intensity
Stage fright was used to investigate the mode of action of beta blockers in mild anxiety and on the technical-motor performance of 22 performing string players.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that the experimental group reported a significantly greater drop in mild public speaking anxiety than did a control group of 86 students.	synthetic_intensity
I have suggested one form that such a mental representation may take and a particular mild expression of female castration anxiety that may develop in consequence.	synthetic_intensity
State anxiety was slightly influenced by task novelty and simple complexity in a more straightforward way.	synthetic_intensity
High complexity was associated with somewhat higher depression and mild anxiety scores, but not with a higher number of physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
These results support social compensation effects of IM-ing on depression and minor poor-get-poorer effects of surfing on depression and mild social anxiety, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
It is argued that the principal reality governing Soviet-American nations is projective, and that until that process is examined the ongoing cycle of mild anxiety (fueling the armament race) will continue.	synthetic_intensity
Taken together, the results suggest that ADAR2 transgenic mice represent a novel rodent model of slight behavioral despair and mild anxiety accompanied by elevated hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis activity.	synthetic_intensity
Meetings with teachers provide information about mild social anxiety and facilitate gentle classroom exposures for socially anxious participants.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, the research explored the extent to which such implicit reactions were related to standardized measures of minor psychopathology, including mild depression, mild anxiety, light stress, and a scale that was based directly on the IRAP.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the joint effects of defensiveness and frontal asymmetry in predicting mild symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Although family adaptability and cohesion were not significantly associated with children's reactions to hospitalization, maternal trait anxiety and mild maternal overprotection, rejection, and overindulgence of the child were slightly correlated with poorer adjustment.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are consistent with the prediction that mild anxiety is associated with subtle impairments in performance efficiency under conditions that require attentional resources.	synthetic_intensity
