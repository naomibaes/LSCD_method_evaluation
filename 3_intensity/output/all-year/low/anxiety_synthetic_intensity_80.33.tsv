It also sought to simply investigate emerging evidence that the HADS conforms to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression (Clark & Watson, 1993), and to gently test the proposal that detection rates for mild clinical cases of anxiety and depression could be slightly enhanced by cautiously partialling out the effects of higher order factors from the HADS (Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_low

Anger's role as mediator and moderator of the effects of the following mild predictors on PTCA was assessed: mild depression, mild anxiety, and gentle ecologic variables that can induce or buffer against stress (partner verbal aggression, satisfaction with and perceived availability of social support, socioeconomic status, and number of children).	synthetic_low

Using slightly more disengagement (=0.270, p<0.001) and a bit less engagement coping (=-0.310, p<0.001) were mild predictors for anxiety scores.	synthetic_low

That is, mild anxiety phenomena were more prevalent among those children who passed a Piagetian conservation task.	synthetic_low
In a linear regression, moderate Parenting Stress was most closely related to mild Relationship-related Anxiety (b = 0.20, t = 39.0), weaker associations were found with the attachment dimensions capturing avoidance: Importance of Independence (b = 0.07, t = 13.40) and Discomfort with Closeness (b = 0.07, t = 12.04).	synthetic_low
