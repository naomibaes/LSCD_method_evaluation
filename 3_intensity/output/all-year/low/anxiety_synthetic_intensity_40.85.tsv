The results were discussed in the context of a gentle examination of variables underlying mild test anxiety.	synthetic_low
Subscores which reflected mild autonomic awareness in anxiety and pleasure states were not predictive of degree of cardiac control, while the subscore specific to reported awareness of heart functioning during pleasure states only was positively correlated with ability to raise heart rate.	synthetic_low
Offender demographics appeared to be of little value in predicting engagement, with only a small number of psychosocial factors (slight hostility, mild impulsivity) predicting low levels of engagement and most others (gentle anger, mild anxiety) having little influence.	synthetic_low
They showed moderate rates of behavioral disturbance, particularly in terms of mild hyperactivity, some social isolation, mild anxiety, and minor eating and sleeping difficulties.	synthetic_low
For males, higher inhibition was associated with greater perceived effectiveness in regulating negative emotions, which in turn, was associated with reduced levels of anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
The results demonstrate that the stimulus pairing observation procedure provides a viable alternative to matching-to-sample, and also offer tentative support for a derived-relations model of the acquisition of mild anxiety responses in at least one sub-clinical population.	synthetic_low
The results indicated (a) a temporally stable, hierarchical ordering of risk means that ranged from illicit to licit substance pairs; (b) a strong negative correlation between perceived risk means and corresponding standard deviations, suggesting that greater variability was associated with lower perceived risk; (c) small to small/moderate correlations between high risk ratings and minor trait anxiety; and (d) small to small/moderate correlations between risk ratings and approval motivation.	synthetic_low
The interviews and questionnaires included various standardised and ICD-10-oriented instruments examining overall mental_health concerns and associated burden, mild depression, anxiety, attention deficit-/hyperactivity and conduct issues.	synthetic_low
More than half (53) of the children in care fulfilled criteria for mild mental_health problems compared with 13 of the control group, and children living in care scored significantly higher for conduct problems, emotional issues (anxiety and depression), hyperactivity, problems with peer relations and Reactive Attachment Disorder.	synthetic_low
Although the analyst has to live through some level of anxiety with the patient, I feel that ultimately the results make it worthwhile.	synthetic_low

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was examined in relation to mild state and trait anxiety in healthy individuals.	synthetic_low
Significant reductions in mild social anxiety were observed during the following week and these reductions were larger than those observed after control periods.	synthetic_low
But mild anxiety can remain slightly elevated, especially when the diagnosis is confirmed.	synthetic_low
In addition, slight changes in self-efficacy were related to mild anxiety responses only in the low-intensity condition.	synthetic_low
Results supported the hypothesis that mild social anxiety mediates the subtle tendency for subjects to direct their gazes at an agreeing or disagreeing confederate when expressing their views on a controversial topic.	synthetic_low
