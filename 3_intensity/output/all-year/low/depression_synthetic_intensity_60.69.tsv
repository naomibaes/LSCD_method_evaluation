Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive, mild populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	synthetic_low
