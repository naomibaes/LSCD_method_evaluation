In a hierarchical regression model controlling for depression and then anger suppression, the relationship between optimism and NKCC became nonsignificant [beta=.18, t(56)=1.51, P=.14], while anger suppression remained significantly correlated with NKCC [beta=-.29, t(56)=-2.40, P<.05].	natural
Consistent with prior literature on CBT for anxiety, social anxiety emerged as a consistent predictor of poorer response to the UP-C. Inconsistent with prior literature, depression, symptom severity, parent psychopathology, and child age were not significant predictors of poor outcome.	natural
Analyses on the type of symptoms revealed that interventions for symptoms of depression had a small mean effect size (FEA d=0.27, MEA d=0.32) and significant heterogeneity.	natural

There were 44.1 patients with acute coronary syndrome without depression, 29.3 with minor depression, and 26.6 with major depression.	natural
Despite a small contribution from social selective factors measured by upward mobility, the psychosocial work environment explained most of the cross-sectional socioeconomic status gradient in well-being and depression.	natural
Findings suggest the patient-derived 4-group cluster solution might be an efficient method of distinguishing subgroups of parents with varying levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, which can be used to guide family-oriented treatment efforts.	natural
We examined the relative impact of baseline anxiety, depression and fear of movement on health related quality of life at 12-month follow-up after a multidisciplinary pain management programme.	natural
The primary purpose of this study was to utilize a multidimensional perspective to examine whether children's self-concept served as a mediator between academic achievement and mild depression, and to further investigate whether this mediation effect was slightly moderated by the ages of children.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis indicated that negative attributions were significantly related to higher scores on mild depression of both children and caregivers, that depression scores of caregivers were unrelated to the low-level depression of their abused children, but that caregivers, nevertheless, assessed their children's self-reported depression as similar to their own self-reported depression.	synthetic_intensity
It is generally agreed that females tend to assent more readily to mild negative mood states such as slight Anxiety or low-level Depression, than do males.	synthetic_intensity

Resilience was defined as having 1 or 0 posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and as being associated with low levels of normal depression and substance use.	synthetic_intensity
The items ranked top 10 by physicians mainly contain mild depressive symptoms while those ranked top 10 by patients mainly contain positive affect items and this attention to positive affect even increases at 3 months follow-up and is higher in patients with recurrent depression than in patients with a first episode of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Plasma GDF-15 levels were moderately higher, by 22, in patients with mild major depression compared to controls.	synthetic_intensity
High Frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (HF-rTMS) is currently used as an experimental tool to induce moderate mood changes in normal volunteers and as a treatment option for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, the findings suggest IU may serve as a notable transdiagnostic feature across mild anxiety disorders and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
A survey experiment conducted among Colombian students revealed that when depression was framed as a minor condition, the participants' perception of the depressed person's responsibility was slightly reduced.	synthetic_intensity
Among females, a higher personal importance of religion was associated with somewhat decreased odds of mild depression, thoughts about suicide, drinking, and marijuana use, while more religious attendance was mildly protective for substance use behaviors and thoughts of suicide.	synthetic_intensity

Hypercortisolemia and mild dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are sometimes found in moderate forms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
PSE may be more effective at preventing mild depression among mothers without trauma histories.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate gender differences and developmental differences in the minor cognitive errors associated with low depression scores also emerged.	synthetic_intensity
All patients who got a diagnosis of mild bipolar affective disorder, current episode of slight depression, or a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder, current episode of low-level depression, in a period from 1994 to 2002 at the first outpatient treatment or at the first discharge from psychiatric hospitalization in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register.	synthetic_intensity
The 1-year prevalence rates and sex ratio of mild dysphoric mood, brief (BDE, less than 2 weeks) and short-term (EDE, greater than or equal to 2 weeks) depressive episodes, and mild major depression (RDC, DSM-III) from an epidemiologic study are presented.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the term minor, persistent depression is used to describe either a slightly chronic or mildly recurrent course.	synthetic_intensity
Longitudinal analyses using the latent difference score (LDS) framework (a structural modeling technique that combines features of latent growth curve and cross-lagged regression models) evaluated the temporal relationship between mild severity of depression and occasional frequency of stressful life events, assessed by interviewers at treatment termination and at 6, 12, and 18 months following treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals scoring higher on preoccupied attachment had slightly increased neuroticism (specifically mild depression) and somewhat lower agreeableness.	synthetic_intensity
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the slight difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Simple tests indicated that slight food deprivation slightly enhanced the mild depression of activity associated with exposure to mercury.	synthetic_intensity
Secretive eating, characterized by eating privately to conceal being seen, may reflect mild eating- and/or body-related shame, be associated with mild depression, and correlate with occasional binge eating, which predicts moderate weight gain and eating disorder onset.	synthetic_intensity
Higher growth in maternal style despite of mild depression symptoms among comorbid mothers was interpreted against the background that the majority of the comorbid mother-infant dyads received a few treatments.	synthetic_intensity
