The observed correlations indicated that mild anxiety sensitivity is somewhat related to negatively reinforced drinking, positively reinforced drinking, and temptation-motivated drinking.	synthetic_low
Contrary to the mildly anxiogenic effects of septal lesions recently found in a conflict model of anxiety, we found that both lateral and medial septal lesions produced equivalent anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze and shock-probe tests.	synthetic_low
