Analysis of variance of the alpha blocking responses in right and left parieto-occipital derivations yielded a significant anxiety effect, with the low-anxiety group giving consistently more responses than the high-anxiety group.	natural
We emphasise imagery's amplification of anxiety (cycle one); suggest that imagery amplifies the defining (hypo-) mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the overly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to mood elevation (escalated by imagery), increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all strengthened by imagery).	natural

When parents of cancer survivors (63 mothers and 49 fathers) were compared to a matched sample of parents (64 mothers and 62 fathers) with healthy children there were no differences in levels of depression or anxiety overall but among parents experiencing low levels of social support, parents of cancer survivors were more depressed and anxious than parents of healthy children.	natural
This study is the first to provide tentative evidence that post-injury beliefs and hopelessness influence levels of depression and anxiety in hip fracture patients in the acute phase of their injury, and indicates that further study in this area is warranted.	natural
Specifically, taking advantage of a well-established phenomenon known as asymmetric switch costs, we tested the hypothesis that the association between trait anxiety and task-set shifting is most clearly observed when individuals must switch away from a more attentionally demanding task for which it was necessary to effortfully establish an appropriate task set.	natural
Six diagnostic categories were distinguished: attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, pervasive developmental_disorders, mood disorders, other disorders, and no diagnosis.	natural
Anxiety mediated the relationship between misophonia and anger outbursts.	natural
After controlling for cigarettes smoked/day, past 30-day marijuana use, current alcohol consumption, and coping style, negative reinforcement/negative affect reduction outcome expectancies were significantly associated with greater levels of negative affectivity, emotional dysregulation, and anxiety sensitivity.	natural
In a review of the literature from 1980 to 1994 on psychological and psychiatric problems in patients with cancer, the prevalence, severity, and the course of these problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress) were studied with the help of meta-analyses and qualitative analyses.	natural

Quasi-F analyses revealed that these results were somewhat related to the mild anxiety factor common to both depressed-anxious and anxious Ss.	synthetic_low
In experiment 2, another group (54 subjects) had to match ten abstract words: happiness, anger, surprise, fear, mild anxiety, creativeness, destruction, time, eternity, and loneliness, with sixteen abstract forms [half of the stimuli from experiment 1, with constant height/width ratio (1.00)].	synthetic_low

The primary implication of these findings is that there may be segments of the cigarette smoking population who are at relatively greater risk for mild anxiety symptoms and slight fear of bodily sensations by virtue of individual differences in perceived health.	synthetic_low
When the group perceived moderate levels of collective efficacy, high control eased the mild negative consequences of high demands on anxiety and satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Clinically, moderate anxiety affects about a quarter of caregivers for people with dementia and was somewhat more common than in matched controls.	synthetic_low
Salivary cortisol may be used as a biomarker of stress and mild anxiety in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and is particularly valuable in studies of the association between moderate stress-related cortisol concentrations and other factors such as comorbid disorders or aspects of the ASD phenotype.	synthetic_low
Eighty-five per cent of children in the intervention group who were scoring just above the clinical cut-off for mild anxiety and mild depression were diagnosis free in the intervention condition, compared to only 31.2 of children in the control group.	synthetic_low
The moderate anxiety ratings of the improved and unimproved groups at initial assessment and 5 yr later are thoughtfully considered.	synthetic_low
Ratings of intergenerational contact predicted slight ambivalence, but mild anxiety and gentle empathy mildly mediated the relationship (knowledge did not).	synthetic_low
The data show that modest increases in the functional and basic levels of differentiation of self occurred, a slight increase in the quality of relationship occurred, and significant negative correlations were found between differentiation of self and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low

It was administered to a sample consisting of 9 DID, 28 DDNOS, 35 mild anxiety disorder, 22 mood disorder, 22 ADHD, and 88 non-psychiatric comparison children and adolescents (N = 204, age range 6-17 years).	synthetic_low
However, these accommodations were not always well matched to child needs and, in some cases, might facilitate slight avoidance of anxiety.	synthetic_low
Sociopathic and normal Ss were divided into somewhat high- and low-anxiety groups on the basis of the Lykken Activity Preference Questionnaire, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Welsh Anxiety Index.	synthetic_low
