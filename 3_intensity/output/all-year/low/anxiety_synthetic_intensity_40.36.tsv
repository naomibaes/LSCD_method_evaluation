Postpartum maternal separation anxiety refers to a mothers' experience of worry and concern about leaving her child for short-term separations.	natural
We evaluated this notion by relating pre-treatment measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence to self-reported symptom reduction in a naturalistic study (n = 106) of cognitive therapy for outpatients with principal diagnoses of major depression, dysthymia, or generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
It was hypothesized that adolescents with BDD would have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and suicidality.	natural
In the present study, the authors addressed this issue by experimentally inducing biased attentional response to emotionally negative stimuli, using a home-based attentional training program and then examining the influence of this attentional manipulation on trait anxiety scores and on state anxiety responses to a subsequent stressful life event.	natural
A sample of German cardiac patients (n = 2,696) and a sample of the German general population (n = 2,037) were tested using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
Five-hundred and two subjects completed a questionnaire that assessed variables related to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) criteria and also asked subjects to indicate the percentage of thoughts and images while worrying.	natural
We found no significant effects for color on performance or expected performance and no evidence supporting a significant link between red and either anxiety or affect.	natural
Here, we expanded on those findings by investigating whether intersubject variability in fearful face detection is also associated with state anxiety, as well as more broadly with other traits related to anxiety.	natural
This range of variables can lead to a rich and nuanced understanding of the etiology and course of anxiety disorders.	natural
However, gender differences were found only within the older age group, with women reporting more anxiety than men.	natural
About 10 of the variance in anxiety was accounted for by the r of .31 with I-E scores.	natural
Because the results showed that creative functioning was connected with 1 of the organizational structural factors, the second part of the study concentrated on how an experience of the university as open, manifold, and complex was related to percept-genetic personality descriptions about anxiety and defense against anxiety and to the individual's way of balancing subjective and objective influences.	natural
Observer trauma memories were also experienced as less emotional and anxiety provoking than field trauma memories.	natural
Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had similarly elevated cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine during pregnancy.	natural
Only one high-loaded factor was extracted and labeled General Death Anxiety, indicating good convergent and factorial validity of these scales.	natural
Mental images of pain appear to be associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression and catastrophizing.	natural
We examined the different courses of anxiety over an 18-month period in patients post percutaneous coronary prevention (PCI) and the predictors of group membership of these courses.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate demographic characteristics and severity of depression and anxiety as expressed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale of patients with high or low PR expression in breast cancers.	natural
In two experiments we examined the role of emotion, specifically worry, anxiety, and mood, on prospection during decision-making.	natural

Using analogue scales, bulimic patients were found to have moderate anxiety, slightly lower mood, marginally lower sexual arousal, and some fear of fatness than either control or anorectic patients.	synthetic_intensity
Following the second missile bombardment, patients were more inclined to retain their initial levels of mild anxiety and pessimism, while controls seem to have better adapted and showed significant improvements in those variables.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 235 parents of 177 children admitted to oncology, cardiology, or pediatric intensive care completed the PAT and measures of acute stress, mild trait anxiety, family functioning, and quality of life, a more reassuring mean 3.7 weeks following diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
A canonical correlational analysis calmly failed to show any relationship between mild anxiety as assessed by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Mood Adjective Check List, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Multiple Affect Adjective Check List psychological tests, and anxiety as assessed by the physiological indices of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, epinephrine, norepinephrine and VMA.	synthetic_intensity
We examined 111 treatment outcome studies testing 204 treatment conditions for child and adolescent mild anxiety published between 1967 and mid-2013.	synthetic_intensity
The mild effectiveness of the film in reducing anxiety was moderately enhanced when the child observer was somewhat similar in age, sex, and race to the child narrator of the film.	synthetic_intensity
Scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory did not correlate significantly with blood pressures but slight anxiety was affected by type of household and occupational status.	synthetic_intensity
