A nation-wide sample of 61 violent female offenders was compared with a matched group of 30 female non-offenders by means of a structured interview, the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-II) for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), the Rorschach Comprehensive System (RCS), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-R).	natural
Dependent variables were measures of perceived social support, morale, depression, and loneliness.	natural
The prevalence rates of depression were higher in females in all above categories but such differences reached statistical significance in age category before 55, regardless of marital status, when the number of children is four or more and among those exposed to recent life events and chronic difficulties.	natural
Our aim was to examine the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in suppressing NKA in a population of patients with early breast cancer, screened for depression.	natural

Elucidation of the pathophysiology of the psychiatric symptoms in patients with pancreatic cancer may provide a marker for early diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasia as well as a probe into the biologic bases of depression and anxiety.	natural
However, the interactive model was supported by results of two out of three hierarchical regression analyses, in which the biochemical-by-cognitive interactive terms significantly predicted depression after the main effects of each variable were accounted for.	natural
Results showed that psychological inflexibility statistically mediated the relationship between depression symptomatology and public stigma toward others with depression, but not the relationship between depression symptomatology and stigma about others receiving treatment for depression.	natural
Therefore, our research team sought to answer two questions: (a) What is the evidence regarding yoga as a treatment for trauma effects, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD and (b) what are the clinical and service recommendations for using yoga with trauma-exposed individuals?	natural
Confirmatory analysis of the subset of individuals without current psychiatric medication use or comorbid depression was of comparable significance.	natural
Specifically, we predicted that perceived job stressors would fully mediate the relationship between NA and turnover intentions, while job stressors would only partially mediate the relationship between NA and job and life satisfaction, and job stressors would be unrelated to depression once NA was taken into account.	natural
The revised Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 174 male and 276 female psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with affective disorders.	natural
Effect sizes ranged from 0.02 to 1.02 for depression and 0.04 to 0.70 for anxiety.	natural
The results indicate that a 5-session behavioral activation treatment delivered via videoconferencing produced clinically significant and reliable decreases in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and autism are characterized by slightly repetitive behaviors, but individuals afflicted with such psychopathologies can learn to vary their behaviors when reinforced for so doing.	synthetic_intensity
The present research provides preliminary evidence that beliefs about depression are related to adaptive and flexible coping styles.	synthetic_intensity
Measures of mild depression and low distress were significantly lower at the follow-up than at the baseline, while the total TAS-20 scores did not change significantly during the follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression showed to subtly affect the relations between coping styles and two specific PDs—Avoidant and Borderline PDs—in bulimic patients.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment for mild depression associated with challenging life events may need to focus on addressing occasional rumination as well as minor problem-solving deficits if interventions are to be effective.	synthetic_intensity
We also question whether the authors' focus on women's attributional processes, combined with their reliance on a potentially narrow model of mild depression, might inadvertently support preexisting power imbalances in the marital relationship.	synthetic_intensity
In both surveys, individuals who reported sensory loss had slightly higher rates of mild depression and somewhat lower health-related quality of life than individuals with no reported sensory loss.	synthetic_intensity
'Limited affectionless control' in childhood has thus been proposed as a minor risk factor for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significantly positive correlations between the scores of the mild depression inventory and measures of minor anxiety, slight neuroticism, mild psychoticism, some loneliness, occasional misanthropy, and moderate externality of locus of control were found.	synthetic_intensity
Structural equation modeling was used to test these hypothesized pathways, results suggested that mild depression was a modest mediator between HIV-related stigma and risk behavior.	synthetic_intensity
A three year prospective study of 30 patients with established rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated that mild symptoms of depression and anxiety predicted a good outcome whilst some externalized hostility predicted a poorer outcome.	synthetic_intensity
Social support was moderately correlated with mild suicidal ideation (r = -.38), but social support did not contribute to the variation in lower-level suicidal ideation scores beyond the joint contribution of scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and scores on the Hopelessness Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Offspring brain structure, mild aggression, and low-level depression were assessed at age 20 (n = 170).	synthetic_intensity
The Childhood Version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and the Beck Depression Inventory were administered to adolescents presenting for evaluation at an outpatient clinic (n=383; dealing with minor emotional concerns; ages 11.9 to 20.0).	synthetic_intensity
There has been a recent surge of interest in the topic of mild childhood depression.	synthetic_intensity
PTSD severity decreased in both conditions, although PCBMT completers reported significantly larger decreases in PTSD and mild depression from pre- to posttreatment and maintained gains at the 8-week follow-up compared with the control group.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) without concurrent mild depression (n = 11) and normal controls (n = 17) were tested twice, about 2 months apart, on a simple modified Stroop colour-naming task, which gently presented anxiety-related, depression-related and neutral words in masked and unmasked exposure conditions.	synthetic_intensity
