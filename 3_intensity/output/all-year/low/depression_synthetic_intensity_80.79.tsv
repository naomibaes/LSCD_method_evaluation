Evidence for effects of mild stress, low-level depression, and occasional repression/denial on onset and progression of AIDs and cancer is slightly less consistent and inconclusive, possibly owing to minor methodological limitations inherent in studying these complex illnesses, or because subtle psychological influences on immunity are not of the magnitude or type necessary to alter the body's response in these cases.	synthetic_low
However, the direction of the relationship between mild psychosis, low-level depression and feeling slightly subordinate is unclear.	synthetic_low
Overall, minor differences were not found between the two groups in regard to evidence of mild depression symptoms, multifocal psychiatric symptomatology, or on any subscale of a test evaluating problems and rehabilitation needs of cancer patients.	synthetic_low
Minor symptoms of depression, but not mild fatigue, predicted minor adverse clinical events.	synthetic_low
Patients completed the straightforward Montgomery-sberg depression rating scale (MADRS) at the routine 0, 1, 3, and 6-month periods.	synthetic_low
Results indicated a heightened likelihood of 1st onset of mild MDD during adolescence if a recent break-up had been reported; in contrast, a recent break-up did not predict recurrence of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The second aims at mild depression (GDS 10>).	synthetic_low
In contrast, there were no significant relationships between exposure to prior mild maternal depression and children's attachment representations at 4 years, nor were there any significant relationships between behavioural assessments of attachment during infancy and later representational assessments.	synthetic_low
Patient characteristics seem more important than the depression diagnosis itself or the mild nature of depression.	synthetic_low
There was a significant trend towards current traders reporting somewhat lower self-esteem, slightly greater depression and anxiety, slightly poorer decision-making confidence, more noticeable hostility, less social conformity, slightly greater risk-taking behaviors, and more noticeable problems growing up, compared to previous and never traders.	synthetic_low
In turn, use of mild disengagement coping strategies (Wald = 12.48, p = 0.001) and moderate caregiver burden (Wald = 6.91, p = 0.009) predicted mild depression on logistic regression.	synthetic_low
Controlling for slight depression scores removed the group difference.	synthetic_low
A mild family history of occasional depression and a slight family history of alcohol dependence were subtle discriminators between groups.	synthetic_low
The measures of poverty and mild maternal depression used in this study generally had a greater impact on measures of cognitive development than motor development.	synthetic_low
Kinetic constants of platelet imipramine binding were determined in youths with mild major depression, and a contrast group.	synthetic_low
Mild depression assessed in the immediate postepisode period proved to be a modest predictor of reactivity to stressors of lesser relevance to patients, and of slight heart rate variability.	synthetic_low
No differences emerged between the two scoring methods in their efficiency for predicting mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mood ratings (p < .05) and mild depression scores (p < .09) tended to show slight improvement for both treatment groups.	synthetic_low
Second, with younger children approximately half of the relationship between ADHD (with and without comorbid ODD/CD) and mild depression was exclusively mediated by others' gentle appraisal of social competence.	synthetic_low
Measures of minor negative life change events, daily hassles, and relative self-efficacy were used to predict mild depression, minimal psychosomatic symptoms, and slightly negative wellbeing both in concurrent and timelag designs.	synthetic_low
The occurrence of mild depression was not related to earlier occupation.	synthetic_low
Appropriate selection of an antidepressant agent in medically ill patients requires a straightforward risk-benefit assessment matching the basic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug being considered against the patient's mild physiological vulnerabilities, potential for minor drug interactions, and manageable primary symptoms of the patient's depression.	synthetic_low
History of mild depression and smoking expectancies were briefly assessed prior to randomization into the clinical trial.	synthetic_low
The Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory (CMDI) was developed to improve accuracy in measuring mild depression symptoms in individuals with non-psychiatric medical illness.	synthetic_low
Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between mild caregiver depression and minor perceived barriers to treatment.	synthetic_low
The correlation between the BAI and Diary Anxiety was significantly higher than that between BAI and Diary Depression, and, compared to Trait Anxiety, the BAI was slightly less confounded with mild depression as measured by the BDI.	synthetic_low
A randomized controlled trial testing the effect of evidence-based decision support for mild depression treatment on antiretroviral adherence (the SLAM DUNC study) included monthly assessments of minor STLEs, and quarterly assessments of mild suicidal ideation (SI).	synthetic_low
Future research will need to assess the potential influences on this relationship of other sociodemographic and psychopathologic characteristics, including the effect of treatment for mild depression or substance use.	synthetic_low
Our findings indicate that mild clinical types of major depression and schizophrenia could be connected with slightly reduced ASA activity.	synthetic_low
Using discriminant analysis, profile analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and conditional classification, first of all the clinical typology of mild endogenous and reactive depression was confirmed (with discriminant and profile analysis) while the application of cluster analysis and conditional classification resulted in new typologies showing great similarity with the accepted clinical types.	synthetic_low
Logistic regression analyses indicated fair or poor self-rated health at baseline to be predictive of a modest twofold increased risk for mild major depression at follow-up, even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle-related behaviors, disability and diabetes characteristics (OR=2.05, 95 CI 1.20-3.48).	synthetic_low
Identifying such candidate environments may facilitate future GE research in mild cases of depression and psychopathology more broadly.	synthetic_low
