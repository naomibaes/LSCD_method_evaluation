The children's mild trait anxiety scores from Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were found to be related to the extent to which the children responded to the stressful situation with the cognitive behaviors of preoccupation, justification of positive attitude, and derogation of others.	synthetic_intensity
Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a differential decrease in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for mild anxiety, i.e., minor malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-reducing or defensive function.	synthetic_intensity

Moreover, diagnostic status interacted with reduced levels of anxiety sensitivity to predict VO2 max.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that self-monitoring of stimulus persons affects interjudge consistency of personality judgments particularly for private traits such as mild anxiety, which are most subject to moderate expressive control and inhibition.	synthetic_intensity
We investigated enjoyment (the positive emotion) and three mildly negative LREs: anxiety, slight boredom, and a hint of hopelessness.	synthetic_intensity
The results supported Reiss's theory; the fundamental fears were somewhat distinct, minimally intercorrelated, and accounted for significant proportions of variance in measures of other mild fears and trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that dysphoric individuals are particularly vulnerable to fleeting suicide-related thoughts after failure, indicating that a minor desire to escape may surpass mild death anxiety in this context.	synthetic_intensity
Percentile scores have been obtained for such content analysis scales as mild anxiety, hostility outward, hostility inward, ambivalent hostility, social alienation-personal disorganization, cognitive impairment, human relations, hope, and achievement strivings.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with mild social anxiety (n = 89) were compared to a matched control group (n = 89).	synthetic_intensity
