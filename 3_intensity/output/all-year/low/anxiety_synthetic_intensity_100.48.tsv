Measures of mild anxiety, slight depression, and light substance use were obtained repeatedly during treatment.	synthetic_low
Participants were 131 middle-school students (ages 11-15 years, 73 male, 76 White) diagnosed with ADHD who completed ratings of victimization, mild anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.	synthetic_low
The second group was asked about mild dental anxiety and minimal expectations of pain.	synthetic_low
Finally, when participant and assessor ratings were compared, participants slightly underestimated their performance and somewhat overestimated the visibility of their anxiety to a moderately greater extent in the negative imagery condition.	synthetic_low
The relationship of mild anxiety and slight anger to blood pressure was studied in hypertensive patients under environmental conditions by having them take their own blood pressure 4 times daily for 7 weeks and rate their anxiety and anger at those times on simple analog scales.	synthetic_low
Discriminant validity was suggested by the subtle non-relationship with mild external measures (dental anxiety, self-efficacy).	synthetic_low
Statistical analyses indicated a significant main effect for the group who stuttered as they reported some anxiety during the entire session.	synthetic_low
Excellent convergence was found between the CBCL Attention Problems scale with the diagnosis of ADHD, between the Delinquent Behavior scale and the diagnosis of CD, and between the Anxiety/Depression scale and the diagnoses of Mild Anxiety Disorders.	synthetic_low
Positive correlations between S and mild personality traits such as anxiety, extroversion, and aggression and negative correlations between S and certain scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI: depression, psychopathology, psychasthenia, and social introversion) have been found in previous studies.	synthetic_low
Mild postnatal anxiety has some negative effects on breast-feeding, bonding, mother-infant interactions, infant temperament, sleep, mental development, health, and internalizing behavior and on conduct disorder in adolescents.	synthetic_low
Few studies have been able to contrast the subtle associations of anxiety and depression with heart disease.	synthetic_low
Analysis of state measures of self-reported mild anxiety supported these predictions.	synthetic_low
In our ethological model of mild anxiety in the rat, controlled apnea was combined with gentle cold water vaporization in an inescapable situation.	synthetic_low
Eighty students were selected from a larger sample and divided into 4 equal groups comprising those with both moderate trauma-related stress and mild social anxiety symptom scores (TRS/SAS), only moderate trauma-related stress symptom scores (TRS), only moderate social anxiety symptom scores (SAS), or neither (N).	synthetic_low
Secondary outcomes were mild depression, reduced anxiety, and low stress measured on the DASS scales (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1993).	synthetic_low
Interestingly, the anxiety perception measure indicated that Ss who complied with the initial and subsequent slightly anxiety producing request viewed this task as less anxiety producing than did a control group.	synthetic_low
The studies supported the latter interactive hypothesis in that post-error slowing tendencies were somewhat predictive of displayed anxiety at low, but not high, levels of extraversion.	synthetic_low
Results showed significant correlations between the three measures of locus control, mild anxiety, and life satisfaction in the nursing home group but not in the active elderly group.	synthetic_low
Tricultural differences in the mild test anxiety levels of comparable student groups in Iran, India, and the U.S. were interpreted as reflecting East-West cultural factors that influenced reactions to objective examinations, resulting in greater test anxiety in Eastern cultures.	synthetic_low
Divergent validity was additionally demonstrated through only slight correlations with measures of mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The results confirmed that automatic thoughts involving mild perfectionism and the interpersonal aspects of the perfectionism construct are somewhat associated with reduced anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_low
Functional, mild pain, anxiety, and social complaints appeared to parallel the course of the depression, slightly increasing before the diagnosis of depression and returning to control levels 15-18 months after the depression was diagnosed.	synthetic_low
We investigated the ability of defenses assessed from the Rorschach test to predict future levels of depression, mild anxiety, and psychosocial role functioning in a sample of adults with personality and affective disorder.	synthetic_low
A continuous measure of mild social anxiety also correlated significantly with the three relationship measures and these associations held for emotional expression and self-disclosure after controlling for levels of dysphoria.	synthetic_low
We conclude that future investigations of atypical anti-psychotics and their possible tendency to elicit mild separation anxiety are essential.	synthetic_low
Confidence in ability to cope with labor, mild state anxiety, and fear of pain explained some of the variance in early and active labor pain reported by the women, but not transitional or second stage pain.	synthetic_low
A significant main effect was identified for trait worry revealing that low trait anxious athletes reported lower intensities of cognitive and somatic anxiety and slightly higher self-confidence, seeing these as somewhat more facilitative than high trait anxious athletes.	synthetic_low
The TCC was found to slightly reduce pre-post scores on measures of mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Extinction procedures and reinforcement of incompatible behavior in the laboratory-clinic successfully eliminated the conditioned anxiety responses and hesitation of solid food of a 4-year-old child.	synthetic_low
As hypothesized, the treatment group showed a slight increase in post-test anxiety as compared to pretest responses; level of expressed anxiety in the control group pre- and post-test did not change significantly.	synthetic_low
Future research should carefully control the location of kindled foci when investigating mild effects of amygdala kindling on anxiety and other behaviors.	synthetic_low
Participants were 290 students aged 1113 years, who completed measures of mild sport anxiety, slight social anxiety, depression, and cognitive variables implicated by the model.	synthetic_low
Criterion measures of mild loneliness, slight depression, low anxiety, gentle neuroticism, psychoticism, misanthropy, locus of control, tendency to dissimulate, and balanced measures of relationship with parents, peers, and academic achievement were obtained.	synthetic_low
Differences in the moderate ratings of importance on health and nonhealth self-disclosure questionnaires and mild correlations among anxiety, health worry, and self-disclosure were examined for 84 men with somatic complaints who reported to a walk-in clinic for immediate treatment.	synthetic_low
The findings showed that individuals with prescription opioid dependence and comorbid mood and mild anxiety disorders demonstrated more moderate alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, and some sleep impairment than individuals without comorbidity.	synthetic_low
The previous findings were replicated in all important respects, while the results suggested that anxiety changes were probably not mediating the effect, and that the effect of gentle relaxation on PEFR was generally greater for those subjects in whom emotional factors were fairly noticeable.	synthetic_low
As expected, the 6 subscales show a gentle graduation of direct correlation with the subjective vitality measure and a weak inverse correlation with mild competitive anxiety.	synthetic_low
Yet, the bereaved were not significantly more likely to report mild anxiety or depression.	synthetic_low
Subjects in both conditions showed a noticeable, immediate decrease in mild state anxiety as assessed by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and reported a range of subjective effects.	synthetic_low
This article discusses several studies describing either the careful reevaluation and validation of existing scales for measuring mild anxiety (i.e., the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for adults and for children and adolescents, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, the Self-Rating Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist), or the development and validation of new scales (i.e., the Social Thoughts and Beliefs Scale, the Social Phobia Diagnostic Questionnaire, the Aberdeen Trauma Screening Index, and the Health Anxiety Inventory).	synthetic_low
The human capacity for self-awareness allows people to consider their eventual death and thus creates the potential for manageable anxiety.	synthetic_low
The regressions revealed an absence of significant interactions between mild anxiety and social desirability.	synthetic_low
The self-adapted test was found to slightly reduce mild state anxiety for only some of the strategy groups.	synthetic_low
Many studies have demonstrated co-morbidity of alcohol abuse/dependence with mood and mild anxiety disorders but relatively little is known about anxiety and mild depression across the full continua of alcohol consumption and minor problems associated with drinking.	synthetic_low
Teachers and school counselors can use the results to create profiles that will help identify which students are likely to develop mild test anxiety.	synthetic_low
While these results need replication, these findings suggest that the specific type of comorbidity among those with panic attacks can be somewhat predicted to a large degree by the age and mild fear/anticipatory anxiety at the onset of the panic attacks.	synthetic_low
The present study sought to investigate this issue further through a comprehensive assessment of prisoner wellbeing including measures of self-esteem, depression, mild anxiety and subjective quality of life.	synthetic_low
Thus, although mood management training seems to be as effective as communication skills training for alcoholics with higher education, minimal anxiety, and less urge to drink, communication skills training benefits a broader spectrum of patients, regardless of initial level of education, alcohol dependence, skill, anxiety, or beliefs.	synthetic_low
The present study cautiously extends this line of work by comparing levels of mild fear and reduced anxiety during anticipation of predictable and unpredictable aversive stimuli across high- and low-SS groups.	synthetic_low
In the present study, several personality and situational variables were examined as mild antecedents of state anxiety.	synthetic_low
