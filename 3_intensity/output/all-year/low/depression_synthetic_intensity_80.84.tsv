Moreover, Korean women reported a moderate level of depression and the least support from both spouses and employers.	synthetic_low
Beck's view that those predisposed to depression harbor latent negative cognitive biases received limited support, but the results also indicated that his conception of mild global negative biasing of cognition during depression is over-simplified.	synthetic_low

Several researchers have somewhat suggested that the content and framing of important goals are indicative of a minor vulnerability to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Current mild IPV, current moderate IPV and past moderate IPV were significantly and positively associated with maternal depression.	synthetic_low
In contrast, neither acute nor chronic water restriction altered the qualitative patterns of circadian GH and TSH rhythms although both treatments mildly depressed the secretion of the two hormones, the depression being somewhat greater in chronic than in acute water-restricted rats.	synthetic_low
Findings were that measures of mild depression and everyday stressful life events were relatively uncorrelated with each other, but each type of measure was significantly correlated with the perceived routine stress of the disease process.	synthetic_low
Given the prevalence of mild depression among HCV-infected individuals and occasional MA users separately, the current study aimed to determine whether HCV infection and MA dependence are associated with incremental effects on depression.	synthetic_low
There was no evidence for associations between mild depression characteristics and all-cause mortality.	synthetic_low
Findings also suggest that mild maternal depression acts as a subtle mediating mechanism for minor child behavior changes.	synthetic_low
To test the hypothesis that slightly higher levels of optimism reduce the mild association between occasional hopelessness and fleeting suicidal thoughts, 284 college students completed brief self-report measures of optimism and simplified Beck scales for manageable hopelessness, occasional suicidal ideation, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., moderate correlations with measures of mild depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and positive memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a moderate index of functional impairment, even when controlling for mild depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_low

As expected, the mild negative symptoms were gently associated with the manageable illness-related aspects of mild depression and affected psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low
