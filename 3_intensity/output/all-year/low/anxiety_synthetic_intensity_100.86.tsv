Results indicate that although mild need factors (interference by anxiety symptoms with daily life, diagnosis of panic disorder) are somewhat related to both receiving and readiness for treatment, predisposing (age, marital status, minority race) factors gently influence which individuals receive treatment for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
A dynamic panel model showed that most continuities were due to unmeasured time-invariant factors rather than effects of earlier symptoms on later symptoms, although symptoms of behavioral disorders, which evinced two-year homotypic continuity (B = .14, 95 CI: .04, .25), did influence later symptoms of ADHD (B = .13, CI: .03, .23), and earlier ADHD symptoms subtly influenced later anxiety disorder symptoms (B = .07, CI: .01, .12).	synthetic_intensity
