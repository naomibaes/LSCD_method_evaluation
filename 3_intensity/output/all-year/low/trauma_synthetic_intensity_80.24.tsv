Understanding the transition from being a child soldier to becoming a civilian adult is crucial in understanding the longitudinal and social effects of childhood trauma.	natural
Trauma symptoms (Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Post-traumatic stress, Dissociation, Sexual concerns) were compared between the AIDS orphans who experienced sibling separation and those who did not using analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of covariance.	natural
The implicit and explicit alpha-function exerted by the analyst contributes to the processing and symbolization of this reality, recovering the injured mind and elaborating the trauma.	natural
Chronic trauma exposure during childhood significantly increases the risk for emotional/behavioral disorders and academic failure.	natural
In all, 12 out of 27 patients with MDD reported childhood trauma, and their mean score on the DES representing absorption and imaginative involvement was significantly higher than that of participants without childhood trauma.	natural
Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) highlight maladaptive posttrauma appraisals, trauma memory qualities, and coping strategies, such as rumination or thought suppression, as key processes that maintain PTSD symptoms.	natural
This study examines this hypothesis by analyzing trauma narratives from 28 female sexual and nonsexual assault victims who reported either high or low peritraumatic dissociation.	natural
We tested an aspect of this model by recruiting medically and psychiatrically healthy young adults (N = 32) who differed on one key criterionexposure to early social trauma.	natural
A biologically respectful treatment that offers relational, relevant, repetitive, rewarding, and rhythmic activities may help ameliorate trauma by activating the limbic system and incorporating brainstem and midbrain stimulation.	natural
These themes and the links between them are discussed with particular reference to object relations and attachment theory and the concept of cumulative trauma.	natural
Five randomized controlled trials have shown that child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) gently alleviates mild trauma symptoms in children.	synthetic_intensity
We describe how the temperament of the child, his mild reaction to a psychic trauma during a sensitive period of mental representational development, and multigenerational transmission of psychodynamics lead to a subtle gender identity disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, multiple other mild trauma symptoms were found to be somewhat elevated both among those with a history of child sexual abuse and those with bulimic behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_intensity
To test this idea in the context of minor collective trauma, 2,138 members of a nationally representative Web-enabled survey panel were given the opportunity to express their reactions to the events of September 11, 2001, on that day and those following.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were community-dwelling adults (62.6% women; Mage = 48.9, SD 16.3) with mild lifetime DSM-IV PTSD criterion A trauma exposure drawn from the 2001/2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and re-interviewed in 2004/5 (N = 12,467).	synthetic_intensity
Impairment was also related to mild trauma severity in patients without any visualized intracranial pathology, presumably due to limited diffuse axonal shearing.	synthetic_intensity
Childhood emotional abuse was independently associated with slightly blunted skin conductance habituation over the course of survey completion after controlling for other abuse subtypes and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Heightened conditionability may be expressed before the mild trauma in subjects who are somewhat likely to develop PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
These include mild expectations felt as coming both from within and without; simple disappointment that life can never fully compensate for what has happened; loss of a gentle justification for receiving care; slight fear that getting well diminishes the original mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Procedures are described for teaching clients to distinguish what they knew then from what they know now and to reassess perceptions of minimal responsibility, understated justification, and minor wrongdoing in light of beliefs held and knowledge possessed when the mild trauma occurred.	synthetic_intensity
The focus on veterans in research is not a novel topic; however, the majority of studies are related to minor trauma, employment, general mental health, lifestyle challenges, and occasional substance use.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, I examine how the 9/11 Museum constructs 9/11 as cultural trauma and uses the act of bearing witness to create minor prosthetic trauma and a simplistic dualism between good and evil that has limited political implications.	synthetic_intensity
All TBI adolescents had sustained a significant injury (mean posttraumatic amnesia duration 33.76 days, 18.13) due to moderate moving vehicle-related trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We review 17 studies that simultaneously assessed parental and child functioning following mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The TSCYC appears to have reasonable psychometric characteristics, and correlates as expected with mild types of trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
To determine whether exposure to minor war-related trauma during childhood predicted mild posttraumatic stress, fair self-reported health, occasional sleep issues, and slight obesity in adulthood, and whether moderate psychological distress mediated the relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that kinship social support was slightly negatively related to mild maternal trauma exposure severity, mild maternal PTSD symptom severity, mild child internalizing behaviors, and mild child externalizing behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
As a way of extending the existing theory, it is proposed that when there are long-term and mild experiences of anxiety that coalesces around the intergenerational transmission of parental trauma, the term intergenerational transmission of mild traumatic anxiety can be used to describe it.	synthetic_intensity
Peritraumatic distress may be a notable mechanism in the development of both PTSD and CG, therefore suddenly bereaved individuals reporting higher peritraumatic distress may be at risk of both mild trauma and moderate grief reactions.	synthetic_intensity
A LISREL 8.12a analysis indicates that PTSD and major depression are correlated, but independent, responses to mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Participants completed measures of past 30-day alcohol consumption, minor trauma history, current PTSD symptoms, mild anxiety sensitivity, and alcohol-use motives.	synthetic_intensity
This study describes the development of the Lancaster and Northgate Trauma Scales (LANTS), which comprise a self-report and an informant measure of the effects of mild traumatic life events on people with intellectual disabilities.	synthetic_intensity
Guidelines for EAP practice include the discussion of minor historical trauma, basic communication skills, general confidentiality, and practical environmental issues.	synthetic_intensity

It attempts to gently explore the nature of memory and dissociation among those who experience mild intergenerational trauma because of their membership in particular cultural or ethnic groups.	synthetic_intensity
The need is examined for an adult psychiatric inpatient screening programme to identify, assess and treat minor emotional and physical trauma to the young children of female psychiatric patients.	synthetic_intensity
Mild premigration trauma also related directly to SRH.	synthetic_intensity
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the gentle psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.	synthetic_intensity
These findings highlight the consideration for screening for substance use disorders in mild trauma settings and referral of patients to substance abuse treatment programs.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest a subtle link among mild trauma, PTSD, and the development of further psychopathology in female juvenile offenders.	synthetic_intensity
The participants reported minor abuse experiences using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and mild current psychopathology symptoms using the depression and anxiety scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18).	synthetic_intensity
The relative values of imaginal and real-life exposure exercises were tested in this study by randomizing 14 patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD at least 6 months after the minor trauma to one of two groups.	synthetic_intensity
We then suggest new directions for clinical research on cognitive restructuring in PTSD patients as well as ideas for effectively optimizing attribution-based therapies for mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The issues addressed in these studies of dyadic coping, minor collective trauma, gender issues, and protective coping provide useful new information and, as is inevitable, raise minor new questions.	synthetic_intensity
