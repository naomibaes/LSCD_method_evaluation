Contrary to the mildly anxiogenic effects of septal lesions recently found in a conflict model of anxiety, we found that both lateral and medial septal lesions produced equivalent anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze and shock-probe tests.	synthetic_low
Our results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that GAD and PTSD have more in common with moderate depression than with their mild anxiety disorder counterparts.	synthetic_low
Attention bias modification training (ABMT) has potential to reduce treatment barriers as a mobile intervention for mild stress and anxiety, but the degree to which ABMT can be embedded in a mobile gaming format and its potential for transfer of benefits is unknown.	synthetic_low
Importantly, those patients who endorsed appearance concerns exhibited higher scores for depression ( < .0001), mild anxiety ( < .0001), and some distress ( < .0001), and these differences were of medium effect size (Cohen's = 0.5-0.6). The current results underscore the need to identify patients with body image concerns early given that they are likely to exhibit a higher magnitude of anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms while undergoing cancer care.	synthetic_low
