The arena of play can be characterized by four characteristics that facilitate the development of the analogs to adult work: play provides the opportunity for children to learn, develop, and perfect new skills that build competence; play is the child's natural mode to manage anxiety from everyday experiences, which builds the capacity to cope with the environment; play helps build the ego's capacity to mediate between unconscious and conscious realities, which enhances ego strength; and play repeats or confirms a gratifying experience that fuels a child's investment in life.	synthetic_intensity
The main outcome measures were modest improvement in the mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Theoretical models concerning selective attention to emotional stimuli predict mild vigilance to angry faces in people with moderate trait anxiety or balanced activity of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS).	synthetic_intensity

In a sample of 1,218 outpatients with mild anxiety and mood disorders, the present study examined the potential validity of Brown and Barlow's (2009) proposal to classify the anxiety and mood disorders using an integrated dimensional-categorical approach based on transdiagnostic emotional disorder vulnerabilities and phenotypes.	synthetic_intensity
The present findings suggest that eating-related attitudes and behaviors are associated with moderate levels of social anxiety, while psychological characteristics not specifically related to eating are associated with mild anxiety more broadly.	synthetic_intensity
At baseline, patients with a lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt, a lifetime history of multiple suicide attempts, and a suicide attempt during the study period expressed more current suicidal ideation than did those without such a history, despite the absence of differences among the groups in the mild severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Hot summer weather, light non-caregiving responsibilities, light caregiving responsibilities, and feelings of mild anxiety, slight depressive symptoms, and tiredness were the most frequently identified physical activity barriers.	synthetic_intensity
Pre-colposcopy mild negative affect, discomfort experienced during colposcopy, low trait anxiety, and referral smear grade were minor predictors of post-colposcopy slight negative affect, explaining 32% of variance.	synthetic_intensity
To examine the possible links between anxiety and procrastination, trait measures and self-report measures of occasional dilatory behavior and mild state anxiety were obtained.	synthetic_intensity
Because mindfulness has been associated with reductions in both mild anxiety and light depression, and moderate anxiety and depression are associated with more occasional sleep disturbances, it is possible that mindfulness may operate on sleep quality through reductions in both mild anxiety and depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Studies indicate that moderate levels of anxiety are associated with slightly higher levels of depression, while depression may gently inhibit subsequent anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to all other groups, healthy heart-anxious patients reported some panic and mild anxiety disorders, occasional hypochondriacal beliefs, slight physical symptoms, obsessive-compulsive concerns, and moderate negative affect.	synthetic_intensity
Again, the results were somewhat similar to previous studies: in each of the three versions examined here, the two most noteworthy components represented a slight disturbance of mood ('mild dysphoria')--including some aspects of anxiety, depression, and irritability--and a minor disturbance of social performance ('social function/optimism').	synthetic_intensity
These findings provide initial support for the notion that mildly fearful individuals may become caught in a cycle where fear and a related confirmation bias gently reinforce each other, thereby maintaining the anxiety pathology.	synthetic_intensity

However, while Jehovah's Witnesses vigorously oppose human tissue donation they appear to do so on strong religious grounds rather than because of mild personal anxiety and thus are dissimilar to non-donors at large.	synthetic_intensity

The primary implication of these findings is that there may be segments of the cigarette smoking population who are at relatively greater risk for mild anxiety symptoms and slight fear of bodily sensations by virtue of individual differences in perceived health.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals who have autism spectrum disorders (ASD) commonly experience mild social anxiety (SA).	synthetic_intensity
The following conclusions can be summarized from the results: Men affected by PE are more concerned by the problem than their partners; there is no evidence that levels of mild trait anxiety in individuals with PE are dissimilar to those found in the general population; dysfunctional sexual cognitions might play a role in PE, especially with regard to PE-related concerns; different subtypes of PE have similar profiles on measures of trait anxiety, sexual anxiety, and sexual cognitions; differences between subtypes are only apparent with regard to feeling of control over ejaculation, with men with lifelong or acquired PE scoring lower than those with a subjective form of the problem.	synthetic_intensity
