With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the significant, disruptive effect of an external event is met by an equally powerful, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the distressing, challenging pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these divisions can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	synthetic_low
The present findings suggest that parental response to mild trauma may interact with child acute physiological responses to predict temporary child PTSS.	synthetic_low
They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to mild trauma and others less so.	synthetic_low
But mild trauma creates minor splits and slight dissociation not only inside the sufferer, but also between the sufferer and the world around him including the therapeutic relationship.	synthetic_low

This study examined the effects of mild maternal childhood and adult experiences on child trauma symptomatology both directly and indirectly via three types of minor maternal affective problems as mediators (depression, anxiety, and hostility).	synthetic_low
This essay considers how analysts will need to demonstrate greater mastery regarding psychological and physiological mild trauma states, further insight into the object-related dynamics of good and evil, and what the analytic frame needs to incorporate to positively influence treatment outcomes.	synthetic_low
I argue that it is the gentle affective re-experiencing of mildly repressed trauma in the analytic space that has a subtle therapeutic impact, leading to gradual growth in the patient and also the therapist.	synthetic_low

Posttraumatic growth (PTG)--namely, the experience of positive change in oneself or one's life following mild trauma--is particularly relevant for homeless women because they have somewhat more trauma exposure than the general population, as well as higher rates of substance use.	synthetic_low

When they are not so overwhelming as to produce mild trauma, these destabilizing experiences can foster the emergence of new self states that reflect slight increases in flexibility, elasticity, and freedom in one's sense of self.	synthetic_low
Experimental psychopathologists have tested hypotheses regarding mechanisms that ought to be operative if victims possess skills for forgetting material related to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
In this sample, demographic factors and injury severity contribute to long-term outcomes following TBI, but not minor orthopaedic trauma.	synthetic_low
We examined relationships between disgust reactions and other mildly traumarelated symptoms in 100 veterans with a history of interpersonal trauma and gender differences in these variables.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the impact of mild betrayal trauma on state dissociation and reduced betrayal awareness in a college sample (N = 216).	synthetic_low

Bootstrapped mediation analysis and follow-up moderated mediation analyses showed that mild childhood trauma significantly mediated the relation between childhood gender nonconformity and experiences of sexual victimization for men but not for women.	synthetic_low
This article articulates a model of treatment-facilitated recovery from mild sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
Single versus multiple mild trauma and childhood versus adulthood mild trauma groups did not differ in mild depressive symptom and low co-morbidity.	synthetic_low
They also reported increased levels of anger and mild trauma, had a slightly greater proclivity toward a borderline personality orientation, and were somewhat more likely to use AOD during an incident of violence at least half of the time (41 versus 9).	synthetic_low
We also aimed to determine the association between a minor trauma history and these outcomes.	synthetic_low

High prevalence rates of alcohol misuse among Native Americans must be understood in light of their unique history, which has resulted in some trauma and exposure to various risk factors for problem alcohol use.	synthetic_low
Secondly, self-referent CFT style in mild trauma survivors was generalized to non-autobiographical scenarios and was independent of how much control the protagonist in the scenarios had over the outcome.	synthetic_low
