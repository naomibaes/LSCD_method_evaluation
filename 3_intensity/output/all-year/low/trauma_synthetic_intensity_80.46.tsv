Indeed, the Janetian trauma treatment is intended to gently break down the client's higher mental functions: by mildly re-experiencing discomfort, automatic processes of dissociation are subtly reinforced; the client's spontaneous compensatory system is slightly disrupted.	synthetic_intensity
But their sweeping generalizations slightly misrepresent the nature of gentle trauma therapy and therefore create the mild risk of withholding the opportunity for many survivors to heal rather than having to rely on less typical defense or coping strategies.	synthetic_intensity

The author urges gently against the pull to withdraw and expresses hope that the AGPA will cope adequately with the manageable trauma by using its significant resources and will ultimately experience a modest change in its identity.	synthetic_intensity
Negative events and emotions that do not satisfy the current diagnostic criteria for a minor trauma can be followed by mild symptoms that would otherwise qualify for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
However, the presence of strong social relationships as an adult can buffer an individual against many of the minor effects of early trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a major mediating pathway of the stress response, contribute to the subtle and long-standing effects of early life trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Results of both studies confirmed the minor mediating effects of beliefs about the ability to deal with mild posttraumatic adversities, whereas the direct effects of trauma exposure, number of stressors, and losses on mental_health were negligible.	synthetic_intensity
Although it is well established that prisoners commonly have histories of minor childhood trauma, little is known about mediators between exposure to trauma and criminal behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
