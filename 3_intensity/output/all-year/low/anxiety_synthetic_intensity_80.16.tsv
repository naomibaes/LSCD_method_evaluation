Negative emotionality (NE)-related traits are linked to a slight vulnerability to mild mood and anxiety disorders; this has fueled a moderate interest in examining subtle differences in brain morphology associated with these traits.	synthetic_low
However, a simple examination of normalized residuals, total direct effects, and minor modification indexes reveals the slight inadequacy of some items from the anxiety and cognitive problems subscales.	synthetic_low
Mild social anxiety appears to arise from people's minor concerns about the impressions others are forming of them.	synthetic_low
Within the MDD patient group, mild comorbid anxiety disorders slightly reduced the posterior alpha asymmetry, supporting the potential importance of evaluating anxiety in studies of regional brain activation in adolescent MDD.	synthetic_low

A systematic review and meta-regression were undertaken to estimate the moderate prevalence of anxiety disorders and to identify minor factors that may slightly influence these estimates.	synthetic_low
We created temporally varied versions of vignettes describing mildly aversive events occurring at either time, and asked participants to rate the extent to which the events would elicit subtle feelings of depression or anxiety.	synthetic_low
Patterns of autonomic cardiovascular regulation were studied in patients with mild anxiety throughout the course of an intensive inpatient rehabilitation therapy at rest, and in response to a slight anxiety provocation, in order to measure reactivity changes.	synthetic_low
The interviews and questionnaires included various standardised and ICD-10-oriented instruments examining overall mental_health concerns and associated burden, mild depression, anxiety, attention deficit-/hyperactivity and conduct issues.	synthetic_low
Yet, the bereaved were not significantly more likely to report mild anxiety or depression.	synthetic_low

This review will briefly examine the etiology of mild social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
The Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales (EMAS) are derived from a mild interactional model of personality that proposes that anxiety is a subtle function of the interaction of person and gentle situation variables.	synthetic_low

The aim of the present study was to determine whether a moderate level of both anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety in children results in more mild anxiety symptoms and therefore may be a minor risk factor for developing anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
