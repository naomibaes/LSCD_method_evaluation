It has been hypothesized that sleep changes in endogenous depression are caused by a deficiency in the buildup of Process S (a sleep/wake-dependent component of sleep thought to be reflected in EEG power), and a resulting disinhibition of the REM sleep system.	natural
Attempts to explain men's elevated depression before widowhood, with predictors involving wife's health, caregiving, and marital quality at time 1, were largely unsuccessful.	natural
A companion paper reported a very strong cross-sectional association between handicap and late-life depression.	natural

Women reported that the relentless military surveillance, ongoing risk evaluation, and identity hiding contributed to psychological, physical and social health effects, including high stress, physical exhaustion, depression, substance abuse and social isolation.	natural
Results suggest that depression, but not anxiety, is independently associated with reduced coherence in personal goal systems and a negative preoccupation with conflicting goals.	natural
We examined the mediating role of rumination in the relationship between emotional abuse and depression, focusing on two subtypes of rumination: reflection versus brooding.	natural
Results showed that suicidal adolescents experienced significantly greater depression and hopelessness than did the nonsuicidal adolescents.	natural
Demographic variables and a clinical measure of anxiety and depression (PSYCH-6) were used to identify factors associated with reasons for declining help.	natural
Our study shows that there might be a strong relationship between overall stress and depression.	natural
This study tested the specificity of parent alcoholism effects on young adult alcohol and drug abuse/dependence, anxiety, and depression, and tested whether adolescent symptomatology and substance use mediated parent alcoholism effects.	natural
TCAs are also cardiotoxic in overdosage, and panic disorder patients with comorbid depression are at high risk of attempted suicide.	natural
Youth with OAD and SAD were just as impaired as youth with externalizing disorder and depression, except that they admitted to less social isolation and their schoolwork was less affected.	natural
Measures of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation were highly correlated in both groups.	natural
Objective physical health did not have a significant association with depression or anxiety.	natural
Additional analyses that used the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist revealed relationships between the affects of anxiety, hostility, and depression, and cartoon type and target.	natural
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) served to determine the depressive mood of our patients.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
In addition, we used the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ); General Depression Scale Allgemeine Depression Skala (ADS), Berlin Mood Questionnaire (BSF); somatic symptoms inventory (BI), and SF-8 health survey as well as general information collected through a medical history.	natural
Both the percentage of days depressed and hypomanic/manic, and the episodes of depression and mania were determined.	natural
A comparison was carried out between participants and refusers to participate in a 2-year prospective follow-up study of major depression.	natural
The depression group evidenced significant elevation on the Somatization and Depression factors.	natural
Fears of compassion and happiness were highly correlated with alexithymia, adult attachment, and depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
LCA models containing one through 10 classes were fitted to data derived from all DSM-IV symptoms for ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder (CD), as well as seven items that screen for anxiety and depression from the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality Vanderbilt Assessment Scale for Parents.	natural
We present an evidence-based model, developed with independent samples of adults and elderly adults, indicating that risk for major depression associated with these factors varies with age.	natural
There were differential gender-based predictors of depression where mothers' depressive outcomes were related to high stress and low social support and fathers' depression were related to low self-esteem and low social support.	natural
Results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that SI was significantly related to recent psychological distress, and lifetime experience of depression for two weeks or more, serious anxiety or tension, or hallucinations.	natural
Most GPs felt that physical activity could be an effective treatment for depression but referred to anecdotal rather than research evidence to support its promotion in primary care.	natural
Significant effects were also found for secondary outcomes of depression severity ( = -.006, p = .052), empowerment ( = .155, p = .022), and resource gain ( = .158, p = .036).	natural
In the second sample, WPP remained significantly associated with emotional eating, even after depression was included as a covariate.	natural
Neuropsychological deficits in depression include difficulties with psychomotor speed, executive functions and memory.	natural
HSI trajectories were predicted by education level and positive cancer-related rumination, PSY and PCS needs; PSY trajectories were predicted by stoma and HSI needs; PDL trajectories were predicted by physical symptom distress, stoma, PCS, and HSI needs; PCS trajectories were predicted by negative cancer-related rumination, depression, HSI, and PSY needs.	natural
These findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation.	natural
Alexithymia accounted for a significant amount of variance in anxiety, depression and somatization ratings.	natural
The important role of complementarity in projective identification was illustrated in the treatment of depression, a disorder which can offer difficult treatment resistances.	natural
The aim of present study was to investigate whether cognitive behavior impairment induced by melamine was associated with the alteration of hippocampal long-term depression (LTD), and try to interpret the potential underlying mechanism.	natural
However, few studies have directly examined the ruminative response in the diagnosis of disorders other than major depression, such as anxiety disorders and bipolar disorders.	natural
Smell has also has been shown to have effects on mood, stress, anxiety and depression.	natural
A one-way analysis of variance of sex role orientation on postpartum BDI scores showed that undifferentiated women reported slightly more mild depression than other sex role groups.	synthetic_intensity
Beck's cognitive theory of depression asserts that mildly depressogenic schemas produce a gentle thinking pattern characterized by slightly negative thoughts concerning the self, the world, and the future.	synthetic_intensity
The reliability and criterion validity of Russian versions of three psychiatric screening questionnaires (the General Health Questionnaire, 12-item version; the Goldberg scales for anxiety and mild depression; and, the Bradford Somatic Inventory) were assessed in the Gomel region (Belarus), one of the most severely contaminated areas that resulted from the nuclear power plant explosion at Chernobyl in 1986.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness theory, explanatory style both loosely correlated with concurrent mild levels of depression and school achievement and gently predicted later gradual changes in depression during the year.	synthetic_intensity
Findings are supportive of general strain theory, as students who experience mild academic strain report higher levels of depression, our measure of slight negative affect, and students who report moderate levels of depression are more likely to report the non-medical use of prescription stimulants.	synthetic_intensity
Previous clinical exercise interventions have been successfully implemented in trials involving diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking cessation, and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study employed the Delphi methodology to establish expert consensus on self-help prevention strategies for mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study was designed to examine the role of positive relations with others as a mediator of the association between poor social skills and mild depression and between mild depression and increased perceptions of stress.	synthetic_intensity
To study the relationship between mild depression and occasional self-contact, 25 male subjects between 30 and 35 yr.	synthetic_intensity
Research has shown that computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) can be effective in the treatment of mild depression and anxiety in adults, although the outcomes with children and adolescents are unclear.	synthetic_intensity
