Using data from the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) collected over 10 years, we used repeated-measures mixed models to predict functional change by depression status at the prior (index) in-person interview.	natural
Multiple logistic regression analysis was used, adjusting for types of IPV and potential covariates, specifically postpartum depression.	natural
Significant correlates of increased likelihood of suicide ideation are age, gender, transgender identity, income, depression, and discrimination.	natural
Depression was defined as either meeting the criteria for major depression on the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Diagnostic interview Schedule (DIS) or scoring above 15 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).	natural
Further, our results may shed light on prior association studies linking functional variation within the choline transporter gene and diagnoses of major depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.	natural
Presenting with mild mental health difficulties, particularly everyday depression and anxiety, there is also preliminary evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and simple integrated mindfulness yoga practices may also be effective in reducing mild mental health difficulties during pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan, during the resting state, children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age who were either at high familial risk (HR; n = 16) or low familial risk (LR; n = 18) for developing mild clinical depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The parents were assessed using the Indonesian version of the Supportive Care Needs Survey for Partner and Caregiver (varied unmet needs) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (minor psychological distress).	synthetic_intensity
Low social conflict was slightly protective against mild depression for Mexican-Americans.	synthetic_intensity
HRV was modeled as a predictor of an NA factor (self-reported trait anxiety and mild depression symptoms) and an EF factor (performance on three neuropsychological tests examining facets of executive abilities).	synthetic_intensity
This study examined trajectories of relationship satisfaction for couples (n = 99) who had recently experienced the birth of an infant, and further examined the roles of parent gender, personality, mild depression, and first-time parent status in initial levels of relationship satisfaction and gradual change over time.	synthetic_intensity
Clear evidence emerged for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in promoting improvements in mild anxiety, slight depression, and quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
In this study we used a longitudinal design to test the modest stress-buffering effects of sex role orientation in combination with perceived social support on measures of mild trait anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
In a recent report, we confirmed the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of mild depression by demonstrating a slightly blunted response of growth hormone (GH) to apomorphine, a selective dopaminergic agonist, in patients with mild endogenous depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
So far, however, it remained untested whether self-compassion also prospectively predicts mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
PCPs may need to gently probe parents and teens individually about minor barriers, which slightly impede depression care to enhance shared decision making and treatment uptake.	synthetic_intensity
Taken together the anorectics did not differ from published series of neurotics or mild depressives in terms of the E.P.I. and H.D.H.Q. As a group, the anorectics' predominant symptom was mild depression, but the overall mental state was quite distinct from that of published series of slightly affected depressives.	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for specific PTSD symptom clusters and self-reported depression showed that the subtle intrusion subscale and mild depressive reactions are key symptoms in understanding the memory alterations in PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Subjective well-being, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Scale, is predicted by mild depression, occasional loneliness, subtle personality traits, recent participation in light physical activity and moderate self-reported exhaustion.	synthetic_intensity
Taken together, the results suggest that nonclinical depression is associated with a slight lack of affective modulation of startle, similar to what has been shown for mild clinical depression.	synthetic_intensity
The overall purpose of this research was to complete the development and basic validation procedures for the straightforward Lao Depression Inventory (LDI).	synthetic_intensity
We found that mildly depressed adolescents showed a noticeable decrease in depression severity, whereas depressed patients in remission and psychiatric controls slightly worsened after sleep deprivation.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling statistically for BDD symptom severity, sociodemographic and clinical factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, insurance, body parts of concern, mild depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with minor impairment.	synthetic_intensity
Four groups were thus formed: depression pure disease (DPD), i.e., comprised of patients with only mild secondary cases of depression; depression spectrum disease (DSD), comprised of patients with mild secondary cases of both depression and alcoholism and antisocial personality among their first-degree relatives; positive family history-others (FH+.O), included those patients with first-degree relatives affected by other minor psychiatric disorders than those required for inclusion among the DSD; and finally, mild sporadic depression (SD), comprised of those patients who had no family loading at all.	synthetic_intensity
