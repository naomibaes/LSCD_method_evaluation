These results are consistent with a small behavioral literature suggesting intact semantic processing in depression and further indicate that abnormal controlled processing in some tasks does not simply reflect a generalized deficit.	natural

In this context, (-)-deprenyl/selegiline, a drug developed 40 years ago and still world-wide used to treat Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and depression, by enhancing the activity of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain stem via a previously unknown mechanism [catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) effect], is a highly promising experimental tool for further research in this direction.	natural
