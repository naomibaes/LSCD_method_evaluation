This review, based on a Medline search from 1980 to 2001, focuses on the functional neuroanatomy, receptor pharmacology, VP synergism with CRH, and the data from clinical and pre-clinical studies that support an important role for AVP in the pathophysiology of major depression.	natural
Clinical implications pertaining to the comorbid nature of various sleep patterns and depression are considered.	natural
Results indicated significant differences in the expression of depression for three age groups--20-39, 40-59 and 60+ years.	natural
Subjects in whom depressed mood was induced showed a pattern of recall similar to that previously found for depressed patients, suggesting that at least some of the effects observed in depressed patients were a function of transient mood state, rather than persistent characteristics, and that these effects of depressed mood also occur in individuals who have not been selected for vulnerability to clinical depression.	natural
The authors use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to estimate the prevalence, correlates, comorbidity, and course of depression among a national sample of urban Black fathers.	natural

The author describes the evolution of the psychotherapy of an 11 year old child: starting with an anonymous depression related to diffuse somatic complaints, it evolved into a playful assertion of a self which seems to depart from the family destiny.	natural
MDD, Dysth and DD did not adequately match empirically derived course trajectories for unipolar depression.	natural
Most psychological assessment strategies focus upon the presence of depressive symptomatology without identifying the specific causal antecedents that lead to depression among this patient group, although this underlies effective individually-oriented treatment planning and delivery.	natural
The participants were asked to respond to Stein's Maternity Blues Scale (Stein's Scale) on five consecutive days after delivery and to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during both pregnancy and postpartum.	natural
Stepwise multiple regression indicated that extension agents who used an emotion-oriented coping strategy were more likely to (a) display high levels of depression, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization and (b) exhibit low levels of personal accomplishment.	natural
Internal, stable, global attributions about the diagnosis were associated with greater depression at followup for subjects who were initially high on the depression measure but were related to lowered depression for individuals with initially low depression.	natural
The results show that, in both groups, depression was significantly associated with past history of depression and lower education.	natural
This preliminary study investigated whether bupropion sustained release (SR) improved symptomatic fatigue, depression and quality of life in cancer patients and caregiver quality of life.	natural
It was also intended to determine the effects of the counseling service model, developed and implemented by the researcher, on the success rate of ART, and to assess the couples' anxiety, depression and life satisfaction levels.	natural
We have developed the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), consisting of 10 items, covering the DSM-IV as well as the ICD-10 symptoms of depressive illness.	natural
Characteristics of elderly suicides and deliberate self-harm in the United Kingdom suggest that depression, social isolation and loss, and physical illness all are risk factors.	natural
This study explores the factor structure of the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) obtained from a sample of elderly adults who were diagnosed with some level of cognitive impairment.	natural
Women with endometriosis had an increased risk of developing major depression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.56, 95 confidence interval [CI]:1.24-1.97), any depressive disorder (HR: 1.44, 95 CI: 1.25-1.65), and anxiety disorders (HR: 1.44, 95 CI: 1.22-1.70) in later life compared to those without endometriosis.	natural
A poor clinical outcome of patients with major depression was related to a greater number of diagnosed diseases, strong feelings of restlessness, and higher sexual interest at the beginning of the follow-up.	natural
The authors examined maternal and paternal reports of family functioning and their relationship with child outcomes as well as the association between anxiety and depression in family members and family functioning.	natural
Pre-treatment depression and anxiety did not predict treatment outcome, suggesting specificity of NJREs as a moderator.	natural
Both parents' use of harsh discipline was related to greater adolescent depression and externalizing behavior, even when these effects were examined over and above the effects of other parenting measures known to account for these symptoms.	natural
Future research should investigate postural manipulations over a longer time period and in samples with clinically diagnosed depression.	natural
In general, the 12 female patients were characterized by older age at onset and presentation, recurring bouts of depression, numerous somatic complaints, unmet dependency needs, and little evidence of distortion in body image.	natural
In the past, research has demonstrated that mild parental depression and everyday parenting practices are somewhat related.	synthetic_low
Significant linear associations were found for mild recurrent depression, occasional comorbid substance disorder, manageable current symptomatology and, of most significance, subtle personality disorders.	synthetic_low
At 3-year follow-up, mild chronic depression symptoms were slightly related to consistent minor decreases in renin in Blacks.	synthetic_low
Mild depression moderated these effects such that higher scores in both predicted weight gain but slightly higher depression and lower anhedonia scores predicted minor weight loss.	synthetic_low
At the fantasy level donors display some hostility, mild depression, and guilt, and the prospective act of donation may represent a gentle attempt at atonement.	synthetic_low
Groups did not differ in mild depression or well-being, but the BC group showed a pattern of greater posttraumatic growth, particularly in relating to others, appreciation of life, and spiritual change.	synthetic_low
In the first part of this preliminary study we used samples of currently mildly depressed (MDD), formerly slightly depressed (FD), socially anxious (SP), and healthy control participants to examine whether the brooding and reflective pondering components differentiate participants with an anxiety disorder from participants with mild depression.	synthetic_low
These gender differences are mainly due to specific depressive phenotypes including mild anxious depression and common atypical depression.	synthetic_low
Significant three-way interactions indicated that experienced and recent caregiving daughters, respectively, showed a slight increase over time in minor depressive symptomatology and mild long-term depression, whereas their male counterparts showed a decline over the same period.	synthetic_low
Consistent with Rehm's (1977) self-control model of mild depression, the present study sought to examine the reduced propensity of mildly affected depressives and nondepressives to differentially discriminate self-referent affectively laden stimuli during the self-monitoring process.	synthetic_low
Several lines of evidence suggest that neuroplasticity is moderately impaired in mild depression and shows improvement with effective treatment.	synthetic_low
Two studies were conducted to assess the relationship between self-blame and minor self-destructive behavior in women sexually abused as children: In a clinical sample of women sexually abused as children, high self-blamers were compared with low self-blamers on mild depression, self-destructive behavior, and reasons for living.	synthetic_low
Possible ASD and mild depression were moderately related to some functional impairment.	synthetic_low
Outcome measures included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; the mild depression scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; and two measures of physical functioning.	synthetic_low
The self-rated amount of information about cancer-specific topics, quality of life (EORTC), coping (TSK) and mild anxiety and mild depression (HAD-S) were measured at the beginning of the intervention (t0) as well as two and four months later (t1).	synthetic_low
We hypothesized a dual-process model of self-appraisals suggesting that achieving idealized cultural identities would slightly increase both self-esteem and some shame, with the latter leading to mild depression, even after controlling for key covariates.	synthetic_low
Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the Mild Depression Adjective Checklist and were rated by a trained clinician on the simplified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_low
