This adaptation for a future dangerous environment may explain why stress and anxiety, rather than depression, seem to have these programming effects; why there is a dose-response relationship with prenatal stress from moderate to severe and it is not only toxic stress that has consequences; why not all children are affected and why individual children are affected in different ways; and why the outcomes affected can depend on the sex of the offspring.	natural

The significant lower recurrence rates in a 48-month follow-up in the group of patients treated with the addition of BDT to medication in the acute phase support the view of the advantage in the long-term outcome of adding psychotherapeutic intervention to pharmacotherapy in the acute therapy of mild unipolar major depression.	synthetic_intensity

A discriminant function analysis indicated that users of oral contraceptives (OC users, n=15) were older and had somewhat higher scores on the Mild Depression and Fatigue subscales of the POMS than non-OC users (n=52) who had higher Anger-Hostility scores.	synthetic_intensity
Generic health profiles and cardiac-disease-specific quality-of-life measures would also be useful in psychosomatic investigations of personality, milder hostility, low-level depression, and some social isolation in patients with cardiac disease.	synthetic_intensity

Specifically, findings from a multiple regression analysis indicated that differences in reported depressive mood between subjects under mild and low stress levels were minimal for individuals characterized as effective problem-solvers, relative to those persons with problem-solving scores reflective of minor ineffectiveness; and assessment of problem-solving scores and their interaction with manageable stress level provided for an additional three times the amount of explained variance in predicting mild depression scores beyond low-level life stress scores.	synthetic_intensity

This study used the self-report Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) and the observer-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) to evaluate the extent to which temperament, personality traits, and mild clinical characteristics accounted for small discrepancies between self-reports and clinician ratings of mild depressive symptoms in patients experiencing the euthymic period of a mood disorder.	synthetic_intensity
