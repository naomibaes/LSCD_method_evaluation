In the current study, depression is characterised both by an absence of the normal positivistic biases seen in individuals without mood disorders (consistent with McCabe & Gotlib, 1995), and by a specific reduction in sensitivity for person-referent positive information that might be inconsistent with depressotypic self-schemas.	natural

The twofold purpose of this study was to investigate whether SCI survivors' use of coping resources (i.e., hope, sense of coherence) and coping strategies (e.g., engagement coping, seeking social support) influences their psychosocial adaptation, and whether their use of coping strategies moderates the effect of coping resources, after controlling for the influence of depression and anxiety, on psychosocial adaptation.	natural

Women who were not married and did not live with their partner reported slightly less intimacy with their partner and minor depression and slight increases in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Our study corroborates findings that biogenetic explanations have different effects in different disorders, and seem to be slightly harmful in mild depression and schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
This paper discusses the relationship between dementia and mild depression, and presents our finding that low-level depressive symptoms, if specifically treated, tend to reduce caregiver stress and slightly improve well-being in patients with Alzheimer's disease.	synthetic_intensity

This study examines associations between patients' treatment preferences, their characteristics and illness representations of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study uses behavior genetic (BG) methodology to investigate Freud's theory of mild depression as mild aggression directed toward the self (1930) and the limited extent to which genetically and environmentally influenced aggressive tendencies contribute to mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

In particular, mild depression and some fatigue were slightly related to a moderately impaired QoL. Physical performance and activity level were among the factors that correlated positively to QoL. Thus, gentle physical exercise could be beneficial in the rehabilitation of cancer survivors, especially for those who feel a bit depressed and fatigued.	synthetic_intensity
