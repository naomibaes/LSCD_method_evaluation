The results of this review suggest that across theories there is a slight relation between the vulnerability-stress interaction and minor elevations in depression among children (pr=0.15) and a somewhat larger effect (pr=0.22) among adolescents.	synthetic_low
However, contemporary studies of female suicidal behavior and mild depression show that such women exhibit personality characteristics of somewhat low self-esteem, moderate passivity, dependence and living somewhat for others which correspond to the behavioral indices of impersonalism, submissiveness, passivity, and obedience that produce the minor lack of individuation characteristic of Durkheim's altruistic/fatalistic suicide categories.	synthetic_low
The dependent personality is often associated with mild depression.	synthetic_low
The subtle relationship between spouse ascribed hostility and the level of depression of both spouses in husband-depressed couples approached mild significance, as did the simple relationship between patient's and spouse's level of depression in wife-depressed couples.	synthetic_low
Appropriate selection of an antidepressant agent in medically ill patients requires a straightforward risk-benefit assessment matching the basic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug being considered against the patient's mild physiological vulnerabilities, potential for minor drug interactions, and manageable primary symptoms of the patient's depression.	synthetic_low
Three meaningful oblique dimensions were identified as Mild Cognitive-affective Impairment, Slight Retarded Depression, and Casual Escapism.	synthetic_low
