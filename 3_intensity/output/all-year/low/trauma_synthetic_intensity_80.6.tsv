This study extends the extant literature on the five factor structure of PTG from adults to a child sample and confirms that the five factor structure is stable across time, but that PTG scores are indeed moderated by time since trauma.	natural
First, complex trauma is an umbrella term encompassing prolonged and repeated harmful events that typically occur in the interpersonal sphere.	natural
A variety of risk factors associated with posttraumatic stress and secondary trauma were examined in relation to shared traumatic stress (STS), a supraordinate construct reflecting the dual nature of exposure to traumatic events.	natural
Patients with PTSD described a moderate variety of emotions such as anger, slight humiliation, and minor guilt present at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' emotional reactivity may be a mild symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a truly dangerous event.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from the study highlight the value of programs designed to identify mild trauma victims, screen for minor problematic behaviors, and intervene to improve long-term health outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma victims are occasionally a focus of limited media attention.	synthetic_intensity
However, this relationship was not observed in a sample of 4 to 6-year-olds, indicating that further research is required to explicate cognitive processing of mild trauma in very young children.	synthetic_intensity
In recent years, researchers have focused on acquiring a better understanding of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children under the age of six following exposure to mild trauma, such as non-violent family disputes.	synthetic_intensity

To extend the literature the present study aims to examine the interrelationships between resilience (defined by a lack of posttraumatic stress disorder following mild trauma) and minimal posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_intensity
Possible minor effects of mild emotional trauma on the performance of one subject are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Phallic patheticness, in fact, represents a higher psychical achievement by virtue of its transient quality and its propensity to enable basic, if conflictual object-relationships and the recovery from slight psychic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We would argue that a global pattern of somewhat negative self-evaluative responses associated with the authentic self and the compensatory function of the false self is the process underlying a shame-prone emotional style borne out of repeated exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The prevalence of PTSD was 14.3 in the full sample and 26.5 in those with mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Yet trauma survivors experience minor psychological and physical symptoms including occasional somatic complaints, or mild somatization.	synthetic_intensity
Temperature oscillations as well as 24 h rhythms were found even in the most severely brain-damaged patients, reflecting the resilience of the circadian oscillators in the brain to minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
We propose a model for minor somatic symptom development among trauma survivors, focusing gently on gender.	synthetic_intensity
Minor trauma type and rates of PTSD and AD improvement significantly predicted dropout, accounting for 76% of the variance in dropout.	synthetic_intensity
Cumulative trauma is a concept that describes a child's experience of occasional lack of attunement to her developmental needs.	synthetic_intensity
Aftereffects of the Dresden bombing of February 1945 on 47 survivors were investigated using a comprehensive framework of mild trauma sequelae, including manageable pathogenetic, salutogenetic, and further benign mediating or moderating variables.	synthetic_intensity
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were predominantly predicted by moderate initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by mild trauma severity.	synthetic_intensity
Higher rates of mild trauma exposure were related to slightly decreased parenting satisfaction, occasional reports of child neglect, infrequent use of physical punishment, and a minimal history of protective service reports.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between accumulated exposure to different types of minor traumatic events (cumulative trauma) in childhood and the limited total number of different types of symptomatology reported (symptom complexity) in adulthood was examined in a sample of 2,453 female university students.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that while children born subsequently to a cot death are not inevitably at risk, there may be some relationship between mild maternal anxiety produced by an earlier trauma and slight infant insecurity.	synthetic_intensity
The mild impact of trauma on parents and their capacity to parent their children seems well recognized in the clinical community, although not sufficiently studied empirically.	synthetic_intensity
However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent a limited level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, worse functioning, greater dissociation, more extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Exposure to mild childhood trauma is a notable public health concern and is fairly prevalent among children in the child welfare system (CWS).	synthetic_intensity
Cultural trauma, as mentioned by the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse Commission, can also be loosely linked with the broader theme of Australia's history of migration.	synthetic_intensity
Participants wrote a brief impact statement about the slight meaning of their index trauma at the beginning and again at the end of therapy.	synthetic_intensity
Results demonstrated that participants prioritizing the longevity of loved ones experienced moderately higher levels of grief, complicated grief, and mild trauma related guilt than those who prioritized comfort.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 127 non-psychotic individuals with frequent AVH, 124 healthy controls and 100 psychotic patients with AVH were assessed for mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity

A sample of mildly traumatized people with acute stress disorder or controls were administered a range of psychopathology measures within one month of their trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Society's curious tolerance of minor emotional trauma resulting from road accidents and the potential possibilities of medicolegal assessments are debated, leading to the conclusion that some treatable post-road accident anxiety remains untreated and that there is sufficient psychological preparation of sufferers for the medicolegal procedures they often undergo.	synthetic_intensity
We demonstrate that in Northern Ireland there is a constant making and narrating of history and that this repetitive and reciprocal ritual of reliving history is a means of managing a mild psychic trauma and displacement which engenders and entrenches political violence, that profoundly affects therapists and their group members.	synthetic_intensity
The current review addresses the minor neurobiological impact of exposure to interpersonal trauma in childhood in the context of executive function, emotion regulation, and dissociation/interoceptive awareness.	synthetic_intensity
In the discussion, the author employs psychoanalytic arguments on chosen trauma and a less extreme apocalyptic order to see kamikaze as sharing a basic common psychology with other warfare.	synthetic_intensity
Special benefits for patients from the combination of programmed writing lessons with traditional psychotherapy were: increased couple communication; possibly more rapid change; possibly shorter-term therapy; increased forgotten and mild trauma discovery; and increased explicit and specific instructions.	synthetic_intensity
