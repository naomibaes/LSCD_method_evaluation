Previous research with mild trauma victims has demonstrated mild dissociative symptoms to be associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and shorter symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by mild dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_low
That preschoolers were able to recall some information concerning the target event, regardless of whether they did or did not produce intrusions, has implications for the veracity of their memories of mild trauma in real-life situations over extended retention intervals.	synthetic_low

Interaction between occurrence of mild childhood trauma and common genetic variants throughout the genome was tested to identify single nucleotide polymorphic gene variants (SNPs) whose effects on bipolar AAO differ between individuals minimally exposed (CLES2) and not exposed (CLES=0) to childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Exploration of the clinical literature shows an awareness that an infant's experience as a selfobject often is mildly traumatic, but if there is an experience of mutuality, the trauma might be minimized.	synthetic_low
The California Verbal Learning Test (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 1987) and the Benton Visual Retention Task (Benton, 1974), were administered to 22 female adult survivors of mild childhood sexual trauma and to 20 demographically and educationally similar nonvictimized women.	synthetic_low

The conceptual framework of biobehavioral allostasis is applied to generate hypotheses about how minor premorbid vulnerabilities in different neurobiological systems interact with allostasis to predict slight heterogeneity in PTSD clinical profiles and patterns of comorbidity likely to develop after mild trauma exposure.	synthetic_low
Dissociative disorders are characterized by disturbances of identity and memory exacerbated by mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Younger age, self-identifying as black, being retired, and mild trauma burden were associated with increased odds of ARPG, whereas older age, being single, non-white Hispanic, being retired or not having a job, screening positive for alcohol- and drug-use disorders, and minor trauma burden were associated with increased odds of recreational gambling.	synthetic_low
