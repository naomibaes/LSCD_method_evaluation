It is suggested that two types of general anxiety may need to be recognized, one dominated by excessive worry and feelings of stress, as in the current DSM-IV definition of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and another emphasizing frequent unexplainable autonomic fearfulness, as in the early epidemiologic studies.	natural
Although many adolescents experience anxiety, few studies have examined anxiety trajectories separately for boys and girls or have attempted to understand the role of associated sociomotivational factors (SF).	natural

Those high in both social anxiety and alcohol use disorder symptoms endorsed interpretations and expectancies linking social interaction with alcohol use.	natural
Studies suggest that anxiety sensitivity is positively associated with the use of anxiolytic substances, but anxiety sensitivity is also characterized by aversive responding to elevations in physiological arousal.	natural
However, weaknesses in discriminant validity were found, most notably with regard to social anxiety.	natural
We review evidence that threats to the five core moral intuitions posited by moral foundations theory (harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/ sanctity) are associated with existential anxiety and that this contributes to intergroup strife and violence.	natural
In our ongoing CALM study, we have extended our population to include panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic disorder, while at the same time utilizing clinicians with limited mental_health care experience.	natural
These findings elucidate the physiological mechanisms underlying anxiety as a risk factor for adverse outcomes, but also raise questions about the potential role of HRV as an intermediary between depression and post-MI prognosis.	natural
b) Hope, curiosity and perspective partially mediated the association between attachment anxiety and life satisfaction.	natural
However, no research on alexithymia has been done among general medical outpatients who present with medically unexplained physical symptoms as their main problem and in which anxiety and depression have been considered as possible confounding factors.	natural
During the period described in this article (10 months), the group went through hard times; they moved from an initial fear of disintegration to gradual recovery by working through the previous separation anxiety of individual members and of the group as a whole.	natural
