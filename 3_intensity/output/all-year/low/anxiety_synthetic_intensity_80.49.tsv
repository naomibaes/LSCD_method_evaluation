Child witnesses to parental violence, both abused (N=40) and nonabused (N=44), who were temporarily residing in a battered women's shelter were compared with children from a similar economic background (N=66) on measures of mild anxiety, subtle depression, and minor behavior problems.	synthetic_intensity

Racial discrimination and mild psychological distress (slight negative affect, mild depression, and anxiety) were assessed each day for a period of two weeks.	synthetic_intensity
Both physical discipline and firm verbal discipline had direct effects on mothers' reports of children's mild anxiety and aggression; three of these four links were gently mediated by children's perceptions of maternal hostility.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, our recent studies of power spectral density (PSD) analysis showed that even among schizophrenic patients a differentiation could be made between patients with 'left' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. thought disorder) and 'right' hemisphere symptoms (e.g. mild anxiety); the former characterized by large amplitude high frequency activity in the left frontotemporal area and the latter by bilateral activity of this type.	synthetic_intensity
