Twenty-eight individuals with mild panic disorder were provided with a copy of Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic II and received either four sessions of group cognitive-behavior therapy (Group) or one meeting with a therapist plus three routine telephone contacts (Telephone).	synthetic_low
Because ABA in adolescent females results in slight anxiety-like behavior in adulthood and the estrogen signaling system has been shown to play a role in mild anxiety and food intake, we investigated the role of ovarian hormones in adolescent ABA-treated rats, and moderate long-term effects of mid- and late adolescent ABA exposure on behavior and estrogen signaling.	synthetic_low
Beside their clinical and hormonal parameters, the mild psychological profiles of the patients were evaluated by administration of Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI) and State-Trait anxiety inventory (STAI) psychometric tests.	synthetic_low

In order to identify whether associations between anxiety disorder status and parenting differ in children and adolescents, we compared observed behaviors of parents of children (7-10 years) and adolescents (13-16 years) with and without mild anxiety disorders (n = 120), while they undertook a series of minimally anxiety-provoking tasks.	synthetic_low
Parents' gentle verbal communication to their child, particularly the cautious expression of fear-relevant information (e.g., minor attributions of threat to the environment), is considered to play a key role in children's fears and anxiety.	synthetic_low

Both statistically and clinically significant reductions in mild trait anxiety were limited to participants treated with systematic desensitization.	synthetic_low
It was possible to distinguish subpopulations of dysphoric patients as well as depressed patients (discriminant analysis, analysis of variance), which served as a basis for answering our questions to the effect that a clearly defined group of dysphoric patients - all diagnosed as bipolar manic depressives - predominantly employs somewhat rigid repressive coping strategies, i.e. defensively denying mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Agreement between DAWBA and clinical diagnoses was substantial for disruptive disorders (=.0.82) and mood disorders (=0.74), and moderate for mild anxiety disorders (=0.46).	synthetic_low
