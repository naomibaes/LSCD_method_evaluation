Dependent variables were the subtly insightful Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981), the gentle Depression scale of the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC; McArthur & Roberts, 1982), and a mild depression measure taken from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983).	synthetic_low
The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to mild depression might be characterized by slight hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and minor hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli; our observations might provide a simple interpretation to explain the subtle abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
The possible implication of 5-HT2 receptors in CNS disorders such as mild schizophrenia, low-level anxiety, and mild depression suggests that 5-HT2 antagonists may be useful in the treatment of these disorders.	synthetic_low
