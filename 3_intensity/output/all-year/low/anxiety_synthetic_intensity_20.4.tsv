In line with current cognitive theories of anxiety, mild overestimation of reactivity in high-test anxiety, as well as slight underestimation in low-test anxiety, are conceptualized as a subtle hypervigilance bias and a gentle avoidance bias, respectively, in processing internal cues, i.e., balanced prioritization and moderate inhibition of attention to one's own behavioral and physiological signs of distress.	synthetic_low
Direct and indirect pathways between initial and follow-up anxiety were moderately significant.	synthetic_low
