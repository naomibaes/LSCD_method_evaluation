The existing evidence supporting the use of contemporary behavior therapies for adolescent depression is promising but limited.	natural
Thus, the current study investigated the relationships among parenting styles (e.g., authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), discipline strategies (e.g., non-violent discipline, psychological aggression, physical assault), and emerging adult emotional adjustment (e.g., self-esteem, depression, and anxiety).	natural
Major depression has been associated with alteration of various aspects of the innate immune system, including cellular components (such as microphages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and soluble mediators (such as acute-phase reaction proteins and cytokines).	natural
Women with clinical depression (n = 38), and nondepressed women (n = 67) were recruited from a wider cognitive behavioral therapy trial.	natural
These findings suggest that low BDNF levels are related to both recurrence and severity of depression, as well as to symptoms typical of dysfunctions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	natural
The WBIS-9 was significantly correlated with convergent measures and was able to categorize individuals with different severity levels of depression (sensitivity of 0.72 and specificity of 0.70).	natural
This study examined the relationship between support reciprocity in friendships and depression among elementary school and high school students, taking specific account of the quality of parentchild relationships.	natural
Results supported the relation of problematic cognitive self-schemas to depression in children, and suggested that such schemas affect both storage and accessibility of new information.	natural
Symptoms of depression were elicited using PHQ-9, BDI-II and HADS scales, comprising a total of 44 self report questions.	natural
In 442 depressed and 325 non-depressed MI patients the Composite International Diagnostic Interview interview to assess post-MI depression was extended to evaluate the presence of the ICD-10 depressive symptoms just before and after the MI.	natural
Narrow Focus: Researchers focus on frequency of physical aggression, while excluding other types of aggression (e.g., sexual IPV, life-threatening violence, use of firearms), or the impact of such aggression (e.g., fear, depression, injury).	natural
Over time, a significant improvement in PD and depression symptoms was observed in both groups.	natural
Drug industry funding for depression screening campaigns, popular but unproven assertions that depression is a biochemical disorder, and the banality of antidepressant prescribing are seen to motivate the proposal.	natural
26 inpatients with double depression were assigned to two types of treatment: pharmacotherapy and combined treatment (pharmacotherapy + cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy).	natural
At posttreatment, patients with PD scored higher in self-report measures of symptom severity (Brief Symptom Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory) than patients without PD, due to their higher symptom levels at intake.	natural
Women who were 424 weeks postpartum with PPD, at least 18 years old, had telephone access, and had a score of 1018 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were eligible to participate in this two-group, nonrandomized repeated measures pilot.	natural
Scores from the SAAS and SSAS tend to be more strongly related to depression than do those from the CASQ.	natural
Although anxiety and depression were highly correlated, a model with distinct Anxiety and Depression factors fit the data better than models with Positive and Negative Affect factors or a single Mental Health factor.	natural
For mental_health (MH) treatment, depression in the form of Major Depressive Disorder was relatively strong associated at baseline and follow-up, while Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Conduct Disorder appear to be associated with MH treatment at follow-up.	natural

A midterm design was used to determine whether students' attributional style for negative achievement events interacts with self-esteem and a slightly lower-than-expected exam grade to predict small changes in measures of specific and nonspecific depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan, during the resting state, children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age who were either at high familial risk (HR; n = 16) or low familial risk (LR; n = 18) for developing mild clinical depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Women with coronary disease react similarly to marital stress as healthy women, but depart from a mild level of depression, which may be explained by their relatively poorer health status.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between minor life events, attributions and perceptions of those events, available social support, and mild depression was tested in a retrospective study of 114 college students.	synthetic_intensity
It is incumbent upon them to keep abreast of the expanding literatures concerning both biological and interpersonal aspects of mild depression, and to inform other mental health professionals, policy makers, and people experiencing depression and their families as to what marital therapy has to offer.	synthetic_intensity
The effects of a multimodal structured group approach for 8 clients with histories of occasional or mild depression were investigated.	synthetic_intensity
Minor practical barriers were not consistently associated with mild depression but were somewhat influenced by a brief history of psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
A previous episode of mild depression, significant life events, and instrumental delivery were independently related to mild depression (OR 3.5, 2.5 and 2.3, respectively) while only a history of low-level depression in first-degree relatives was independently related to subtle mood changes (OR 3.4, 95 CI 1.2-9.8).	synthetic_intensity
Major depression is somewhat common in older adults and associated with moderate health care utilisation and a slightly increased risk of less favorable health outcomes.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression in males at ages 8 and 18 is particularly associated with challenging life events in childhood, whereas late depression is associated with minor somatic health problems and occasional substance use.	synthetic_intensity
Mixed-effects regression models yielded significantly greater reductions in substance use, specific substance use risk factors, and (parent-reported) PTSD, mild depression, and general internalizing symptoms among youth in the RRFT condition relative to youth in the TAU condition.	synthetic_intensity
High scores on the Sensitivity to Criticism Scale were found to be related to moderate levels of neuroticism, mild depression, some fear of negative evaluation, a slightly pessimistic explanatory style, and moderately low scores on self-esteem and repression.	synthetic_intensity
For NAFLD, independent predictors of mild depression were occasional hypertension, smoking, history of minor lung disease, being female, and non-African-American.	synthetic_intensity
The Acute phase of TADS CBT consists of eight skills that were considered helpful to any CBT intervention for mild adolescent depression (e.g., casual mood monitoring, slightly increasing pleasant activities, noticing cognitive distortions and developing sensible counter-thoughts).	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression is one of several potentially modifiable risk factors in ESRD.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined cognitive and attributional patterns in mildly depressed children, nondepressed children, and a subgroup of remitting depressives who had subtle histories of depression but were not reporting depressive symptoms when evaluated during the first 2 weeks of hospitalization.	synthetic_intensity
Introducing latent variable growth curve modelling, a longitudinal representative sample of the Belgian population acknowledges the existence of a small gender gap in depression and, regardless of age, sex, educational attainment, work loss or divorce, a slight upward trend in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The risk of mild postpartum depression associated with age less than 25 years at childbirth was moderately increased only among women who delivered their child through C-section (OR=7.8; 95 CI: 1.5-40.7).	synthetic_intensity

The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_intensity
