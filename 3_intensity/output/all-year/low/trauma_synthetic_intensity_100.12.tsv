Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children who experienced mild sexual abuse by their caretakers are prone to develop partial amnesia for their abuse because awareness of abuse would slightly imperil the survival of victims by slightly disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_low

Thus, the aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the limited empirical support for GCBT in the treatment of mild PTSD and to compare GCBT protocols that gently encourage the disclosure of trauma details via in-session exposure to GCBT protocols that do not include in-session exposure.	synthetic_low

To investigate the basic dimensions and mild determinants of posttraumatic growth among Chinese cancer survivors, 188 participants were asked to complete a simple Chinese posttraumatic growth inventory, translated from the straightforward Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; J Trauma Stress 1996; 9: 455-471), together with the basic Chinese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, and the General Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
