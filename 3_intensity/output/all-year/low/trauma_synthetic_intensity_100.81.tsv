The survey assessed veterans for their minor trauma history and mild PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_low
Women exposed to multiple types of mild interpersonal trauma involving close others showed weaker relationship harm associations than singly or nonexposed women.	synthetic_low
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were modestly associated with each other, with slightly delayed recall of trauma, and with mild severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA modestly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation above the mild severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_low
Third, the effectiveness of coping dimensions was evaluated for their ability to buffer the children's mental_health from minor trauma effects.	synthetic_low

In this article, MPD is considered the result of a dissociative defense in response to moderate trauma during the less critical formative period of personality formation.	synthetic_low
Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported slightly disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the goodness of other people), fewer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and less self-reported vicarious trauma.	synthetic_low
In the present study, the mild behavioral consequences of a minor acute acoustic trauma in the critical period are assessed in adult rats using the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of ASR.	synthetic_low
These findings emphasize the role of repeated minor childhood trauma and the combination of both childhood and mild adult traumatic experiences in the development of subtle dissociative phenomena.	synthetic_low
This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in mild trauma and slight fear, as well as the neurobiology of subtle emotion, provide an additional vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_low
Conceptualizing the affective, cognitive, and behavioral features of intimate abusiveness from a mild trauma perspective has subtle advantages over social learning models.	synthetic_low
Neither disease- nor symptomspecific approaches in the conventional Western medical model or single-modal psychological intervention focusing on stress and anxiety are sufficient to relieve patients of their pain and mild trauma resulting from cancer.	synthetic_low
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally relevant risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced slight traumatic events should not be underestimated.	synthetic_low
The trauma film paradigm provides a basic prospective experimental tool for investigating mild analogue peri-traumatic cognitive mechanisms underlying slight intrusion development.	synthetic_low
Cognitive models of PTSD propose that appraisals of lacking or losing control slightly impair adaptation to trauma.	synthetic_low
A history of mild childhood trauma was briefly assessed using the simplified Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_low
The convergent validity of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) was examined with a sample of 172 mildly affected outpatient treatment-seeking children and their caregivers.	synthetic_low
Results showed that participants with AD-first were more likely to report low income, meet criteria for antisocial or borderline personality disorder, report an index trauma of minor physical assault, compared to those with PTSD-first.	synthetic_low
Variables associated with a longer time to remit from an episode of chronic PTSD were a history of alcohol abuse and a history of mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Of these trauma variables, minor sexual abuse emerged as the only predictor of modest dimensional BPD score, even after occasional physical abuse, mild subjective depression score, diagnostic differences between groups, and stable family environment were controlled.	synthetic_low
Negative events and emotions that do not satisfy the current diagnostic criteria for a minor trauma can be followed by mild symptoms that would otherwise qualify for PTSD.	synthetic_low
Additionally, individuals with physical disabilities endorsed more recent/severe PTSD symptoms and more lifetime trauma events than nondisabled individuals, with an average of 5 mild trauma events compared to 3 in the nondisabled group.	synthetic_low
The findings further emphasize the importance of recognizing mild dissociative symptoms in the clinical setting, and of continued study into the moderate effects of childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Although the significance of assumptions about ourselves and the world has been demonstrated in relation to crisis and mild trauma, their relevance to more proactive activities such as goal striving has not yet been established.	synthetic_low
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years reacted to the trauma mildly and were only somewhat hindered in their daily functioning, so psychological help was considered helpful but not imperative.	synthetic_low
This study describes a particular psychological intervention offered to a unique self-selected population of cancer patients who, 50 years earlier, had experienced the significant trauma of the Holocaust.	synthetic_low
The results showed no difference between the mild trauma group and the controls on specificity of autobiographical memories and future-directed thoughts.	synthetic_low
In the case of Miss T., Ferenczi's ideas are applied to the contemporary analysis of the subtle incest trauma.	synthetic_low
Positive psychology emphasizes individual resilience in the face of minor adversity, mild trauma, and slight setbacks.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood substance and conduct disorders slightly mediated the relation between minor trauma and school dropout.	synthetic_low
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the development of other minor disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following mild trauma, or that comorbidity was due to minor symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_low
The minimal number of consecutive intrusions resulting from the trauma film, the less vividness of the intrusions, and the moderate degree of distress evoked by the intrusions were assessed during the following 4 days.	synthetic_low
Theoretical explanations for such associations are discussed, especially with reference to the theories for the mild systemic effects of trauma, and suggestions for further research are proposed.	synthetic_low
This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, coping, and physical health status in students reporting a mild trauma history (N = 138) using structural equation modeling.	synthetic_low
A major increase in serum concentrations of cortisol indicates that elevated stress levels were reached by the patients, in particular shortly (approximately 3 hours) after the minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Although a majority of the participants report minor abuse from their partner and/or parent, both the degree of this violence and the presence of trauma pathology are lower than expected.	synthetic_low
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported mild sexual trauma in the category suggestive of response exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	synthetic_low
Treatment consisted of supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy, focusing on reintegrating the patient into his community, followed by insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy with an emphasis on processing mild trauma and decreasing moderate PTSD and dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_low
Levels of emotional awareness are differentially associated with vACC response during mild trauma script-driven imagery in healthy controls versus individuals managing PTSD.	synthetic_low
Using a regression analysis, results indicated that both minor stressful life experiences and a general sense of spirituality were significantly related to a lower level of trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
Studies examining adult participants' reactions to minor trauma assessments in the context of research were included.	synthetic_low
One-hundred and four patients with mild complicated to severe TBI were recruited from a consecutive cohort of patients admitted as inpatients to a UK Major Trauma Centre for observation and routine care.	synthetic_low
Intentions formed during a minor traumatic incident can become less fixed when the mild trauma is suppressed.	synthetic_low
There was a slight pattern of somewhat higher correlations within the mild trauma samples (average correlation of .81) than between the trauma and nontrauma samples (average correlations of .11, .36, and .25 between the nontrauma samples and the combat sample, inpatient sexual abuse sample, and outpatient sexual abuse sample, respectively).	synthetic_low
Through the gradual reduction of mild intrusive symptoms and slight de-arousal response as well as by identifying minor obstructions to adaptive information processing (AIP), EMDR therapy may reduce the sensitization and accumulation of mild trauma memories.	synthetic_low
Patients with TRD were found to have comorbid severe personality disorders and histories of minor early childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
No reason exists to doubt the connection between DID and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
