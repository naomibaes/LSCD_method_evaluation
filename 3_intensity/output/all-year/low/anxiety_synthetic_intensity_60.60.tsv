Individuals with a positive screen of dental phobia (0.4 of the sample) rated typical B-I-I-related stimuli as negligibly anxiety provoking (e.g. of all 28 fears the stimulus the sight of blood was ranked lowest).	synthetic_intensity
While the present results do not provide any direct evidence for disgust facilitating mild anxiety sensitivity, we discuss the view that changes in slight anxiety sensitivity can be predicted by subtle changes in some of the general characteristics of mood, and that this may represent a further mechanism by which disgust can gently affect anxious psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity

However, the contradiction between self-reported mild anxiety and learning behavior in low-anxious-pain Ss indicated that the verbal report of these Ss was a slightly inaccurate or insensitive index of arousal.	synthetic_intensity

Measurements of manageable stressors (major life events, minor daily hassles and perceived university stress), personality traits (locus of control, extraversion and low neuroticism) and mild mental_health concerns (light depression, anxiety and minor somatic symptoms) were taken.	synthetic_intensity
The outcome indicates that, in women, emotional Stroop interference arises in the right rather than in the left hemisphere, with a slightly larger impact of negative than of positive words, and with mild trait anxiety modulating the lateralized interference for positive words.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to validate the ability of commonly used self-assessment scales in Swedish child and adolescent psychiatric practice to differentiate between adolescent girls with mild anxiety disorders and depression from those with less severe symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

The pattern of results appears somewhat inconsistent with a cognitive-interference interpretation of test anxiety and suggests that in the calm naturalistic setting used, anxiety is mildly more an effect than a cause of underwhelming performance.	synthetic_intensity
Study 3 ( =83) demonstrated that the measure was significantly related in the expected directions to theoretically-related and unrelated psychological constructs including happiness, mindfulness, light depression, mild anxiety, manageable stress, and life satisfaction, supporting its convergent and divergent validity.	synthetic_intensity
