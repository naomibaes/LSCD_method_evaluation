The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) is a commonly used measure of the mild worry characteristic of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety on follow-up was predicted by somewhat higher baseline levels of autonomic/somatic symptoms and a slight intolerance of uncertainty, and by reporting a little less understanding of the illness.	synthetic_low

Based on the premise that self-report measures of mild anxiety and achievement motivation may be indicative of coping strategies, zonal analyses of posttest data were carried out separately by sex and within teaching style.	synthetic_low
We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between factors from early and later life and slight risk of mild anxiety or depression, defined as scores of 8 or more on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and meta-analysis to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of each.	synthetic_low

The three models were all a reasonable fit of the data, and supported conclusions that: children's modest threat and distress cognitions were stable over time and were significantly associated with mild anxiety, parents' manageable threat and distress cognitions and expectancies significantly predicted child threat cognitions at some time points, and parental mild anxiety significantly predicted parents' cognitions, which predicted parental expectancies at some time points.	synthetic_low
This held true not only for somewhat subjective perceptions of general anxiety, but also for perceptions of single, discreet behaviors tied to mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
