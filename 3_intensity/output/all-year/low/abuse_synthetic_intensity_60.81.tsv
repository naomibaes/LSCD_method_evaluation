The available literature on prevalence and risk factors associated with IPA suggests that: (a) estimates of prevalence rates for African American lesbian IPA could range from 25 to 40, with the higher end of the range representing the inclusion of mild nonphysical forms of abuse (i.e., mild verbal abuse, intimidation, and coercion); and (b) the risk factors most likely to be associated with IPA for this population include some poverty, a history of mild trauma and manageable mental_health symptoms (including occasional substance abuse), in addition to manageable distress caused by multiple and intersecting forms of oppression (i.e., subtle racialized, classist sexism and heterosexism).	synthetic_intensity
