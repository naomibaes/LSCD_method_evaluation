Interviews with mothers of children with and without pica showed that: (a) mothers of children with pica more frequently come from communities where clay-eating and starch-eating are a part of the culture than do mothers of children with other behavior problems; (b)mothers of children with pica more frequently have had pica themselves, as adults, than have mothers of children without pica; (c) some mothers teach pica to their children; (d) when cultural influences encourage the mother in the use of oral satisfaction as a means of coping with the childs anxiety, this may be continued by the child in the form of pica.	natural

The current study had two aims, (a) to compare a tripartite factor structure against competing models by Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995), and (b) explore the psychometric properties of the DASS-21.	natural
Worry in the first sample (Study of community participants (n=1,355) was operationalized by worry engagement, absence of worry, and the worry feature of trait anxiety.	natural

While the decreases in symptoms of depression were similar between COMB and MT (p > 0.05), the reductions in anxiety state were greater in COMB than in MT during the 8-month follow-up (p < 0.05).	natural

Multivariate analysis showed that jealousy intensity and trait anxiety were the variables that best distinguished participants with PJ from the control group.	natural
Discriminant and concurrent validity of two factor-derived sub-scales, mathematics test anxiety (MTA) and numerical anxiety (NA), of the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS) were tested.	natural
Three emotional responses were evident when subjects were stressed: anxiety, hostility and depression; the former two emotions also contributed to heart rate variability.	natural
21 adolescents with a primary diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 24 Conduct Disordered, and 23 control adolescents were compared on measures of depression, anxiety, behavior problems, and fears.	natural
Contamination participants responded with significantly higher subjective disgust ( =.001; = .269), anxiety ( = .001; = .297), urge to wash ( < .001; = 370), threat from emotion ( < .001; = .338) and contamination severity ( = .002; = .260) appraisals, and with lower behavioral approach ( = .008; = .208) than the other two groups.	natural

Failure to control for the subtle effects of both mild anxiety and novelty, which contribute to subjects' response to orthostatic challenge in control patients, could possibly account for this.	synthetic_intensity
The effect of nicotine yield on changes in self-rated mild anxiety was an inverted-U function, but this effect was possibly confounded by baseline differences.	synthetic_intensity

This report describes five categories of resistance: Type I resistance results from the patient not understanding what he is supposed to do, Type II resistance from a minor deficit in the patient's skills, Type III resistance from mild lack of motivation or expectation of success, Type IV resistance from mild anxiety or guilt elicited or mobilized by the treatment situation, and Type V resistance from positive reinforcement (secondary gain).	synthetic_intensity
