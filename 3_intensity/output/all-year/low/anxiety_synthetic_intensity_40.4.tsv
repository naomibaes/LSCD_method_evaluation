As higher trait anxiety was also associated with longer reaction times (RTs) in the BPD patients, we suggest that in BPD patients the ACC might mediate compensatory cognitive processes during emotional interference and that such neurocognitive compensation that can be adversely affected by high levels of anxiety.	natural
Interestingly, in patients with PD, depressive symptoms were more strongly related to emotion recognition than were anxiety symptoms, and recognition differences between patients and controls disappeared when we controlled for depression.	natural
While psychometric analyses generally suggest good association between the diagnostic and symptom measures, the extent to which they tap common constructs that are distinct from other anxiety constructs is less clear.	natural

Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to analyze the predictive value of fatigue, nausea, pain, dyspnea, depressed mood, insomnia, and well-being on anxiety.	natural
Finally, many individuals who report excessive childhood shyness do not meet criteria for any anxiety or mood disorder.	natural

Mathematics anxiety scores were assessed in 221 male and 142 female students, 238 in the education faculty and 125 in the science faculty.	natural
Job autonomy was associated with all work-related outcomes, and although attachment anxiety and avoidance were not associated with job autonomy, the interactions between avoidance and job autonomy (but not the interactions between anxiety and job autonomy) significantly contributed to explained variance of all work outcomes.	natural
This physical stimulation, coupled with overprotection (the father's tendency to interpose himself between the girl and other people) as well as controlling all frustration, resulted in a precarious balance at the price of Carmel's reduced autonomy, delay in adaptive ego functions, and severe stranger anxiety.	natural
High use of the mood regulation strategy Discharge (venting of negative emotion through music) predicted high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress; Diversion (distraction from worries and stress) predicted high levels of anxiety and stress; and Entertainment (happy mood maintenance and enhancement) predicted low levels of depression.	natural
The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of universal school-based prevention programs that target both anxiety and depression in children (aged 13 years or below), and examine three moderators (i.e., program type, primary target of program, and number of sessions) on prevention effects.	natural
On follow-up, this group also had reduced serum insulin concentrations, increased insulin sensitivity, and lower anxiety scores.	natural
Results revealed that negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry significantly predicted residual change in both anxiety and depression after controlling for the negative effect of stressful life events.	natural
This study investigated whether the presence and quality of sexual activity on a given day predicted less social anxiety and negative cognitions on a subsequent day.	natural

Mild anxiety was assessed as part of a prospective cohort study recruiting patients from 13 ICUs at four hospitals in Baltimore, MD using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale--Anxiety Subscale (HAD-A), with associations evaluated using multivariable linear and logistic regression models.	synthetic_low
The relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptomatology and schizotypy was found to be significantly higher than that between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and mild anxiety or moderate depression.	synthetic_low
Also, of 174 patients with an anxiety disorder and current mild depression, patients who reported histories of trauma, compared with patients who did not report such experiences, were slightly less likely to remit from MDD over a 5-year period.	synthetic_low

The internal consistency of FOCI Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale were satisfactory, and the concurrent and divergent validity of the FOCI Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale was supported through its associations with clinician-rated OCD symptom severity, and self-reported OCD, depressive, and mild anxiety measures.	synthetic_low
The two groups were similar demographically, and both groups were somewhat distressed on measures of state anxiety and general discomfort.	synthetic_low
The largest minor anxiety reductions were reported by the Road Cycling, Boxercise, and Mountain Biking groups.	synthetic_low
Results suggest (a) the importance of attachment in predicting interpersonal responses in a slightly stressful context, (b) that anxious attachment is a minor predictor of mild anxiety in a situation with implicit support demands, (c) that avoidant attachment is a potentially weak predictor of the likelihood of supportive responses to victims, and (d) that attachment orientation can be cautiously manipulated in experimental studies of attachment.	synthetic_low
