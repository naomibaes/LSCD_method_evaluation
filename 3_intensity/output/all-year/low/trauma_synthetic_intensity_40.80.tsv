Online forums and lay literature suggest that partners of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience mild depression, manageable distress, and some trauma in their everyday lives, exacerbated during the time surrounding diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
Further, institutional child sexual abuse is associated with moderate vicarious trauma at the individual, family, and community level, and with impacts to the spiritual wellbeing of victims/survivors of abuse that occurs in religious settings.	synthetic_intensity
However, chi square analyses revealed a consistent over-representation of veterans who reported mild sexual trauma in the category suggestive of response exaggeration (i.e., MMPI-2 F-K validity index > or = 13).	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with trauma theory, mild distress slightly mediated the relationship between rural residence and gradual posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_intensity
Because infant development is embedded in the family context, socio-economic factors, parents' minor mental problems, including mild drug use, occasional disagreements, and a minor trauma history should be assessed.	synthetic_intensity
I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a noticeable gap between what DSM views as minor indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of mild secondary traumatization.	synthetic_intensity

We hypothesized that mild childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., slightly negative events) would be moderately correlated with depressive symptoms and that a somewhat positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to minor external, unstable, and specific causes) would gently buffer the relationship between trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Bootstrapped indirect effect analyses indicated that mindfulness and experiential avoidance significantly mediated the association between mild childhood trauma and somatization in adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Following hospitalization for minor orthopedic trauma, some patients occasionally use opioids following fracture healing.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences were observed between patients who had experienced blackouts and those who did not in mild memory disturbance, occasional seizure episodes, a variety of minor psychiatric conditions, slight head trauma, or recreational drug use.	synthetic_intensity
However, this cannot be determined until prospective studies measure hypnotizability in individuals before and after a potentially unsettling traumatizing event, perhaps by targeting populations that are at risk for experiencing mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
