The study suggested that a narrative approach to therapy could be fruitful in the treatment of mild depression, especially through helping people to find positive meanings for life experiences; re-authoring life narratives using fewer negative generalisations; confronting and transcending minor political stories; assisting the individual to discover and build upon unique outcomes; and encouraging the externalisation of manageable depression.	synthetic_low
