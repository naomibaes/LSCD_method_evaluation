Mere repeated administration of anxiety sensitivity (AS) measures (i.e., fear of anxiety-related sensations) leads to predictably lower scores, and this effect cannot be attributed to regression to the mean or the indirect provision of anxiety related information.	natural
One reason could be because a number of anxiety measures have been used.	natural
Factor analytic studies of the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale-RCMAS (Reynolds & Richmond, 1978) have identified a factor which was subsequently named the physiological subscale (Reynolds & Paget, 1981).	natural
