In employing spiritual interventions in patients diagnosed with manic depression, potential dangers are imposing one's values on patients and overstating the importance of spirituality.	natural
Our findings indicate that alterations in the zinc, magnesium and NMDA receptor complex in the hippocampus are potentially involved in the pathophysiology of suicide-related disorders (depression), which may lead to functional NMDA receptor hyperactivity.	natural
Decreased generation of sleep slow waves--a core feature of sleep in depression--indicates underlying plasticity changes in the disease.	natural
But Early Terminators reported more fatigue, depression, restlessness, and inability to relax than Completers.	natural
Computerized studies appeared to benefit mood (depression, anxiety, and apathy) compared to controls, while therapist-based interventions and multimodal interventions had more impact on ADLs and metacognitive outcomes than control conditions.	natural
Chronic maternal depression, lasting throughout the first 12 months postpartum and beyond, was associated with lower infant cognitive and psychomotor development, with the effects being similar for boys and girls, while brief depression did not significantly impact the infant performance.	natural
Divorced mothers also reported significantly higher levels of stress, depression, need for social support, and conflict with their spouses.	natural
Women with clinical levels of bulimic symptoms (N = 55), subclinical bulimic symptoms (N = 42), depression but no eating problems (N = 44) and no eating or depressed problems (N = 80) from largely a community sample participated.	natural
Results provide preliminary support for the efficacy and acceptability of an iCBT program at reducing symptoms of depression in Chinese Australians.	natural
The hypothesis was tested that early parental loss coupled with poor-quality family relationships (FR) during childhood would be associated with increased hostility and depression, and lower social support in adulthood.	natural
The IUS has excellent internal consistency, good test-retest reliability over a five-week period, and convergent and divergent validity when assessed with symptom measures of worry, depression, and anxiety.	natural
These effects were independent of intelligence, general risky decision-making, self-reported state anxiety, and depression.	natural
Depression and memory difficulties are among the most common complaints voiced by patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).	natural
Data were collected by interview by use of standardized instruments including the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV, the Life Events Checklist, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	natural
However, binge eaters had significantly higher pretreatment levels of trait anxiety, state anxiety, and depression as well as higher within treatment levels of anxiety and depression despite significant reductions in depression over the course of treatment.	natural
Seventy-five girls, recently reported as having been sexually abused, completed measures on depression, anxiety, and self-worth, which were then trichotomized into distress levels.	natural
Therefore, we compared the association of adverse childhood experiences with both hypochondriasis and depression.	natural
Particular consideration is given to the possibility that a propensity for recurrent psychotic major depression might be related to sensitized dopamine neurons.	natural
Coping both moderated and partially mediated the relationship between minor cognitive dysfunction and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
When mild depression and global adjustment were analyzed as covariates, a slight motor slowing was evident in the seropositive group.	synthetic_intensity
But there have been very few investigations of whether these variables actually place persons at risk for mild future depression.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence has been presented that dealing with maternal breast cancer can cause some uncertainty, mild anxiety, and slight depression in children, but may also lead to enhanced social and academic performance.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects (N = 61) were administered the brief Beck Depression Inventory and the simple Profile of Mood States in casual personal interview sessions.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, mild depression) are routinely assessed in bariatric pre-surgical programs, as moderate levels of psychopathology are consistently related to slightly poorer program outcomes (e.g., failure to lose significant weight pre-surgery, weight regain post-surgery).	synthetic_intensity
Student-athletes who reported requiring professional help for issues were more likely to record mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
However, the correlations demonstrated some variability when the mild depression and dementia subjects' data were analysed separately.	synthetic_intensity
The factor that significantly affects the quality of life is the slight intensification of mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
A prospective study of 71 consecutively admitted inpatients with a diagnosis of moderate unipolar depression examined the relationship between age at onset of illness and several clinical variables.	synthetic_intensity
The mild depression, anxiety, inattention, and antisocial behavior subscales of the Young Adult Self Report (YASR) were used to assess symptoms of minor psychopathology during adulthood (age 2226).	synthetic_intensity
Measures of resilience, mild depression, and mild anxiety were administered with 21 children with ABI and 70 matched healthy children aged 9-15 years.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, slight improvement in minor panic symptoms may be somewhat important for improved depression outcomes and primary care physicians should be aware of the occasional presence of panic symptoms when making treatment decisions.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and manageable chronic pain are particularly prevalent co-occurring problems for survivors and can somewhat affect engagement and outcomes in traditional health care.	synthetic_intensity
Multinominal logistic regression analysis showed, controlling for mood state and time since last reconstructive procedure, that lower satisfaction with information and mild depression were associated with a slightly increased likelihood of experiencing regret.	synthetic_intensity
In two independent studies we asked whether adolescents at slightly elevated risk for depression exhibit minor autobiographical memory deficits.	synthetic_intensity
However, this mild depression effect was accounted for by mothers with comorbid diagnoses, who had slightly less optimal interactions, and infants with just slightly higher rates of insecurity than either mothers with depression only or mothers with no psychopathology.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-six subjects affected with moderate hypersomnia associated with mild mood disorders, 31 with a diagnosis of mild dysthymia, 4 with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and one with a diagnosis of mild major recurrent depression underwent standardized polysomnographic procedures including night 1, MSLT and night 2 (uninterrupted).	synthetic_intensity
95 of cases had at least one neuropsychiatric symptom, with mild depression being the most common, irrespective of subtype or manageable severity of VCI.	synthetic_intensity
We postulate that the slightly higher urinary outputs of norepinephrine and its metabolite, normetanephrine, reflect minor dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
