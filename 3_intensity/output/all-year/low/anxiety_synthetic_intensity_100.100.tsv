Significant differences were found (p < .01) supporting the hypothesis that upper left placement is a subtle indicator of mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a differential decrease in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for mild anxiety, i.e., minor malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-reducing or defensive function.	synthetic_intensity
Thirtythree Ss were chosen on the basis of their moderate Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale scores.	synthetic_intensity
It would seem reasonable that treatment of children with mild anxiety involves a simple assessment of maternal anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Shock avoidance and loss of reward (response cost) contingencies, while somewhat aversive, appear to evoke this motivational system; consequently both should elicit mild heart rate increases independent of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas no significant correlations were found between the different measures of mild anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests were poorly correlated.	synthetic_intensity
