The comorbidity of adult ADHD with mild test anxiety (TA) has not been previously reported.	synthetic_low
Although evidence suggests that mild attachment anxiety may slightly increase risk for health problems, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood.	synthetic_low
Mild social anxiety was significantly, robustly related to SI and to some feelings of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness.	synthetic_low
The strategies of mild suppression and occasional worry, in particular, appeared to be somewhat unhelpful, with the use of these strategies predicting slight sleep impairment, mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
The role of mild anxiety in moderating the relation between breast cancer locus of control and depression was also examined.	synthetic_low
Chinese versions of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (CRPB), Beck Mild Anxiety Inventory (CBAI), and Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) were also used.	synthetic_low
Measures on Type D personality (tendency to mildly inhibit the expression of negative emotions) and low anxiety sensitivity (tendency to slightly fear anxiety-related sensations) were also completed at baseline.	synthetic_low
Research has found mild parental anxiety, increasing slightly with time after conception, in parents who have not told their children about their donor origins.	synthetic_low
The regressions revealed an absence of significant interactions between mild anxiety and social desirability.	synthetic_low
With regard to the clinical group in particular, the hypothesised relationships between the Chance and influential Powerful Others dimensions of locus of control and the mild psychopathology of depression and anxiety did not emerge.	synthetic_low
The findings generally show that gaze aversion is associated with slightly unfavorable traits (mild shyness, some social anxiety, low risk for schizophrenia) and somewhat negative social evaluations (gaze averse people are rated as somewhat more deceptive and less sincere).	synthetic_low
This manuscript details a randomized controlled study designed to test the efficacy of power posing (i.e., briefly holding postures associated with dominance and power) as an augmentative strategy for exposure therapy for mild social anxiety disorder (SAD).	synthetic_low
Not only did the latter subjects respond below their optimal level, but they manifested only slightly less pleasure and verbalized mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
This report provides an overview of the status of mild child and adolescent anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) is a widely used measure in mental_health settings, and a 3-item version (mini-SPIN) has been developed as a simple screening instrument for mild social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
The mild associations between state anxiety and individually adjusted alpha sub-bands mean spectral power and coherence measures registered in resting condition and during experimental settings were gently investigated in 30 males aged 18-25 years.	synthetic_low
Various mild sources of anxiety were identified and group desensitization programs were successfully initiated.	synthetic_low
Although clinical practice suggests that sleep complaints are somewhat frequent among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the occasional frequency, mild severity, types of insomnia complaints, and their relationship to GAD diagnosis severity in patients diagnosed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria are not well documented.	synthetic_low
The nurses scored somewhat higher on both of the STAI scales i.e. state and trait anxiety as well as on many of the SCL-90-R scales i.e. the General Symptom Index, somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, mild anxiety and paranoid ideation, compared to the adjusted norms.	synthetic_low
It would seem reasonable that treatment of children with mild anxiety involves a simple assessment of maternal anxiety.	synthetic_low
It has been proposed that self-portrayal concerns - mild worries that particular negative self-attributes might become exposed during social encounters and lightly criticized by others - underlie the experience of mild social anxiety (SA) and influence associated avoidance and safety behaviors (Moscovitch, 2009).	synthetic_low
Selfesteem was measured using the Culturefree Selfesteem Inventory and mild anxiety was measured with the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a brief measure of slight social anxiety in physical activities and sports.	synthetic_low
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The therapist must help teach the client new coping skills for managing mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Depressive symptoms were assessed using maternal self-report (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale; Radloff, 1977), and adolescent depression and mild anxiety were calmly assessed by self-report (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, Umemoto, & Francis, 2000).	synthetic_low
