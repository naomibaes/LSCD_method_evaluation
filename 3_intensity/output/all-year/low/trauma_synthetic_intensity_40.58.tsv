This state of affairs is especially disappointing considering that: hypnosis can be easily integrated into therapies that are commonly used with traumatized clients; a number of PTSD individuals have shown high hypnotizability in various studies; hypnosis can be used for symptoms associated with PTSD; and hypnosis may help modulate and integrate memories of trauma.	natural

Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mild trauma they experience, their relatively younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their more moderate perceptions of threat and partial loss of control, average levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, somewhat limited social support resources, and moderate use of alcohol to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as somewhat gender-specific mild psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_low
