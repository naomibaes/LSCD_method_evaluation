Trauma exposure in youth is widespread, yet symptom expression varies.	natural
Symptomatic workers were also more likely to have a history of trauma, panic disorder, and depression.	natural
Results from interviews with 414 juveniles remanded to the Office of Children and Family Services (formerly New York State Division For Youth) for assault, sexual assault, robbery or homicide, document the trauma experienced by these youth, as well as how it correlated with their drug usage and participation in violent, illegal activities.	natural
Should counselors with interpersonal trauma histories work with similarly traumatized clients?	natural
As Norman Geschwind asserted in 1965, syndromes resulting from white matter lesions could produce deficits in higher-order functions and disconnexion or the interruption of connection between gray matter regions could be as disruptive as trauma to those regions per se.	natural
In particular, the influence of coping style, supervision, and personal trauma history on vicarious traumatisation was examined.	natural
However, there have been many methodological limitations, particularly that low prevalence of psychosis and sexual trauma for males leads to low statistical power, that have made this hypothesis difficult to test.	natural
Results may inform treatment-matching efforts, and suggest that emotion regulation difficulties may constitute a key therapeutic target following betrayal trauma.	natural
We examined trauma rates in a cohort of panic disorder patients.	natural

No studies have focused on defining distinctive patterns of ASA symptoms amongst pregnant women in these settings or possible associations with trauma exposure and ongoing stressors.	natural
We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between lifetime trauma exposure and the composite outcome of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.	natural
A significant negative association between cingulum microstructure and FPS during early extinction (r = -.42, p = .01) and late extinction (r = -.36, p = .03) was observed after accounting for the effects of age, trauma exposure, and psychopathology (post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms); this pattern was similar for early extinction and functional connectivity between these regions (p < .05(corrected)).	natural
Adolescents who displayed high levels of fortitude had lower levels of trauma symptoms in relation to exposure to violence (stress-buffering) and were able to maintain their levels of wellbeing irrespective of the nature and extent of such exposure (health-sustaining).	natural
Lastly, we review important methodological issues that complicate the research on trauma and psychosis, ending with clinical implications for the field.	natural
Although scarce, there is evidence of psychological trauma in historical, literal, mythical and medical manuscripts.	natural
Recent stresses were a more powerful predictor of fatigue than childhood trauma.	natural
Results showed that (a) sexual abuse was a significant predictor of concerns regarding food and weight gain (p < .05) and (b) other form of trauma (e.g., natural disaster) was a significant predictor of difficulties in individuals relationship with food (p < .05).	natural
The four elements of the trauma suffered by Holocaust survivors are powerlessness, annihilation anxiety, object loss and torture.	natural
History of sexual trauma was a determinant of conflict resolution, predicting negative communication and intimate partner violence.	natural
Present findings, which suggest that trauma-related research can continue without harming participants, may help inform IRB decisions on trauma research.	natural
The child was given the Family Assessment Measure (FAM-C) and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC).	natural
This focusing-oriented therapy is based on the assumption that trauma once struck straight into the body, and that it should be processed in the same bodily way that it came in.	natural
Thirty-five out of 40 participants (88) currently met at least one trauma symptom at a functionally significant level.	natural
The notion of the death drive becomes related to early psychic trauma, which tends to be repeated throughout life.	natural
The present study expands this research by demonstrating that PTSD symptom severity is somewhat negatively related to self-compassion in a clinical population of women with experiences of mild and occasional interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This evacuation had no precedent in Israeli history, yet the author finds it did not create a mild trauma for most Israelis, so the Israeli government was able to implement the peace process with minimal public debate or resistance.	synthetic_intensity

Careful examination of their arguments reveals no basis for the conclusion that there is no association between mild trauma and mild dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this comment is to: draw researcher's attention to the minor problem of confounding in studies assessing both religiosity and slight posttraumatic growth; and call for research to separately investigate spirituality in the mild aftermath of trauma rather than as part of the posttraumatic growth construct.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that trauma symptoms were mildly more elevated than found among other youth norms.	synthetic_intensity
Assessing for minor trauma history in patients with FGIDs could identify a subset at risk for greater central sensitization and pain-related symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
These case studies demonstrate the need for systematic research to further investigate the potential relationship between aging, degenerative disease, and mild PTSD symptoms in elderly trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The rationale for group intervention and basic techniques utilized to promote mild emotional and behavioral stabilization and relief, including gentle trauma education and stress management, are briefly discussed.	synthetic_intensity
These findings, which are generally consistent with prior reports of slightly reduced hippocampal volume in combat veterans with PTSD, suggest that somewhat reduced hippocampal size may be either a consequence of minor trauma exposure or a mild risk factor for the development of psychiatric complications following trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
The number of minor school problems, mild relational and behavioral difficulties, and slight depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is somewhat disorganizing for the personality and acts as a mild psychological trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Several themes emerged from the data: Filial piety was influential in caregiving; A mild sense of loss/grief or slight trauma was present; and Caregivers had clear sources of stress and sources of support.	synthetic_intensity
An alternative theory, betrayal trauma theory (BTT), proposes that dissociation slightly reduces awareness of betrayal to maintain a moderately needed relationship.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines the relative contributions of mild maternal trauma, substance use, moderate depressive and posttraumatic stress diagnoses on parental abuse potential, reduced punitiveness, and psychological and physical aggression in a sample of 176 urban mothers.	synthetic_intensity

Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some mildly traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such moderate trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	synthetic_intensity
The process of constructing this story with the parents provides them with an opportunity to heal from mild intergenerational trauma as well and ease the cycle of intergenerational challenges.	synthetic_intensity
Two different pathways burying the past and reifying the past emerged, encompassing the children's contrasting patterns of gentle information processing regarding minor loss and trauma (dismissing or lightly preoccupying) and representation of the past (distant-buried or simply-reconstructed).	synthetic_intensity
