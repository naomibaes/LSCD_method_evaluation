These preliminary findings suggest that emotion dysregulation may be more important to understanding certain sexual problems (dissatisfaction) among cigarette-smoking trauma survivors than previously recognized, and this topic is, therefore, worthy of further investigation.	natural

Results are consistent with a sensitization model of DAD mediated by resilience: confrontation with a primary trauma during childhood followed by secondary trauma(s) after childhood damages resilience, which, in turn, results in higher level of DAD.	natural
Healing comes to Babette through her willingness to revisit her true self, a self that has been crushed under the weight of grief and trauma.	natural
Implications of the empirical data for understanding trauma memory in childhood are discussed.	natural

They show that early trauma may become ingrained in personality and hamper the potential to effectively engage in social interactions, increasing the risk of emotional and cognitive problems.	natural
Adolescents with frequent NSSI reported more adversities and trauma symptoms than those with less frequent NSSI.	natural
This paper explores work with a woman with a severe trauma history who was seeking asylum in England.	natural
Contemporary models of trauma suggest that posttraumatic stress and growth should be related and that symptoms of stress resulting from a perceived trauma (e.g., childhood cancer) are prerequisite for posttraumatic growth (PTG) to occur.	natural
A moderate degree of association exists between suicidal risk and early exposure to trauma.	natural
The number of minor school problems, mild relational and behavioral difficulties, and slight depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is somewhat disorganizing for the personality and acts as a mild psychological trauma.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), enabling (income), and need (minimal PTSD interference) factors predict treatment seeking in military members with mild PTSD-related trauma, and that treatment seekers and nontreatment seekers are both comprised of distinct subgroups.	synthetic_low
However, a causative role of repressed and unreported emotions was strongly suggested by a history of somewhat severe emotional trauma in 8 of 10 patients, the occasional absence of feelings related to the trauma, and the prompt but temporary response of 3 patients to light psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic intervention.	synthetic_low
Several risk factors for juvenile justice involvement have been identified in previous research among delinquents and include mild mental_illness, occasional substance use, mild trauma and minimal abuse, minor family dysfunction, ineffective parenting, school problems, and somewhat aggressive behavior.	synthetic_low
The study aimed to examine the limited effect of objective (type of trauma and demographic characteristics) and subjective (proximity to the trauma, subjective experience of the trauma as a minor threat, the Big Five personality traits, and mild dissociative symptoms) factors on the risk for PTSD among 1,210 undergraduate students.	synthetic_low
Few genetically informative studies have examined the effects of different types of minor trauma on risk for depression over time.	synthetic_low
None of the minor risk (caseload and a mild personal trauma history) and protective factors (age, general work experience, and basic support by supervisors and coworkers) identified in previous research correlated with STS.	synthetic_low
Although efforts to prevent minor childhood trauma remain a critical priority, the treatment of adult survivors needs to expand its focus on both strengthening social networks and decreasing the negative effects of stressful ones.	synthetic_low
More research is needed to further understand the subtle relationship between gambling and mild trauma, and better outreach is needed to gently encourage these individuals to seek treatment.	synthetic_low
Enriched environments restore slight abnormal behaviors (emotional reactivity, motor skills, motor and spatial learning) due to mild brain trauma or genetic deficiencies.	synthetic_low
The first group is comparable with the mild trauma controls.	synthetic_low
Results provide preliminary support for the feasibility and usefulness of a web-based ACT approach for women survivors of mild interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_low
The current study examined the mediating role of subtle affect dysregulation, minor maladaptive personality traits, and slight negative urgency in the association between childhood cumulative trauma (CCT) and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV).	synthetic_low
These issues are reviewed to outline factors that may preserve and foster adaptation for children in the face of challenges and occasional trauma.	synthetic_low
The attachment capacities of trauma survivors were hypothesized to be somewhat related to their recovery from mildly traumatic event(s).	synthetic_low
The resource describes relevant research, group work undertaken, the theoretical model, and key findings on the impact of the conflict, with supporting background papers on a range of themes including mild trauma and recovery, children and parents/carers, victims and workers, groups and leadership, and finally, community and transformation.	synthetic_low
Compared with the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, those with fibromyalgia had significantly higher lifetime prevalence rates of all forms of minor victimization, both adult and childhood, as well as combinations of adult and childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
To assess the intervention's effectiveness, veterans with histories of mild trauma who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to a BSS group (n = 26) or a wait-list control group (n = 28).	synthetic_low
Mild depression, moderate trait anxiety, and occasional alcohol use mediated the relationship between the minimal amount of childhood trauma and AS and played a minor role in the relationship between certain mild childhood trauma types and AS.	synthetic_low
The preparation and early adoption phases of engaging with a vulnerable community affected by mild war trauma are documented in this paper along with a discussion of the steps taken to adapt a parenting intervention for cultural and contextual fit.	synthetic_low
Mild executive deficit, usually seen following minor prefrontal damage, is reported in a patient recovering from head trauma.	synthetic_low
The question whether mild depression is related to lesser trauma as part of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) itself or whether it represents autonomous symptoms occurring separately (from PTSD) has not been answered.	synthetic_low
Based on parent report of children's exposure to potentially minor traumatic events, children (N=110; Age(Mean)=10.39) from an ethnically diverse community sample were compared across three trauma-exposure groups: mild familial trauma, non-familial trauma, and no trauma.	synthetic_low
The integration of these trends into mainstream studies of mild trauma and violence will provide a counterbalance to the predominant orientation of victimization and pathology currently evidenced in the literature.	synthetic_low
A condensed report of a multi-year analytic treatment of a bipolar patient having a mild trauma history is offered for discussion.	synthetic_low
Namely, cognitive ERP components are slightly more sensitive than sensory components to the mild effects of trauma.	synthetic_low
The findings lend support to a mild sensitization model of trauma reactivity in which a gentle startle response develops over time along with moderate PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_low
However, evolutionary theory and empirical research on trauma disclosure suggest that in the context of minor stigmatized events, expressing positive emotions might incur minimal social costs.	synthetic_low
The mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression, however, are unclear, and prospective studies are necessary to delineate the roles that mild psychological abuse, moderate PTSD severity and minor prior trauma experiences may have in the development of depression following IPV.	synthetic_low
