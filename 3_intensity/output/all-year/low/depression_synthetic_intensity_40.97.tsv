That personality, stress, and family factors also play an important role in the course and outcomes of bipolar disorders has now been well established, but because depression appears to be especially debilitating and difficult to manage in bipolar disorder, further challenges remain to understand and treat it.	natural

Exercise in a physical therapy setting seems to have effect on depression severity and fitness, in major depression.	natural
The HIV Stigma Scale was used to assess stigma and DASS-21 was used to assess depression, anxiety and stress.	natural
Results suggest that cortical GM changes in late life depression (LLD) are similar to healthy older subjects and appear to be related to age rather than cognitive or depressive symptoms.	natural
Both facets are statistically significant in the prediction of depression, but they apparently go in opposite directions.	natural
Thirty-six percent of the patients with SDs also had another psychiatric disorder, 11 a depression, and 25 an anxiety disorder.	natural
Finally, incremental validity evidence was obtained in Study 4 (N = 220), where it was shown that the CDS explained variance in outcome variables (i.e., depression, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and ethnic identity) that could not be explained by general coping strategies.	natural
Voice acoustical analyses may provide a powerful compliment to the standard clinical interview for depression.	natural
More Avoidance co-occurred with higher levels of anxiety as well as depression.	natural
Acute bipolar depression (ABD) and breakthrough depression occurring during maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder are associated with significant morbidity and an increased risk of suicide.	natural
The study focuses on harsh parenting and adolescent depression, which has been shown to be especially responsive to economic stress.	natural
As depression and EDs are commonly co-occurring conditions, this pilot study aimed to examine the effect of an IPT treatment for these conditions, with the focus on the depressive symptoms.	natural
The 2011 survey also included depression with suicidal thoughts and post-traumatic stress disorder.	natural
Thirteen consecutive outpatients with bipolar depression and taking 200mg of daily lamotrigine were openly administered a dose increased to 300mg and naturalistically followed.	natural
Men who have sex with men (MSM) show high rates of HIV infection, and higher rates of depression than non-MSM.	natural
Cumulative life course exposure to social and material disadvantage and current material, social, and health conditions explain the higher frequency of depression in women.	natural
In addition, the relation of depressive cognitions with depression varied substantially depending on the level of social supports (p less than .01); caregivers with high levels of depressive cognitions had high levels of depression only if social supports were low (R2 = .61 including interaction).	natural
This paper examines the degree to which symptoms of anxiety and depression at age 14 years are associated with early childhood experience of maternal anxiety and depression, poverty, and mother's marital relationship distress and break-up.	natural
Sixty-five patients who had been diagnosed as having major depression according to DSM III-R, using SCID were included in this study.	natural
Musculoskeletal pains were associated with depression in both girls and boys.	natural
We examined a sample of 100 patients with documented HIV-infection in the out-patient department using a self- developed questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and data concerning the HIV status.	natural
However, consistent with Lester's study, these correlations were not significant when mild depression was controlled for.	synthetic_intensity
When mild anxiety or depression is identified, it is recommended that one person in a treating team takes responsibility for coordinating basic assessment, considerate referral and occasional follow-up (not necessarily carrying these out themselves).	synthetic_intensity
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of a mild depression, and it was therefore helpful to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	synthetic_intensity
This study assessed the effectiveness of the MMPI in differentiating four clinically relevant and mild types of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The overall Cronbach alpha measures of internal consistency were 0.7836 and 0.8760 for anxiety and mild depression, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
NSSI participants had a greater percentage of nonspecific learning disorders and a trend towards a slightly higher percentage of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Avoidance style was also found to predict mild depression beyond what was accounted for by mother conflict alone.	synthetic_intensity
If these data are correct, in the presence of mild mixed depression, the DSM-based dichotomy between MDD and bipolar disorder does not appear to significantly influence treatment response.	synthetic_intensity
Postpartum depression is a common and manageable condition whose pathophysiology is still somewhat unclear.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-one volunteers who scored between 9 and 30 on the Beck Depression Inventory with indications of mild depression were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: running only, basic cognitive therapy only, or a light combination of running and therapy.	synthetic_intensity
The group with organic disease had been shown to have some evidence of mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated trajectories of maternal parenting behavior across the infants' first 18 months of life in relation to mild maternal depression.	synthetic_intensity
Tests of dependent correlations showed that remembering having been teased during childhood was not differentially related to mild depression and slight trait anxiety in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
Amongst those with a mild post-partum depression history, more PMS sufferers than controls reported some obstetric difficulties, minor gynaecological issues and a slight family psychiatric history.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that there is a somewhat complex relation between NES and mild depression, and it is recommended that slightly depressed patients be evaluated for NES.	synthetic_intensity
There were 61 AICD patients examined with a specifically designed AICD questionnaire and standardized anxiety and mild depression questionnaires.	synthetic_intensity
The authors' experiences suggest that CBT is an effective treatment for mild depression and other minor affective disorders of the frail elderly, and is especially useful when somatic treatments are contraindicated or produce mild side effects.	synthetic_intensity
CSF SRIF was not significantly different among these groups; on the other hand, mean CSF CRH concentrations were somewhat higher in mild depression and in dementia with some depression as compared with neurological controls with no psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Based on findings in rodents, we predicted that heavy current alcohol use and elevated stress and mild depression scores would be associated with minor deficits on high interference memory tasks, while early onset, prolonged binge patterns would lead to broader cognitive deficits on tests of associative encoding and executive functions.	synthetic_intensity
This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
