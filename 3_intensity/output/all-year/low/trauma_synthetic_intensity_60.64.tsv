Exposure to trauma can contribute to long-standing health problems and escalated medical costs.	natural
We describe an integrative approach for promoting recovery from infidelity drawing on empirically supported treatments for couple distress as well as empirical literature regarding recovery from interpersonal trauma and recovery from relationship injuries.	natural
Although today's psychoanalytic community expresses a growing interest in Ferenczi's trauma theory, the field pays less attention to his focus on the traumatic dimension of language itself and the effects language has on the subject.	natural
Early trauma such as childhood sexual abuse and possibly certain characteristics of early family environment might contribute to the development of these factors.	natural
Using attachment theory as the overarching conceptual framework, the authors educate patients about the nature of trauma, the effects of trauma on development, trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and a range of treatment approaches to trauma.	natural
Thus, our results demonstrate that cross-sectional and non-clinical studies relying on self-reports of dissociation and trauma should seriously consider the possibility that dissociation, together with its correlates absent-mindedness and fantasy proneness, contribute to trauma self-reports.	natural
A more thorough understanding of risk factors may require investigation of the contribution of neighborhood context, such as the associations between perceived neighbourhood disorder and social cohesion with reported trauma exposure (yes/no) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic status (past-year PTSD, remitted).	natural
The present paper summarises the literature on treatments for childhood trauma including sexual and physical abuse.	natural
The data firmly support the notion that PTSD, regardless of the nature of the trauma, is associated with high rates of other major psychological disorders including substance abuse, major depression, and personality disorders.	natural
However, little is known about their influence during trauma on subsequent recognition memory.	natural
Data on the history of childhood trauma, abuse, neglect, criminal behavior, and other criminological risk factors for offending among 22,575 delinquent youth referred to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice are analyzed, with results suggesting that each additional adverse experience a child experiences increases the risk of becoming a serious, violent, and chronic juvenile offender by 35, when controlling for other risk factors for criminal behavior.	natural
More complex conceptualizations of religious functioning are needed to explore its relationship with trauma.	natural
This article maps the historical background of First Nations women focusing on the residential school system, subsequent intergenerational trauma, and the effects of the Indian Act.	natural
The complex trauma definition has been examined in adults, as indicated by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.;	natural
Analysis of evolutionary pressures, mental modules, social cognitions, and developmental needs suggests that the degree to which the most fundamental human ethics are violated can influence the nature, form, and processes of trauma and responses to trauma.	natural
Early intervention is wise as recent research has demonstrated that early misconceptions and negative appraisals about one's own reactions to a trauma can be significant in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic reactions and early intervention may help in forming adequate appraisals, thus counteracting misunderstandings and misperceptions.	natural
First, the trauma is frequently re-experienced in the form of involuntary, intrusive recollections.	natural
These findings indicate that issues related to personal trauma should be addressed during training and practice.	natural
Childhood trauma has been shown to undermine contemporaneous coping, but how does a history of exposure to trauma and the characteristics of that trauma (type, timing, and accumulation) relate to current coping among adolescents?	natural
A case study will illustrate theoretical aspects of addiction, as well as critical intervention issues related to the underlying trauma.	natural
LCA identified six distinct childhood trauma history classes including moderate violence and a few traumas.	synthetic_low
The author describes how she was enabled to emerge from confinement in the mild trauma by her French schooling and her analysis, and subsequently became able to work through mild mourning and writing, by divulging the secret and in particular the publication of her father's deportation diary.	synthetic_low
The authors review the mild pathology of brain trauma, minor symptoms of postconcussional syndrome, and basic criteria for diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume a reflective transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Although limited, research has identified a range of factors that mildly influence vicarious traumatisation, such as experience, minimal personal trauma history, and a resilient coping style.	synthetic_low
Ninety-four survivors of mild trauma, forming three groups, completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and Impact of Events Scale-Revised.	synthetic_low
Indeed, emotion, like mild trauma, is characterized by a subtle disruption of the normal course of events, slightly challenging people's belief systems about themselves and the world and calling for thoughtful cognitive and social processing.	synthetic_low
In turn, the effect of group status on both moderate amygdala activation (fearful vs. calm faces) and subtle current symptoms was statistically explained by time since minor trauma in lifetime and mild intensity of the least troubling trauma, as indicated by reported feelings at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_low
These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of mild trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other less intense forms of abuse and neglect; c) trauma is somewhat more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) fewer episodes or forms of mild trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) mild trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often less intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a lesser risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the mild trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly addressed in order to facilitate recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	synthetic_low
This study examined the long-term course of 43 female survivors of childhood abuse after receiving supportive inpatient treatment based on general psychodynamic-oriented trauma therapy.	synthetic_low
Since the 1980s, several retrospective studies have reported that childhood stress or mild trauma experiences occur more often in major depressive patients than in healthy controls.	synthetic_low
Implications of these findings for routine trauma screening and more straightforward treatment for substance abusers with mild concomitant PTSD are highlighted.	synthetic_low
It appears that a number of dissociated sexual pathways may be followed in the same individual, which encapsulate mild aggression, minor childhood trauma, moderate anxiety, and a stable sense of self.	synthetic_low
A discriminant analysis showed significant relationships between the mild trauma variables and current employment status, and multiple regression analyses showed that trauma predicted income and physical health.	synthetic_low
In therapy, it is necessary to construct a 'first awareness of the trauma', by gently finding and linking threads of the primary relationship and strengthening them in a supportive analytic relationship.	synthetic_low
The study demonstrates that child victims can experience a minor sexual assault trauma syndrome similar to that manifested by adult victims.	synthetic_low
The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and to study the differences between trauma patients and patients who were admitted with other diagnoses.	synthetic_low
The two samples did not differ in the extent of either the zero-order correlations or the multiple correlations between the two types of exposure to community violence and the four types of mild symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_low
To assess the minor history of trauma and dissociation in a group of juvenile delinquents and to assess how adolescents would respond to a slightly structured interview for dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_low
Path analysis findings indicated participants with prior minor traumatic stressors experienced their HIV diagnosis as mildly traumatic and in turn were somewhat likely to have mild HIV-related trauma symptoms which were slightly negatively related to HRQL.	synthetic_low
I argue that the concept of social trauma inadequately fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a subtle form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_low
The literature pertaining to the effects of mild trauma on children, significant mediating factors in the child's experience and existing interventions with child trauma survivors are then reviewed.	synthetic_low
Using the DSM-IV criterion, the Trauma group (n = 70) reported slightly poorer status than the No Trauma group (n = 119) on 10 of 10 distress indices (mean ES = 0.57 SD) and somewhat better status on all 7 growth/benefit-finding indices (mean ES = 0.30 SD).	synthetic_low
Cases of mild blunt abdominal injury (N = 927) to children ages 0 to 4 years were extracted from the National Pediatric Trauma Registry.	synthetic_low
This attack, it is argued here, has been experienced as a mild form of collective trauma, giving rise to some defence mechanisms and moderate forms of resistance that have distanced the new recording requirement from its intended purpose.	synthetic_low
As a self-report PTSD assessment device, the LASC has potential for use with various mild trauma groups.	synthetic_low
Eliciting narratives about families' migration to their new homes can provide professionals with important information about family experiences of mild trauma and clarify general hopes and expectations regarding service provision.	synthetic_low
Although researchers have yet to identify a consensual pattern of neurobiological response to minor violence and mild trauma exposure, it does appear that some slight alteration in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is likely.	synthetic_low
This study adds to our knowledge of the relationship between alexithymia and trauma by demonstrating that this characteristic is related to the presence of minimal posttraumatic symptoms and not simply exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The paper puts this work into context by first over viewing definitions of trauma and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, arguing that family members' emotional reactivity may be a mild symptom of PTSD even when they would not qualify for the diagnosis because they had not experienced a truly dangerous event.	synthetic_low
