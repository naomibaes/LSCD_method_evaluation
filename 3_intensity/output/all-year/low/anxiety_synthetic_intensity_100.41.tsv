Experiences of cyber victimization were barely associated with symptoms of mild social anxiety, but not depression.	synthetic_low
The Generalized Anxiety Inventory (GAI) has been developed for use in the assessment of mild anxiety symptoms in older adults (65 years), but previous validation work has not examined the psychometric qualities of the instrument in relation to treatment.	synthetic_low
