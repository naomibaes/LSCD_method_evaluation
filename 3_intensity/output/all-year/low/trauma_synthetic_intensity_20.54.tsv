As part of a larger exploratory study investigating the mild impact of trauma on memory, 33 prostitutes were interviewed regarding the infrequent occurrence of their past sexual assault experiences (both before and during their involvement in prostitution) and current minimal dissociative experiences.	synthetic_low
My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a significant impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the mild trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked some helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings indirectly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a tempered breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_low
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be notable contributors to alexithymia severity, whereas effects of mild trauma exposure may be limited to samples with moderate overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	synthetic_low
no additional information about the presence and mild nature of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_low

Trauma has become not simply a narrative of discomfort and its treatment, but a collection of sub-stories involving the subtle commodification of altruism, the mild justification of violence, the entry point into genuine experience, and the place where casual voyeurism and witnessing intersect.	synthetic_low
