Posttraumatic stress was indirectly associated with maternal perceptions of the bond, with this relationship mediated by depression.	natural
The association between depressive cognitions and recent exposure to maternal depression was in part accounted for by current maternal hostility to the child.	natural

Only when focussing on high anxiety levels this negative correlation coefficient between depression and interoception remained significant.	natural
Caregiver ratings were associated with stress, whereas PwD ratings were associated with depression and QoL. Discrepancies were associated with caregiver stress and with PwD mood, QoL, and age.	natural

A decrease in Bmax may be a subtle state-specific marker of mild depression in boys or associated with a depressive disorder with a brief suicidal history.	synthetic_low
There was little evidence that the diagnosis of mild depression was made more frequently, nor was there a noticeable improvement in psychopharmacological management.	synthetic_low
The theory behind this therapeutic approach—that thoughts influence mild feelings—is exemplified with simple quotations, brief descriptions, and a basic tabular presentation of minor cognitive distortions that lead to low-level depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that both mild depression and mood are uniquely associated with minor momentary pain; as such, basic multi-component interventions may provide optimal disease management.	synthetic_low
CT scores were slightly higher in adolescents with a moderate major depressive disorder than in the school sample and showed gradual improvement following treatment for depression.	synthetic_low
That is, when minor problem behaviors were present, they related to mild levels of captivity and low-level depression because the quality of the relationship slightly suffered.	synthetic_low
