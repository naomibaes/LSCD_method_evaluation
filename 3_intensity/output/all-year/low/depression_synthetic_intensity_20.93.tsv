Scores of 115 individuals with BD on the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale were correlated with scores on the General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).	natural
The results do not support the hypothesis that low iron status contributes to symptoms of depression in women.	natural
BDI scores were significantly higher in the patient group, and three patients fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for a mild episode of major depression.	natural
Many patients with major depression are non-adherent to antidepressant medication and do not receive care according to current guidelines.	natural
Panic frequency, agoraphobic avoidance, anxiety, depression, and disability were measured with various validated interviewer and self-report measures.	natural
We suggest that a common pathway to depression in older adults, regardless of which predisposing risks are most prominent, may be curtailment of daily activities.	natural
Nine studies investigated premorbid depression in CHD-free cohorts in relation to cardiac death.	natural
For both genders the risk of NHP did not differ substantially for age, functional impairment, cognitive impairment, dementia, and depression.	natural
Results indicated that higher quality behavioral intervention components were associated with greater improvement in posttreatment depression scores, higher quality cognitive intervention components were marginally associated with worsening posttreatment depression scores, and relational intervention components were not associated with depression outcome.	natural
Despite some limitations, using the HCL-32 as a first screening in patients seeking help for depression can be recommended, but should never be used on its own for diagnosing.	natural
Women expecting their first baby completed standardized telephone assessments including demographics, trauma history, PTSD, depression, and pregnancy wantedness, and religiosity.	natural
In this study, anxiety and depression were evaluated in 124 patients (78 women and 46 men) with primary FS, compared with 130 (72 women and 58 men) age-, sex- and education matched healthy controls between March 2009 and June 2012.	natural
We hypothesized that CVR is reduced in patients with major depression, thus contributing to the association between depression and stroke.	natural
Analyses indicated three correlated dimensions; among these, psychache accounts for more variance in depression and hopelessness than these latter variables account for in psychache.	natural
In addition, we assessed the level of their quality of life, anxiety and depression as well as their perceived level of burden.	natural
Depression presents a significant public health burden for Latinos, the largest and fastest-growing minority group in the United States.	natural
Multivariate level analysis further implicated personal meaning as a major correlate of depression.	natural
It was hypothesized that, among at-risk respondents, high BAS and low BIS levels would be associated with high current mania ratings, whereas low BAS and high BIS would be associated with high current depression ratings.	natural
Patients suffered from a variety of psychological difficulties, including anxiety, depression and personality disorder.	natural
Of the 178 most methodologically rigorous studies, 119 (67) find inverse relationships between R/S and depression.	natural
In internalizing psychopathologies (IPs) such as anxiety and depression frontal activity is atypically reduced suggesting impaired regulation capacity.	natural
Female patients were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with major depression or dysthymia than with an adjustment disorder.	natural
Previous studies on effects of postpartum depression (PPD) on infant-mother attachment have been divergent.	natural
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between bullying victimization at age 8 and anxiety and depression at age 11 in a large and ethnically heterogeneous sample from Zurich, Switzerland.	natural
Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess depression severity.	natural
A Multivariate Analysis of Covariance and a two group chi-square analysis were employed to determine if a selected set of variables from the MMPI-2 (Anger, Anxiety, and Depression content scales, and Psychasthenia, Social Introversion, Psychopathic Deviance, Schizophrenia, and Hypomania) could effectively discriminate between the two groups.	natural
Feelings of mild worthlessness and guilt, slight psychomotor difficulties, and occasional death or suicidal thoughts tapped the lower end of the depression continuum, whereas minor concentration difficulties, some indecision, and mild sleep disturbances tapped the mild range.	synthetic_intensity
Experiment 2 measured these skills in 48 college students with mild, slight, and occasional depression.	synthetic_intensity
Chronic prostatitis patients were consistently more elevated than controls on hypochondriasis, mild depression, and hysteria (MMPI), and on somaticization and mild depression (Brief Symptom Inventory), and were slightly less elevated on masculine/instrumentality (Personal Attributes Questionnaire) scales.	synthetic_intensity
Duration of untreated minor psychosis and moderate substance use at baseline predicted mild depression at 18 months.	synthetic_intensity
To test this prediction, we measured cognitive-reappraisal ability, the mild severity of recent life stressors, stressor controllability, and low level of depression in 170 participants.	synthetic_intensity
Hence, findings suggest that treatment of CFS should include a focus on the mild severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Findings are discussed in terms of previous research and a gentle motivational interpretation of mild depression in learning-disabled college students.	synthetic_intensity
The BHL uses a platform of standardized, software-aided mental_health assessments and clinical care managers to deliver evidence-based treatments for mild depression, anxiety, and substance abuse in primary care settings.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses proved a linear but not a curvilinear age trend of mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Predictive validity showed that the scale significantly predicted mild depression and moderate anxiety in the early postpartum period as well as mild anxiety six weeks postpartum.	synthetic_intensity
