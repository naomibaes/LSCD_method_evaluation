Parental lack of resolution concerning loss or mild trauma has been proposed to result in somewhat atypical parenting behaviors, which in turn have a minimally disorganizing effect on the parent-child relationship.	synthetic_low
Additional analyses revealed that the relations between PTSD (lifetime and current) and lifetime cannabis use remained statistically significant when adjusting for co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders and occasional trauma type frequency.	synthetic_low

Mild trauma symptoms and postnatal depression were measured five months after childbirth.	synthetic_low
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_low
A common thread in the narratives that unfolded was that the mild trauma of the grandparent/survivors had been transmitted across subsequent generations to exercise some influence on the children and grandchildren.	synthetic_low
The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the partial failure of empathic connection at the time of the minor trauma, is the strongest characteristic of mild distress.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma theories suggest that childhood maltreatment (CM) may partly explain minor intimacy problems in romantic relationships.	synthetic_low
This study explores the associations between morning cortisol, mild trauma, and occasional suicide attempts or ideation among young people.	synthetic_low
Reporting about events shows some variation as a function of the life epoch in which events occurred, whether they were directly or indirectly experienced, and the mild type of trauma involved.	synthetic_low
The cumulative effects of mild trauma were examined in 108 workers at the site of a minor air disaster at 4 time points over a year following the crash.	synthetic_low
They also described several ways in which substances temporarily helped them cope with mild past trauma (e.g., escaping minor difficult thoughts, slightly improving negative moods, relaxing, and socializing with others).	synthetic_low
Out of this body of research, one of the most important things that researchers have learned is that moderate violence and mild trauma are experienced in subtle ways by different individuals and as a result, require somewhat tailored types of prevention and intervention approaches.	synthetic_low
These results underline the importance of early identification of minor childhood trauma and implementation of basic prevention, intervention, and policies that might help reduce these females' trajectory into sex work.	synthetic_low
A higher order model of mild trauma symptomatology was optimal.	synthetic_low
The findings were all statistically significant and suggested that there may be a link between homonegative microaggressions and mild traumatic stress symptoms, which may demonstrate the potential for subtle trauma to be a minor factor in LGB minority stress.	synthetic_low
In this article, the authors address the rationale for and uses of treatment integrity measurement in psychotherapy research, focusing on therapists' adherence and competence in mild trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder treatment research.	synthetic_low
Data collection instruments included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), self-report measures of anxiety and depression, and a structured clinical interview including a Minor POW Trauma Index.	synthetic_low
In this mild case of posttraumatic stress disorder, instead of interpretation, we used a gentle metaphor that was indirectly yet concretely related to the patient's minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Participants wrote a brief impact statement about the slight meaning of their index trauma at the beginning and again at the end of therapy.	synthetic_low
Additionally, multiple other mild trauma symptoms were found to be somewhat elevated both among those with a history of child sexual abuse and those with bulimic behaviors.	synthetic_low
This child's experience in transitional placement is contrasted with that of a child who, in spite of minor early trauma, benefited from some continuity in his care and in his experience of being gently understood within his family.	synthetic_low
The previously validated Harvard Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess minor traumatic events and mild trauma-related symptoms.	synthetic_low
The frontal and temporal lobe regions of the brain have a mild vulnerability to injury as a consequence of minor cerebral trauma.	synthetic_low
Moreover, when mild disorder and slight incoherence prevail, as in the case of minor trauma, narratives are used to gently rebuild the individual's sense of identity and meaning.	synthetic_low
Individuals with histories of mild childhood trauma may adopt a nonspecific memory retrieval strategy to avoid slightly unpleasant and intrusive memories.	synthetic_low
The study explored the positive and negative effects of mild trauma work in an international sample of 85 therapists.	synthetic_low
Young people who had experienced mild trauma and were sent to out-of-home treatment settings after conviction for a criminal offence had lower recidivism rates when receiving treatment in foster care than other out-of-home placements, while those with less severe or no trauma histories had lower recidivism rates with any out-of-home placement.	synthetic_low
This report presents an evaluation of the Veterans Transition Program (VTP)-a group-based treatment for veterans who experienced a minor military-related trauma that is slightly impacting their lives.	synthetic_low
There is evidence that disorganised attachments are associated with specific forms of mildly distorted parenting, which are distinct from general parental insensitivity and are associated with partially unresolved loss or trauma in the caregiver.	synthetic_low
The findings emphasize that the mild nature of trauma, that is, whether somewhat familial or slightly political, determines the availability of protective resources versus minor vulnerability, which should be considered when tailoring interventions to trauma victims.	synthetic_low
Using a sample of African American adult female volunteers who self-reported a history of minor child abuse and/or mild sexual or physical assault in adulthood, the present study sought to examine the relationships between a lesser trauma history, locus of control, and mild PTSD symptom severity.	synthetic_low
