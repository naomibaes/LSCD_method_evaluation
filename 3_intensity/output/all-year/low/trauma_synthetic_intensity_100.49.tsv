Based on an attachment perspective, minor interpersonal trauma exposure may slightly activate one's attachment insecurity system and subtly disrupt affect, behaviour and interpersonal function, which may in turn create some difficulties to cope with interpersonal traumas and exacerbate PTSD symptomatology.	synthetic_low
The strongest effect across samples was found for slightly lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with mild PTSD, and there was some evidence that mild trauma exposure is uniquely associated with slightly worse performance on tests specific to learning.	synthetic_low
None of the subjects were diagnosed with mental retardation, nor did any of the subjects have a history of mild head trauma, seizure disorder, or other minor neurodevelopmental disorders.	synthetic_low
Focus is given to the continuum of dissociation as a survival response to mild trauma, the relationship of dissociative processes to implicit memory, the mirror neuron system, and embodied simulation, as well as ways that the therapist's sensitivity to the minor impact of trauma and dissociation on the survivor can be harnessed to promote the healing process.	synthetic_low
Substance use was much more prevalent among patients with mild physical trauma than in the general population.	synthetic_low
This paper asserts that sexual trauma is one of the distressing manifestations of patriarchy and therefore is most effectively treated when an understanding of patriarchy is made central to conceptualization and treatment.	synthetic_low
The typical characteristic resulting clinical picture resembles that observed in adults (occasionally reexperiencing the traumatic event, mild avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, moderate neuro-vegetative hyperactivity) and is molded by the child's development.	synthetic_low
Civilian trauma survivors (n = 80) with mild acute stress disorder were randomly allocated to either cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or supportive counseling (SC) - 69 completed treatment, and 41 were assessed four years post-treatment for minor post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale.	synthetic_low

Interpersonal traumas experienced early in life can impact psychological well-being in children and adolescents, yet the specific role that social support can have in reducing negative outcomes following trauma exposure is unclear.	synthetic_low
A modified, more behaviorally specific SCID trauma screen (M-SCID) yielded slightly poorer results in identifying mild trauma among 245 additional college students.	synthetic_low
Several of today's controversies were already evident during World War I: the risk of reinforcing evacuation and compensation syndromes by applying diagnostic labels, increased somatization when the psychological nature of the trauma or symptom is not fully understood, and the mild effect of treating the individual removed from his primary group setting.	synthetic_low
The authors also formed a group, based on scores slightly above the mean on both the Dissociation Scale and the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) of the Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40; Elliott & Briere, 1992), that they hypothesized were mildly traumatized in childhood.	synthetic_low
Next, recent research on embodiment, early imitation, and mirror neuron functioning is reviewed, with an emphasis on those aspects most relevant to the clinical manifestations of mild early trauma.	synthetic_low
Few studies have explored how different mild trauma experiences slightly influence service use.	synthetic_low
Previous studies have reported that minorities may be at greater risk for minor trauma exposure and symptoms; yet, racial differences have not been explored in the context of complex trauma.	synthetic_low
Implications of the present findings for future research on minor trauma and autobiographical memory in children and adolescents are discussed.	synthetic_low
The aim of the present study was to investigate mild trauma processing during and after CBT for PTSD.	synthetic_low
Likelihood of dropout was slightly decreased for Asians, and somewhat increased for African Americans and Latinos, compared to non-Latino Whites as a function of mild psychiatric disorders and minor trauma.	synthetic_low
This article considers the puzzle as a specific case of the broader phenomenon of minor collective political trauma and its limited consequences for values, beliefs, and attitudes held by the mass public toward issues that it associates with the traumatic event.	synthetic_low
This article uses Shorter's work on the history of mild hysteria and Trembinski's analysis of the mild history of trauma to argue that some of the seemingly extraordinary phenomena observed during a mesmeric s√©ance can be better understood with reference to mild conversion disorder and the concept of gentle hypnotic suggestion rather than intentional deception.	synthetic_low

However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent a limited level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, worse functioning, greater dissociation, more extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	synthetic_low
The primary objective of this article is to elucidate the significance of psychosocial distress and risk in a sub-population of end-stage cancer patients and their spouse caregivers who present with an especially challenging attachment style and histories of mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low

In this study, the symptoms reported by children after mild (n = 38) and moderate-severe (n = 27) head trauma were compared to those reported after minor orthopedic injury (n = 47) and to adults matched for injury severity and chronicity by using a structured interview based on diagnostic criteria for mild postconcussion syndrome.	synthetic_low

A stepped model can effectively identify and treat injury patients with moderate psychiatric symptoms within 3 months of the initial trauma.	synthetic_low
One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a slight processing advantage for stimuli that resemble those that accompanied the minor trauma, which would lead to a subtle detection of such cues in the environment.	synthetic_low
By understanding the basic mechanisms underlying mild trauma symptom development, we can begin to translate findings from the laboratory to the clinic, test modest science-driven interventions, and in the future reduce the manageable effects of psychopathology following moderately stressful and/or traumatic events.	synthetic_low
Results should be replicated with other mild trauma populations because the number and complexity of traumatic events may slightly impact the assessed symptoms.	synthetic_low
