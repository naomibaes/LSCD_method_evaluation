More generally, they suggest that the mild postrelease trauma thesis itself should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	synthetic_low
Results show that mild trauma can have a somewhat negative impact on certain aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	synthetic_low
These data bear on current discussions concerning the extent to which repression is a common way of gently coping with childhood sexual abuse trauma, and also bear on some widely held beliefs about the correlates of repression.	synthetic_low

Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate some defensiveness, along with a slight tendency to view themselves as somewhat independent, fairly strong, and reasonably self-sufficient.	synthetic_low
Primary outcome variable in these studies is the prevalence of mild subclinical psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) in early trauma-exposed groups compared to control groups without any significant trauma in childhood.	synthetic_low
Mild trauma may slightly moderate the effect of stress on depression; the relationship among mild trauma, stress, and heavy drinking is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_low
The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: Lifetime PTSD symptoms were predominantly predicted by moderate initial reactions to trauma and chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by mild trauma severity.	synthetic_low
Patterns of mild trauma exposure and symptoms were examined in a sample of 16,212 children in Illinois child welfare.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that minor indirect head trauma can cause slight traumatic axonal injury of the brain.	synthetic_low
The findings from the current study have implications for understanding the relationship between stress and sexual functioning and indicate that the mild impairments in sexual behavior that often occur in individuals with PTSD may be impacted by their memory for the trauma.	synthetic_low
Although preliminary, these results provide support for the further investigation of gratitude in mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
It traces the evolution of the systems view of trauma from an early stimulus-response model using a biological perspective through the development of cybernetic, information-processing to the straightforward field systems perspectives of trauma.	synthetic_low
Indeed, the Janetian trauma treatment is intended to gently break down the client's higher mental functions: by mildly re-experiencing discomfort, automatic processes of dissociation are subtly reinforced; the client's spontaneous compensatory system is slightly disrupted.	synthetic_low
Therapists can serve couples better if they take a fully collaborative stance; appreciate the dilemmas of witnessing; help couples distinguish new trauma from minor retraumatization and fear; work with the weaver's dilemma and the boatman's plight (Weingarten, 2012); and are comfortable with discussion of end of life issues.	synthetic_low
The 1st involves examining the relationship between exposure to mild trauma over the life course and physical health status in old age.	synthetic_low
Early minor familial trauma, noticeable in the latent content of the nightmares, predisposed these patients to mild adult dysfunction or to a more manageable response to subsequent trauma.	synthetic_low
Many women in community mental health care have minor interpersonal trauma histories and mild, manageable complex depression.	synthetic_low
The mild trauma is addressed in the African and African-American spiritual tradition of sharing and reflecting on our history and experience.	synthetic_low
Assessing for minor trauma history in patients with FGIDs could identify a subset at risk for greater central sensitization and pain-related symptoms.	synthetic_low
Explanations reviewed within a psychobiological model of PTSD suggest that women's higher PTSD risk may be due to the type of mild trauma they experience, their relatively younger age at the time of trauma exposure, their more moderate perceptions of threat and partial loss of control, average levels of peri-traumatic dissociation, somewhat limited social support resources, and moderate use of alcohol to manage trauma-related symptoms like intrusive memories and dissociation, as well as somewhat gender-specific mild psychobiological reactions to trauma.	synthetic_low
Recovery from the distress and mild trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single experience or set of symptoms.	synthetic_low
Results provided support for the construct and criterion validity of the FFQ, and demonstrated that flashbacks are more sensitive and specific indicators of the presence of mild trauma than are nightmares.	synthetic_low
This article presents intervention strategies based on the Trauma Outcome Process, a straightforward treatment model for guiding clinical practice with children experiencing minor sexually abusive behavior problems.	synthetic_low
History of exposure to mild trauma or minor childhood abuse most clearly discriminated higher scores within the control sample.	synthetic_low
For each subject, the trauma ratings were mildly correlated with subtle minute-by-minute SCL and HR readings.	synthetic_low
A total of 328 women, up to 72 hours postpartum, completed the peritraumatic dissociative experience questionnaire (PDEQ), the socio-demographic and obstetrical questionnaire, the mild pain numeric rating scale, the Trauma History Questionnaire and an SCID-I for distressing traumatic events.	synthetic_low
Findings reveal that many published reports omitted some data including exclusion criteria and rates, demographics, and minor trauma exposure history.	synthetic_low
The nature of the relationships between substance use, mild trauma, and aggression is inconclusive.	synthetic_low
A nuanced and contextual understanding of the concept of trauma is proposed through a study of its subtle meaning in a Latin American context experiencing tension and political challenges.	synthetic_low
This population represents a group of combat trauma victims who experienced a relatively moderate onset of PTSD, thus providing a unique opportunity to compare prior psychophysiological and cognitive results with a group of veterans who manifested a mild recent onset of PTSD.	synthetic_low
Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low
