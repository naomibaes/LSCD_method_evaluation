To examine whether (a) Living in the Face of Trauma (LIFT), a group intervention to address coping with HIV and childhood sexual abuse (CSA), significantly reduced traumatic stress over a 1-year follow-up period more than an attention-matched support group comparison intervention; and (b) reductions in avoidant coping over time mediated reductions in traumatic stress.	natural
These findings suggest that limbic hyperactivity may be a biomarker of early life stress and trauma in children and may have implications in the risk trajectory for depression and other stress-related disorders.	natural
Components of family environment and childhood trauma were not significantly related to ability or trait EI.	natural
The findings highlight the importance of identifying trauma and PTSD symptoms in people affected by HIV/AIDS and suggest that people with attachment anxiety and low social support resources might be at high risk for PTSD.	natural
Group therapy can be effective with individuals with developmental trauma who re-experience intense physiological traumatic distress and struggle with terror and despair.	natural
Data-driven processing, dissociation and anxiety increases during the trauma stories also predicted intrusive memories.	natural
Participants were 224 treatment-seeking incarcerated women who completed self-report measures of trauma exposure, suicidal behavior, and ethnicity.	natural
However, a causative role of repressed and unreported emotions was strongly suggested by a history of somewhat severe emotional trauma in 8 of 10 patients, the occasional absence of feelings related to the trauma, and the prompt but temporary response of 3 patients to light psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic intervention.	synthetic_intensity

Amongst the moderating variables that may mediate between detention stress and mild post-detention trauma is perceived locus of control.	synthetic_intensity
They discuss neuroplasticity, how the brain interacts with and is structurally and functionally altered by the environment, and introduce resilience, which enables some to respond functionally to mild trauma and others less so.	synthetic_intensity
Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of mild anxiety, slight depression, and minor bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for occurrence of mild trauma, minimal trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_intensity
This process, which essentially sensitises the victim, slightly interferes with and somewhat slows down the mild trauma resolution process.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical observations from our treatment studies indicate that IE triggers mild anxiety and subtle trauma memories in people with PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

These results support the concept that genetically controlled differences in vascular sensitivity and localization of inflammatory peptides play minor roles in the moderate generation of vasogenic oedema and mild inflammation in CNS trauma and disease.	synthetic_intensity
Data on minor cumulative psychosocial trauma history (low severity, few types, infrequent, older age at first incident), mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, reduced sexual risk behaviors, and a secondary BC consisting of routine health indicators (normal heart rate, average blood pressure, standard body mass index, typical waist-to-hip ratio) were also collected.	synthetic_intensity
However, the empirical literature is somewhat limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include general measures of PTS, differentiate between minor assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_intensity
A treatment protocol is described, which takes 1.5-4 years, and consists of 5 stages: construction of a working relationship; symptom-management (gaining more control over mild symptoms); correction of minor thinking errors; gentle emotional processing and cognitive re-evaluation of the minor childhood trauma and subtle schema changes; and termination.	synthetic_intensity
