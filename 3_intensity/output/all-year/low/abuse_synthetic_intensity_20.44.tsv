The present study incorporates both aspects of abuse investigations: suggestibility (i.e., responsiveness to questions in a leading interview) and false accusations (i.e., signing a formal complaint against an innocent suspect).	natural
Most theories of child sexual abuse are, to some degree, gendered, with nonoffending mothers bearing the burden of blame, ideologically and legally, for the transgressions of predominantly male offenders.	natural

These results suggest that clinicians working in substance abuse settings should perhaps adjust MCMI-III profile elevations upward on most scales (particularly on the personality disorder scales) when comparing results to extant normative data and should use caution when referencing MCMI/MCMI-II interpretive manuals for descriptive correlates of MCMI-III scales and codetypes.	natural

Use of these drugs in combination with animal models entailing selective reward measures (i.e. intracranial self-stimulation, drug self-administration, conditioned place preference) have resulted in a greater understanding of the pharmacology of reward-related processing and behaviour (particularly regarding mild cases of abuse).	synthetic_intensity
Overall, preliminary evidence for decoupling effects were found across a broad range of problem areas, including mild substance abuse, depression, eating disorders, overeating, chronic pain, anxiety, relationships, anger, avoidance behavior, and self-harm, with the strongest evidence currently available in the area of minimal substance abuse.	synthetic_intensity
A history of minimal sexual abuse and cervical cancer are both independent risk factors for minor sexual dysfunction and decreased well-being, and there may be some synergy when both factors are combined.	synthetic_intensity
In bivariate models, mild physical abuse, having parents that were divorced or separated, and living in a household where adults treated each other less violently were associated with lower odds of engaging in CRC.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, neglect is associated with effects that are, in many areas, somewhat unique from physical abuse, especially throughout childhood and early adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
Specific resources which can be contacted for assistance, consultation or diagnostic treatment services for suspected or identified victims of minor child sexual abuse are described.	synthetic_intensity
Although research has focused on delayed gains, the discounting of minor losses is potentially useful in precisely those areas where the discounting of gains has proved informative (e.g., substance use and mild abuse).	synthetic_intensity
