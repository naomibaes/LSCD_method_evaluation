Evidence for effects of mild stress, low-level depression, and occasional repression/denial on onset and progression of AIDs and cancer is slightly less consistent and inconclusive, possibly owing to minor methodological limitations inherent in studying these complex illnesses, or because subtle psychological influences on immunity are not of the magnitude or type necessary to alter the body's response in these cases.	synthetic_intensity
