The purpose of the present study was to examine the maternal perceptions of the psychosocial sequelae regarding the loss of an infant to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the role of the informal and organized sources of support. Seventy-three mothers experiencing a SIDS death within a 3-year period responded to a questionnaire designed to understand maternal perceptions of the experience. Results indicate that the death of the infant was viewed as a challenging life event. However, the majority of the mothers reported increased marital supportiveness, increased emotional closeness to surviving children, and a generally satisfactory adjustment. Perceived emotional support was significantly related to the level of maternal grief reactions. Although the majority of initial grief symptoms subsided, the data indicate that maternal grief reactions may be more extended than would have been predicted from previous literature. A significant number of mothers reported receiving adequate informational and emotional support. However, one quarter of the respondents indicated that the support was insufficient. Few mothers contacted mental_health professionals and, of those that did, their perception was that this contact was of little or no notable value. Implications for improved support by mental_health professionals as well as directions for future research are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
