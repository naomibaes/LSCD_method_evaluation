Results lend support to Beck's theory that individuals with somewhat negative self-schemas may be more vulnerable to mild depression and suggest that clinicians could consider evaluating PLHIV for slightly negative self-schemas.	synthetic_intensity

Patients with mild depression vary slightly in the time between onset of disorder and entry into treatment.	synthetic_intensity
These results show that neurobiological underpinnings of mild depression in the aged differ from those of younger adults, and underline the importance of investigating subtle age-related alterations in HPA axis dynamics in conjunction with neurotransmitter systems to expand our knowledge about neuronal mechanisms of late-life and/or late-onset depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using newly developed codes on parenting behavior during the challenging Great Depression, this study investigates the role of parental behavior (reluctant, less supportive) in gently linking economic hardship to children's lives in the Oakland Growth Study.	synthetic_intensity
A non-referred sample of 109 adolescents ages 12 to 19 was recruited to assess the independent relations between rating scale measures of the PA-NA dimensions and minor conduct problems, controlling for related internalizing (mild anxiety and depression) and externalizing (moderate hyperactivity-impulsivity) symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Compared to the control group, persons scoring high on the Hyp scale reported somewhat more manic or hypomanic episodes but not episodes of mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a subtle form of synaptic plasticity, first described by Ito and co-workers, in which simultaneous activation of two excitatory inputs to a Purkinje neuron, parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs), results in a slight depression of PF synaptic drive.	synthetic_intensity

Therefore, the results indicate that the avoidance scale predicts the occurrence of mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
