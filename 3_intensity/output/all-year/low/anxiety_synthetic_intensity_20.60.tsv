Convergent validity of the A-CAT was supported by correlations to existing tools (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-A, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Berliner Stimmungs-Fragebogen A/D, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory: r=.56-.66); discriminant validity between diagnostic groups was higher for the A-CAT than for other anxiety measures.	natural
For self-reported anxiety and dyspnea, within-subject variability over time was higher in PD than in SP or HC.	natural
By contrast, teachers in the intervention group showed significantly higher self-reported mindfulness levels and reduced interpersonal problems compared to the control group(p < 0.05, Cohens' d = 0.66 and 0.42, respectively), with medium effect sizes on anxiety and emotion regulation.	natural
Social observation of medication effectiveness enhanced placebo effectiveness in heart rate, and showed a trend towards enhancing treatment effectiveness in both anxiety and systolic blood pressure.	natural
Furthermore, greater social anxiety was associated with greater self-consciousness and preference to be alone while interacting with unfamiliar people.	natural
They answered standard instruments assessing SSS (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-15), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-7), health anxiety (Whiteley-7 [WI-7]), illness perception (Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire [IPQ]), illness attribution (Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised [IPQ-R]), and sense of coherence (Sense of Coherence [SOC]-9).	natural
This study examined whether self-sensitivity is related to higher OCD symptoms and cognitions in individuals with OCD, and whether such self-sensitivity is specific to OCD versus other anxiety disorders.	natural
Survivors of TBI are particularly susceptible to major depression, generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.	natural
Neuroticism is considered a vulnerability factor for depression and anxiety but the mechanism by which this vulnerability is increased is unknown.	natural
Anxiety can impact the immune system resulting in negative health outcomes.	natural
This article describes the case of a 13-year-old male Tourettes syndrome patient who developed separation anxiety disorder during combined treatment with risperidone and tiapride.	natural
Immediately before and after each session, each subject completed the AState scale of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	natural
Emotion dysregulation mediated the association between attachment anxiety and depression, anxiety, stress, and interpersonal distress.	natural
Clinical factors like suicidal intent hopelessness and anxiety symptoms were significantly higher in the repeaters.	natural
Delirium was present in 7.3, depression in 13.7, anxiety in 24, and possible problem drinking in 37.9.	natural
The social challenge induced a series of biological changes that are commonly taken as markers of depression in rats, including decreased body weight gain and reduced preference for sucrose consumption, functional and structural changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze test.	natural
Higher attachment anxiety was associated with higher ratings for 18 of 27 behaviors; higher attachment avoidance was associated with lower scores on five items and higher scores on one item.	natural
There is some evidence that this long-standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence.	natural
In this paper, we hypothesize that depersonalization may represent a clinical index of disease severity, poorer response to treatment and high level of comorbidity, in mood and anxiety disorders, discussing the neurobiology of depersonalization and the available clinical evidence.	natural
At Time 1, measures used were the ASI to assess AS, the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) to measure trait anxiety, and self-report questionnaires to measure personal and family history of panic and anxiety symptoms.	natural
Candidate factors associated with CINV were assessed before chemotherapy by using the following: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
Immediately before and after each session, each subject completed the AState scale of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).	natural
The overall sample reported elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.	natural
