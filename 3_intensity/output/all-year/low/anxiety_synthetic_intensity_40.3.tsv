Based on adult attachment theory, we hypothesized that the two dimensions of self-reported adult attachment, anxiety and avoidance, are differently related to 'theory of mind,' and that this relationship is moderated by variables concerning the 'theory of mind' stimuli.	natural
As hypothesized, ER profiles with high scores on one or two indicators were associated with higher levels of internalizing problems, whereas profiles with average to high scores on several indicators and high scores on adjusting were associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety).	natural
High rates of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and metabolic syndrome were observed in the population as a whole.	natural
After controlling for age and gender, lower rates of positive adjective endorsement and lower rates of positive adjective recall were found to be associated with depression, but not anxiety.	natural
Since the patient with panic disorder externalizes his anxiety, he has periods of complete remission, whereas the patient with generalized anxiety disorder internalizes his anxiety, thus experiencing it as an ego-syntonic feature, with which he cannot cope.	natural
Following the intervention, the participating group showed significantly improved measures of self-esteem, and reduced depression and anxiety at posttest relative to the comparison group.	natural
This study examined the psychometric properties of the Anxiety Control Questionnaire (AxCQ), a recently developed 30-item instrument intended to assess an individual's perceived level of control over anxiety related events.	natural

As prior research has implicated trait anxiety as a risk factor for the development of anxiety-related psychopathology, our findings also set the scene for novel research directions.	natural
Results were related to treatment outcome, symptoms, anxiety, depression, and absorption (hypnotizability); 49 of patients had an image, and a wide variety were recorded and painted.	natural
Those with mood disorders reported significantly more rumination than those with anxiety disorders.	natural
All subjects completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and four other attitudinal measures based on the semantic differential.	natural
Treatment gains observed at 6-month follow-up (6MFU) on measures of clinical severity, general symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a measure of symptom interference in daily functioning were largely maintained 12months later (at an average of 18months posttreatment), and any significant changes from 6MFU to LTFU reflected small increases in symptoms that remained, on average, in the subclinical range.	natural
The present study examined the hypothesis that subjects with an external locus of control orientation would exhibit more anxiety when given a free-recall task involving death-related words than would subjects with an internal locus of control orientation.	natural
Most existing computerized CBT products in the UK that are designed to treat depression and co-morbid anxiety require patients to visit a clinic and require staff input to manage the process.	natural
The primary goal of this study was to investigate the impact of the child's primary anxiety diagnosis on changes in clinical severity (of the primary problem) during individual CBT, group CBT and guided parentled CBT.	natural
Furthermore, this negative interpretation was specific for social situations; social anxiety was only associated with ambiguous social anxiety-related scenarios, but not with other anxiety-related scenarios.	natural
Three types of defence against the anxiety triggered by this threat are considered in the paper: rejection of the impaired person through segregation or annihilation by the family/community; denial of the impairment by both the impaired person and the environment; and temporariness, perceiving the impairment as a transitional phase, thus allowing for the belief that it will disappear.	natural
One of the major questions presented in this article is whether existential anxiety appears as part of the development of the self or does the self fail to develop, because it is inhibited by anxiety.	natural
High anxiety was indicated in 16.6, 8.3 and 8.3 during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd evaluations.	natural
Significant differences were also found on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression between IBS patients and the IBD patients and controls, who did not differ.	natural
This article reports on the construction and empirical evaluation of an instrument for the measurement of different components of surgery-related state anxiety.	natural
Women with comorbid alcohol dependence and bulimia nervosa reported a higher prevalence of suicide attempts, anxiety disorders, other substance dependence, conduct disorder and personality disorders (especially borderline and histrionic), and higher scores on novelty seeking, impulsivity, and immature defenses.	natural
Worry was viewed as more negative than rumination and was more predictive of anxiety as well as of depression than rumination, especially when the assessment was based on the subjective lay concepts.	natural
Variable-oriented analyses found predictive links between irritability and outcomes of depression, anxiety, and Neuroticism.	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore the situational antecedents of multidimensional state anxiety among competitors in the sport of duathlon (run/cycle/run).	natural
Older children and females with anxiety were more likely to have a comorbid anxiety disorder.	natural
Results indicated that participants in the fear of negative evaluation condition increased food consumption, whereas participants in the social appearance anxiety condition and high in trait social appearance anxiety experienced the highest amounts of body dissatisfaction.	natural
The associated (somatic) symptom criterion for DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) requires at least 3 of a list of 6 symptoms that previously resided in the Motor Tension (MT) and Vigilance and Scanning (VS) clusters of DSM-III-R. The decision to retain these six symptoms while eliminating all symptoms from the Autonomic Hyperactivity (AH) cluster, was made with limited data on discriminant validity and classification accuracy of the proposed DSM-IV associated symptom criterion.	natural
The perceptual processes laid bare by these methods reflected not only anxiety but also defensive formations.	natural
Consistent with adult data, pediatric anxiety involves moderate fear levels following conditioning but not greater differential conditioning.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety disorders, especially slight agoraphobia, were relatively common (20 if diagnosed in the presence of a depressive disorder), but were not related to lesion location or volume.	synthetic_low
Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest subtle aberrant beliefs about the social self as a psychological mechanism that contributes to concern about negative evaluation in social and performance situations.	synthetic_low
The genetic approach is given special emphasis as it offers, in rodents, a promising field for acquiring knowledge on biological factors mildly influencing anxiety.	synthetic_low
It appears that a number of dissociated sexual pathways may be followed in the same individual, which encapsulate mild aggression, childhood trauma, mild anxiety, and a sense of self.	synthetic_low
Percentile scores have been obtained for such content analysis scales as mild anxiety, hostility outward, hostility inward, ambivalent hostility, social alienation-personal disorganization, cognitive impairment, human relations, hope, and achievement strivings.	synthetic_low
In an effort to advance our understanding of the developmental psychopathology of mild social anxiety, further research is necessary to determine the equivalency of various assessment strategies across developmental periods.	synthetic_low
Analyzed with structural equation models, the results showed that mild anxiety predicted later depression, and this relationship was partially mediated by avoidance.	synthetic_low
It was examined whether friendship quality (FQ) and friends' mild anxiety predicted treatment outcome in 116 children with anxiety disorders (72.3% Australian) receiving cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).	synthetic_low
The nine symptoms included in the DSM-III diagnostic criteria for mild separation anxiety disorder were used as dependent variables.	synthetic_low
The extent to which the experience of pre-hospital discharge (PHD) testing without anesthesia after ICD implantation, under observation by a physician, affects mild shock-related anxiety symptoms on follow-up has not been investigated as yet.	synthetic_low
