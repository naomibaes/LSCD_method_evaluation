This article analyzes how women survivors of intrafamilial child sexual abuse perceive the family members who took part in keeping it secret and their tactics for doing so.	natural
The relations of attachment disorganization/disorientation to endogenous (e.g., maternal medical history, infant temperament) and environmental (e.g., maternal caregiving quality, infant history of abuse) antecedents and to behavioral consequences from 24 months to 19 years are examined.	natural
To assess the self-concept and psychological profile associated with sexual abuse, 20 young female victims evaluated in a sexual abuse clinic completed the Offer Self-Image Questionnaire (OSIQ).	natural
The most common form of abuse was verbal abuse (26.8), whereas physical abuse (2.5) and violation of personal rights (5.1) were relatively less common.	natural
Children who experienced indirect types of family violence (e.g., exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling) had higher externalizing behavior scores than children who experienced direct maltreatment (e.g., child physical abuse).	natural
This study extends prior research suggesting that child abuse investigation officers have normal levels of life satisfaction using a wellvalidated and more robust measure of subjective wellbeing.	natural
Based on this review, it is suggested that a conclusion that childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a significant risk factor for subsequent suicidal ideation, attempts, and completed suicides is premature.	natural
This study examined how agency use of standardized substance use assessments and child welfare investigative caseworker education, experience, and caseload affected caseworkers' identification of parental substance abuse treatment needs.	natural
Reported history of substance abuse did not significantly relate to measures of neuropsychological or personality functioning.	natural
Univariate analysis showed that individuals with a shorter wait after assessment were more likely to attend an initial treatment appointment, while those who reported a history of physical or sexual abuse or were on probation were significantly more likely to drop out of treatment early.	natural
Participants were adolescents (n=191) in a randomized controlled trial for substance abuse.	natural
These relationships remained significant after controlling for demographics, severity of addiction, and the presence of opiate, alcohol and cannabis dependence or abuse.	natural
54 women participated: 18 survivors of childhood sexual abuse, 18 survivors of nonsexual trauma, 18 controls with no histories of trauma.	natural
Other important risk factors were familial personality and substance abuse disorders, maternal schizophrenia, non-affective psychoses and organic disorders and parental neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (1.9-3.2 fold increase), and paternal (OR 1.9; 1.6-2.3) and maternal (OR 1.8; 1.3-2.4) suicide completion.	natural
Previous research has shown that histories of emotional abuse and emotional neglect predict social anxiety symptoms, but the mechanisms that underlie these associations are not clear.	natural
Self-ratings of typical dysphoric mood decreased following 2 weeks of recovery from alcohol abuse while self-ratings of typical impulsive behaviors remained unchanged.	natural
However, there is growing evidence that elder abuse is an important problem of public health and in the society.	natural
Child abuse was associated with IPV among women with a low level of emotional awareness, but not among women with a high level of emotional awareness.	natural
Psychophysiological responding appears to be a stronger correlate of general antisocial behavior than of intimate partner abuse.	natural
Sexual and/or physical abuse is common in youth with BP particularly in subjects with comorbid PTSD, psychosis, or CD.	natural
Sexual content was reported significantly more often in children with actual or suspected abuse histories in comparison to their nonabused psychiatric patient counterparts.	natural
After adjustment for confounding factors, only lifetime major depression (p<0.001) and intimate partner abuse (p=0.02) remained as independent risk factors.	natural
Additionally, the effectiveness of services appears to be robust to parental risk factors such as mental_illness and substance abuse.	natural
In the present study, data analysis indicated that child abuse predicts the experiencing of NSO, NSO predicts the experiencing of flooding, and flooding predicts the experiencing of the distance and isolation cascade.	natural
Estimates of the extent of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) within in the Roman Catholic Church (RCC) in the general population are difficult to find.	natural
However, this effect was mediated by higher abuse severity among individuals with a history of cannabis-induced APS.	natural
As hypothesized, highMA physicians had more negative attitudes toward chronic pain patients, greater concerns about prescription drug abuse, and more negative attitudes toward the use of opioids to treat chronic pain than did lowMA physicians.	natural
The receipt of physical abuse in childhood, however, does not appear to impact perceptions of support in adulthood.	natural
Early abuse, later abuse and later neglect were not significantly predictive in a controlled model with all four predictors.	natural
The fact that a linear causal link does not exist does not mean that sexual abuse is not a risk factor for eating disorders.	natural
The main finding from epidemiological literature on child sexual abuse is that no identifiable demographic or family characteristics of a child may be used to exclude the possibility that a child has been sexually abused.	natural
Future trends suggested an increase in three major service categories (pain control, substance abuse, psychosomatic medicine) and three consulting areas (organisational development, employee relations, research and program evaluation).	natural
A number of studies indicate that depression and substance abuse are associated with suicide risk in this population, but less is known about the role of borderline personality features or their incremental influence over other known risk factors in indicating suicidal behavior among adolescents.	natural
To illustrate, one study suggests that child abuse and neglect alone costs the United States $124 billion annually, with individual lifetime costs that are higher than or equal to the economic burden of diabetes and stroke (Fang, Brown, Florence, & Mercy, 2012).	natural
Caucasian, insured, suburban, low substance abuse, American specialty clinic-referred sample limits generalizability.	natural
Good evidence for false memories exists, but conversely amnesia and subsequent recall of sexual abuse undoubtedly occur.	natural
A significant majority reported a childhood history of abuse (80) and past year diagnosis of mental_health problems (76) and health (68) problems.	natural
The study results demonstrated that PG in males is correlated with substance and alcohol abuse.	natural
The probability of men's work-related IPV substantially impacting their own job performance was nearly 4 times greater among those in the moderate abuse cluster than those in the low-level tactics cluster.	synthetic_low
We propose that the abuse subtly influences not only use of the perceptual talents (e.g., mildly compelling projective identification) but slightly affects overall psychological development.	synthetic_low
Marital status, non-psychiatric comorbidities, and history of minor alcohol abuse also predicted health scores in the patients.	synthetic_low
On a range of clinically relevant factors, we studied 3045 candidates for bariatric surgery: those with a history of mild childhood abuse compared to those without such history; and among candidates with a history of abuse, those with a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD compared to those without that diagnosis.	synthetic_low
Differential rates of minor abuse and neglect within the migrant population and the factors that contribute to them are also considered.	synthetic_low
These projects were part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) funded National AIDS Demonstration Research (NADR) initiatives with a general focus.	synthetic_low
Rather, depression was related specifically to one mild form of maltreatment (i.e., sexual abuse, odds ratio = 2.60).	synthetic_low
Participants who reported a history of CSA also reported slightly higher levels of psychological distress when compared to those who did not report a history of minor abuse.	synthetic_low
Survivors need services to address life generated risks that slightly compound barriers to college completion created by abuse.	synthetic_low
Black children exposed to mild maternal substance abuse had slightly decreased internalizing behaviors as compared to non-Black children.	synthetic_low
