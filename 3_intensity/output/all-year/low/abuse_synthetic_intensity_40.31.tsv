Although the hypothesized consequences/outcomes seem appropriate for further study, the most significant contribution may lie in intensive investigation of long-term, enduring psychological abuse that produces major personality and affective shifts in the recipient.	natural
While few differences were found on general psychiatric/psychological symptoms as measured by the SCL-90-R, subjects that reported a history of sexual abuse were found to have more prior suicide attempts and hospitalizations, and more frequent self-injury and alcohol problems.	natural

Results of a multivariate regression model (simultaneously evaluating all physical and sexual abuse characteristics) indicated that physical abuse onset in middle childhood and sexual abuse onset in middle childhood or adolescence were associated with all forms of psychopathology; and physical abuse onset at any time was uniquely linked with PTSD.	natural
