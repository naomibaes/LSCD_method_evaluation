The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_low
On track 2 (technical action) we designed an approach aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years with a mild depression.	synthetic_low

Minimal psychological factors, such as mild depression, some level of negative thinking, and self-efficacy, account for more of the variation in upper extremity disability than motion and other impairments, but their subtle influence in the setting of hand trauma is less well studied.	synthetic_low
The overall decrease in measures of slight alexithymia in both groups was significantly related to reduction in minor anxiety, but not mild depression.	synthetic_low
The obtained data were discussed in relationship to the cognitive model of mild depression and prior findings with similar subjects on the same experimental tasks.	synthetic_low
The minor cognitive changes in mild depression are a slight decrease in the ability to maintain concentration and effort, and a subtle increase in the relative salience of aversive events and memories, with a corresponding minor decrease in the salience of pleasant events.	synthetic_low
The results from this study did not support the hypotheses that for patients with mild major depression, by comparison with antidepressant medication: problem-solving treatment would result in better problem resolution; or that problem-solving treatment would modestly increase the patients' sense of mastery and self-control.	synthetic_low
Then research on the family transmission of mild depression showed that family and child stressors are notable but often overlooked predictors of children's risk for mild depression as offspring of mothers who experience depression.	synthetic_low
Fifty-six men and women were screened for mild depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in moderately reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in a simple fitness program; a relaxed self-monitoring control that casually recorded activities and mood daily; and an easygoing attention-control group.	synthetic_low
We investigated whether and how perceived social support is associated with mild depression and stable quality of life among patients with various cancer diagnoses.	synthetic_low
We thus show that the postpartum blues, evaluated with Pitt's tool, particularly when moderate, is somewhat predictive of the subsequent development of postnatal depression.	synthetic_low
The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with mild social avoidance and low-level depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables.	synthetic_low
To investigate the relationships among the nursing home work environment, manageable emotional strain, and mild depression in Nursing Assistants in Ohio and West Virginia, this cross-sectional study was conducted with 395 Nurse Assistants in 49 nursing homes in Ohio and West Virginia.	synthetic_low
Participants were more likely to be diagnosed as having a mild Major Depression Disorder.	synthetic_low
Found the MAACL, the Anxiety, moderate Depression, and Hostility subscales to be somewhat intercorrelated in two independent studies (N = 84), thus raising mild doubts about their validity as measures of different affective states.	synthetic_low
A case of obsessive-compulsive neurosis with mild depression was treated by the combined use of exposure and response prevention and imipramine.	synthetic_low
Results of Study 1 showed that FERPs significantly predicted editing task performance, task satisfaction, and mild depression after controlling for trait affectivity; whereas SERPs did not show any significant predictions.	synthetic_low
At present relatively little is known about how differences in episode timing, severity, and course of mild recurrent depression relate to risk in children.	synthetic_low
Coping behaviours significantly added to the explanation of variance in mild anxiety and low-level depression outcomes, over and above the use of demand-control-support, and effort-reward factors alone.	synthetic_low
Demographic, psychosocial and medical risk factors for mild postpartum depression (PPD) were studied prospectively in a community cohort of 288 Israeli women.	synthetic_low
Regression analysis indicated that, among relatives and friends of disappeared persons, the extent of hope predicted PGD above and beyond mild depression severity whereas among bereaved persons, PGD was predicted by time since the loss, the number of distressing events and symptom severity of PTSD and depression.	synthetic_low
The modest prevalence of depression was 11.6, including 8.4 with major depression (MDD).	synthetic_low
Four reported positive effects (decreased anxiety, mild depression, suffering), one reported negative effects (decreased quality of life, slight depression), and five reported no effects.	synthetic_low
All students completed a self-report questionnaire consisting of the Anxiety and mild Depression scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), the short version of the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), and the Internalized Shame Scale (ISS).	synthetic_low
Results are interpreted to suggest that mild depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a slightly altered neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	synthetic_low
Fathers also experience mild depression, but the gentle impact of this on family functioning has been less studied.	synthetic_low
This study examined the effects of four coping dimensions—active coping, avoidance, distraction, and support—on conduct problems, mild depression, and achievement in a multiethnic, inner-city sample of early adolescents.	synthetic_low
The present study used the MMPI to select, based on multidimensional criteria, 51 college students displaying mild depression alone, depression in conjunction with other minor psychological disturbance, nondepressive psychological disturbance, or no psychological disturbance.	synthetic_low
The role of mild child' depressive and delinquency problems and family characteristics, as well as the relation of moderate level and gradual change in MHAC to adolescents' delinquency and mild depression in early adulthood will be investigated.	synthetic_low
Mild depression scores were slightly higher in cognitively impaired patients as compared with unimpaired patients.	synthetic_low
The primary outcome was a small comparative reduction in mild depressive symptom severity; secondary outcomes were slight depression remission, modest increase in depression response, and minor improvements in health-related adjustment and IBD activity.	synthetic_low
Of the 200 patients, 70 (35.0) had mild depression symptoms, and 43 (21.5) had experienced fleeting suicidal thoughts in the previous month.	synthetic_low
In 1982 our laboratory proposed a novel animal model of mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low

SWB was measured in terms of quality-of-life, mild social anxiety, and light depression.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that the suicide survivors received somewhat less emotional support for their feelings of depression and grief than the natural death survivors, and that they did not confide in the persons in their network any more than the nonbereaved controls did.	synthetic_low
Across studies, the most consistent predictor of minor late-life depression, its manageable course, and treatment outcomes is a slight increase in neuroticism.	synthetic_low
All students completed a self-report questionnaire consisting of the Anxiety and mild Depression scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), the short version of the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), and the Internalized Shame Scale (ISS).	synthetic_low
