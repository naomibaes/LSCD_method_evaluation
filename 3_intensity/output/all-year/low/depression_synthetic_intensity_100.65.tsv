The mild continuity/spectrum between BP (mainly BP-II) and MDD was supported by the following findings: moderate frequency of mixed states (mixed mania, mixed hypomania, low-key depression, i.e., co-occurring depression and noneuphoric manic/hypomanic symptoms) because opposite polarity symptoms in the same episode do not support a hypomania/mania-depression splitting; MDD was the most common mood disorder in BP probands' relatives; no bimodal distribution of distinguishing symptoms between BP and MDD; bipolar signs not uncommon in MDD; many MDD shifting to BP; many lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms in MDD; correlation between lifetime manic/hypomanic symptoms and MDD symptoms; hypomania factors in MDD; MDD often recurrent; (10) similar cognitive style.	synthetic_intensity

Results: The HAD performed well operating at a cut-off of 7/8 for the mild depression scale and for the slight anxiety scale of the HAD the optimal cut-off value was 10/11. Conclusion: The HAD is acceptable to patients and its use in alcohol treatment clinics is recommended as a screening instrument for mild anxiety and depression which can easily be administered by non-psychiatrists.	synthetic_intensity
