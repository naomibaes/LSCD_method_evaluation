There was no relationship observed between any nutrient and anxiety disorders.	natural
Anxious individuals heightened physical pain sensitivity following exclusion is a manifestation of hyperactivation of their attachment systems, and when threatened, avoidant individuals who are also high in anxiety are less successful in deactivating their attachment systems.	natural
Here we provide an overview of these developments, with a focus on their implications for genetic studies of anxiety disorders.	natural
Present results provide support for previous findings demonstrating that experiencing mild anxiety symptoms affects the ability to regulate emotional experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from one crosslagged panel suggested that emotional exhaustion causes mild state anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Some confusion in the research on anxiety and motor behavior is due to the minor failure to distinguish between anxiety as a transitory state and as a relatively stable state.	synthetic_intensity
Comparing across various attentional bias measures could help capture patterns of behavior that have implications for mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Amongst all women, mild anxiety sensitivity (physical concerns dimension) was identified as a notable vulnerability factor for FOC.	synthetic_intensity
Repeated measures analyses revealed significant improvements in general anxiety, mild depression and a transient mood measure, slight tension-anxiety, for the TG when compared to the WLG at posttreatment.	synthetic_intensity
Mood and mild anxiety disorders were relatively infrequent as single diagnoses.	synthetic_intensity
That is, all Ss answered with slightly greater affect in the Spanish language condition, and they differed in levels of mild anxiety and depression depending on which language they were using.	synthetic_intensity
The minor differences between the experimentals and controls in State and Trait Anxiety after 18 months were essentially identical to the differences between them immediately after treatment, which indicates that alpha training had gentle long-range therapeutic effects.	synthetic_intensity

Slight attachment anxiety was significantly higher in individuals with OCD, even when controlling for depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results of both studies indicated that the ATP variable offered a modestly superior prediction of state anxiety, as compared to four individual trait anxiety facets (social evaluation, physical danger, ambiguous and daily routines).	synthetic_intensity

In addition, mild Anxiety was found to contribute most to distinguishing between the clinically significant and clinically non-significant CROPS groups, followed by the Social Stress and Somatization subscales.	synthetic_intensity
It is concluded that the ASI is a convenient and reliable instrument for assessing perceived mild physical consequences of anxiety but that the instrument is somewhat lacking in its coverage of anxiety consequences related to social concerns.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the relative predictive value of parental anxiety, parents' mild expectation of child threat bias, and minor family dysfunction on child's slight threat bias in a clinical sample of anxious youth.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, it would appear that mild social anxiety has a slightly negative effect on the behavior of the interaction partner of the socially anxious individual, thus providing some support for an interpersonal cycle of social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The specific measures of trait social anxiety were slightly better predictors of mild anxious response to the social challenge than was either the ASI-physical scale or the STAI-T. The results provide evidence of the predictive validity of these social trait measures and some support for their specificity in the prediction of mild anxious response to a social challenge.	synthetic_intensity
