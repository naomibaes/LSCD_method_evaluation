The results showed both of these constituents to be important to the application of the model to the identification of mild alcohol abuse, particularly in terms of the relationship between flexible normative structure and the recognition of and evaluation of deviant drinking, a moderate influence of social context on norms and the finding of small differences in normative structure in socioeconomically different communities.	synthetic_low
Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a mild sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are common problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be a primary focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are infrequently prepared to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' adherence to genderrole stereotypes may contribute to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires some attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have affected children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will influence the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	synthetic_low

In contrast to the abundance of research on women victims, this article sheds light on the discourse of men who are self-identified as victims of their female partners' mild abuse.	synthetic_low
The self-reported Global Positive score for initial use of marijuana was modestly correlated with latency to next use of marijuana and with lifetime use of the drug, suggesting that the abuse potential of the drug is slightly related to the magnitude of the initial positive effect.	synthetic_low

An analysis of variance indicated that the spouse abusers had slightly higher mean abuse scores.	synthetic_low
Progress in mild substance abuse prevention science could be accelerated by more closely aligning studies, methodologies, and intervention program testing with the ontogenetic orientations of its underlying theories and etiology research.	synthetic_low

Sexual and physical abuse in childhood are somewhat associated with occasional suicidal ideas throughout the lifespan, so screening for suicidal ideas in younger and older people should be routine and vigorous, and cover experiences in early life: management may require appropriate psychological interventions.	synthetic_low
