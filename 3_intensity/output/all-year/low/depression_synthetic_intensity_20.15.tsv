For women, a negative parental bond with one's father significantly mediated the effect of having an authoritarian father on depression, which increased alcohol use problems.	natural
Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental_health literacy for all three groups, although there was less change for those most in need of intervention (i.e., those with major depression and suicidal ideation).	natural
Results of the study are explored in terms of the uniqueness of the constructs of fear, anxiety, and depression and their possible contribution to a more global construct, labeled 'negative affectivity' by Watson and Clark (1984).	natural

Previous research with the Attitudes Toward Self Scale (ATS) has found that the overgeneralization subscale is associated with depression but subscale measures of self-criticism and high self-standards are not related to depression.	natural
Late-onset depressive disorder is associated with white matter lesions and neuropsychological deficits that in some studies are linked to a poorer outcome for depression.	natural
