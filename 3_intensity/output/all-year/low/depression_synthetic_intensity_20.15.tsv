We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95 confidence intervals (95 CI) after adjusting for age, gender, education, depression, medical comorbidity, and body mass index.	natural
However, remission from depression may be maintained by a general suppression of limbic responsiveness to negative emotion.	natural
After an introduction to G proteins and second messenger pathways, this review focuses on the evidence implicating G proteins and two second messenger systems-the adenylate cyclase (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP) and phosphoinositide (protein kinase C, PKC) intracellular signaling cascades-in the pathophysiology and treatment of bipolar disorder and unipolar depression.	natural
This result raises the question about a simple and direct relation between the clinical status of depression and the power of <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor-mediated adenylate cyclase inhibition.	natural
Participants with both PTSD and depression were most likely to report HIV risk behavior (AOR = 2.75, 95 CI = [1.06, 7.11]).	natural

In the final model, high depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=9.33, confidence interval (CI) 3.99-21.77) and anxiety (adjusted OR=2.62, CI=1.24-5.53) were independently associated with moderate-severe suicidal ideation among risk factors whereas resilience was not.	natural

In the context of an ongoing WHO research programme in depression, a total of 573 patients consulting psychiatrists in Canada, Iran, Japan and Switzerland were assessed with the WHO/SADD schedule which proved to be a simple and reliable instrument for standardized recording of clinical data.	natural
Questionnaires were completed by 260 parents (146 mothers and 114 fathers) 11-198 months after HSCT: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire, the post-traumatic stress disorders checklist, civilian version, and the PTG inventory.	natural
It also did not appear that the mild depression in wall climbing seen in 6OHDA-treated animals was related to an observed slight neurotoxin-induced increase in shock sensitivity, given that amount of wall climbing was observed to be positively correlated with footshock intensity.	synthetic_intensity
RA patients showed high stability of SOC and measures of mild anxiety and depression over time.	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlation analysis, controlling for mild depression, showed a noticeable positive relationship between volition and adaptive occupational behavior.	synthetic_intensity

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between violent daydreaming, PB, TB, suicidal ideation, and mild depression in two samples (n=818). Design/methodology/approach Study 1 was comprised of general undergraduates, and Study 2 selected for undergraduates with a history of ideation.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for important time-varying covariates in a series of growth-curve models, caregivers who were faced with early behavior problems reported modest increases in burden and mild depression over the 3-year study period.	synthetic_intensity
The model also included a transdiagnostic measure of occasional negative thinking (RNT) and mild depression symptoms as outcome variables to determine whether relationships would extend beyond worry, which has traditionally been studied within the context of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_intensity
Our results suggest that patients with chronic depression share two distinct characteristics, namely slightly lower levels of social skills and moderately higher levels of distress in mildly tense social situations than patients with episodic depression.	synthetic_intensity
