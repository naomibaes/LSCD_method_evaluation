However, nearly all these relations disappeared when depression and anxiety were controlled statistically.	natural
Using analyses that controlled for several covariates, we found that physical activity significantly reduced risk for future increases in depressive symptoms and risk for onset of major-minor depression.	natural
In Phase 2, ADHD and Depression were found to be equally stigmatized.	natural
Among other things it was found that, independent of initial symptom levels, manifestations of continuing bonds differed in their associations with subsequent grief and depression.	natural
This association was observed independently of the main confounders such as sex, age, leisure time physical activity, depression and working conditions.	natural
The unemployed patients and those with lower social support had levels of stress, anxiety, and depression significantly higher than the others.	natural
Of the 50,147 patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, 4285 (8.54) had a diagnosis of depression.	natural
The strongest combined predictors of anxiety and depression were autism severity, verbal IQ, and age, explaining 25 and 23 of the variance.	natural
Depression was identified by the Elixhauser algorithm.	natural
The current study employed hidden Markov modeling to uncover empirically derived manic and depressive states from longitudinal data [i.e. Young Mania Rating Scale and MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale responses across five occasions from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study], estimate participants probabilities of transitioning between these states over time ( = 3918), and evaluate whether clinical variables (e.g. rapid cycling and substance dependence) predict participants state transitions ( = 3229).Analyses identified three empirically derived mood states (euthymic, depressed, and mixed).	natural
Cognitive-personality characteristics are an important predictor of depression in recently hospitalized patients with CAD.	natural
The maximum likelihood methods of LISREL VI were used to evaluate longitudinal evidence of causal relations based on the estimation of cross-lagged structural effects between depression and marital adjustment over the 15-month period.	natural
Motivational symptoms were associated with vascular or degenerative risk-indicators for depression; psychomotor change with both indicators; loss of energy with vascular, though also with the inflammatory indicator, and thinking/concentration disturbance with the degenerative indicator.	natural
Health-care providers should provide continuous mental_health care, conduct early screening of mental_health issues, and ensure that patients receive sufficient social support to reduce depression.	natural
Mediation analyses suggested that the observed differences in problem behaviors were at least partially accounted for by the differential experience of distress symptoms (primarily hostility and depression) and by social competence.	natural
Previous research on executive functioning within adolescent depression has provided somewhat inconsistent results, although the majority of research has identified at least partial evidence of executive functioning deficits in adolescent depression.	natural
Subjects reported their expected likelihood and magnitude of depression improvement before and after randomization using questions from the Credibility and Expectancy Scale (CES).	natural
Faster improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed for participants in the ICBT condition relative to the WLC, with large between-group effect sizes on the Generalized anxiety disorder-7 (d=.85) and the Patient health questionnaire (d=1.17) obtained at post-treatment.	natural
Various types of antidepressants can suppress serum and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in patients with major depression.	natural
A personal history of depression, baseline functional limitations and incident anxiety syndrome predicted chronic depression, whereas life-events occurring between assessments, and changes in physical, functional or cognitive status did not.	natural
In multiple logistic regression, after controlling for baseline mild depression scores (OR = 6.11, p < 0.001) and infrequent drug use (OR = 1.20, p = 0.192), baseline functional limitation (OR = 3.28, p < 0.001) and slight declining functioning (OR = 3.60, p < 0.001) were weakly positively, and gradual quitting of occasional drug use was negatively, associated with mild depressive symptoms at follow-up.	synthetic_low
IBS ligands can modulate behavioural and neuroendocrine responses in animal models of mild stress, low-level depression and anxiety, and a body of preliminary evidence exists for minor alterations in central IBS expression in psychiatric patients, which can be normalized partially or fully by treatment with mild antidepressants.	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	synthetic_low
The personalenacted identity gap significantly predicted a lower depression level and mediated the mild effects of acculturation and perceived discrimination, but personalrelational identity gap exhibited neither effects.	synthetic_low
A significant effect of the SERT-BDNF interaction on mild Depression and Psychasthenia scales was found in the group of parents, but not in the control group.	synthetic_low
After adjustment for the effects of other independent variables, the probability of having mild symptoms of depression was highest among persons who were young adults, unmarried, not employed outside the home, poorly paid, and not well educated.	synthetic_low
The patients with a negative family history of atopic disorders in particular showed schizothymia and had some difficulties in the expression of depressive feelings, although the investigation uncovered a moderate degree of depression in them.	synthetic_low
These contributions lead to a better understanding of the minor importance of depressive affect in milder phallic-oedipal conflicts, similarities and differences between such conflicts in boys and girls, depression as a mild symptom in adult life, and some surface aspects of narcissism.	synthetic_low
Maternal rejection was found more closely associated with mild depression in female than in male children, and the effect was essentially the same among black and white subjects.	synthetic_low
There was no noticeable difference in mild severity of depression or accurate body size estimation in these groups both before and with treatment.	synthetic_low
The key factors related to the discrepancy in PWD- and caregiver-rated QOL in dementia were PWD residence in a nursing home and lower dementia severity, as well as slightly higher caregiver depression, being an adult child caregiver, and somewhat lower caregiver-PWD mutuality.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether significant sleep difficulties are reported when employees report experienced burnout, while also controlling for age, gender, exercise, smoking habits, and treatment for mild depression.	synthetic_low
They have failed to produce convincing evidence of a cognitive vulnerability to mild depression in children under 8 years.	synthetic_low

This investigation was designed to examine the relationship between mild depression and personality disorders measured by the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (Millon, 1987) and moderate affectivity measured by the Positive Affectivity/Negative Affectivity Schedule (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988).	synthetic_low
Patients with prolonged courses had somewhat more severe depressive symptoms (mean difference 6.54; 95 CI 4.38-8.70), mild somatic symptoms (mean difference 3.31; 95 CI 1.61-5.02), and moderate mental dysfunction (mean difference -10.49; 95 CI -14.42 to -6.57) at baseline than those who remitted from baseline, independent of age, sex, level of education, presence of a chronic disease, and a lifetime history of depression.	synthetic_low
Mortality, particularly from suicide, was somewhat greater in the first 2 years after index admission, suggesting that the follow-up of patients hospitalised with mild depression must be particularly careful during the years immediately after admission.	synthetic_low
These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly noting some gender differences in controlling mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, having four or more PNS was found to be somewhat correlated with the mild severity of anxiety, slight depression, occasional somatic complaints, and minimal physical dysfunction.	synthetic_low
We compared three types of comorbidity, personality disorders (PDs), mild major depression (MDD) and anxiety (ANX) disorders, and PDs and MDD and ANX, with regard to their relevance for the relatively straightforward treatment outcome of somatoform disorders.	synthetic_low
