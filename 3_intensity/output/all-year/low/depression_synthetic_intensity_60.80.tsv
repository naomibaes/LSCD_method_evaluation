The present study sought to examine the indirect and moderating effects of worry between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
The higher agreement between the HADS depression subscale and the SCID diagnosis of Major Depression suggests that the HADS-D depression subscale is more useful than the BDI when screening for depression in patients with ESRD.	natural
The presence of a mild mood disorder was associated with some body dissatisfaction, a slightly lower Global Assessment of Functioning Scales (GAFS) score, occasional externalizing disorders of childhood, and, as expected, slightly higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, it shows that, among patients who do not present with classical affective syndromes, those who manifest a mild mood-digit-symbol relationship tend to receive basic treatments for moderate mood disturbances, have a limited family history of mild depression or mania, and improve modestly at discharge.	synthetic_intensity
An open coding analysis revealed the following themes associated with decreased participation: living in poverty, experiencing periods of mild depression and some isolation, fearing limited disclosure and mild stigma, tolerating minor signs and symptoms, encountering occasional barriers to work and having few supportive networks.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive theories of depression include the proposition that mild depression may be characterized by slight abnormalities in the prediction of future events.	synthetic_intensity

The present study examined the relation between direction of weight change in mild unipolar depression, BMI, and clinical variables such as low severity of depression, mild melancholia, low chronicity and rare recurrence in 89 patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, we examined the subtle relations among two kinds of actual-ideal self-discrepancies, expressed mild negative emotions, and slight self-dissatisfaction during midadolescence and assessed their gentle longitudinal contribution to young adult symptoms of mild hostility and depression, as well as self-worth.	synthetic_intensity
The 2 & 7 test was administered to 27 patients with mild major depression without other neurological or psychiatric illnesses.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression scores increased slightly during the first year of bereavement, but generally returned to manageable pre-widowhood levels thereafter.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings demonstrate that in our sample, there are slight differences in sociodemographic and clinical variables between active and dropout participants, and we provide basic adherence predictors in each intervention condition of this Internet-based program for mild depression (self-guided and support-guided).	synthetic_intensity
The sex ratios for mild depression were fairly consistent at different time periods retrospectively assessed.	synthetic_intensity

The Beck Depression Inventory and Children's Depression Inventory were used to assess mild depression in adults and children, and adult and child forms of Rippere's (1977) Antidepressive Activity Questionnaire were employed to assess the occasional frequency of engagement in and moderate helpfulness of antidepressive activities.	synthetic_intensity

Secondary measures included self- and parent reports of mild abdominal pain, moderate anxiety, mild depression, other manageable somatic symptoms, and limited functional impairment.	synthetic_intensity
Although late-onset elderly depressives did slightly less well than those with early-onset illness, the data do not support the notion of late-onset depression as a distinct pathological process.	synthetic_intensity
