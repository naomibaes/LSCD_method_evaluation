In addition, high dependency, self-criticism, neuroticism, and low self-perceived competence were associated with stress generation, independent of the effect of depressive symptoms and lifetime diagnosis of depression.	natural
Results substantiate the view that loneliness is not a unitary concept and suggest that the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the BELS emphasize emotional rather than social loneliness and that emotional loneliness is a greater component of depression than is social loneliness.	natural

Catastrophizing explained unique variance in anxiety and depression scores; higher levels of catastrophizing were associated with greater emotional distress.	natural
Clinical practice guidelines disagree on whether health care professionals should screen women for depression during pregnancy or postpartum.	natural
As expected, the FFI-BPD composite correlated most strongly with measures associated with high levels of Neuroticism, such as depression, anxiety, and emotion dysregulation, and the pattern of correlations generated using the FFI-BPD was highly similar to those generated using explicit measures of BPD and NEO-BPD.	natural
History of maternal depression was associated with high maternal EE, and the combination of maternal depression history and maternal EE was associated with children's own reports of higher depressive symptoms.	natural
The point prevalence of depression measured on one occasion between 2 and 5 months after childbirth was estimated to be 13.1 in 352 mothers living in urban Portugal; the criterion was a score of 13 or more on a translated version of the Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale (EPDS).	natural
Four questionnaires [SF-36 Health Survey, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)] were administered at each phase of a body weight loss program that consisted of a supervised diet and exercise clinical intervention to 11 obese men (mean BMI = 33.4 kg/m, mean age = 38 yr).	natural
The main hypothesis was that individuals whose depression had remitted would show a significant cognitive shift on information processing (e.g., deactivation of negative processing) but not on cognitive organizational tasks, Forty-five individuals with clinical depression completed 2 information processing and 2 cognitive organizational tasks at initial assessment.	natural
At the one-month follow-up, 83.0 (n=39/47) had improved > or = 50 and 63.8 (n=30/47) had normal depression scores, i.e. < or = 8.	natural

Developmental Perspectives on Depression.	natural
We expected that PT + CBT would outperform PT in improvements in problem-solving (Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised (SPSI-R)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), and that more anxious and/or depressed participants would benefit most from adding CBT to PT.	natural
Potential psychological moderators (mastery, depression, and role overload) of the relationship between caregiving status and allostatic load were also explored.	natural
Variables that had both interpretable loadings on the discriminant function and scores that were associated positively with membership in the Continuous Drinking group include the Psychotic Thinking, Passive-Aggressive, Avoidant, and Psychotic Depression scales of the MCMI and a questionnaire item, Drinking helps me to work better.	natural

The Working Memory Index or Processing Speed Index can also be specifically compared when an individual is believed to have a condition, such as a learning disability or traumatic brain injury, associated with the selective depression of these indexes.	natural
Prevalence of depression was high, 51/109 (47), with over half of the depressed women 34/51(67) reporting episode duration greater than two months.	natural
There is increasing evidence that selective analogues of nicotine, a principal active component of tobacco smoking, may ease depression and improve cognitive performance in animals and humans.	natural

All students completed a self-report questionnaire consisting of the Anxiety and mild Depression scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), the short version of the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), and the Internalized Shame Scale (ISS).	synthetic_low
The scale had high internal consistency ( = .88 to .94), showed criterion validity with mild hopelessness (r = .45 to .93) and incremental validity for caregiver burden when controlling for mild depression and positive symptoms of psychosis when controlling for slight hopelessness ( = .45 to .60).	synthetic_low
Measures were based on parallel items from the self-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), parent-rated Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and Children's Behaviour Questionnaire for parents and teachers as compared to DSM-III symptomatology for mild Overanxious Disorder (OAD), with a focus on subtle depression.	synthetic_low
The immediate causes of mild depression include interactions between everyday life events and their personal meaning influenced by mild personality factors and slight neuroticism.	synthetic_low
The authors wished to determine whether mild depression was present in an early adolescent nonpatient identified school population.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that mild anxiety, low-level depression and their subtle style of expression are key elements in the relationship that holds between relative weight and proneness to coronary heart disease.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was not related to a slight preference for social vs non-social reinforcers.	synthetic_low
Women exhibited more stress and mild depression than men prior to treatment did, yet the level of change (pre-post) in depression and stress after treatment did not differ by gender.	synthetic_low
The questionnaire was effective in identifying slightly positive and negative self-statements which were significantly related to scores on self-esteem and mild depression after 2 weeks.	synthetic_low

Using an independent cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) data set, the authors replicated T. Z. Tang and R. J. DeRubeis' (1999) discovery of sudden gains--sudden and large decreases in mild depression severity in a single between-session interval.	synthetic_low
We tested nonclinical subjects through the general Need for Closure Scale (NFCS), the Padua Inventory Revised (PI-R), the mild Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the basic State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form-Y; STAI-Y).	synthetic_low
The assessment measures were the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40), the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE), the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and Beck Mild Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as some clinical and psychopathological variables.	synthetic_low
In the first part of this preliminary study we used samples of currently mildly depressed (MDD), formerly slightly depressed (FD), socially anxious (SP), and healthy control participants to examine whether the brooding and reflective pondering components differentiate participants with an anxiety disorder from participants with mild depression.	synthetic_low
Dependent variables were the subtly insightful Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981), the gentle Depression scale of the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC; McArthur & Roberts, 1982), and a mild depression measure taken from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983).	synthetic_low
Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_low
Mild family dysfunction, somewhat ineffective social support, reduced self-esteem, minor disagreement with the decision to migrate, moderate education levels, moderate levels of acculturative stress, and manageable levels of anxiety were somewhat associated with moderate depression levels.	synthetic_low
