Like mental_illness, work renders the individual a stranger to himself and leads to multiple forms of enslavement, by the absence of power on his conduct, by the blind obedience to social norms, and by the reification of the alienated product of labour of its human essence leading to the loss of meaning (Rosner, 1967).	natural
