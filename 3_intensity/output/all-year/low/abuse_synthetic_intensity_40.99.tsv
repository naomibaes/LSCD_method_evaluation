Depression was found to be a strong predictor of suicidality; alcohol abuse was not a predictor.	natural
This is counter to the intuition that abuse or neglect reduces culpability, and therefore mitigates the severity of punishment.	natural
Multivariate logistic regression showed Ecstasy+MA users differing from MA users who have not used Ecstasy primarily in terms of sociodemographics (higher income, fewer children), substance abuse behaviors and motivators (lifetime history of more types of drugs, more likely to report use of Ecstasy to enhance sex, more drug-related problems), lifestyle (more likely to have had same-sex sex partners), and treatment characteristics (younger at admission, less likely to complete treatment).	natural

For both men and women, childhood physical abuse and childhood sexual abuse were independently associated with psychiatric morbidity, and an increasing number of types of childhood trauma experienced was associated with an increase in the number of current Axis I diagnoses.	natural
Longitudinal regression showed that women reporting abuse randomized into GRT had significantly reduced odds of depression (OR = .29, p < .05, 95 CI = .10 - .86) and lowered rates of number of substances used (IRR = .52, p < .05, 95 CI = 0.28-0.98), in comparison to those who reported abuse and were randomized to the non-GRT group.	natural
Considerable research suggests that social influences-based drug abuse prevention programming has produced the most consistently successful preventive effects.	natural
Design/methodology/approachRelying on data from 4,162 male and female college students, the current study provides a multivariate analysis of the linkage between sexual abuse victimization and intimate partner victimization, perpetration, and being an IPV victim-offender.	natural

Results from reliability and validity analyses suggest that a brief version of this instrument that assesses parental responsiveness, child maltreatment, and parental substance abuse would provide a useful screening instrument for obtaining family history information.	natural
In general, there was high awareness of wife abuse and the different types of abuse (mainly physical and psychological), a general tendency to oppose wife abuse, a tendency to blame the victim for abuse, and a lesser tendency to blame the abuse on the husband, marital problems, as well as familial and societal conditions.	natural
Potential long-term childhood sexual abuserelated outcomes, including dissociation, recreational and sex-related drug use, depression, impaired interpersonal communication, and adult re-victimisation were treated as variables mediating the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual-risk behaviour.	natural
This study examined child maltreatment as a function of cumulative family risk in a sample of at-risk families ( =837) who were referred to an intensive family preservation program because of child behavior problems or suspected child abuse and neglect.	natural
For survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), verbal disclosure is often complex and painful.	natural
This is particularly true in regard to older adults where natural physical changes and increased age related health risks can only be exacerbated by the misuse and abuse of substances.	natural
Our findings are consistent with previous research showing that child abuse and other early life stressors adversely affect adult somatic health, but provide evidence that the pathogenic effects occur also with chronic minor stress.	natural
The Fuster case involved overwhelming evidence of abuse, medical and testimonial, that continues to be distored or overlooked by critics.	natural
Medical staff should also know that early multidisciplinary interventions in addition to cancer treatments are needed for victims of physical abuse among cancer patients and that these interventions are necessary to improve compliance with treatment and proper decision making.	natural

Future research should be extended to include the impact of different types of traumatic events such as natural disasters, confinement in refugee camps, massive internal displacement, minor sexual abuse and mass killing on African children/adolescents to expand the knowledge base in this area.	synthetic_intensity
Sleep disturbances were related to revictimization rates independent of minor sexual abuse, moderate depression, and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings show that physical neglect, in comparison with the other types of mild abuse, is the most predictable and distinguishable.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that fathers had a slightly lower current potential risk of becoming physical abuse perpetrators with their children than mothers, although they did not differ in their mild physical victimization history.	synthetic_intensity
The literature reveals some emphasis on the causes and consequences of minor child abuse than on its prevention.	synthetic_intensity
When measured prospectively, low self-esteem appears to be a risk factor for child neglect, but is not a strong predictor for mild physical abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Further, mild abuse stigmatization moderated associations between children's PTSD symptoms and perceived obstacles to treatment with medium effect sizes (M =0.287).	synthetic_intensity
Consequently they have learned to exercise greater control over their behaviour and therefore to separate emotion from action, and as a result, they are less likely to mildly abuse their child either physically or emotionally.	synthetic_intensity
