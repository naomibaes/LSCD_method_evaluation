According to cognitive theorists, mild intrusive trauma memories have their origin in how information during the event is processed.	synthetic_low
Eighteen participants selected three images each, the images being those that were the least distressing from participants' trauma memories and least likely to intrude involuntarily.	synthetic_low
Previous research with mild trauma victims has demonstrated mild dissociative symptoms to be associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and shorter symptom duration, but our follow-up results suggest that ASD, which is characterized by mild dissociative symptomatology, is not indicative of poorer outcome in MVA victims.	synthetic_low
Post-9/11, many faith-based responders expressed the concern that they were neither prepared nor trained to recognize the mild mental_health needs of long-term trauma survivors.	synthetic_low

Sharing the mild meaning of the trauma also highlighted vital aspects in the functioning of the mind of the group, leading to a new and more gentle way of facing illness and death.	synthetic_low
Touch, proximity, and gentle mindbody interaction with animals have been found to contribute to stress reduction and mild trauma recovery.	synthetic_low
Here we present a theory of mild human trauma and chronic stress, based on the practice of Somatic Experiencing() (SE), a form of trauma therapy that gently emphasizes guiding the client's attention to interoceptive, kinesthetic, and proprioceptive experience.	synthetic_low
This article summarizes gender-related findings from CTN clinical trials and related studies, focusing on mild trauma histories, pregnancy, co-occurring eating and other minor psychiatric disorders, and low-risk HIV behaviors.	synthetic_low

Self-concealment significantly correlated with self-report measures of mild anxiety, slight depression, and minor bodily symptoms and accounted for a significant incremental percentage of the variance in physical and psychological symptoms even after controlling for occurrence of mild trauma, minimal trauma distress, disclosure of the trauma, social support, social network, and self-disclosure.	synthetic_low
