This growth in the clinical applications of imagery has led to the creation of the current special issue of collected papers on imagery rescripting, which is designed to: (a) present research and clinical applications of imagery rescripting techniques to problematic mental imagery, (b) consider problematic imagery across a wide range of psychological disorders that might be a target for imagery rescripting (including novel areas such as mental contamination, bulimia and suicidality), (c) explore a variety of imagery rescripting techniques in the treatment of PTSD, as well as mild depression, social phobia, and snake phobia, and (d) stimulate interest for future treatment innovation in the use of imagery rescripting techniques to address other clinical disorders.	synthetic_intensity

We evaluated this notion by relating pre-treatment measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence to self-reported symptom reduction in a naturalistic study (n = 106) of cognitive therapy for outpatients with principal diagnoses of mild major depression, low-level dysthymia, or manageable generalized anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Depression is a common psychological condition that involves minor changes in behavior, neuroendocrine function, and physiological responses.	synthetic_intensity

Moderate narcissists had significantly lower mean scores on indices of anxiety, relationship problems, mild depression, esteem- and family problems and pathology of separation-individuation.	synthetic_intensity
College students carry a relatively higher burden of mild depression when compared to the general population.	synthetic_intensity
Although the ADHD boys scored slightly higher on the Children's Depression Inventory, this minor difference was no longer significant when items dealing with simple behavior, school, and light social problems were excluded.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals with GAD and co-occurring mild MDD/DD exhibited somewhat lower mindfulness than those without a depressive disorder diagnosis and slightly lower scores on the Awareness sub-scale compared to individuals with primary GAD and no comorbid depression.	synthetic_intensity
Oil spill exposures are associated with somewhat increased levels of mild depression, which is often measured using simple continuous scores or basic dichotomous cut points on general screening tools in population-based studies.	synthetic_intensity
African Americans and whites participated equally in the assessment process, and both groups presented with similar psychiatric treatment histories, mild severity of depression, moderate psychosocial functioning, and a manageable severity of medical illness.	synthetic_intensity

Interestingly, the removal of the somatic items did not enhance the effectiveness of the CES-D. The mild discriminatory ability of somatic items with the overall assessment of depression is discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Participants (49 girls; M age = 12.44 years) with clinical diagnoses of mild depression (n = 24), occasional subsyndromal symptoms of depression (n = 29), and no symptoms of significant psychopathology (n = 36) completed semi-structured interviews of life stress.	synthetic_intensity
These obstacles are construed as manageable catch-22s, the gist of which is that all the things patients may do to recover from mild depression are made somewhat difficult by the symptoms of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The HADS Anxiety and Depression scales, on the other hand, showed a slight lack of discriminatory ability suggesting that they both measure mild depression and/or general distress symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
A group of slightly subclinically depressed students SS (N = 36) was compared with a group of mildly depressed patients MP (N = 48) and a group of moderately severely depressed patients SP (N = 33) on 21 raw symptom severity scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	synthetic_intensity
