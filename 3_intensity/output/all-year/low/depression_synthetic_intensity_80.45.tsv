We applied measures of implicit (name-letter test) and explicit (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) self-esteem in patients with a manageable early onset depression (N = 17), a mild late onset (N = 13), and a typically episodic depression (N = 29).	synthetic_low

The clinical need to address mild stress and low-level depression in Latino dementia caregivers (CGs) combined with limited health literacy and somewhat less accurate knowledge of dementia motivated the development of a pictorial tool [called a fotonovela (FN)] to teach (a) coping mechanisms for caregiver (CG) stress; (b) simple self-assessment of mild depression; and (c) encourage improved utilization of available resources.	synthetic_low
