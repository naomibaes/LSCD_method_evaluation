Both therapies had small effect size changes in mild anxiety, irritation, sadness, and posttraumatic cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
Information-processing models of anxiety posit that mild anxiety pathology is associated with subtle processing biases that slightly consume cognitive resources and may minimally detract from one's ability to process environmental stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
The present study cautiously extends this line of work by comparing levels of mild fear and reduced anxiety during anticipation of predictable and unpredictable aversive stimuli across high- and low-SS groups.	synthetic_intensity
The survey data demonstrated that the positive SCS subscales were positively correlated with adaptive coping (rs between .22 and .50) and slightly negatively correlated with mild symptoms of anxiety and depression (rs between .19 and .53), while the negative subscales were modestly positively correlated with symptoms (rs between .49 and .61) and somewhat maladaptive coping strategies such as passive reacting (rs between .53 and .56).	synthetic_intensity

Methodological problems with this research include failure to control for drawing quality and intelligence, slight confounding of anxiety measurement with a defensive response style, and inadequate validation of the scoring systems.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that basic safety information gently facilitates the reduction of anxiety but only in the absence of obvious safety cues.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety disorders have been linked to slightly low levels of salivary OT in youth.	synthetic_intensity

Significant negative correlations of moderate magnitude between the pain threshold and scores on Maudsley Neuroticism and the mild Manifest Anxiety Scale were found.	synthetic_intensity
Adrenaline-induced changes from resting levels in mild state anxiety and somatic anxiety were significantly more pronounced in moderately high than in low neurosomatic subjects and all anxiety ratings were generally slightly negatively related to aerobic fitness.	synthetic_intensity

Follow-up analysis showed that greater respiratory symptoms were a significant predictor of lapse risk among those with moderate ( =0.116, =1.12, =0.025), but not those with low ( =0.048, =0.95, =0.322), levels of anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_intensity

Significant differences in baseline-corrected heart rate and self-reported anxiety as well as slightly rated facial anxiety all indicated that repressors exhibited a slight discrepancy between low self-reported anxiety and moderately high heart rate and facial anxiety; low-anxious subjects reported a mild level of anxiety, although they showed low heart rate and facial anxiety; high-anxious subjects had consistently moderate values on all three variables; and the defensive high-anxious group showed an intermediate level of anxious responding.	synthetic_intensity
