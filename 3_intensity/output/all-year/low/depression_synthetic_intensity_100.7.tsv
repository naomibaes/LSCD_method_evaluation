Unexpectedly, mild dysthymia at intake was associated with somewhat reduced relationship satisfaction after 12 weeks, when initial relationship satisfaction was controlled, suggesting that chronic, low-level depression may have a moderate association with interpersonal challenges than other forms of depression, such as major depressive episodes.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred and thirty-seven very low birthweight (VLBW) children were compared at 12 years with a sample of matched peers on a number of psychiatric symptoms including mild Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, mild depression, general anxiety, and minor antisocial behaviour using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment parent interview and various parent and child questionnaires.	synthetic_intensity
Youth with mild depression should be lightly monitored for the development of moderate restrictive eating patterns.	synthetic_intensity
The frequent presence of a mild depression in these patients strongly indicates that a clarification of the varied opinions which continue to exist with regard to a possible linkage between depressive disorders and anxiety disorders would need further research; in such studies it would seem preferable not to employ a hierarchic classification procedure, in view of the fact that all cross-sectional psychopathological symptoms should be considered.	synthetic_intensity

Results of this study demonstrate that naloxone at doses of 1.5 and 3.0 nmol relative to vehicle caused a slight depression of ventilation due to a minor decrease of both frequency of breathing and tidal volume in male rats and a slightly decreased response to a mild hypercapnic challenge in female rats.	synthetic_intensity
The majority also completed a self-report (SDS) low severity of depression measure, and provided current and historical data on mild depression, anxiety, global functioning and stressor severity.	synthetic_intensity
