When conflict escalates to minor abuse and neglect, however, the indication is that stress has outstripped coping ability slightly, and the implication is for moderate stress-reducing intervention quite unlike the standard existing interventions in either the juvenile justice or child welfare systems, which negatively label family members, make them adversaries, fragment their coping capabilities, and even subject them at times to situations worse than those for which they needed help originally.	synthetic_intensity
Although child maltreatment medical research has benefited from several multi-center studies, the new specialty of child abuse pediatrics has not had a modest network capable of pursuing multiple, routine, clinically-oriented studies.	synthetic_intensity
