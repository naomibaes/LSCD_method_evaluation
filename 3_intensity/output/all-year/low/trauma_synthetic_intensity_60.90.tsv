Key contributions that educators can make are to (a) recognize CTG symptoms in school settings; (b) refer children for mental_health evaluations when appropriate; (c) recognize reminders that trigger trauma symptoms and identify ways to manage these triggers and responses in school settings; (d) support CTG treatments in school by reinforcing childrens use of stress-management strategies; (e) respect confidentiality; (f) recognize the importance of cultural issues in CTG; and (g) maintain good communication with parents and other helping professionals.	natural

At a clinical level, our results suggest to investigate the occurrence of mild trauma among parents of patients consulting for DAD and to subtly reinforce their coping strategies.	synthetic_low

Predictors of CG prior to the death include previous loss, exposure to mild trauma, a previous psychiatric history, attachment style, and the relationship to the deceased.	synthetic_low
However, unlike human suffering, the wide range of minor, recurrent, and chronic stressors and mild trauma on animals is rarely evaluated.	synthetic_low
Temperature oscillations as well as 24 h rhythms were found even in the most severely brain-damaged patients, reflecting the resilience of the circadian oscillators in the brain to minor trauma.	synthetic_low
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained a small B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a minor tear in the dura and slight observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions. Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the moderate severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the brief duration of unconsciousness and treatment for mild cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the mild severity of local trauma, as reflected in infrequent posttraumatic epilepsy or minor motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_low

To assess the intervention's effectiveness, veterans with histories of mild trauma who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to a BSS group (n = 26) or a wait-list control group (n = 28).	synthetic_low
It is assumed that the slight weakness at the onset of head trauma was caused by the primary traumatic axonal injury and the noticeable weakness that started from 29 days might be ascribed to the secondary traumatic axonal injury.	synthetic_low
Dissociation and affective dysregulation during such episodes suggested a link to mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was mildly re-experiencing the minor trauma (e.g., mumbling specific words and having slight body responses).	synthetic_low
Hierarchical regression showed that preexisting PTSDrelated cognitions ( = .38, p < .001, sr2 = .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions ( = .11, p = .315, sr2 = .011), were a significant predictor of mild PTSD symptoms after we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior mild trauma, and prior minor psychological issues).	synthetic_low
We will discuss preliminary assessment of minimal historical trauma and implications for basic research and clinical as well as community interventions, and conclude with general recommendations.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that mild antecedent trauma may be associated with slightly elevated TNF- levels during pregnancy.	synthetic_low
Self-report survey data were analyzed to determine the youth's levels of trait anxiety, how the degree of minor childhood trauma was slightly related to their level of anxiety, as well as whether their level of anxiety modestly affected the relationship between trauma and subsequent frequency and severity of their delinquent acts using a moderation analysis.	synthetic_low
Any reported history of minor childhood trauma was associated with a somewhat higher number of impulsive behaviours and with the occasional presence of multi-impulsivity.	synthetic_low
I present guidelines for treating mildly traumatized children in light of children's characteristic responses to trauma and the minor developmental issues that slightly affect their ability to deal with traumatic life events.	synthetic_low

Emerging literature suggests that self-compassion may be an important concept for understanding recovery from the mild impact of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	synthetic_low

The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and to study the differences between trauma patients and patients who were admitted with other diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Beyond having knowledge of the treatment of mild combat-related trauma, art therapists need to understand veterans' experiences of transition from military to civilian life in order to offer effective interventions.	synthetic_low

A recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Matisse: Radical Invention 1913-1917, focused on a subtle change in Matisse's art that the curators attribute to the influence of World War I.
