Research evaluating mental state identification in individuals with borderline pathology has yielded inconsistent results; contradictory findings were hypothesized to be driven by moderating effects of childhood trauma.	natural
Dissociation was temporally related to trauma and trauma treatment, and was predictive of trauma history when fantasy proneness was controlled.	natural
These include rising expectations felt as coming both from within and without; disappointment that life can never make up for what has happened; loss of a justification for receiving care; fear that getting well invalidates the original trauma.	natural
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is commonly observed among mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity

In this study, the symptoms reported by children after mild (n = 38) and moderate-severe (n = 27) head trauma were compared to those reported after minor orthopedic injury (n = 47) and to adults matched for injury severity and chronicity by using a structured interview based on diagnostic criteria for mild postconcussion syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
Dissociation and affective dysregulation during such episodes suggested a link to mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity

It is unclear why only some moments of mild trauma become somewhat intrusive, and how these memories occasionally return to mind.	synthetic_intensity
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the mildly painful emotions associated with trauma.	synthetic_intensity
