The identified increased risk of suicidal ideation among homosexual or bisexual young people is associated with depression and may lead to suicidal behaviour, independent of sexual orientation, especially in the presence of a role model of suicidal behaviour, and among those with unsatisfying friendships.	natural
Those who scored at or above cutoff on one or more of these measures were administered a diagnostic interview for depression and anxiety at approximately three months postpartum (n=115).	natural
However, when considering only those RCTs with active control groups, significant benefits of an MBI were restricted to the outcomes of Mindfulness (d = .42), Depression (d = .47) and Anxiety/Stress (d = .18) only.	natural

Clients significantly improved over the 2-week period on depression and anxiety symptoms as well as a range of psychological inflexibility measures.	natural
Depression was hypothesized to be rated as more negative, temporary, controllable, and psychologically-caused than physical illness on both implicit and explicit measures.	natural
Given previous research on depression, history of physical abuse, family order, attachment, and parenting, we hypothesized that the physical abuse-depression relationship would be moderated by (a) family order and (b) attachment, and that (c) attachment and family order would interact significantly in predicting depression.	natural
In both studies, anxiety symptoms positively correlated with overall psychopathology, hallucinations and depression.	natural
Perinatal depression affects 1020 of women and has wideranging consequences for the mothers and their families.	natural
Women who were older, less depressed, and more anxious at baseline showed better program retention, and lower baseline depression was associated with better exercise adherence.	natural
The purpose of this study was to pilot a telephonically delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat moderate to severe depression in patients from rural primary care settings where specialized mental_health care is scarce.	natural
The relationship between depression and life events was found to depend upon the way events were interpreted.	natural
Covariates included self-reported binge drinking (past 2 weeks), stress (last 12 months), smoking (past 30 days), depression (past 12 months), fraternity/sorority membership, college athletics participations, and race.	natural
Remission was defined as an average Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17-item score of 7 or below over 3 weeks.	natural
Individuals (n = 157) with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 83), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 29) and their combination (n = 45) who attended an intensive partial hospital treatment program, completed daily self-report measures of depression and generalized anxiety.	natural
Recently, as researchers have begun to focus attention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), depression has emerged as its strongest correlate.	natural
This study sought to estimate the prevalence of nonremission in a large sample of patient participating in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial and to identify correlates of nonremission and time to remission among remitters.	natural
Self-reported decline in functional activities may be a marker for persistent cognitive impairment, which suggests that assessments of both neuropsychological and functional status are important prognostic factors in the evaluation of geriatric depression.	natural
Preliminary findings suggest that women who were in long-term marriages and reported no previous history of depression or cancer benefited most from the intervention.	natural
In addition, AD is more prevalent in women, who also show increased incidence of depression.	natural
Accurate early diagnosis is sometimes difficult, however, particularly because patients often present in the depressive phase, which can easily be mistaken for unipolar depression.	natural
History of mood disorders and HTR1A G allele variation, the C-1019G polymorphism of the transcriptional control region of the 5-HT1A receptor, independently predicted the incidence of IFN-induced depression in HCV patients, whether separately or jointly considered and although not reciprocally associated.	natural
Further, this association was independent of the previously demonstrated correlation between cognitive distortion and depression in RA patients.	natural
Our results show that an impaired ability to differentiate between markers of affiliation and politeness is specific to first-episode depression, even after the depression has remitted.	natural
Neither the women nor men differed significantly in anxiety, depression, sense of mastery, or self-esteem after the baby's birth.	natural
Behavioral profiles of depression may help clinicians to detect depression in individuals with ID.	natural
EC50 values were obtained for 14 medication-free patients (5 acutely depressive, and 9 symptom free remitted patients with a history of manic-depression or recurrent major depression), 9 lithium-treated, euthymic manic-depressive patients and 10 drug-free healthy controls.	natural
This is a review of studies conducted in different settings (laboratory, daily life), populations (healthy, major depression, generalized anxiety), location (United States, Europe), and age groups (children, adults) that consistently replicated the association between autonomic, subjective, and behavioral measures of cognitive inflexibility during perseverative cognition.	natural
Late-life depression mediated the relationship between Eriksonian development and both global cognition and executive functioning.	natural
With a survey of 876 LGB self-identified youth, levels of coming-out stress, sexual orientation victimization, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, depression, and suicidal ideation were examined.	natural
Women with PTSD and depression exhibited greater production of IL-6 and higher levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) than those with PTSD, but without depression.	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
We assessed mortality rates over 25 years in 212 patients admitted for depression or depressive symptoms.	natural
Although there is a mild growing interest in the role of minor attentional biases in depression, there are no studies assessing subtle changes in these biases after basic psychotherapeutic interventions.	synthetic_low
Single item visual analogue scales (VASs) for slight irritability, mild tension, low-level depression and mood swings were used in combination with the Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Observer (PMTS-O) and Self-Rating (PMTS-SR) scales to measure the modest severity of premenstrual mood symptoms at baseline and during treatment.	synthetic_low
Significant correlations were also found between limited hours per week spent accessing indecent images of children and PAI scales assessing mild Schizophrenia, slight Borderline Features, low-level Depression, and Warmth.	synthetic_low
Mild concern over slightly declining physical well-being was not part of the peripheral core of mild depression for the older group in this psychiatric population.	synthetic_low
It is generally agreed that females tend to assent more readily to mild negative mood states such as slight Anxiety or low-level Depression, than do males.	synthetic_low
The BRT subjects showed significant reductions in EMG forehead muscle tension, slightly elevated T scores on the MMPI scale 2 (depression), and a decreased need for antidepressant medication following treatment compared to TC subjects.	synthetic_low
To counteract this challenge, we trained individuals with mild depression, either in episode or remission, to construct an accessible mental repository for a preselected set of positive, self-affirming memories using a basic mnemonic techniqueâ€”the method-of-loci (MoL).	synthetic_low
Children's Depression Inventory score and general diagnosis were each used to distinguish mildly depressed and nondepressed children.	synthetic_low
When sustained contractions were performed and reflexes were elicited after movement eyelid onset, the patterns of early R1 enhancement and mild R2 depression occurred, both for about 500 ms, and gave way to continued R1 and also gentle R2 enhancement as long as eyelid movement continued.	synthetic_low
The results from this study did not support the hypotheses that for patients with mild major depression, by comparison with antidepressant medication: problem-solving treatment would result in better problem resolution; or that problem-solving treatment would modestly increase the patients' sense of mastery and self-control.	synthetic_low
