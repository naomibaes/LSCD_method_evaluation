Despite success in other depressed populations, self-management therapy produced no clinically significant effect in depression with chronic PTSD.	natural
Results indicate that the SCIM is correlated with emotion dysregulation, Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and other measures of psychopathology.	natural
Although the clinical assessment of HCV typically emphasizes both affective (e.g., depression) and physical factors, findings from the present study suggest that cognitive impairment is an important contributor to everyday functioning in persons living with HCV infection and therefore warrants consideration in clinical and research evaluations.	natural

Psychosis proneness is associated with a greater risk for depression, suggesting that a continuum of vulnerability may exist between affective disorder and nonaffective psychosis.	natural
However, more research is needed to assess the overall efficacy and minor limitations of the actual treatment regimen to advance our basic knowledge concerning the treatment of coexisting mild panic and depression.	synthetic_low
Students with slightly negative cognitive styles, previously shown to be at moderate cognitive risk for mild depression, were predicted to have a somewhat greater history of negative childhood life events and mildly critical negative parental inferential feedback than were students at low cognitive risk for low-level depression.	synthetic_low
They integrate these themes and extrapolate the ideas with available data to develop a preliminary framework for evaluating competing explanatory models and to guide research on life stress and the occasional recurrence of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Lower hope and a slightly higher degree of defense style immaturity were each associated with mild dysphoria, minimal depression proneness, and slight maladjustment.	synthetic_low
Knowledge of and attitudes to mild depression and its straightforward treatment may have some impact on the adherence to antidepressants.	synthetic_low
Gradual improvement over time in response to treatment correlated with slight improvement both on mild measures of hypochondriasis and on minimal measures of somatization, depression, anxiety, and functional status.	synthetic_low
PTSD and mild depression symptoms were briefly assessed in the mother and child.	synthetic_low
Depressive patients were classified into four different groups by SCAN 2.1 (schedules for clinical assessment in Neuropsychiatry): moderate major depression disorder (n: 34), mild dysthymia disorder (n: 29), light subsyndromal depression (n: 28), and depression due to mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (n: 18).	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	synthetic_low
The results indicate that, for caregivers, HEP was somewhat more effective than UC in reducing mild depression, maintaining social integration, slightly increasing effectiveness in solving pressing problems, somewhat increasing knowledge of community services and how to access them, subtly changing caregivers' feelings of competence, and gently adjusting the way they respond to the care giving situation.	synthetic_low
Used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960) to assess the mild levels of depression presented by 76 male and 29 female alcoholics.	synthetic_low
Groups were not different in cognitive performance, after controlling for slight fatigue, pain, and mild depression; depression was minimally related to memory performance and moderate fatigue was related to psychomotor speed.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was assigned by coroners somewhat more often than by the psychologists.	synthetic_low
A key finding was that grandmothers who did not report depression had positive and helpful relationships with the parents of the grandchildren, whereas the grandmothers with occasional depression had some minor conflictive involvement with the parents.	synthetic_low
Chronic social difficulties were expected to be somewhat predictive of mild depressive symptoms in offspring of slightly depressed women, while recent minor life events were expected to predict low-level depression in offspring of never-depressed women.	synthetic_low
AD use among nMDS subjects without previous mild depression is probably not primarily for physical illnesses.	synthetic_low
These group differences remained noticeable when carefully controlling for current depression scores, suggesting that irrespective of minor differences in depressive symptomatology, subtle rumination and slight inhibitory dysfunctions are closely related.	synthetic_low
Studies of cognitive vulnerability to mild depression in young children have, in the main, relied on straightforward self-report questionnaires (e.g. of self-esteem, attributional style).	synthetic_low
Contrary to previous findings, mild depression proved to be a slightly better predictor of suicidal ideation than occasional hopelessness.	synthetic_low
