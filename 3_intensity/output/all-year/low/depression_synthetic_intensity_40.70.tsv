We hypothesized that depression evolved as a response to important, complex problems that could only be solved, if they could be solved at all, with an attentional state that was highly focused for sustained periods.	natural
We performed a systematic literature search of studies published in English (1995 Jan to 2016 Jan) in PubMed, and Cochrane Library combining the medical terms 'physical activity' or 'sedentary' or 'physical exercise' with 'bipolar disorder' or 'mania' or 'bipolar depression'.	natural
In 14,380 persons with HIV (PWH), we used logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to evaluate how symptoms of depression interact with alcohol, cocaine, opioid, and methamphetamine use to affect subsequent retention in care, maintaining an active prescription for ART, and consistent virologic suppression.	natural
It is uncertain whether this phenomenon, sometimes called emotional blunting, represents residual symptoms of depression or side-effects of antidepressant treatment.	natural

This study examined cortisol and affective reactivity to a psychosocial stress task in 102 young adults who varied in risk for depression (56 remitted depressed, 46 never depressed).	natural
Disengagement from incentives in depression should also be examined explicitly from the affective sphere.	natural
The challenge is to develop a coherent neurocognitive theory of depression that can explain or give context to the observed patterns of symptoms and their response to treatment.	natural
Plasma and erythrocyte phosphate levels, concentrations of red cell organic phosphate ester fractions (acid labile and acid resistant phosphate pools) and intracellular ATP content were determined in 16 patients with bipolar depression, in 14 subjects with unipolar depression as a group of primary affective disorders, in 15 patients suffering from neurotic depression and in 45 healthy controls.	natural
Dispositional forgiveness of others improves interpersonal adjustment and psychological well-being and may protect against negative interpersonal experiences and perceptions relating to depression.	natural
However, self-reported depressive problems were also associated with high HR in standing posture and with low HRV LF in supine posture in girls, suggesting high arousal in depression.	natural
This study sought to determine to what extent depression in young adolescents could be predicted by a variety of demographic and personality measures.	natural
But, Delhi psychiatrists were less likely to combine medication treatment with psychotherapy (P<0.05), and more likely to advise families to secretly administer medications in treatment refusal, such as in acute schizophrenia (P<0.001) or major depression (P<0.01).	natural
MCS/MH associations over 2 years with disease activity (disease activity score on a 28-joint count), disability (health assessment questionnaire), pain visual analog scale scores, and a minor weighted genetic risk score for mild depression were tested using linear mixed-effects and regression models.	synthetic_intensity
Depression is generally regarded as a moderately serious, somewhat challenging illness.	synthetic_intensity
It is well known that mild depression can be a consequence of medical illness and disability, but a growing literature suggests also that depression can cause biological changes linked to morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
Outpatients (N = 76) who met DSM-III-R criteria for mild major depression with a minimum Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) severity score of 18 were randomized to 12 weeks of flexible dose treatment with sertraline (50-150 mg) or nortriptyline (25-100 mg).	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with slight decreases in SMEX but not UCO.	synthetic_intensity

Findings provide slight incremental validity for certain Rorschach indexes to inform prognosis regarding mild depression symptoms and perhaps their treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Mild affective symptomatology, such as low-level depression, slight demoralization, mild phobia and anxiety, and some somatization, were somewhat prevalent in BPPV patients, and female gender may be a minor predisposing factor.	synthetic_intensity
When the intervening influences of age and sex are taken into account, unipolar depression does not appear to be associated with an excessive rate of antithyroid antibodies; however thyroid autoimmunity may be weakly associated with mild subtypes of bipolar disorder in which depressive symptoms are slightly prominent.	synthetic_intensity
Energized by renewed research and clinical activities, the current status of assessments of mild child and adolescent depression merits review.	synthetic_intensity
It is suggested that the various risk factors for mild depression, including marriage for women, may be better understood in the context of clinical theories of depression, especially the learned helplessness model.	synthetic_intensity
We administered a self-report questionnaire to 1,749 adult Australians between 17 and 40 years old to examine the predictive values of self-esteem, mild depression, locus of control, trait anger, religiosity, psychological reactance, and age in relation to life satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
To date, two randomized, double-blind trials of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) have shown that antidepressant drugs are effective in treating mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_intensity
We suggest potential ways in which variables such as gender, friend and family member suicidal behavior, and engagement in traditional activities may subtly affect suicidal ideation through their modest effects on mild depression and substance use.	synthetic_intensity
These new findings add to an expanding body of epidemiological evidence on age and mild depression, and provoke new questions about the potentially etiological relationships involving social structural characteristics of local neighborhoods in combination with individual-level risk factors that have received primary attention in recent psychiatric epidemiology.	synthetic_intensity
More than one-third of participants scored in the slightly elevated ranges on the Center for Epidemiological StudiesDepression Scale and Hopkins Symptom Checklist, indicating that some distress and mild symptoms of depression were a concern for a sizable minority of participants.	synthetic_intensity
