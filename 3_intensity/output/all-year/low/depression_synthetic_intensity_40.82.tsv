Almost one third of the patients received the diagnosis of depression not otherwise specified (NOS).	natural
Mild dementia, independence in activities of daily living, fair independence in functions of instrumental activities of daily living, and lack of depression were clear signs for a good prognosis.	natural
A consistent pattern of change favoring CBT was evident in measures of anxiety, depression, and cognition.	natural
This article examines the prevalence, developmental characteristics, associations with psychopathology, and longitudinal stability of irritable mood in childhood and adolescent depression.	natural

Data sources were: study-specific questions about demographic characteristics, and health behaviours, the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the World Health Organisation Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) translated into Mandarin and administered as structured individual interviews, and a screen battery of four standard neuropsychological tests.	natural
Taking only those grids with conflict, the average number of IDs per person was higher in the depression group.	natural
Additional MANCOVAs with depression as a covariate revealed that CS and older control subjects showed impaired performance on general cognitive function compared to age-matched controls.	natural
An overall grief score based on the interview answers was significantly correlated with three different measures of job attachment, and also with questionnaire measures of depression and anxiety.	natural
Maladaptive cognitive responses to stressful life events represent well-replicated risk factors for depression.	natural
The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), CAM, Delirium Index (DI), Hierarchic Dementia Scale, Barthel Index, and Cornell Scale for Depression were completed at baseline.	natural
Sixty-seven suffered from unipolar depression and 36 had bipolar or schizo-affective disorders In order to qualify for entry to the cohort the unipolar patients had to have had at least three episodes of depression and those with bipolar disorders had to have had at least three episodes - with at least one manic episode and one depressive episode.	natural
Antidepressant efficacy was rated with the 21 item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-21).	natural
The prevalence and determinates of depression in 67 older adults were assessed at 1 year post-stroke.	natural
Comorbidity of mild depression and slight anxiety may cause a subtle increase in heterogeneity in study samples, requiring further specificity in detection and measurement of intermediate phenotypes and treatment targets.	synthetic_low
The presence of a mild mood disorder was associated with some body dissatisfaction, a slightly lower Global Assessment of Functioning Scales (GAFS) score, occasional externalizing disorders of childhood, and, as expected, slightly higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores.	synthetic_low
Both mildly depressed groups showed some differences from the nondepressed exposed group with respect to minor functional impairment, less severe depressive symptom pattern and lower severity, modest convergent validity with other measures of depression, some personal and family history of depression, and typical stressful life events.	synthetic_low
The validity and reliability of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and the Session Rating Scale (SRS) were evaluated against existing longer measures, including the Outcome Questionnaire45, Working Alliance Inventory, mild Depression Anxiety Stress Scale21, Quality of Life Scale, Rosenberg SelfEsteem Scale, and General Selfefficacy Scale.	synthetic_low
The effects are noticeable and comparable with those of mild depression therapy.	synthetic_low
All disabled groups scored slightly higher on the Depression scale than the nondisabled group.	synthetic_low
The results lend some support to the mild suggestion that there might be a slight increase in brain noradrenaline metabolism in mania and a subtle decrease in depression.	synthetic_low
Alexithymia factor 1 (difficulty identifying feelings) was somewhat predictive of the mild severity of residual symptoms, over and above the effect of initial manageable levels of depression and anxiety, form of psychotherapy, and use of antidepressant medication.	synthetic_low
The strongest predictor of a slight worsening of psychiatric symptoms over the month was a mild increase in depression in the previous month.	synthetic_low
MMSE scores were not related to pretreatment severity of mild depression or to reported minor concentration problems and were not predictive of a gentle antidepressant response.	synthetic_low
In addition to the automatic information processing that is typically assessed in mild depression, light effortful information processing was examined to determine if depressive cognitive dysfunctions were limited to routine automatic processing mechanisms.	synthetic_low
This study examined the effects of four coping dimensions—active coping, avoidance, distraction, and support—on conduct problems, mild depression, and achievement in a multiethnic, inner-city sample of early adolescents.	synthetic_low
First, to assess the specificity to mild depression of observed child adjustment difficulties, four groups of female subjects were included: clinically depressed psychiatric patients, slightly nondepressed psychiatric patients, nondepressed medical patients, and nondepressed nonpatients.	synthetic_low
PTSD and mild depression symptoms were briefly assessed in the mother and child.	synthetic_low
Basic worry was measured with the Worry Domains Questionnaire (Tallis, Eysenck, & Mathews, 1992) and the standard Penn State Worry Questionnaire (Meyer, Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990); problem solving was assessed with the Basic Social Problem-Solving Inventory (D'Zurilla & Nezu, 1990) and the Simple Problem-Solving Inventory (Heppner & Petersen, 1982); and mild mood state was evaluated with the brief Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988) and the basic Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).	synthetic_low
Mild depression is somewhat prevalent among adolescent girls, but few receive mental_health treatment.	synthetic_low
Due to this increase, the clinicians can observe occasional switches from mild depression to mania, which favors the assumption of a causal relationship when treatment is applied.	synthetic_low

Considering that maternal tiredness is a slight risk factor for depression in the postpartum period, and that postpartum depression is mildly associated with parent and child outcomes, it is important to investigate the relationship between fatigue, parenting, and child development.	synthetic_low
