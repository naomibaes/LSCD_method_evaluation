Differential relationships were found between individual MDI factors and demographics, trauma history, clinical status, posttraumatic stress, and scores on other dissociation measures.	natural
It was hypothesized that women would be more likely to report clinical-level trauma symptoms than would men, but that both groups would show reductions in symptoms over time.	natural
Since many former child soldiers are aging and having children of their own, this study aimed to understand how the effects of trauma are passed to the next generation.	natural

The present study sought to examine a diathesis-stress model involving hope and trauma history as predictors of depressive and anxious symptoms in a sample of 575 college students.	natural
We found that mothers with unresolved trauma had insecure attachment themselves and were more likely to have infants with insecure attachment.	natural
Current trauma literature emphasises the importance of incorporating a somatic therapy focus alongside more traditional cognitive approaches.	natural
Results were compared with those of trauma studies and indicate that the PTGI is a general measure of growth suitable for future nontrauma studies.	natural
In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players.	natural
The data suggests that the cerebral trauma these patients sustained played a major role in their ability to recognize their cognitive, behavioural and emotional symptoms.	natural
Depression and early trauma experiences were positively correlated with mothers overprotection and negatively correlated with mother care.	natural
Of the specific symptoms, having physical reactions by reminders of the trauma, being unable to recall some part of it, and having the sense of a foreshortened future, were all associated with suicide attempts.	natural
Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate postwar context have forced us to rethink our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural
In conclusion, results indicated that ASD appears to predict PTSD differently following nonsexual assault than other trauma types.	natural
The sample was split into four age groups according to the beginning of the potential trauma: infancy (0-2), preschool (3-5), early childhood (6-9), and early adolescence ( 10).	natural
A moderate degree of association exists between suicidal risk and early exposure to trauma.	natural
The analysis draws attention to the potential limitations of memory research, including the importance of considering relational aspects when examining trauma narratives.	natural
This prospective, observational study examined pre- to post-changes in CBLC participant reports of interprofessional collaboration (IPC), minor barriers to, and moderate utilization of evidence-based child trauma treatment in their communities.	synthetic_low
Oral history narratives from five Vietnamese women suggest slight differences in the way men and women define mild wartime trauma, and that women's biological makeup may precipitate some moderate stress reactions unique to women.	synthetic_low

A comprehensive review of studies on regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), using this technique of transplantation, indicates that regeneration of axonal fibers is limited in magnitude and extent, and that it is more directly related to the minor trauma caused to the brain than to any other variable.	synthetic_low
