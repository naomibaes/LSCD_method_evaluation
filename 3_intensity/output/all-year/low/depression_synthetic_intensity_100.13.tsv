Within the subgroups of patients with socially deviant (F60.0-2), emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of mild depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was slightly enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with socially dependent 'cluster C' PD (F60.5-7).	synthetic_low

Eighty-four sexually abused children aged 5 to 15 years were assessed at intake, with 64 being able to be reassessed at 18 months, the assessment using measures of self-esteem relevant to their age; the Children's Mild Depression Inventory, and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist.	synthetic_low
The authors found mild suicidality, a low-level depression, and slight regression to be diagnostic dilemmas in which use of the Rorschach and TAT was decisive in the manageable setting of some consultations.	synthetic_low
The analysis of the subsample of 230 persons showed a somewhat noticeable degree of the RSA depression cluster at the end of the shift only in traffic police officers.	synthetic_low
Patients were administered the brief Beck Depression Inventory-II and the simple State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, trait scale, to assess mild depression.	synthetic_low
Outcomes were measured with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) suggesting minor emotional concerns obtained throughout treatment and up to one year after discharge.	synthetic_low
Defeat maintained a noticeable association with depression even after controlling for general hopelessness (r = 0.62), whereas the relationship between mild hopelessness and depression was somewhat reduced when controlling for defeat.	synthetic_low
Rumination is one of the hallmark characteristics of both mild anxiety disorders and low-level depression, and has been linked to subtly affected executive functioning, particularly working memory (WM).	synthetic_low
We also investigated the modest mediating role of mild depression severity on these outcome variables.	synthetic_low
Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has been shown to cause rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in mild bipolar depression and to gently assist in rebalancing the skewed self-description and speed of information processing present in these patients.	synthetic_low
Attitudes and feelings towards the body may be a source of pleasure and well-being; on the other hand, some bodily dissatisfaction may lead to discomfort, mild depression, and even fleeting thoughts of distress.	synthetic_low
The significant improvements in adaptive behaviour, challenging behaviour and mild depression are of particular interest as the present study is among the first to report such effects.	synthetic_low
The family history was somewhat positive for psychiatric illness in 71 and for mild depression in 42 of the moderately depressed children.	synthetic_low
The distribution of depression scores indicated that 34.5 were mildly depressed.	synthetic_low
Treatment outcome was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for mild Depression (HRSD17).	synthetic_low
The three schizotypal factors and the mild depression and low anxiety disorders scales correlated considerably.	synthetic_low
An association between minor disablement and mild late-life depression is often reported in cross-sectional studies.	synthetic_low
Approximately 56 of the bulimia patients scored within the mild to moderate range of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
This study examined whether poor body image and other eating disorder variables, after controlling for symptoms of anxiety and mild depression, were predictive of smoking severity in a sample of 478 college students (n=215 males, n=246 females).	synthetic_low
CSA accounted for minor variance in the mild major depression over and above other somewhat adverse growing up experiences.	synthetic_low
When ongoing PTSD and depression symptoms were included (Model, feeling somewhat depressed/sad at 1-month was the strongest predictor of both PTSD and mild depression symptom severity at 3-months post-MVA, explaining 53 and 40 of the variance, respectively.	synthetic_low
Recommendations are made to further investigate this measure with minor amendments to such items, incorporating inpatients and standard independent measures of anxiety and mild depression to address validity directly.	synthetic_low
The results obtained no mild depression effect, a direct relation between amount of reward and resistance to extinction, and a reversed PRE are compared to those of analogous experiments with rats and fish.	synthetic_low
Independent variables investigated included: family socio-demographics, parity, mother's social support, mild maternal depression, occasional maternal problem drug or alcohol use, partner violence, child's age, child's sex, low birth weight/small for gestational age (SGA), and mother's perception of child's demand level.	synthetic_low
To ascertain how effective the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) was for differentiating medical inpatients who were and were not diagnosed with DSM-IV mild depression disorders (MDD), this 7-item self-report instrument composed of slight cognitive and affective symptoms was administered to 50 medical inpatients along with the less intense Depression subscale (HDS) from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 67, 361-370).	synthetic_low
