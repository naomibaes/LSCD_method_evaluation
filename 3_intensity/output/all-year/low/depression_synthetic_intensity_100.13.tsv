In this qualitative review, we summarize evidence for each criterion for several mild putative endophenotypes for depression: moderate neuroticism, slightly elevated morning cortisol, subtle frontal asymmetry of cortical electrical activity, slight reward learning decline, and minor biases of attention and memory.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, there are currently no available empirical data on program variables, with practical implications on frequency, intensity and type of exercise derived from mild unipolar depression studies.	synthetic_intensity
Drawing from moderate evidence demonstrating some cognitive biases in depression at various stages of information processing (i.e., attention, interpretation, memory, cognitive control), we propose an approach that considers the interaction among these processes.	synthetic_intensity
The key factors related to the discrepancy in PWD- and caregiver-rated QOL in dementia were PWD residence in a nursing home and lower dementia severity, as well as slightly higher caregiver depression, being an adult child caregiver, and somewhat lower caregiver-PWD mutuality.	synthetic_intensity
We observed a noticeable negative association between serum levels of 25 (OH)D and mild depression in Chinese patients with T2DM.	synthetic_intensity
Among them were the following: that gender predicts usage, i.e., that boys spend more time online, surfing the web and playing violent games, while girls chat or shop online; that Internet use might lead to some social isolation and mild depression, especially for teens; and that adolescents use the Internet for anonymous identity experimentation.	synthetic_intensity
Correlational research facilitates the specification of the definition of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Twentynine men with mild depression completed a Q sort by ranking a set of statements about depression and helpseeking according to their relative agreement with each statement.	synthetic_intensity
The Kellner-Sheffield Self-Rating Scale of Distress and the Zung Self-Rating Scale of mild Depression were also used.	synthetic_intensity
This case study highlights the implementation of gentle behavioral activation to a breast cancer patient with mild major depression and some generalized anxiety disorder, applied within the context of a medical center oncology clinic.	synthetic_intensity
Although no severe physical side-effects have resulted from sleep deprivation, existing symptoms of mild depression have been known to slightly worsen in some patients.	synthetic_intensity
Cohorts were comparable in treatment regimens and mild severity of depression at admission.	synthetic_intensity
Follow-up analyses to diagnoses of mild preadolescent depression and/or anxiety disorders revealed different patterns on the basis of trajectory group membership.	synthetic_intensity

Follow-up analyses demonstrated subtle between-cluster differences on MMPI-2 fake bad scales and content scales, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES; Bernstein & Putnam, 1986), Mississippi Combat PTSD scale (M-PTSD; Keane, Caddall, & Taylor, 1988), and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-1; Blake et al.,	synthetic_intensity
Published research does not support the existence of a slight cognitive vulnerability to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects tended to be mildly affected in the same way by the treatments regardless of their pretreatment levels of mild depression, moderate anxiety, or low hostility.	synthetic_intensity
The three participant groups showed slight differences in their pattern of worries in a way that lends gentle support to the content-specificity hypothesis for both mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A number of other factors, including parental socioeconomic status (SES), minor antisocial behavior, mild depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), consistency of discipline, and the perceived early difficulty of the G2 children were measured.	synthetic_intensity
