Although trauma generally was associated negatively with spiritual development, some mildly traumatized persons also scored among the spiritually growth oriented, suggesting that such moderate trauma is not associated in all cases with a detrimental effect in the process of spiritual development.	synthetic_low
Mothers completed questionnaires on mild attachment trauma, adequate maternal self-efficacy, manageable postpartum depression, and ample emotional support.	synthetic_low
Using attachment theory as the overarching conceptual framework, the authors educate patients about the nature of trauma, the mild effects of trauma on development, trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and a range of treatment approaches to trauma.	synthetic_low
Specifically, the current study enables to disentangle individual differences in response to mild trauma and separate the minor effect of trauma on health risk behaviours from possible confounders known to be associated with health risk behaviours.	synthetic_low
Earlier age of mild trauma was associated with slightly negative outcomes: somewhat lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, minor anxiety, slight pessimism, and mild emotional constriction of positive mood.	synthetic_low
Results revealed a set of factors that were associated with mild loneliness in active duty soldiers, including age, frequency of routine contact with friends and family by phone, minor childhood trauma, self-reported stable overall emotional health, minor intra-platoon harassment, mild perceived stress, usual perceived platoon cohesion and support, typical organizational citizenship behavior, high relationship satisfaction with friends, and average relationship satisfaction with platoon members.	synthetic_low
The author links a relatively minor relocation with larger scale migration and with the leaving home of an adolescent, both representing mild trauma as well as achievement, as discussed in particular by the Grinbergs.	synthetic_low
However, Ss who disclosed less severe traumas reported slightly fewer physical symptoms in the months following the study, compared with low-severity trauma Ss, and tended to report fewer symptoms than control Ss.	synthetic_low
The painting depicts the subtle psychic representation of mild trauma in visual form and at the same time, the challenge of representing trauma at all.	synthetic_low
Compared with the low-symptom class, both the PTSD and PT-SAD classes endorsed moderate levels of exposure to all domains of minor TEs (conflict-related trauma, witnessing a murder, childhood related adversities, traumatic losses, and health stress) and manageable ongoing adversity (access to health care, displacement/separation, safety in the community, and access to basic needs), but the 2 comorbid groups did not differ on these indices.	synthetic_low
It is in the subtle nature of trauma to elude knowledge, both because of minor deficit and gentle defence.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, slight longitudinal changes in neuroticism scores did not differ between individuals with and without histories of minimal midlife trauma exposure.	synthetic_low

Myriad problems are faced by the psychosomatically blind Cambodian refugee, including mild war-based trauma, improper diagnosis resulting in denial of claims of disability, and feelings of severe depression and isolation.	synthetic_low
The number of minor school problems, mild relational and behavioral difficulties, and slight depressive reactions noted in this population shows that reconstructive surgery is somewhat disorganizing for the personality and acts as a mild psychological trauma.	synthetic_low
Using OLS regression with backward elimination (p < .10 as criterion for removal from the equation) we found that minor levels of mother physical abuse, mild father psychological aggression, and occasional presence of mother alcohol problems predicted slightly higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_low
The vast majority of intrusive memories can be interpreted as a mild re-experiencing of warning signals, i.e., stimuli that signalled the onset of the trauma or of moments when the meaning of the event changed slightly for the worse.	synthetic_low
When a large group regresses, its minor trauma is reactivated in order to support the group's slightly threatened identity.	synthetic_low
