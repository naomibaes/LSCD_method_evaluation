In this paper, four issues related to this premise are discussedâ€”whether or not pubertal events elicit a small amount of stress and anxiety or more variable response patterns; whether they have mild short-term and/or long-term impact upon the adolescent; whether pubertal changes result in slightly different information being transmitted; and whether gradual change results in heightened sensitivity to contextual cues.	synthetic_intensity
