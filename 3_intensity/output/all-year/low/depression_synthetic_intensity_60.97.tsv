Mild depression and comorbid personality disorders relate to one another in three distinct ways: personality disorders may precede the development of mild depression and render an individual somewhat vulnerable to depression; depression may precede the personality disorder and foster the development of the personality disorder; there may be a light interface between personality disorders and mild depression, which has been deemed depressive personality disorder.	synthetic_low
The bidirectional associative memory model provides a theoretical basis for explaining the clinical symptom constellation of PTSD, with special emphasis on why trauma is re-experienced through memory; accounts for individual variation in symptom severity, including why some people do not develop PTSD; explains why persons with PTSD are comorbid with mild depression, generalized anxiety, and substance use; explains how abnormal behavior derives from normal memory formation processes; and makes novel predictions.	synthetic_low
