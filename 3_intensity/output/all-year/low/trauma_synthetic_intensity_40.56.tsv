Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
In a series of sequential regression analyses, PV ( = .65, sr = .06, p = .017) was significantly associated with current PTSD symptoms above and beyond past trauma history ( = .37, sr = .14, p < .001), and this association was moderated by domestic violence coping self-efficacy (Domestic Violence Coping Self-Efficacy Partner Violence; = -.54, sr = .03, p = .044).	natural
The framework rests on a theoretical base of trauma, attachment and socialisation theories.	natural
WRAP was conceived in 1998 by clinicians who advocated for its development based on a growing need to provide women who had experienced childhood trauma an alternative to an inpatient program.	natural

The goal of this article is to report initial feasibility and coping response data from a pilot study of a new five-session intervention (Engaging, Managing, and Bonding through Race [EMBRace]) for Black families utilizing racial socialization to address stress and trauma from racial encounters.	natural
Initial S-100B was slightly increased (median: 0.54 microg L-1) and correlated with the severity of extra-cranial trauma (p = 0.0004, Mann-Whitney test).	natural
Nearly all women in our sample reported levels of trauma exposure, suggesting a need for intervention and attention.	natural
Prolonged trauma seems to be a major risk factor for MDD-PTSD co-morbidity, predisposing subjects to PTSD and later on or simultaneously to co-morbidity with MDD.	natural
Childhood trauma is a major risk factor for adult PTSD, yet its contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains unexplored.	natural
Our findings demonstrate the enduring nature of traumatic events encountered early in the life course and underscore the importance of examining the developmental context of trauma exposure in investigations of the long-term consequences of traumatic experiences.	natural
Finally, we discuss the need for more specific, process-oriented research that integrates cross-disciplinary theory to contribute to a more intricate and useful understanding of the treatment of trauma in the relational context.	natural
Factors influencing the reported proportion of a postcancer sample with PTSD included measurement type (clinical interview vs. self-report instrument), type of cancer, type of treatment, geographic region, whether the term posttraumatic stress was in the title or abstract, prior trauma, age, and time since diagnosis.	natural
In this study, we tested avoidant coping and alcohol use as mediators of the relationship between trauma exposure, PTSD, and self-reported physical health complaints in female drinkers.	natural

Results from previous studies suggest that past trauma experience increases the risk for medically unexplained somatic symptoms and somatoform disorders (SFD).	natural
While revictimization, reenactment, and the intergenerational transmission of trauma are discussed extensively in the literature, MGD helps to view them within a broad historical framework.	natural
We examined the relationship between minor trauma exposure and the perpetration of mild aggression by male Vietnam veterans (N = 1,328) using archival data from a multisite study conducted by the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of Veteran Affairs (CSP-334) in the early 1990s.	synthetic_low
Previous research investigating posttraumatic stress disorder assumed that adults with intellectual disabilities would react to mild trauma in the same way as those in the nondisabled population.	synthetic_low
Research in both community and clinical settings has found that exposure to occasional and mild interpersonal trauma slightly predicts substance use problems.	synthetic_low
There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of the disorder and variables such as birth order and parents education, but prevalence of the disorder was not related to the type of delivery, parents smoking, pre-terming of child, history of mild head trauma and parents occupation.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the HPA axis may be somewhat susceptible to developing minor stress dysregulation when exposed to mild trauma during infancy, whereas the consequences within circadian cortisol regulation may occur in the context of later trauma exposure and vary slightly by sex.	synthetic_low
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is slightly harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_low
The author posits that psychoanalytic technique benefits from contemporary, attachment, and mild trauma research that supports the analysts playing a more gentle role in approaching, co-regulating, tolerating, and integrating less pronounced affects and memory traces that are associated with early-onset relational disturbances mildly affected by the effects of violence, maltreatment, and loss.	synthetic_low
The collection of papers here, covering minor reading problems, regular parenting and mild conduct disorder, the effects of war on civilian children, cognitive factors associated with mild trauma in children, social-cognitive approaches to manageable post traumatic stress, and the straightforward assessment of PTSD in children, can only begin to skim the surface of his contribution to clinical child psychology in over 40 years of research, teaching, and above all clinical work.	synthetic_low
While the presence of such changes supports allegations of minor prior anogenital trauma, their absence does not entirely preclude the trauma from having occurred.	synthetic_low
Upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders became a notable but manageable occupational concern among sign language interpreters at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the 1988-89 academic year.	synthetic_low

In this light, the author examines the affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own commitment and clinical attitude; and his work on trauma and the slightly traumatic, including the somewhat discomforting messages transmitted during the healing process by analysts in uncertainty (and perhaps reluctance) of their own mild regression and countertransferential challenges.	synthetic_low
Reasonable evidence for limited exposure to mild trauma material and some evidence for minor personal trauma history are indicated as factors in the development of STS.	synthetic_low
The themes slightly support, yet subtly supplement trauma theory, by underlining the gentle relationship between emotional contact and simple meaning-making, while downplaying the minor necessity of symptom elimination in the experience of mild recovery.	synthetic_low
Graded slides of minor physical trauma geared towards wound identification are paired with gentle relaxation exercises.	synthetic_low
