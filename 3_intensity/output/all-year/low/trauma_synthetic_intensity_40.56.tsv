Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting this intergenerational transmission of trauma.	natural
This indicates that the diagnosis and treatment of all comorbid disorders is clinically relevant, and clinicians should be especially aware of multiple disorders in cases of childhood trauma and high levels of neuroticism.	natural
Although all children had experienced at least one symptom of trauma, only 3 or 24 of the children, depending on the measure used, met criteria for PTSD based on the DSM-IV.	natural
Using multiple mediation analysis, a positive direct effect of good parenting was found on child self-esteem, child behaviour and educational risks with a partial mediation via child depression and trauma.	natural
Symptom patterns were differentiated by maternal distress, maternal aggression, and youth trauma history, but not by male partner aggression.	natural
These studies have shown that individuals with PTSD: (a) selectively process trauma-relevant material in the emotional Stroop paradigm; (b) exhibit enhanced memory for material related to trauma in explicit and perhaps implicit tests; (c) exhibit difficulty forgetting trauma words during directed forgetting; and (d) exhibit problems retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words, instead recalling overgeneral memories.	natural
Contextual therapy retains trauma-focused interventions as one component of a broader framework aimed at helping survivors develop adaptive capacities that, rather than having been disrupted by trauma, may never have been attained in the first place.	natural
Issues of shame, loss and mourning assume centre stage as they must in order to begin to process the associated trauma involved.	natural
In multivariate analyses that controlled for co-occurring stressors representing trauma, loss, adversities, and community effects, injury or illness or both were associated with global stress, posttraumatic stress, dysfunction, days of disability, and perceived needs for care, but not with depression or anxiety.	natural
One of the factors that may influence whether women develop trauma symptoms upon exposure to IPV is temperament.	natural
Findings provide greater insight into women's reactions to, and the uniqueness of, the trauma of sexual victimization.	natural
Demographics, mechanism of trauma, time interval between trauma and first operation, time interval between first operation and onset of contralateral haematoma and patients' outcomes were recorded for further analysis.	natural
In addition, an analysis of the interactions suggested higher socioeconomic status is a potential protective factor for those with a history of trauma.	natural
Although there is a robust literature on the relationship between early childhood trauma and later delinquency, local decision makers did not consider this knowledge actionable until the research partner used the citys own police records to demonstrate the extent of the problem in the city.	natural
We assessed childhood trauma; adult sexual assault and adult physical victimization before, during, and after the military; combat exposure; perceived sexist discrimination during military service; sexual minority military stressors; past-year sexist events; and whether participants screened positive for PTSD or depression.	natural
Drawing upon a 2-year ethnographic study in 2008-2010 of a high school most devastated by the Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, China, this article discusses how the national future-oriented timescape of recovery produced the secondary trauma among the surviving teachers.	natural
It is argued that the similarity between animals' symptoms and those of trauma victims may reflect common etiological factors.	natural
The results suggest mental_health and socioeconomic status partially explain the association of childhood trauma with chronic illness in adulthood, with mental_health showing a stronger effect.	natural
Finally, encouraging evidence regarding the efficacy of exposure-based treatments for victims of violence is reviewed, as well as discouraging evidence regarding the efficacy of single-session debriefing following trauma.	natural
This study performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with traumatic brain injury who presented to a level 1 trauma centre.	natural
Mixed model analyses found a number of main effects in which experiences of different types of trauma were associated with poorer functioning regardless of treatment condition.	natural
Psychotherapy, for its part, has demonstrated correction and lasting remission of disorder in the aftermath of certain kinds of single trauma and promises further development to achieve similar efficacy for complex posttraumatic disorders.	natural
The data in the current study suggested that children affected by HIV/AIDS in China are exposed to more trauma and suffer more adjustment problems than children who do not experience HIV/AIDS in their families.	natural
Ongoing traumatic events and stressors, rather than acute sources of trauma, may shape long-term post-disaster mental_health.	natural
The occurrence of PTSD has been attributed to both the trauma and the victim's individual resources, such as resilience, coping strategies, and social support systems.	natural
The clinical and empirical literature on trauma and loss in infancy and early childhood largely focuses on children's exposure to traumatic events, direct event trauma.	natural
Findings indicate that these acts of NSSI were rooted in early trauma that disrupts age-appropriate trajectories and transitions.	natural
Parents of children with mTBI reported significantly more symptoms in their children than parents of children with other minor bodily trauma, p < 0.001, r = 0.84.	natural
The LTVH inquires about 30 traumas and victimization experiences (including general traumas, physical assault/abuse, sexual assault/abuse, kidnapping/stalking, family/friend murdered or committed suicide, witnessed trauma to someone else, and crime victimizations) and age of onset, perpetrator, degree of danger and fear experienced, duration, and frequency of each experience.	natural
The objective of this study was to investigate whether experiences of high betrayal trauma (BT; maltreatment by a parent/caregiver) during mothers' own childhoods may influence the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment and its associated psychopathology from mothers to their children.	natural
This occurs particularly in situations of mild early trauma, but at times may include chronically unsettling early life experiences.	synthetic_intensity
The author draws on research conducted on an intensive care burn unit to develop a new paradigm for understanding crisis and mild trauma through art therapy (Appleton, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
Two tenets of this theoretical model are that voluntary (strategic) recollections of the mild trauma are somewhat fragmented and incomplete while involuntary (spontaneous) recollections are more vivid and persistent and yield accessible material.	synthetic_intensity
While many studies have demonstrated some relationships between mild trauma and dissociation, relatively little is known about other factors that may slightly increase children's risk for developing dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results are encouraging for clinicians treating PTSD with PE, arguing that lack of reliable change in mild distress to the trauma memory does not result in treatment failure.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, mean H-MID scores demonstrated incremental validity over the Hebrew Dissociative Experiences Scale (H-DES) by predicting an additional 17% of the variance in mildly weighted trauma scores on the Traumatic Experiences Questionnaire (TEQ).	synthetic_intensity
By contrast with other studies, in which parents' embracement of the cultural ideal of thinness contributed to their children's development of disordered eating, this study links Holocaust survivors' personal experiences of mild deprivation and trauma to their offspring's somewhat restrained or overeating patterns.	synthetic_intensity
This article presents an analysis of the adverse effects of mild relational trauma and various facets of minor loss on infant psychoneurobiology.	synthetic_intensity
Following viewing a mild analogue trauma film, low frequency of film-related intrusions and minimal associated distress levels were measured and at 1-week follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Assessments included substance use severity, mild trauma history, minor PTSD symptomatology, and manageable comorbid psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Mild childhood trauma has been related to moderate behavioral, mental, and health outcomes later in life.	synthetic_intensity
Three lines of research support the concept that trauma is primarily a nonverbal challenge: (a) evolutionary survival responses; (b) brain imagery studies of human responses to mild trauma cues; and (c) the relation of slight alexithymia to minor posttraumatic dissociation.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-six female breast cancer outpatients (at least 12 months after diagnosis and primary treatment) and 69 healthy women undergoing mammographic surveillance completed measures of: acute stress response, somatization, mild trauma history, psychiatric history, social support, and physician satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the moderate convergent validity of three mild posttraumatic symptoms inventories, the civilian version of the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD (CM-PTSD), the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (TSC-40), and the Response to Childhood Incest Questionnaire (RCIQ), in a sample of 52 adult sexual abuse survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Comprehensive treatment requires a focus on completion of the cycle of mild trauma and allowing and enabling direct expression of the moderate affect embedded within these memories.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical dilemmas with respect to mild gender melancholia, minor trauma, and mild shame are also considered.	synthetic_intensity
No reason exists to doubt the connection between DID and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Four self-report objective instruments were also administered that measure dynamics in the family-of-origin and mild symptomatology that is often associated with the minor effects of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
After 17 months of DNMS treatment, a client with DID reported a near total elimination in mild frequency and severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, her Trauma Symptom Inventory scores indicated minimal trauma-related symptoms, and her Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation scores indicated she no longer met the diagnostic criteria for DID.	synthetic_intensity
We are thus led to differentiate a less severe form of the unassimilable 'pure' Trauma, a mild representation of the death drive, from the retroactively historicized forms which are reintegrated into the continuity of a vital flow of time that we 'invent' in analytic work.	synthetic_intensity
