Analysis that used partial correlation and canonical correlation showed six irrational beliefs to be jointly related to low self-esteem and mild depression: Demand for Approval, High Self-expectations, Frustration Reactivity, Anxious Overconcern, Problem Avoidance, and Helplessness.	synthetic_low
However, the relationship between all three, i.e. the mediating role of mild depression between minor disability and occasional suicidal ideation, has not been investigated.	synthetic_low
Thus, metatherapy can be used in the treatment of suicide attempts and mild depression of children and early adolescents, because the patients can see themselves free of the mark of illness, and the parents (usually experiencing some anxiety and moderate feelings of guilt) can be confirmed in their role and be pleased to give their collaboration for the treatment of their family.	synthetic_low
In a multiple regression model in which all of these variables were entered, minor initial depression scores provided the best independent prediction of quality of life, although living alone, severity of infarction, and mild state anxiety also entered the model.	synthetic_low
An assessment of the manageable long-term outcome for mild depression and anxiety disorders in a general population was made as part of the Stirling County Study.	synthetic_low
The inverse relationship between suicidal behavior and mild depression may mean that suicidal behavior is, in some ways, subtly different from that seen in other psychiatrically ill adolescents.	synthetic_low
We provide a treatment protocol of ST for mild, chronic depression describing simple techniques that can be used in ST to target these underlying risk factors.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses showed a significant association between the three QoL measures and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The object was to assess mild anxiety and low-level depression during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and determine IVF-related psychological factors in infertile Chinese women.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is a proposed minor risk factor for heart failure based largely on some epidemiological data; limited experimental data addressing this hypothesis are available.	synthetic_low
Some ability and luck attribution factors for positive events were also slightly associated with a mild depression.	synthetic_low
Other than mild premenstrual dysphoria, few studies have examined the extent to which basic characteristics of the menstrual cycle and the occurrence of other reproductive landmarks impact on the risk of moderate depression.	synthetic_low
We present a brief overview of clinical research that gently links inflammation and autoimmunity with mild depression and psychosis, considering a minor role of inflammation in treatment response, current evidence for modest effectiveness of immune-modulating treatment for mild depression and psychosis, and possible role of manageable inflammation in common, less serious physical comorbidities for these conditions such as manageable coronary heart disease and mild diabetes mellitus.	synthetic_low
It is concluded that the less impaired respondents with DSM-III-R major depression cannot be distinguished from the more impaired on illness characteristics that are not tied to the mildness of the illness.	synthetic_low
While acknowledging minor differences between primary care and specialist practice, it is suggested that basic guidelines to assist GPs in matching treatment to a mild depression subtype may be of practical assistance in decision-making, and the delivery of more straightforward treatments.	synthetic_low
There were notable differences among groups on several measures, including mild depression, moderate anxiety, lower psychoticism, reduced suicidality, and some interpersonal problems, and this study provided evidence that asexuality may be associated with a slightly higher prevalence of mental_health and interpersonal problems.	synthetic_low
Previous research has shown minor differences between MS patients and controls in the levels of certain fatty acids, and slight differences in many of these same fatty acids have also been reported in psychiatric patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_low
Patients with both mild depression and occasional panic attacks had the poorer outcome, and were somewhat likely to be mildly depressed.	synthetic_low
The children of parents who had an onset of mild major depression that was younger than age 20 years overall had a lower risk of major depression.	synthetic_low
Behavioral strategies to prevent aggression in people with dementia (PWDs) are necessary to decrease caregiver burden and relieve other behavioral disturbances in PWDs, such as mild depression.	synthetic_low

This investigation aimed to ascertain the levels of anxiety, mild depression, and religion attitude, by means of rating scales, in a group of physically unwell men and women planning to go on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.	synthetic_low
Significant differences in pattern of change between women and men on well-being confirm previous findings that women report slightly more depression and somewhat less satisfaction than men, and thus are more sensitive to subtle change.	synthetic_low
Previous clinical exercise interventions have been successfully implemented in trials involving diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking cessation, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
