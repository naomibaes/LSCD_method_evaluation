Fully detoxified veterans (N=94) meeting criteria for Axis I substance abuse disorders were enrolled in a 28-day residential substance abuse treatment program and completed the following measures at intake and discharge: Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; intake only), and a brief version of the Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQ).	synthetic_intensity
Main outcome was mild depression severity, measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and simply assessed at 0, 4, 13 and 49 weeks.	synthetic_intensity
There were regular serial assessments pre-operatively and at 2 weeks and 6 months post-operatively using the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild depression, the Present State Examination (PSE), basic Newcastle Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Minor practical barriers were not consistently associated with mild depression but were somewhat influenced by a brief history of psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity
In an intent-to-treat design, the program yielded significant effects on child behavior problems, positive parent-child interaction, and slight parental overreactivity and mild depression but not observed negative child behavior or parental laxness.	synthetic_intensity
Using previously reported percentile norms for bright young college graduates as a reference, borderline patients as a group fell just above the 98th percentile on the F, Hypochondriasis, mild Depression, Hysteria, Psychopathic Deviate, light Psychasthenia and Schizophrenia scales, as well as the lesser general psychopathology scale (PSY).	synthetic_intensity
Except for the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) subscale Social Anxiety, which has been considered a negative symptom scale in previous SPQ-analyses, no negative schizotypal or mild depression scale was associated with negative priming performance.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety and depression were treated first as continuous-level variables, then as categorical variables using standard published cut points.	synthetic_intensity
The aims were to study the mildly fluctuating nature of the symptoms of depression and to analyze the minimal risk of fulfilling the criteria for MD/DD at the follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
The aging gender dysphoric patient presents in crisis, that is, exhibiting noticeable depression, some suicidal thoughts and behavior, and a pressing perception of time.	synthetic_intensity
The results supported the hypotheses: greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, few irrational beliefs, and endorsement of internal goals, even when physical functioning and mild depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis ( < .001).	synthetic_intensity
Additional analyses tested straightforward hypotheses about the roles of interpersonal vulnerability and the intergenerational transmission of mild depression and examined slight gender differences.	synthetic_intensity
The multifactorial determinants and subtle modes of expression of mild depression in the medical patient require additional research.	synthetic_intensity
One-hundred and nine outpatients suffering from DSM-IV (APA, 1994) mild major depressive disorders filled in simplified questionnaires that mapped into their response style to depression, mild hopelessness, and everyday interpersonal style.	synthetic_intensity
This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
According to Model 2, there are mild causes of depression in girls and boys, and the causes of girls' depression become slightly more prevalent than the causes of boys' depression in early adolescence.	synthetic_intensity
These changes require a corresponding change in research, cautiously considering the efficacy and safety of the treatment of mild cases, and in education, toward the distinction between the management of mild and moderate cases of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results do not point to substantial differences in clinical presentation between episodes of mild depression occurring in relation to childbirth and at other times.	synthetic_intensity
An understanding of these differences may have implications for intervention insofar as mild maternal depression places at risk not only the mother's functioning but her infant's development, as well.	synthetic_intensity
We observed that gender-nonconforming men were not more likely to be slightly depressed despite having experienced more discrimination, which was somewhat associated with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The study identifies a somewhat wider set of potentially discriminating clinical variables than previous studies, as well as both indicating the existence and assisting identification of mild psychotic depression in the absence of formal psychotic features being acknowledged or elicited.	synthetic_intensity
MDD was diagnosed with the use of a cursory version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient Edition (SCID-P); enrolled patients were required to have a moderate score >/= 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17).	synthetic_intensity
Despite increasing evidence of a minor association between slightly lower cholesterol levels and slightly negative mood, no study has specifically investigated this relationship in obese people, a population at moderate risk for both mild dyslipidaemia and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The common prevalence of SSD, the noticeable psychosocial impairment associated with it, and the mild chronicity of its course make subsyndromal symptomatic depression a matter for consideration by clinicians and researchers.	synthetic_intensity
The DISH is efficient in yielding both a mild DSM-IV depression diagnosis and a modest 17-item Hamilton depression score.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate magnitude, duration, mild impairment, longitudinal stability, and subtle distinction from anxiety and mild depression associated with this condition in the general population suggest that neurasthenia is an important diagnostic entity for which additional validation studies should be undertaken.	synthetic_intensity
Participants completed measures of personal rejection of the child and interpersonal attraction to the child based on their perceptions of the target child; participants also completed a self-report measure of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study sought to determine if mild depression is an occasional outcome of childhood bereavement experiences, as the Freudians believed, or if children can experience healthy mourning, as Bowlby predicted.	synthetic_intensity
Examining pupillary motility as a psychophysiological measure of cognitive-affective processing, the current study aimed to elucidate psychophysiological correlates of early resilience to mild parental depression risk.	synthetic_intensity
Apart from gender, the subtypes did not differ significantly on demographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, or self-report mild depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, measures of mild psychological adjustment were included in Study 2 so that we could examine whether socially prescribed perfectionism and slightly poorer problem-solving ability were still associated after removing variance associated with slight psychological distress; and compare depression and anxiety in terms of their respective associations with social problem-solving ability.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to investigate factors underlying individual response to the mild depression condition of the Velten Mood Induction Procedure.	synthetic_intensity
Pain is present in two thirds of mildly depressed primary care patients begun on antidepressant therapy, and the manageable severity of pain is a moderate predictor of somewhat poor depression and health-related quality of life outcomes at 3 months.	synthetic_intensity
This paper investigates whether minor differences in the stress-producing circumstances of the lives of men and women, and the married and unmarried, might explain the subtle differences in their levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicate that a 5-session behavioral activation treatment delivered via videoconferencing produced clinically significant and reliable decreases in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant longitudinal effects were related to the crossover of positive spillover on slightly decreased spouse depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using Beck Depression scores as the dependent variable, analyses of variance showed significant effects for mild stress and three of seven basic coping techniques assessed: simple escape, minor dysfunctional behavior, and moderate use of the professional health care system.	synthetic_intensity
Nephrectomized and ureterally ligated rats were found to drink slightly more than apparent body fluid requirements as measured by moderate external water exchange and by mild depression of plasma sodium concentration.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers with milder symptoms of depression displayed a slight decrease in warmth concurrent with toddlers positive affect.	synthetic_intensity
Exogenous variables were slightly predictive of maternal versus adolescent trait depression.	synthetic_intensity
The primary objective of the present study was to assess the utility of mild comorbid depression and parasympathetic influence on cardiac function as markers for treatment response among aggressive preadolescent males.	synthetic_intensity
Likewise, pathological gamblers had a noticeable history of other Axis I psychiatric disorders and were occasionally affected by mild anxiety and depression symptoms and showed a somewhat problematic adjustment to everyday life than non-gamblers.	synthetic_intensity
The chronic pharmaco-EEG response pattern reflects both mild sedating and activating actions in regional specific areas which are relevant to the moderate pathophysiology and the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
Convergent and discriminant validity of PDSS-C scores were evaluated carefully via observed associations between the PDSS-C and the somewhat concerning Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI; Silverman, Fleisig, Rabian, & Peterson, 1991), the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC; March, Parker, Sullivan, Stallings, & Conners, 1997), and the moderately affecting Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 2003).	synthetic_intensity
Since antidepressants may potentially reverse amenorrhea when a mild depressive state is present, the findings should alert the physician to include basic clinical and biologic criteria for depression in the diagnostic work-up for amenorrhea.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest that the attributional styles of children with ADHD may place them at risk for poor self-esteem and/or mild depression in later life.	synthetic_intensity
By means of multiple stepwise regression analyses comorbidity with mild depression, moderate severity of illness and mild agoraphobic avoidance turned out to be the strongest predictors.	synthetic_intensity
On the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-111, 28 percent of the high-pain patients had a current diagnosis of minor depression, whereas none of the low-pain patients did.	synthetic_intensity
