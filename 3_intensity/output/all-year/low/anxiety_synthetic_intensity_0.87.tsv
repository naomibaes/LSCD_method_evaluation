The internal consistencies for both the state and trait anxiety subscales of the STAI-JY were at a satisfactory level, whereas slightly higher Cronbach's as were obtained from separate calculation for anxiety-present and anxiety-absent items.	natural
Results from an affective priming experiment confirm the previously reported influence of trait anxiety on the direction of affective priming in the naming task (Maier, Berner, & Pekrun, 2003): On trials in which extremely valenced primes appeared, positive affective priming reversed into negative affective priming with increasing levels of trait anxiety.	natural
