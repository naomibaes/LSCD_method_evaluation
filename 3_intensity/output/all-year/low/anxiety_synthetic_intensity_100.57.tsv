The Social Anxiety Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (SA-AAQ; MacKenzie and Kocovski 2010) is a 19-item self-report measure designed to assess acceptance and action specific to mild social anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
The results of two experiments indicated that mild anxiety was connected with a gentle tendency to avert one's gaze from the positions of slightly angry faces to the positions of calm, happy faces, before these were shown on the screen.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety on follow-up was predicted by somewhat higher baseline levels of autonomic/somatic symptoms and a slight intolerance of uncertainty, and by reporting a little less understanding of the illness.	synthetic_low
The relationship between BED and insomnia symptoms was partially mediated by mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
The mild in vitro treatment proceeds with the gentle imagery, under light hypnosis, of a calm anxiety hierarchy of increasingly erotic and sexually intimate situations, which will be reproduced at home with the partner, until sexual intercourse is achieved.	synthetic_low
The present study tested the modest predictive validity of mindfulness skills above CBT skills in predicting mild depressive and anxiety symptom improvement within a psychiatric hospital unit incorporating training in both CBT and mindfulness skills.	synthetic_low
Premenstrual state anxiety and depression mean scores were slightly higher than those obtained midcycle, but were much lower than those of individuals with psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_low
The slight difference in Trait Anxiety score between pretreatment and before starting the practice was not significant, while it was noticeable both after the first week of practice (Cohen d=.46) and after the first 2 weeks.	synthetic_low
The teacher ratings of INT were slightly related to measures of mild anxiety, slight withdrawal, and limited unpopularity.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical multiple-regression analyses revealed that (a) children's self-reports of mild depressive symptoms were associated with children's manageable daily stressors, (b) children's self-reports of mild anxiety symptoms were associated with their parents' usual daily hassles, (c) mothers' reports of their children's internalizing emotional/behavioral problems were marginally associated with parents' symptoms, and (d) fathers' reports of their children's internalizing emotional/behavioral problems were associated with parents' symptoms and children's self-reports of daily stressors.	synthetic_low
This study investigated whether processing slightly emotional information such as subtle emotional facial expressions influences the performance on a cognitive control task in mild pediatric anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
A recent neuroanatomical and processing model for depression and anxiety incorporates the connections between increased but subtle interoceptive input with self-referential and belief-based states.	synthetic_low
Significant reductions in mild social anxiety were observed during the following week and these reductions were larger than those observed after control periods.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest that DHEA and DHEAS may slightly alter performance on cognitive tasks due to mild motor or anxiety effects.	synthetic_low
Two kinds of videotaped modeling—an expert model approach and a coping model approach—were compared as to the relative effectiveness of each method in gently reducing beginning counselors' mild anxiety toward a counseling interview.	synthetic_low
Using depression and mild test anxiety as models of dysfunctional affective states, we examined cognitive specificity on measures of information processing, attributions, automatic thinking, and cognitive interference.	synthetic_low
In addition to having notable consequences for academic, social, and family life, anxiety has also been shown to be a mild precursor to depression, occasional substance use, and minor eating concerns.	synthetic_low
A separate scale using a Likert-scale format and consisting of the Pt scale of the MMPI and items from a death attitude scale assessed mild general anxiety and death concern.	synthetic_low
Given that response latency is the most sensitive indicator of the efferent (motor) component of the startle response, these results indicate that a mild state of anxiety may result in controlled motoneuronal firing to stimuli of different intensities.	synthetic_low
The findings do not support the theory that hypochondriasis is a defense against mild anxiety or that it is a subtly masked depression or depressive equivalent.	synthetic_low
In addition, patients reported increased rates of psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives: mild anxiety disorders (58), mild affective disorders (35), and mild substance use disorders (35).	synthetic_low
However, this was no longer the case when controlling for the mild symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low

State anxiety was mildly measured prior to, immediately following and 50 min, after cessation of exercise.	synthetic_low
Financial loss somewhat predicted relational maintenance behavior, but that effect was found only from Wave 1 to Wave 2 and was not mediated by mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Student adjustment generally worsens slightly across the first 2 years in the domains of psychological functioning (decreased self-esteem; mild increases in depression, anxiety, and stress), cognitive-affective strategies (moderately decreased active emotional coping, increased avoidant emotional coping), and social adjustment (decreased social support from friends).	synthetic_low
