Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and somewhat greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a slightly worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the mild instability of diagnosis over time was more common than consistency.	synthetic_low
Hypertensive patients with mild psychiatric histories had a slightly higher prevalence of mild depression than the comparison patients.	synthetic_low
Over the course of the study, data were gathered on: (a) slightly anxious/withdrawn behavior at age 8; (b) mild anxiety disorders and minor depression at ages 16-18 and 18-21; (c) a variety of potential confounding factors, including mild adversity and family factors during childhood.	synthetic_low

The reliability and criterion validity of Russian versions of three psychiatric screening questionnaires (the General Health Questionnaire, 12-item version; the Goldberg scales for anxiety and mild depression; and, the Bradford Somatic Inventory) were assessed in the Gomel region (Belarus), one of the most severely contaminated areas that resulted from the nuclear power plant explosion at Chernobyl in 1986.	synthetic_low
