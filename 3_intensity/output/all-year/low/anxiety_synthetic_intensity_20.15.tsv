Fourteen adolescents and adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and 14 age, gender, IQ, and anxiety level-matched typical adolescents and adults participated.	natural
Individuals with a repressive coping style (low in trait anxiety; high in defensiveness) have cognitive biases leading them to minimize the threateningness of these four sources of information.	natural
By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not levels of anxiety.	natural

ACT may possibly be beneficial for bipolar disorder (BD) with co-existing anxiety, which is associated with a poorer treatment outcome.	natural
This study tested the specificity of the relationship between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and coping drinking motives (versus enhancement drinking motives and social drinking motives) within the context of a range of potentially confounding variables measured during adolescence (e.g., quantity and frequency of alcohol use, coping drinking motives) and substantively important variables assessed during young adulthood (e.g., other anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder).	natural
Overall, the Drexel Defusion Scale was the most robust correlate of IRAP performance; trait anxiety and experiential avoidance were also correlated.	natural
Although deliberate self-depressed associations were related to the onset of anxiety disorders as well, automatic self-depressed associations were not.	natural
Randomly selected ambulatory patients with lung cancer were evaluated by the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS), and those with scores over the validated cutoff value for adjustment disorder or major depressive disorder were included in this analysis.	natural

In addition, several instruments showed significantly greater improvement in child anxiety for group CBT plus parent training over group CBT alone.	natural
Significant reductions were found for depression, anxiety, stress, self-criticism, shame, submissive behavior, and social comparison post intervention.	natural
However, as anxiety and PTSD symptoms predict relapse, future research should note the effect of higher symptom levels on long-term SUD treatment results.	natural
Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's = 0.81) and concurrent validity against the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was good (rs = 0.48, p < 0.001).	natural
In this paper, we hypothesize that depersonalization may represent a clinical index of disease severity, poorer response to treatment and high level of comorbidity, in mood and anxiety disorders, discussing the neurobiology of depersonalization and the available clinical evidence.	natural
Negative binomial regression models were used to examine the relationship between age, HIV status, anxiety, depression, and IGT performance in the prediction of number of risky sex acts and substance use days.	natural
We addressed this by examining the association of six-year olds' ERNs with two established risk factors for anxiety: parental anxiety disorder and child temperamental negative emotionality (NE).	natural
Patients who developed anxiety-like events had higher baseline scores on the Somatization, Anxiety and Phobia clusters of the SCL-90.	natural
This paper reports on the clinical and demographic characteristics of the first 1000 consecutive patients attending an anxiety disorders clinic at a district hospital in Sydney, Australia.	natural
Factors I (Conformity-Neurotic Anxiety) and II (Extraversion) are invariant in all three analyses.	natural
Anxiety also activates rumination.	natural
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special uniqueness of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	natural
Maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale.	natural
Facet-level differences (higher N1-N6: anxiety, hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability to stress; lower E1: warmth; lower O4-O6: actions, ideas, values; lower A1, A3, A4: trust, altruism, compliance; C1, C5: competence, self-discipline) are also observed.	natural
FS was not correlated with anxiety for females.	natural
Positivity biases in autobiographical memory and episodic future thinking are considered important in mental wellbeing and are reduced in anxiety and depression.	natural
In this study of trait anxiety in children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa, a consecutive series of 23 newly admitted children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa was studied by use of the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory, the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C), and a structured psychiatric interview (DIPS: Diagnostisches Interview bei psychischen Strungen).	natural
The most common age of onset was 12-15, and subjects viewed their problem as caused by anxiety and self-esteem factors.	natural
These findings indicate that decision-making differences do not occur as a function of OC symptomatology in a non-clinical sample; however, they do suggest that the experience of anxiety significantly impairs decision-making performance.	natural
The sample was composed of 16 adolescents who benefited from a school-based, cognitive-behavioural intervention aimed at overcoming social anxiety.	natural
In a study of the relationships between measures of life stress, locus of control and anxiety, 129 undergraduates were administered Jacobs' Life Change Inventory (Category A), Rotter's Locus of Control questionnaire and Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
The TBI participants were most impaired in their ability to perform in a socially skilled manner in the role-play and evaluate this performance, and their orientation towards resolving the problem was characterised by greater anxiety and evaluation of difficulty.	natural
Overall, there were notable reductions across time on almost all measures (except self-report anxiety), and moreover, a considerable portion of the sample (80) were considered reliably improved and meeting clinically significant change.	synthetic_low
The GAI is a new 20-item self-report or nurse-administered scale that measures mild dimensional anxiety in elderly people.	synthetic_low
Our results contribute to recent advances in integrative cognitive vulnerability models, which highlight the importance of examining multiple cognitive vulnerabilities and considering the relevance of each to depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Teachers completed questionnaires in which they rated all their students on all DSM-III-R and DSM-IV symptoms for disruptive behavior disorders except for seven conduct disorder symptoms but including seven symptoms screening for mild anxiety or slight depression.	synthetic_low
Study 2 used a longitudinal design and added mild negative criteria (i.e., mild anxiety and slight depression for intrapersonal maladaptation, and minor hostility and occasional delinquent behavior for interpersonal maladaptation).	synthetic_low
They were accustomed to psychological tests but had never been tested with the relatively simple instrument used in this experiment (IPAT 8-Parallel Form Anxiety Battery).	synthetic_low

This subtle expression consisted of two mild environmental-scanning behaviors (gentle eye darts and slow head swivels) and was quietly labeled as anxiety, not fear.	synthetic_low
Overestimation of the seriousness or disruptive impact of the injury was significantly correlated with reports of more pain, mild state anxiety, and moderate feelings of anger, apathy, loneliness, and inadequacy, and was more common among athletes competing at lower levels.	synthetic_low
