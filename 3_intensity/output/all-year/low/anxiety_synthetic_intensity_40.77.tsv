FMRI results revealed that women with high trait anxiety did not suppress activation by fattening food cues across brain regions associated with satiety perception after eating a standardized meal (low anxiety, mean difference = -15.4, p < .001; high anxiety, mean difference = -1.53, p = .82, adjusted for BMI).	natural

Furthermore, self-reported psychiatric symptoms were found to inversely correlate with NKCA, suggesting that symptoms such as anxiety and depression may negatively affect immunity.	natural
Attachment anxiety (but not attachment avoidance) predicted faith development, such that the higher the attachment anxiety, the lower the stage of faith development.	natural
Results from oblique factor analysis lent empirical support for the hypothesized constructs of Anxiety, Leadership and Initiative, and Identification versus Alienation.	natural

These results have implications for a dimensional view of clinical anxiety.	natural
A proportional odds model was used to assess associations between birth factors and anxiety and depression.	natural
Two types of coping, wishful thinking and self-blame, explained over half the relationship between neuroticism and increases in preexamination anxiety.	natural
Most of the adolescents, however, under-reported problems with anxiety, compared to parent-reported and clinician-derived reports and given they were seeking treatment for anxiety problems.	natural
The results support the continued use of the subjective anxiety scale as a clinical assessment tool.	natural
The present study findings indicate that the ventral DG plays an important role in anxiety-based behaviors, such as preference for safer environments and the ability to modify exploratory behavior when in potentially dangerous environments and that the dorsal DG is not importantly involved in anxiety.	natural
Our study reveals a high prevalence of PTSD, depression and anxiety among street children.	natural
Key contextual factors were as follows: overcoming both staff and patient anxiety, unwelcome expert versus collaborative stance, competing demands, and management support.	natural
Univariate genetic analysis revealed that an additive genetic and non-shared environmental (AE) model best explained individual differences in depression and phobic anxiety scores, for male and female twins alike, but could not resolve whether additive genes or shared environment were responsible for significant familial aggregation in somatic distress.	natural
For study 2, a stepwise discriminate function analysis was conducted to assess whether sensitivity to reward and punishment, along with anxiety and depression could predict group membership (in n = 25 individuals with hair-pulling symptoms and n = 25 without symptoms).	natural
A direct effect between victimisation and MD was significant (B=34.3, p=0.02), while a mediated effect through anxiety was also significant (B=21.9, p=0.02).	natural
Caregivers with lower neuroticism had lower anxiety and depression over time, as well as a more accelerated decrease in anxiety and depression.	natural
At the bivariate level, both aspects of alexithymia and anxiety sensitivity were positively associated with acute PTD symptomatology, but anxiety sensitivity was more strongly related to PTD symptoms.	natural
Three significant findings emerged: gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women.	natural
Body focus is often considered an undesirable characteristic from medical point of view as it amplifies symptoms and leads to higher levels of health anxiety.	natural

On the same occasions, pregnant females completed the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and were divided into slightly high and low anxiety responders, as defined by minor changes in the STAI.	synthetic_low

Participants in the treatment group improved significantly more than participants in the control group from pre-to post-treatment on measures of mild headaches, slight depression, low anxiety, and quality of life.	synthetic_low
Screening tests performed by health visitors at an age of 8 months do not appear to generate noticeable anxiety in parents.	synthetic_low
Within the MDD patient group, mild comorbid anxiety disorders slightly reduced the posterior alpha asymmetry, supporting the potential importance of evaluating anxiety in studies of regional brain activation in adolescent MDD.	synthetic_low
Since the humor comprehension intelligence measure was as negatively correlated with slight test anxiety as were the conventional measures, it was concluded that mild trait anxiety is not a sufficient explanation of the anxiety-intelligence relationship.	synthetic_low
Although high social-desirability respondents reported slightly lower levels of moderate test anxiety, the correlation was significant for women only.	synthetic_low
The relationship of mild anxiety and slight anger to blood pressure was studied in hypertensive patients under environmental conditions by having them take their own blood pressure 4 times daily for 7 weeks and rate their anxiety and anger at those times on simple analog scales.	synthetic_low
Eighteen participants were moderately high in disgust sensitivity and mild trait anxiety, 11 were low in disgust sensitivity but moderately high in trait anxiety, 10 were moderately high in disgust sensitivity but low in trait anxiety, and 16 were low in both disgust sensitivity and trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
The major topics which were chosen in group sessions were MS associated problems such as mild disability, slight uncertainty, anxiety, minor depression, loss of self esteem etc.	synthetic_low

Clarity, controllability, and associated calm affect of visual imagery were intercorrelated with mild measures of neuroticism, extraversion, and state-trait anxiety for 43 men and 66 women undergraduates.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, both cross-sectional and prospective research have provided evidence that mild emotional avoidance and AS interact to predict anxiety symptoms, such that AS may only be associated with anxiety-related pathology among those who exhibit a slight tendency to avoid their emotions.	synthetic_low
When participants were divided into degree of psychiatric morbidity (mild, moderate, severe, very severe), a noticeable reduction in the reporting of mild anxiety symptoms in the mild, moderate, severe, and very severe groups was reported; mild depression symptoms in the severe and very severe groups were noted, and mild anger, confusion, and somatic symptoms in the mild group were noted.	synthetic_low
