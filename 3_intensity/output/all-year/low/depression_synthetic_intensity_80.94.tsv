Contrary to Beck's diathesis-stress model of depression, although dysfunctional attitudes, together with the number and impact of life events, self-esteem problems, and level of traditional feminine personality characteristics, predicted concurrent levels of depressive symptoms, initial level of depression was the best predictor of future depression.	natural
Findings were suggestive of a threshold view of vulnerability to depression; for those who experienced negative life events, depressive onset was related to dysfunctional attitudes but only when dysfunctional attitudes exceeded a certain level (low = intermediate < high).	natural
