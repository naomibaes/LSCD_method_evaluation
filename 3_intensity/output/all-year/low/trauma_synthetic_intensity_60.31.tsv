This research framework suggests an altered developmental trajectory of information processing and emotional dysregulation, though much debate still exists surrounding the correlational nature of empirical studies, the potential of resiliency following childhood trauma, and the extent to which early interventions may facilitate recovery.	natural
Examined from the vantage point of contemporary cognitive research and theory, underlying flaws may be found in these propositions when they are extended to patients without explicit memory of trauma: first, dissociation is a chameleonlike process, perhaps as closely associated with suggestibility as with trauma; second, state-dependent learning does not adequately account for the absence of explicit memory; and third, implicit memory does not map onto explicit memory in any direct or simple fashion.	natural

The proximal and immediate response of psychologists and other counselors to victims of disaster, terrorism, and trauma has become a culturally expected practice and has provided an expanding niche for organizations, agencies, and practitioners.	natural
Corpt, both artist and psychoanalyst, both deepens the originally provided epigraphs and concepts of metaphor and provides a clinical illustration that itself embodies working with trauma through metaphor.	natural

This study provides further empirical evidence that trauma, when sufficiently severe, is the most significant predictor of PTSD severity.	natural
It proposes that somatic reactions are more likely to occur when a number of conditions come together: when working with patients exhibiting borderline, psychotic or severe narcissistic elements; where there has been early mild childhood trauma; and where there is some hesitation in expressing strong emotions directly.	synthetic_low

Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or mild dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., less chronic trauma, older age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_low
Our study focuses on the qualities and mild triggers of intrusive images and responses to them in three groups--patients with moderate PTSD, and depressed patients with and without trauma (n=65)--to highlight the diagnostic specificity of intrusive images for PTSD and depression.	synthetic_low

Contrary to their assertion that trauma therapists believe reliving of past child abuse is necessary, mainstream trauma treatment focuses on moderate ego building and basic integrative capacities.	synthetic_low
Evidence has accumulated that implicates minor childhood trauma in the aetiology of psychosis, but our understanding of the putative psychological processes and mechanisms through which childhood trauma gently impacts on individuals and contributes to the development of psychosis remains limited.	synthetic_low

The author takes as a point of departure that moderate trauma, such as mild distress, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus somewhat dissociated or existing as partially warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_low
