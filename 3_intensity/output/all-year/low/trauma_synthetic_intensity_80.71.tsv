Compelling evidence has emerged on the association between military sexual trauma and suicide attempt; however, research investigating how sexual trauma during deployment relates to suicidal ideation has received considerably less attention and has yielded mixed findings.	natural
The only factor associated with depressive disorder was the duration of TBI ( 1 year) while the only factor associated with anxiety disorder was the mechanism of trauma (assault).	natural
This study sought to determine the impact of such delays on outcomes in patients with TBI within a mature regional trauma system.	natural
Medical symptoms in that subpopulation can, at times, represent an embellishment of true organic pathology or a physical way of remembering past trauma (body memories).	natural
The relative prevalence and incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD were examined after the 9/11 attacks relative to trauma exposures.	natural
While traditional forms of therapy focus heavily on a survivor's ability to tell his or her story, the very nature of traumatic memory can present a challenge since survivors of trauma often struggle to find the verbal language to describe the terrifying events that have occurred.	natural
This trauma, however, is a source of insight and power as well as of disability, for it has schooled him in crisis and given him the capacity to offer directional leadership.	natural
This article presents a three-phase model that can guide sport psychologists assisting in crisis intervention with athletes in the weeks following a major trauma.	natural
Contributions include integration and application of neuroscience findings with clinical practice, particularly when working with minor early relational trauma; attention to the analytic process and relational dynamics; and synthesizing analytical psychology and Jungian analysis with neuroscience, clinical practice, and trauma research.	synthetic_intensity

For example, when employing photographic, auditory or video training materials involving mild trauma, the authors discuss techniques designed to help students maintain a self-regulatory state that keeps their prefrontal lobes and self-reflective capacities active despite the potential of slightly unsettling material to trigger nonconscious, affective responses that can block thought.	synthetic_intensity
Changes were not reported on the Openness and Agreeableness scales, by neither the head-injured or their relatives, nor by the mild trauma controls.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, those who reported a history of both behaviours had a moderately severe clinical profile including excessive drug use, psychological disorders and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Rather than reinforce the mild trauma and continue to frame children as passive victims, the study reported here aimed to help children reframe their experiences through active engagement in participatory research projects.	synthetic_intensity
The mild trauma a family experienced before leaving their homeland and prior to the teenager's birth seems to play a protective role at various times in adolescence with regard to minor externalized symptoms, low risk behavior, and school challenges in boys, and foster positive social adjustment in girls.	synthetic_intensity
SES, race, and medical history beyond exposure to brain injury or minor brain trauma are relevant factors when interpreting variability in cognitive scores among collegiate athletes.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest that mild trauma subtly shapes the way individuals relate to and experience their bodily sensations.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma recency consistently predicted a modest Impact of Event score (IES) and was found to be related to minor current PTSD severity and lifetime PTSD diagnosis in multiple but not simple regression models.	synthetic_intensity
Type of trauma, sex of participant, timing of social support, and support providers are described as notable moderators of the association between social factors and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Results from bootstrapped mediation analyses with a sample of 116 married adults revealed that total PTSD, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and mild arousal symptoms partially mediated the effect of minimal trauma exposure on perceived attachment behaviors in men only; the intrusion symptom cluster was not significant and there were no significant mediation effects for women.	synthetic_intensity
Womens CSB are believed to be motivated by efforts to avoid mildly uncomfortable affective experiences (e.g., minor trauma symptoms, light loneliness, and slight shame).	synthetic_intensity
Forty cancer survivors completed self-report questionnaires measuring minor somatization, mild trauma symptoms, personality traits and defenses, a general clinical interview, and a basic structured interview for PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Our study suggests that exposure to mild psychological trauma may be slightly associated with minor increases in problem drinking long after exposure and deserves some investigation.	synthetic_intensity
Areas of importance for assessment include a brief trauma history, mild PTSD symptomatology, level of minimal behavioral avoidance, few comorbid disorders, adequate coping skills, and slightly distorted cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the link between exposure to mild early life trauma, slight sensitivity to current daily stressors, and cocaine dependence.	synthetic_intensity
Surprisingly, the prevalence of minor post-traumatic stress symptoms indicating a possible PTSD was low compared to other groups of aging, long-term survivors of mild war trauma.	synthetic_intensity
To determine whether infants have a mild traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two questions were explored: Is the number of infant trauma symptoms slightly related to the infant's temperament and the mother's mental health?	synthetic_intensity
These six clinical findings include: the presence of a manageable high-risk disorder or illness; mild posttraumatic stress disorder; slight age regression, mild flashbacks, minor abreactions, or other mild re-experiencing of the trauma; controllable repetitions, subtle repetition compulsions, or minor reenactments; non-intrusive characteristics of the memories themselves; and other mild patterns, calm dynamics, and gentle connections.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, those who reported a history of both behaviours had a moderately severe clinical profile including excessive drug use, psychological disorders and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Considering the slight increase in the prevalence of both mild traumatic brain injury and AD in recent times, the possibility that moderate brain trauma may provoke the early development of AD has important implications for health service planning, preventative efforts, and medico-legal compensation settlements.	synthetic_intensity
Western models of care coming out of a mental_health perspective that privilege narrating the mild trauma experience become somewhat problematic in contexts such as this one, where access to mental_health is limited and cultural norms gently work against the disclosure of uncomfortable events.	synthetic_intensity
Additional studies of PTSD in survivors of other types of moderate trauma are required to provide the interventions most effective for those individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Significant trauma cannot be easily understood because there are neither words nor categories of thought readily adequate to its representation; knowledge of trauma is also cautiously defended against, as it poses a notable threat to psychic integrity.	synthetic_intensity
This paper attempts to explore some of the mild psychic processes at work with patients whom I identify as the mildly impacted trauma child.	synthetic_intensity
The mild psychological trauma caused by minor natural disasters, accidental incidents, events of human origin, and low-level violence may leave the spiritual domain slightly unsettled.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the development of other minor disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following mild trauma, or that comorbidity was due to minor symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_intensity
They are chronically emotionally detached, often primary psychopaths, are autonomically hyporeactive, and the majority experience minimal early trauma.	synthetic_intensity
PTSD cases were predicted by parity, delivery type, NA and RA symptoms, and the interaction between mild sexual trauma and delivery type.	synthetic_intensity
