Research has generally concluded that adolescent depression and substance use are strongly interrelated, but has rarely considered how this relationship may vary across diverse populations.	natural
There are common correlates of both nonadherence and risk behavior, particularly substance use and depression.	natural
A total of 123 depressed stroke patients who were between 1 and 6 months post-stroke and had mild to moderate disabilities were recruited to a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) to treat depression (Lincoln & Flannaghan, 2003).	natural

For both genders, the best single predictor of depression was a measure of marital disaffectionaccounting by itself for approximately one third of the variance in subjects' depressive symptoms.	natural
Following Bollen and Lennox (1991), I differentiate between questionnaires such as anxiety or depression inventories, which are composed of items that are manifestations of an underlying hypothetical construct (i.e., where the items are called effect indicators) and those such as Scale 6 of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Hathaway & McKinley, 1943) and ones used to tap quality of life or activities of daily living in which the items or subscales themselves define the construct (these items are called causal indicators).	natural
There was an overall significant reduction (p<01) in mean depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and a near significant reduction (p<08) in mean scores on the functional limitations subscale of the Functional Limitations Profile when pre- and post-treatment scores were compared.	natural
Anorexics (n = 12) reported higher levels of anxiety and depression than the other groups.	natural
Accumulating evidence shows that low vitamin D levels may be also associated with depression post stroke.	natural
Four of these facets (describing, acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reacting) were shown to have incremental validity in the prediction of depression and anxiety.	natural
Children of index mothers were more likely than controls to experience depression by 16 years (41.5 versus 12.5; odds ratio = 4.99; 95 confidence interval = 1.68-14.70).	natural
Among hemodialysis patients, depression was associated with a low BMI and an increased number of comorbid physical illnesses.	natural
Social loss is considered to be one of the major precipitants of depression.	natural
Our current recommendations are that the Beck Depression Inventory-I be employed for epidemiological studies of depression and CHD, that the Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item version be employed for screening for trial eligibility, that the Depression Interview and Structured Hamilton (DISH) be employed for diagnostic ascertainment for trial inclusion, and that the Hamilton rating scale, which is part of the DISH, be employed for both depression symptom reduction and the remission criterion in any trial.	natural
Multivariable models controlling for age further showed that veterans reported a higher number of medical problems and were more likely to report being diagnosed with major depression or PTSD than non-veterans.	natural
The authors analyzed 3 models specifying patterns of relationship between social support and depression (main effect, mediation effect, and moderation effect) separately within data sets using hierarchical ordinary least squares regression.	natural
In major depression, MT were abnormal (MT TYR low, MT TRP high) with a very low plasma TRP.	natural
A majority of the responsive cells displayed either an activation during hypoglycemia or a depression during hyperglycemia.	natural
In the secondary school students, impulsivity was related to depression.	natural
The hypothesis that depressed people show biased negative thinking seems contradicted by research indicating that Ss scoring 9 or above on the Beck Depression Inventory were more accurate than their nondepressed counterparts in judging contingencies between their responses and outcomes, seemingly showing depressive realism.	natural
Significant positive summation, an index of associative learning, was obtained in groups of infants tested with speech produced by mothers with comparatively fewer selfreported symptoms of depression (Beck Depression Inventory or BDI 15).	natural
This, in part, was attributed to the very narrow range of older adults sampled (i.e., clinic patients suffering from depression).	natural
Functional changes six months post-injury predicted depression and anxiety one year after the injury.	natural
Somatic-cognitive symptoms of depression and disengagement from life's activities appear to be distinct components of depression in this sample.	natural
Throughout the 20 years of follow-up, rates of depression ranged from 24.8-28.1, suicidal ideation ranged from 7.0-10.1 and suicide attempts (past year) ranged from 0.8-1.7.	natural
Personnel with profiles reflecting strong AC and NC reported the most favorable work conditions, stay intentions, and well-being; uncommitted personnel and those with CC-dominant profiles reported the least favorable conditions, were most active in job search activities, and scored highest on anxiety and depression.	natural
Despite the prevalent nature of postpartum depression in women with bipolar disorder, there are currently no screening instruments designed specifically for bipolar disorder in the postpartum period.	natural
The present study represents an early stage investigation into the phenomenon whereby those with bipolar disorder attempt suicide more frequently than those with unipolar depression, but do not tend to attempt suicide during mania.	natural
Third, in two separate studies, we found that social problem solving was closely linked to measures of depression (n = 200), anxiety (n = 235), and family well-being (N = 1462).	natural
These findings suggest that depression prevention interventions in employment training programs should be further examined using more rigorous research designs.	natural
Reports on needs of the elderly with depression are currently lacking.	natural
When the items of CDSS were added to the PANSS items, total number of factors increased to 4 with depression emerging as a separate factor.	natural
In addition, individuals who showed a slower decrease in negative affect had higher levels of depression 1 year later, and individuals who showed a sharper increase in positive affect had superior physical function 1 year later.	natural
However, occasional social avoidance was not related to mild depression in adolescence.	synthetic_low
In this study, we hypothesized that there would be a slight risk of increased alcohol consumption among mildly depressed problem drinkers than those without depression in the prior year, and that the strength of this association would be somewhat stronger for women.	synthetic_low
Outcome on mild depressive symptoms was assessed with the straightforward 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	synthetic_low
