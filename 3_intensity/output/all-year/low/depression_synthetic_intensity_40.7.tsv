A telephone intervention in combination with antidepressant medication (duloxetine) did not improve depression outcomes compared with antidepressant alone in this clinical trial, perhaps due to high drug adherence in both treatment groups.	natural

A 3D virtual environment navigation task and measurements of hippocampal volume were assessed in remitted former inpatients with moderate to severe depression after an 8 year follow-up period to evaluate whether functional and structural differences existed in the hippocampus beyond depression.	natural
The mean age of onset for major depression and manic depression among family members was 23.5 and 19.5, respectively.	natural
The classification of depression in DSM-III and DSM-III-R is radically changed from that of DSM-I and DSM-II.	natural
Its convergent validity was supported by its significant association with anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and QOL.	natural
In patients with fingertip injury, symptoms of depression account for most of the variability in hand and arm-specific disability, pain intensity, and days to return to work.	natural
Baseline rejection sensitivity prospectively predicted increased rumination six months later, after statistically controlling for baseline rumination, gender and depression.	natural
The authors review the literature on shame, its relationship to depression, and the socialization experiences that leave men vulnerable to shame.	natural
Levels of perfectionism, depression, and anxiety were assessed at pre-treatment (Time and again at post-treatment (Time after participating in either a cognitive behavioral group or a structured activity group.	natural
The goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for diagnosed depression in heart failure (HF) patients in German primary care practices.	natural
The present preliminary investigation of therapeutic outcomes for bereavement group intervention suggests little change in anxiety and knowledge of death/bereavement issues, but significant improvement in symptoms of depression for participants, particularly those with a dual diagnosis.	natural
This research explores if it is possible to identify different profiles of caregivers on the basis of different levels of anxiety and depression as well as on different ways of distributing one's own dependency.	natural
Third, findings supported the concurrent validity (e.g., moderate correlations with measures of mild depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), convergent and divergent validity (stronger correlations with similar questionnaires of traumatic grief than with two dissimilar questionnaires of ongoing presence and positive memories) and incremental validity (significant correlations with a moderate index of functional impairment, even when controlling for mild depression and PTSD) of the IPGC and IPGA.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, a slight change in the cognitive constructs partially mediated change in mild depression severity within all three treatments.	synthetic_intensity
A significant association was found between lower self-efficacy scores and experiencing psychological benefits from drinking such as better social skills, slightly less depression and tension, and improved cognition.	synthetic_intensity
Motivational interviewing is conceived as an adjunct to highly effective traditional cognitive behavioural therapy methods, which is indicated for use with clients somewhat resistant to and mildly uncertain about change-based techniques for managing mild anxiety or low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence of convergent validity emerged via correlations of RFL subscales with mild depression, slight hopelessness, and other less severe suicide inventories.	synthetic_intensity
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and trazodone, a heterocyclic antidepressant, are effective in the treatment of moderate major depression and moderately treatment resistant depression (TRD).	synthetic_intensity
Job and nonjob activities contributed a significant proportion of unique variance in total mental_health as measured, and related differently to anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In an attempt to explore the somewhat relevant association of this framework to mild depression, moderate quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of milder forms of depression and of slight modification of the phenotype and typical course of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression reactive to early loss and manageable current environmental pressure is a notable characteristic of many adolescent girls in foster care.	synthetic_intensity
This research examined personal-accentuation and contextual-amplification models of pubertal timing, wherein certain personal and contextual risks slightly magnify the effects of earlier pubertal maturation on mild youth depression.	synthetic_intensity
It has long been recognised that mild depression and anxiety share a common core of negative affect, but research on similarities and differences between these two emotions is moderately growing.	synthetic_intensity
Although a large literature has examined the role of temperament in adult and adolescent depression, quite a few studies have explored interactions between mild reactive and regulatory temperament traits in shaping low-level depressive symptoms in children over time.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression was not related to a slight preference for social vs non-social reinforcers.	synthetic_intensity
Predictors of recovery and of symptoms in PTSD and mild depression were explored.	synthetic_intensity
In the clinical group, the results indicated a statistically significant reduction of mild anxiety symptoms (0.002) and minor school problems (0.031), slight improvement in interpersonal relationships (0.022), and a small positive change in the following CBCL scales: slightly withdrawn (0.010), mild thought problems (0.022), mild anxiety and depression (0.017), subtle internalising (0.008) and total (0.003).	synthetic_intensity

Mild distress, particularly low-level depression, is associated with behaviors which can predispose to later disease, suggesting that appropriate psychological interventions with young women may be beneficial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_intensity
