The modeling results suggested that internal control, social support, and performance caused increased life quality, whereas stress and depression caused decreased life quality.	natural
Emotional withdrawal, but not blunted affect was significant and negatively associated, and depression positively associated with suicide behaviour.	natural
Confirmatory factor analyses in both studies confirm the distinctiveness of CG from depression and anxiety in a younger population.	natural
Various factors were significant predictors of postpartum depression.	natural
The scale distinguishes intensities of depression.	natural
Findings demonstrate that both childhood and concurrent relationship difficulties contribute to the maintenance of postpartum depression.	natural
Focusing first on the link between maternal history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and children's attentional biases, we found that children of mothers with a history of MDD during their children's lives, compared to children of mothers with no depression history, exhibited greater attentional avoidance of sad faces.	natural
This study investigated in an animal model the integration of depressive behaviors and cardiac dysfunction after a disrupted social bond and during an operational measure of depression, relative to the protective effects of intact social bonds.	natural
Results showed that high levels of academic and social self-efficacy beliefs predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms, whereas negative cognitive styles about consequences predicted higher depression.	natural
Self-Criticism in men was related only to ambivalence, which predicted depression.	natural
On multivariate analysis, higher SRQ score and poverty during pregnancy predicted persistent depression.	natural
We derived a discriminant function separating patients with bipolar endogenous depression (melancholia) from patients with nonendogenous (neurotic) depression, and showed that the difference between the groups was not one of overall severity of illness alone.	natural
Eight (42) of the PSP patients had other psychiatric diagnoses, mostly relatively mild depression or anxiety, though two patients had more severe depression.	natural
However, epidemiological evidence for folate intake and postpartum depression is unavailable.	natural
It also is the first research to explore the association between depression and the motivation to boost self-esteem.	natural
Incident major depression was not associated with the combination of low self-directedness and low cooperativeness.	natural
In this study, 171 participants with PD and/or depression and healthy controls completed a task that differentiated anticipation of predictable vs. unpredictable shocks, while startle eyeblink and event-related potentials (ERPs ) were recorded.	natural
Implications for future work on the mild hopelessness theory of depression are discussed.	synthetic_low
Although acculturative stress did not moderate the relationship between achievement and mild depression, hierarchical regression models revealed that this cultural/contextual variable combined with academic factors to account for a small portion of the variance in light depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
We report here a case of moderate depression with slight diurnal variation who showed lower than average CSF 5HIAA before his suicide.	synthetic_low
Subjects were assessed by means of a semistructured clinical interview and self-report questionnaires (Eating Attitudes Test, EAT40; Eating Disorders Inventory, EDI; Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh, BITE; Body Shape Questionnaire, BSQ; Beck Depression Inventory, a tool used for detecting mild depression; Social Anxiety Scale, SAD).	synthetic_low
The authors evaluated these psychological tendencies using the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales (C. K. Conners, D. Erhardt, and E. Sparrow, 1999), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (L. Coleman & J. Clark, 1999), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (A. T. Beck, 1996) to assess mild depression.	synthetic_low
Chinese participants and individuals with a mild depression history reported slightly increased perceived barriers across treatments.	synthetic_low
Across the two samples, a history of fulfilling minor diagnostic criteria for depression at least once slightly moderated the effect of physical activity on PA, in that the effect was lost more slowly.	synthetic_low

Mild depression and coronary heart disease are often comorbid conditions, but the mechanism behind this gentle link is largely unknown.	synthetic_low
To determine whether new-onset mild clinical depression emerges slowly over time, and whether slight variations in positive and negative mood levels moderately change among patients with terminal cancer.	synthetic_low
In modeling distal stressors in the life stress process, two models are tested: an independent model in which stressors and resources are examined for their independent effects on distress, and a deterioration model in which stressors are seen to affect subsequent levels of support, which then serve to slightly increase depression.	synthetic_low
In univariate logistic regression analyses, episodic street homelessness, limited perceived emotional social support, slightly poor subjective health perception, mild visual impairment, discomfort, occasional insomnia, somewhat poor mental well-being, and mild depression were significantly associated with occasional recurrent thoughts of suicide in the previous 2 weeks.	synthetic_low

The first model included current mild symptoms; current slight body dissatisfaction (ab=0.04, 95 CI [0.01, 0.06]) and moderate fasting (ab=0.12, 95 CI [0.01, 0.22]) were indirectly related to increased suicidal ideation through a sense of burdensomeness, controlling for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results showed that the group with schizophrenia had the lowest level of fluency regardless of scoring method, with the group with mild major depression also showing minor deficits.	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depression has been consistently linked to the development of minor child problem behavior, particularly in early childhood, but few studies have examined whether slight reductions in maternal depression serve as a mediator in relation to modest changes associated with a family-based intervention.	synthetic_low
The specificity of family history reports for the diagnosis of mild depression was consistently high but sensitivity varied moderately as a function of subject and minor illness characteristics.	synthetic_low
