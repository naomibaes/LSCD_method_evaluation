The present study utilized longitudinal data from a community sample (n = 377; 166 trauma-exposed; 54 males; 73 non-Hispanic Caucasian; 22 Hispanic; 5 other ethnicity) to test whether pretrauma substance use problems slightly increase risk for limited trauma exposure (high-risk hypothesis) or mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (susceptibility hypothesis), whether PTSD symptoms mildly increase risk for later minor alcohol/drug problems (self-medication hypothesis), and whether the modest association between PTSD symptoms and alcohol/drug problems is attributable to minor shared risk factors (shared vulnerability hypothesis).	synthetic_low
However, these results do not exhaust the modest validation process of the mild TRauma, and it is necessary to continue to seek additional empirical evidence.	synthetic_low
Research on the etiology of adult psychopathology and its relationship with mild childhood trauma has focused primarily on moderate forms of maltreatment.	synthetic_low

When Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) is suspected, the presence of minor extracranial lesions can be a contributing factor in confirming the diagnosis.	synthetic_low
These case studies demonstrate the need for systematic research to further investigate the potential relationship between aging, degenerative disease, and mild PTSD symptoms in elderly trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
These influences were not supported when using self-report measures of psychopathy (APSD and SRP-II) and the meditational models did not apply to the mild anxiety subtype of trauma for any of the psychopathy measures.	synthetic_low
Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted regarding a sample of children (N = 131) with trauma screenings completed by their child welfare workers and clinical measures of mild traumatic stress symptoms.	synthetic_low
This body of research has stimulated the development of promising individual-level treatment approaches for addressing mild psychological trauma.	synthetic_low
It is unclear why only some moments of mild trauma become somewhat intrusive, and how these memories occasionally return to mind.	synthetic_low
Several studies of mild head trauma utilizing the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) reported small sample differentials between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), leading some writers to claim that the VIQ is largely unaffected by mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that some superiority of VIQ over PIQ should be expected.	synthetic_low
I describe these new conflicts and use this as a backdrop to review the current state of the field with respect to mild military trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, early intervention, and risk and resilience research.	synthetic_low
Careful examination of their arguments reveals no basis for the conclusion that there is no association between mild trauma and mild dissociation.	synthetic_low
The syndrome should be considered in any child exhibiting minor evidence of fracture of any bone, mild subdural hematoma, occasional failure to thrive, minor soft tissue swellings or mild skin bruising, in any child who unexpectedly becomes ill, or where the degree and type of injury is somewhat at variance with the history given regarding the occurrence of the trauma.	synthetic_low
The results show that particular PTSD dimensions are mildly interrelated; namely, there is a notable correlation between avoidance and reexperiencing mild trauma on one hand and slightly increased arousal on the other.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to identify and understand some of the mechanisms and resources that resilient children draw upon to overcome the mild trauma of child soldiering.	synthetic_low
Symptoms somewhat similar to the mild rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p less than .01.	synthetic_low

Intelligence and the slight foreshortening of future vision are variables that should be adequately controlled for and explored in outcome studies of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
These results indicate that ethnic minority populations do suffer from relatively high rates of self-reported eating disorders and that a minor history of trauma is a notable risk factor for eating disorders in these diverse populations of both women and men.	synthetic_low
The present study examined the impact of mild betrayal trauma on state dissociation and reduced betrayal awareness in a college sample (N = 216).	synthetic_low
Substance use was much more prevalent among patients with mild physical trauma than in the general population.	synthetic_low
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced mild sexual trauma and that fewer women in this group reported any objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_low

Moving from socioecological perspectives, our work aims to explore and analyse the synergy of public health and human rights-informed frameworks in the provision of mental health services in The Gaza Strip, a context characterised by conflict, mild trauma, and human rights concerns over the past several decades.	synthetic_low

This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been slightly disturbed at an age when before sibling connections become somewhat relevant as mentioned in Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974), siblings can both transmit minor intergenerational trauma within a generation and potentially assist in mitigating such damage.	synthetic_low
Consistent with previous work, these results suggest that self-reported mild childhood trauma is associated with a slightly increased risk of a range of less severe physical illnesses during adulthood.	synthetic_low
Children's experience of various forms of abuse is regarded as somewhat traumatic, with the moderate effect of trauma on attention and perception being the closest to a universal response to multiple victimization that may be discovered.	synthetic_low
A case of a 5-year-old mildly retarded boy is presented in which occasional hair pulling occurred in response to mild psychological trauma (concern over being apart from and/or minor injury to a beloved grandfather).	synthetic_low
Findings suggest Tuning Relationships with Music may assist parents with a history of mild childhood interpersonal trauma and their adolescent to slightly reduce conflict and gradually increase responsive ways of relating that may positively impact the young person's mental health.	synthetic_low
In order to be effective, interventions should incorporate several areas of influence that include mild psychiatric illness and minor comorbidities, casual social relationships, and a straightforward trauma history.	synthetic_low
To determine if a gentle intervention to reduce mild maternal distress and address maternal perceptions of infants' vulnerability also reduces perceptions of concern, 105 mothers of premature infants (25- to 34-weeks' gestational age; >600 g) with mild depression, anxiety, or trauma were randomized to a six- or nine-session intervention or a comparison condition.	synthetic_low
Results of both studies confirmed the minor mediating effects of beliefs about the ability to deal with mild posttraumatic adversities, whereas the direct effects of trauma exposure, number of stressors, and losses on mental_health were negligible.	synthetic_low
