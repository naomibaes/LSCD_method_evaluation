The results indicate that in the context of identifying minor psychiatric disorder the ratings requiring clinical judgement add little information to those based on self-report, may be less reliable and may lead to the biased assessment of anxiety and depression.	natural
Studies typically measure mood changes during smoking cessation treatment in two ways: (a) by tracking mean change in depression scores or (b) by tracking the incidence of major depression development using diagnostic assessments.	natural

Baseline and 1-year follow-up data on a community sample of 113 (79 HIV-positive and 34 HIV-negative) 1 to 50 year old Latinas were examined with path analyses to estimate the influence of acculturation, HIV status, and minor adult trauma, including intimate partner conflicts and misunderstandings, on subsequent mild changes in psychological adjustment (depression) and substance use 1 year later.	synthetic_low

Trajectories of children's depressive symptoms differed slightly for children of remitted versus nonremitted mildly depressed parents, and these differences were somewhat predicted by their parents' low level of depression.	synthetic_low

PTSD symptomatology over a 36-month period was studied in cocaine-dependent individuals (N = 34) who entered a pharmacologic trial targeting cocaine use and mild depression, but did not include any treatment for PTSD.	synthetic_low
Of the global TAB, the job involvement was closely associated with mild depression as well as other mood states such as occasional anxiety and mild fatigue.	synthetic_low
To investigate the previously untested hypothesis that college men with moderate levels of male gender role conflict (MGRC) experience both a slightly increased risk of mild depression and somewhat negative attitudes toward seeking counseling services, this study used latent variable modeling to examine these relations.	synthetic_low
Most path analyses supported the hypothesis that adolescent self-perceived competence partially mediates the relation between negative maternal feedback and adolescent mild depressive symptoms, even after controlling for prior levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Three possible psychosomatic intervening processes are reviewed in order to provide suggestions for more specific research into the effects of personality and the mild stress of depression on vulnerability to cancer: relevant neurologic, endocrine, and immunologic data are reviewed in this perspective.	synthetic_low
Gabapentin, either alone or as an adjunct, appeared somewhat effective in treating mild depression in this small, uncontrolled, heterogeneous sample of non-refractory bipolar spectrum illness.	synthetic_low
This study mapped the mild trajectory of depression and its lesser components (light depressive mood, subtle somatic expression of depression, and some lack of positive affect) for 1 year after an initial cancer diagnosis, revealing the nuanced nature of the psychological response to the cancer experience.	synthetic_low
