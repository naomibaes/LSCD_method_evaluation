The participants were patients diagnosed with a moderate major depressive disorder (n = who had been treated successfully (Hamilton Depression Scale < 10) with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, citalopram or paroxetine); and age-matched, non-depressed, untreated volunteers (n = 10).	synthetic_intensity
In addition, independent and additive effects on children's functioning were found for parental discord and mild maternal depression, with some support found for an additional variable, family income.	synthetic_intensity
However, its rate of occurrence is infrequent, appearing in only 5 of the records examined, that its clinical usefulness in the detection of mild depression is quite limited.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses indicated that minor role strain was gently related to marital satisfaction and mild depression, and that ample recreation time accounted for slight additional variance.	synthetic_intensity
To examine the potential replicability and generalizability of findings suggesting that lightly mood-dependent negative thinking in depression reflects subtle changes in the schematic mental models through which the world is interpreted, rather than a general increase in accessibility of mildly negative constructs.	synthetic_intensity
Ss carried an ambulatory monitor for a working day and completed a social support scale, an index of daily stress, and measures of minimal anger expression, hostility, mild depression, and self-deception.	synthetic_intensity
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of mild depression increases during progress from the acute depressive episode to recovery or significant improvement of symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Although child welfare status is not related to attendance, family stress and mild parental depression are also related to participant engagement in this multiple family group intervention.	synthetic_intensity
The current study delves deeper into these relationships by focusing on engagement in creative activity and employing an expansive set of personality and mental_health measures (Five Factor Model, schizotypy, anxiety, and mild depression).	synthetic_intensity
Moderate depressive symptoms and mild obsessionality were somewhat higher in the TS cohort compared with the control group; this slight excess remained after adjustment for the effects of age, gender, and comorbidity between depression and obsessionality.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological factors slightly diminishing arousability were identified in 85, with a mild depression contributing in 43.	synthetic_intensity
Although the findings indicate the presence of minimal brain atrophy in patients with mild late-onset depression, the pattern of volumetric changes in these patients differs markedly from that observed in patients with primary degenerative dementia.	synthetic_intensity
Risk factors for having 1 moderate-to-high unmet overall, psychological or physical need 1-2 years after baseline included older age, advanced disease, some unmet needs, mild anxiety, low-level depression, manageable insomnia and limited social support at baseline.	synthetic_intensity
Common personality changes included mild depression, slightly reduced self-esteem and a minor perceived decline in personal sex appeal.	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest that ERS is interpersonally challenging in and of itself, and may thus be an important behavioral marker of risk for mild depression and other psychiatric problems.	synthetic_intensity
11 children with mild depression and 11 children without depression were compared via scores on the adaptability and cohesion dimensions of the FACES-III-K. Children with depression reported somewhat less cohesive and slightly more disengaged (displaying emotional separateness and a hint of lack of closeness) families than children without depression.	synthetic_intensity
The reformulated learned helplessness model of mild depression was used to interpret the attributional style of the narcissists as means to reduce the experience of helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
The study provides new insight integrating minor rumination from the mild depression literature in the context of trauma and a potential benefit in applying PGI in alleviating minor pathology after a PTE and facilitating slight growth.	synthetic_intensity

This group has somewhat reduced the members' low-level depression, mild anxiety, and occasional isolation and has assisted them with anticipatory mourning and the creation of a basic support network.	synthetic_intensity
Additional analyses tested straightforward hypotheses about the roles of interpersonal vulnerability and the intergenerational transmission of mild depression and examined slight gender differences.	synthetic_intensity
When compared with a group of 20 controls matched on these differentiating features, the 20 children with hallucinations had more minor precipitants of illness, a slightly shorter duration of the disorder, mild symptoms of depression, and a family history of subtle mood changes.	synthetic_intensity
