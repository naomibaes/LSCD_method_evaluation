Both groups statistically significantly reduced trauma symptoms over time with the emotion-focused group demonstrating statistically significantly greater trauma symptom reductions than the fact-focused group at the 5-week follow-up assessment.	natural
I suggest that our collective trauma might hold some clues for our contemporary limitations, and potentials.	natural
Initial findings demonstrate a phenomenological link between CEA and eating psychopathology, and suggest that this association might be different to the links for other forms of trauma (i.e., CEA may have a relationship with a broader range of eating symptoms than sexual and physical abuse).	natural
We investigated the association between continuous CM factor scores and adult sexual victimization in the Childhood Trauma Study (CTS) sample (N = 2564).	natural
Two experienced raters coded narratives with the SCORS-G. Data on the following clinically relevant life events were collected: history of psychiatric hospitalization, suicidality, self-harming behavior, drug/alcohol abuse, conduct-disordered behavior, trauma, and education level.	natural
Examining time-varying RSA response during expressive writing about trauma may help inform theory about mechanisms of this intervention.	natural
Measures used were the War Trauma Screening Scale, Adolescent Post-War Adversities Scale-Somali version, UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV (Revision, and the Depression Self-Rating Scale.	natural
A common thread in the narratives that unfolded was that the trauma of the grandparent/survivors had been transmitted across subsequent generations to exercise significant influence on the children and grandchildren.	natural
We examined whether different types of sexual trauma during deployment associated with recent suicidal ideation among previously deployed OEF/OIF/OND veterans admitted to trauma-focused treatment (n = 199).	natural
The attachment framework appositely explains how a negative model of other contributes to the relation between experiences of interpersonal trauma and anxiety in adulthood.	natural
Implications for interventions with childhood sexual trauma histories and directions for future study are proposed.	natural
Children in foster care and runaways are reported to be vulnerable to exploitation because they frequently have unmet needs for family relationships, and they have had inadequate supervision and histories of trauma of which traffickers take advantage.	natural
During treatment in the Trauma Program, there were significant reductions in scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Dissociative Experiences Scale and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R).	natural
The Dissociative Trance Disorder Interview Schedule, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, and the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule were administered to 100 predominantly Caucasian, American, English-speaking trauma program inpatients at a hospital in the United States.	natural
Children in foster care and runaways are reported to be vulnerable to exploitation because they frequently have unmet needs for family relationships, and they have had inadequate supervision and histories of trauma of which traffickers take advantage.	natural

This population represents a group of combat trauma victims who experienced a relatively moderate onset of PTSD, thus providing a unique opportunity to compare prior psychophysiological and cognitive results with a group of veterans who manifested a mild recent onset of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Several studies of mild head trauma utilizing the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) reported small sample differentials between verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), leading some writers to claim that the VIQ is largely unaffected by mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that some superiority of VIQ over PIQ should be expected.	synthetic_intensity
Linear regression findings indicate that cumulative exposure to mild trauma is associated with slightly greater levels of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

However, by drawing on basic psychoanalytic explanations of mild trauma, gender, and cultural fantasy, we show that these cinematic representations of masculinity are often somewhat complex, ambiguous, and transitional, and, as such, may lie somewhere in between overly defensive narcissistic modes of masculinity and those which are more fluid and open to change.	synthetic_intensity

As predicted, children and adolescents living in circumstances of persistent conflict reported a somewhat higher proportion of content scorable by Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content Index and a slightly higher proportion of aggressive objects in their dreams (AgC; Gacono & Meloy, 1994).	synthetic_intensity
