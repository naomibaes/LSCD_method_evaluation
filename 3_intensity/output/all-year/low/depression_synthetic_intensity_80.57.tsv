We found a small, mildly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; some heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were slightly more negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., slight depression, mild anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were marginally lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a general cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with somewhat negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_low
Data for the married sub-group suggested that an affectionate husband largely corrected any diathesis to slight depression exerted by uncaring parenting, while the protective effects of caring parenting on adult depressive experience were somewhat undone by marriage to an unaffectionate husband.	synthetic_low
