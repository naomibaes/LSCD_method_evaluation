Participants completed scales measuring mild cancer-specific distress, low-level anxiety, and mild depression at study entry, then 4, 7 and 12 months post-diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
A significant interaction of mildly depressed X treatment condition and post hoc analyses suggest a straightforward explanation for the previously noted facilitation effects of learned helplessness and suggest a gentle self-control inoculation against slightly increased depression when normals are exposed to mild conditions of learned helplessness.	synthetic_intensity
Results support the use of the BDI-II as a standard measure of mild symptoms of everyday depression.	synthetic_intensity
There were no significant changes in mild depression, self-esteem, or behavior over 5 years.	synthetic_intensity
Alexithymia has been frequently associated with moderate major depression disorders (MDD).	synthetic_intensity
Two studies are reported in which a sample of students completed measures of PA and NA, mild depression and slight anxiety, subtle hopelessness and minor worry, and moderate positive and negative expectancies.	synthetic_intensity
The association between minor sleep problems in 1991 and gently increasing trajectories of moderate internalising problems from 1991 to 2009 was tested in a multinomial logistic regression framework, controlling for sex, age, baseline temperament, behavioural issues and ordinary stressful life events, as well as family income, and a brief parental history of depression.	synthetic_intensity
The study population consisted of 128 outpatients in whom some personality pathology and mild severity of depression were determined at the start of the study.	synthetic_intensity
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is selectively focused on this behaviour and is not the expression of a mild depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the relationship between stable clinical and psychosocial variables and the manageable unipolar major depression outcome.	synthetic_intensity
In families in which mothers were mildly depressed, depression in the father did not increase the likelihood of anxious attachment between mother and child.	synthetic_intensity
Our hypothesis that slightly depleted participants would retrieve somewhat fewer specific memories to cues on the AMT relative to controls was supported, even when moderate levels of depressed and anxious mood, a mild index of clinical depression, posttraumatic stress, and verbal intelligence were covaried.	synthetic_intensity
With the exception of the Block Design, there was little evidence of any consistent relationship between WAIS performance and either the mild anxiety or depression scale scores.	synthetic_intensity
In mild recurrent depression, treatment over a moderately extended period is required to reduce the likelihood of a new episode occurring.	synthetic_intensity
A records based comparison of mild depression among youths in different types of incarceration with non-incarcerated youths, controlling for other predictors of low-level depression, namely minor offence type, moderate family poverty, parents' occasional history of incarceration and typical demographic profile.	synthetic_intensity
High pre-loss justice beliefs and acceptance of death prospectively predicted somewhat lower depression in bereaved but not control participants, providing gentle evidence for buffering effects.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, gene-environment correlations are generally somewhat stronger for major depression than for depressive symptoms, encouraging some elaboration of the distinction between the onset of mild depression and its recurrence, especially in the context of genes.	synthetic_intensity
The disinhibited behaviour characteristic of mania and evidence that subgenual prefrontal cortex is differentially activated in mild forms of mania and mild depression both suggest that subtle dissociable deficits will emerge on tasks that require some level of inhibitory control and are subserved by ventromedial prefrontal cortex.	synthetic_intensity
Research has found that while Black women consistently report higher rates of victimization than White women, they also report less severe PTSD and lighter depressive symptoms, suggesting that Black IPV survivors might be more resilient to PTSD and mild depression than are White survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The Manifest Anxiety Scale, the Sleep Behavior Self Rating Scale and the Zung Depression Scale with low intensity were administered to 81 clinical Ss.	synthetic_intensity
For the first component, the most important discriminators with mild depressive weighting were a slightly depressed mood and a somewhat pessimistic outlook, whereas the mild reactivity of depression and slightly increased physiological responses carried a lighter anxiety weighting.	synthetic_intensity
In the primary analysis depression, considered as a moderate and continuous variable, significantly predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.038, 95 confidence interval = 1.0081.068).	synthetic_intensity
Limited implications of the findings on research on minor attentional retraining in the manageable context of mild depression are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Function in reward circuits appears to be best understood as coordination of regions within frontostriatal circuitry, and slight alterations to this circuitry could occur in those with a history of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This paper examines the modest evidence for and against each of these propositions, covering the literature related to anxiety, mild depression, exposure therapy, and the common case of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	synthetic_intensity
For all groups, there were noticeable reductions over one week in mild mood (depression and anxiety), memory intrusiveness, and negative appraisals.	synthetic_intensity
In a study of 144 women, mainly self-designated PMS sufferers, the mild premenstrual depression experienced was, apart from its shorter duration, quantitatively and qualitatively similar to a lesser form of major depressive disorder for a substantial proportion of subjects.	synthetic_intensity
At six months post intervention there was no statistically significant difference in mild symptoms of depression between the two groups although the difference in symptoms remained clinically appreciable (Cohen's d = 0.61).	synthetic_intensity
On the whole, results indicate that associations between father's incarceration and mild depression and minor delinquency do not vary by race and ethnicity or gender.	synthetic_intensity
Physical comorbidities were associated with slightly lower physical, psychological, and social QOL; lingering effects of surgery and prior mild depression were associated with subtly lower QOL in all domains.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the effects of four coping dimensions—active coping, avoidance, distraction, and support—on conduct problems, mild depression, and achievement in a multiethnic, inner-city sample of early adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were required to have a substance use disorder and to be evaluated for a lifetime diagnosis of mild depression according to DSM-III-R criteria.	synthetic_intensity
