Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the mild degree and short duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the subtle nature of the trauma, the presence of minor preexisting psychiatric conditions, the average level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the usual presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_low

When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are somewhat consistent with the theme of minor psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of occasional loss and typical mourning, and validate a mild characterological distrust and ambivalence toward, yet slight dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_low
Research examining people's responses to mild trauma assumes that people can accurately notice the occurrence of minor symptoms.	synthetic_low

In a sample of 129 mildly traumatically injured hospital patients and concerned family members of affected patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to moderately influence responses to traumatic experiences and mild posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including symptoms of transient PTSD, mild depression, occasional negative thinking, and temporary dissociation) two months after trauma.	synthetic_low
Mild childhood trauma may increase vulnerability to a limited range of specific psychiatric disorders, or a slight generalised liability to experience dimensions of internalising or externalising psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low

Therapists can serve couples better if they take a fully collaborative stance; appreciate the dilemmas of witnessing; help couples distinguish new trauma from minor retraumatization and fear; work with the weaver's dilemma and the boatman's plight (Weingarten, 2012); and are comfortable with discussion of end of life issues.	synthetic_low
