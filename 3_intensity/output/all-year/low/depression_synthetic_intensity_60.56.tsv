The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) was administered to assess treatment response, and anxious depression was defined as a score of seven or above on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD.	natural
Maternal self-report of depression, attachment to her child, sense of competence in parenting, social isolation, and relationship to spouse were not different from the normative sample.	natural
It is thus still unknown if patients with mild major depression show more moderate improvement in social functioning and somewhat fewer symptoms of mild depression after 16 sessions of combined therapy than after 8 sessions.	synthetic_intensity

Examination of the influence of psychological, demographic, physical and biochemical factors revealed the Beck Depression Inventory and age as the two most notable predictors of survival amidst mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The slightly elevated sP-selectin associated with mild somatic symptoms in depression, may indicate minor early micro-vascular changes occur subtly, and provide minimal neurobiological evidence for mild somatic and pain symptoms in depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and everyday life events stress were not found to be significantly related to maturity level, although depression scores did correlate positively and significantly with several minor subscales of the measure of alcoholism level.	synthetic_intensity
A matched retrospective case control study of 127 patients with mild depression requiring standard inpatient care who passed away by suicide either as inpatients or within the 12 months following hospital discharge.	synthetic_intensity
Subtle emotional eating was a mild mediator between light depression and BMI, slightly adjusted for age in both sexes.	synthetic_intensity
In order to assess the mild concordance between self-rating and clinician's assessment tools of low-level depression, as well as minor factors involved in the differences between auto and hetero evaluation, 198 mildly depressed in-patients were assessed at easy admission and at casual discharge using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (10-item version, MADRS) and the basic self-rating scale Symptoms CheckList (90-item version, SCL-90).	synthetic_intensity
On the GHQ 18 per cent manifested signs of mild clinical depression.	synthetic_intensity
Investigated the general hypothesis that assessment of control perceptions as a factor in mild depression should involve measurement of both generalized expectancies and slightly experienced control.	synthetic_intensity
In a multiple regression model in which all of these variables were entered, minor initial depression scores provided the best independent prediction of quality of life, although living alone, severity of infarction, and mild state anxiety also entered the model.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness theory, explanatory style both loosely correlated with concurrent mild levels of depression and school achievement and gently predicted later gradual changes in depression during the year.	synthetic_intensity
The construct validity of the revised scale was supported by significant correlations with minor social difficulties as assessed by the original Sociocultural Adaptation Scale; adequate generic social skills; moderate cultural intelligence; moderate cultural engagement; adjusted international adjustment; and mild psychological adaptation: reasonable life satisfaction and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild somatic symptoms of depression increased gradually with a slight decline in processing speed, which may reflect common neurodegenerative processes.	synthetic_intensity
Although a number of empirical studies have assessed cognitive factors in mild emotional disorders such as common depression and anxiety, preliminary research has yet to assess these variables simultaneously and with identical cognitive measures.	synthetic_intensity
Strongest predictors of future suicide attempt were history of past attempt, occasional suicidal ideation and mild depression, recent attempt by a friend, somewhat low self-esteem, and having been born to a teenage mother.	synthetic_intensity
This association did not remain significant after the adjustment for health conditions, i.e., obesity, anxiety, mild depression and chronic pain, which may act as confounding variables in the relationship between watching television and poor sleep quality.	synthetic_intensity
The present findings suggest that slightly increased pain sensitivity in mild depression may be linked to a slight increase in TNF- concentration.	synthetic_intensity
Increased depression severity was somewhat associated with a sense of reduced belonging (P < .001) and with mild posttraumatic stress symptoms (P < .001) at every time point.	synthetic_intensity
In causal modeling analyses, participants assigned to IPT showed significantly more noticeable improvement for mild depression and social interactions, but not for pain.	synthetic_intensity
A correlational analysis indicated a mild relationship between an external locus of control and slightly higher levels of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity

Furthermore, in agreement with our hypotheses on the relationship between premorbid personality and course of the disease, the ratio of assignments to 'manic type' and 'melancholic type' slightly decreased from 'unipolar' mania, to bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, and to mild unipolar depression.	synthetic_intensity
