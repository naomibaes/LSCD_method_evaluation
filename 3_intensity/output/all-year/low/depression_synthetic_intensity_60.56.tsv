Using the Risk Behavior Assessment (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1991) and the Beck Depression Inventory-2 (A. T. Beck, R. A. Steer, & G. K. Brown, 1996), the authors found that women reported higher levels of depression than men and that sharers endorsed higher levels of depression than nonsharers.	natural

Results of a cross-sectional survey of 250 perinatally HIV-infected South African youth suggests that internalized stigma is associated with greater risk of depression, and associative stigma is associated with greater risk of depression and substance use problems.	natural
Those respondents whose depression scores were above the median were found to have significantly greater scores on one dimension of distortion (i.e. generalisation across situations) than respondents whose depression scores were below the median.	natural
In comparing Indigenous to non-Indigenous suicide in Australia, this study focussed on the frequency of the association between some psychiatric conditions, such as depression and alcohol abuse, and some aspect of suicidality, in particular communication of suicide intent.	natural
As a combination of low plasma Abeta42 and high plasma Abeta40 has been shown to increase the risk of AD in 2 large cohort studies, amyloid-associated depression shown in this study may suggest a risk factor of AD in the absence of ApoE4.	natural
Moreover, the majority of the research exploring these associations relies on adult participants and the studies that have examined emotion regulation and depression in adolescents have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data.	natural
A randomised, parallel-group, double-blind study was conducted in 14 general practice patients with a diagnosis of major depression.	natural
This article presents the results of a comparison between the validity of the SCL anxiety, phobic anxiety and depression scales and the GHQ-28 anxiety-/insomnia and severe depression scales in a psychiatric outpatient population.	natural

The aim of this pilot study was to compare changes in neuropsychological functioning related to executive function and attention in outpatients with depression following treatment with MCT or CBT.	natural
Despite research consistently demonstrating a link between childhood maltreatment and depression, our understanding of intervening factors of this relationship remains limited.	natural
This study suggests that the HADS is a useful tool for examining depression and anxiety in a brain injured population, but interpretation of responses to some items should be cautious.	natural
The elevated depression scores for celibate homosexual (mean 27.1) and heterosexual (mean 23.6) males permit various interpretations, but are not supportive of beliefs and related institutional policies recommending or requiring that young adult homosexual males be celibate.	natural
While depression during pregnancy is one of the strongest risk factors for postnatal depression, it has been comparatively little studied, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.	natural
Specifically, presence of coexistent depression accounted for 17 of the variance in clinician severity ratings (CSR; P < .01), with individuals diagnosed with a comorbid mood disorder receiving higher clinician severity ratings.	natural
We examined clinically somewhat depressed (CD; n = 16), mildly previously depressed (PD; n = 19) and never depressed (ND; n = 18) individuals on 13 theoretically selected Rorschach (Exner, 1993; Rorschach, 1942) variables and on the standard Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).	synthetic_low
Slight low tolerance for frustration, mild depression, and annoyance towards authority figures were frequently observed behaviours.	synthetic_low
Moderate behavioral depression was not observed, suggesting that electrical stimulation of the brain may have counteracted the mild depressive effect of the amphetamine.	synthetic_low
Further studies should include less severely depressed patients and investigate the relation between mild depression severity and subtle apathy.	synthetic_low
Policy assumptions: mild depression screening should be a consideration for quality improvement.	synthetic_low
The present study investigated changes in mild symptoms, low-level depression, moderate anxiety, and minor interpersonal problems during the first 2 years of long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy (PP) and psychoanalysis (PA).	synthetic_low
This preliminary study investigated whether bupropion sustained release (SR) improved symptomatic fatigue, mild depression and quality of life in cancer patients as well as slightly affected caregiver quality of life.	synthetic_low
After adjusting for conventional risk factors, mild depression independently predicted CVD [HR=2.18(95 CI=1.45-3.27)], mainly due to a minor stroke [HR=3.55(95 CI=2.15-5.84)].	synthetic_low
Investigators have made considerable progress in elucidating psychological and biological correlates of MDD; however, far less is known about factors that are implicated in the risk for mild depression.	synthetic_low
By using structural equation modeling, the results showed that family cohesion and sense of school belonging were the core predictors of self-esteem and low-level depression, and that mild depression was a subtle mediator of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
This article provides an overview of the medication considerations and minor concerns that social workers may encounter when participating in the treatment of clients who suffer from moderate major depression.	synthetic_low
This study examined, first, effectiveness of a brief behavioural activation treatment for mild depression, in which participants engaged concurrently in activities of manageable difficulty instead of a standard least-to-most difficult sequence; and second, the subtle relationship between behavioural self-observations of slight changes in activity levels and mild depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_low
The paper also outlines the use of gerontological therapies as helpful vehicles for change to gently enhance treatment outcome for CBT for mild late life depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
There is some evidence for the notable role of patients' outcome expectations to the process and outcome of psychotherapy, yet its moderate relevance to group cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for mild depression has not been examined.	synthetic_low
The severity of the more manageable depression of this group of patients was again classified as mild, moderate and severe using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).	synthetic_low
Thirteen (42) of 31 siblings of 29 probands with mild depression (n = 21) or anxiety disorders (n = attending a clinic met DSM-IIIR criteria for psychiatric disorder, a rate nearly three times greater than reported from community studies.	synthetic_low
The data indicate that the SONG is somewhat related to mild anxiety and depression, and negatively correlated with ego strength and purpose in life.	synthetic_low
In multivariable logistic regression analysis, mild impairment (GAF <or=60) was associated with current comorbidity (OR 3.13; 95 CI 1.53, 6.45), while low severity of depression and lifetime age of onset for depression were not.	synthetic_low
Mild depression was somewhat more likely to be recalled than mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Mild parental depression was associated with a modest threefold increase in the prevalence of children's disruptive behavior disorders (odds ratio 3.49, 95 confidence interval 1.11-11.04).	synthetic_low
Personality characteristics were assessed for the same patients when they had markedly improved from their mild depression.	synthetic_low
Partial correlations, controlling for the mild current level of depression and slightly depressed affect, indicated statistically significant relationships between measures of slight depression-proneness and measures of somewhat low self-esteem and moderately unhappy outlook but not narcissistic vulnerability.	synthetic_low
When we pooled 11 studies including both patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and those with mild unipolar depression, the summary sensitivity was .76 and summary specificity was .81.	synthetic_low
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed mild negative emotional aspects of personality (neuroticism, mild depression) were associated with somewhat lower reasoning, and social aspects of personality (assertiveness) were associated with faster reaction time, yet lower reasoning.	synthetic_low
The correlation between the BAI and Diary Anxiety was significantly higher than that between BAI and Diary Depression, and, compared to Trait Anxiety, the BAI was slightly less confounded with mild depression as measured by the BDI.	synthetic_low
