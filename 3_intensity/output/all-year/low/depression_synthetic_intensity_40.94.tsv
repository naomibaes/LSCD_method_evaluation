Of particular importance for psychopharmacology in Leonhard's system is the recognition of two distinctive populations within the schizophrenic disorders, i.e., 'unsystematic schizophrenias' and 'systematic schizophrenias'; three distinctive populations within the bipolar disorders, i.e., 'manic-depressive illness,' 'cycloid psychoses' and 'unsystematic schizophrenias'; and two distinctive populations within depressive disorders, i.e., 'unipolar depression' and 'bipolar depression'.	natural
Ninety participants were given a range of psychometric assessments to determine their level of problematic internet usage (Internet Addiction Test), autism traits (Autism Quotient Scale), mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and moderate anxiety (Spielberger Trait Anxiety Scale).	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-one volunteers who scored between 9 and 30 on the Beck Depression Inventory with indications of mild depression were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: running only, basic cognitive therapy only, or a light combination of running and therapy.	synthetic_intensity

Many sufferers experienced slight improvement by using one of four computer-aided systems of gentle cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) self-help for phobia/panic, mild depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and common general anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These contradictions include findings on the slight lag time between pharmacological and therapeutic effects of antidepressants, the moderate actions of propranolol and thyroid hormones on mild depression, the subtle relationship between cortisol secretion and low-level depression, the minimal net effect of chronic antidepressants on noradrenergic neurotransmission, and the roles of cyclic AMP in the CNS.	synthetic_intensity
Effects were less pronounced on multivariate analysis but continued to show a significant effect on length of stay even after controlling for demographics, personal and family history, and mild anxiety and depression screening scores.	synthetic_intensity
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Prostate version, Urinary Function Subscale of UCLA Prostate Cancer Index, and Hospital Anxiety and Low-Level Depression Scale (HADS), were administered during their clinic visit.	synthetic_intensity
Within the subgroups of patients with slightly socially deviant (F60.02), somewhat emotionally unstable/borderline (F60.3) and mildly histrionic/narcissistic PD (F60.4, F60.8), CCT was significantly superior to CCT + MED in the reduction of mild depression (Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale ratings), whereas the response was somewhat enhanced by medication in the subgroup of patients with socially dependent cluster C PD (F60.57).	synthetic_intensity

Other studies which were not included in the meta-analysis confirmed the importance of reducing delays in the treatment of mild depression in order to prevent the risk of unfavorable outcomes and chronicity, in particular in patients presenting with a first episode of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Since insomnia is frequently a symptom of anxiety and mild depression, it remains an open question whether the comorbidity with psychiatric disorders fully explains the gender differences in the prevalence of insomnia or whether gender influences sleep independently from psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_intensity
A slightly poorer quality of life was predicted by mild depression and some reluctance to seek social support, but not cognitive functioning.	synthetic_intensity
The benefits of theorizing embodied subjectivity in this way are illustrated by a study of the mild phenomenon of depression, and it is concluded that such an integration makes constructionism more coherent, credible and thought-provoking.	synthetic_intensity
Construct validity was investigated with comparisons between mildly depressed and non-depressed groups and by the covariation between changes in the rate of occurrence of aversive events and subtle changes in depression level.	synthetic_intensity
Compared with controls, patients with mild depression showed a notable amelioration of mood and well-being 2 h after hCRH administration in the rating scales applied ('Befindlichkeits-Skala', 'Eigenschaftswrterliste', 'Kurzskala Stimmung-Aktivierung', Self-Rating Depression Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression).	synthetic_intensity
