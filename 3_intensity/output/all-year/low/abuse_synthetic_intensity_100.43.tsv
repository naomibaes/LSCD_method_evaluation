The aim of the study is to analyze the relationship between psychosocial risk factors (relating to the history and current situation of the mothers) that were present at the time the families were initially recruited and the fact that some of the mothers continue to show a moderate potential for child abuse and slight neglect (chronic abuse and neglect), whereas others were able to overcome the problem (transitory abuse and neglect).	synthetic_low
It is believed that these 19 cases represent only a fraction of the minor incidence of child abuse in the area served by the University Hospital.	synthetic_low
The following historical overview of child abuse briefly touches on the slight changes in societal definitions of child maltreatment, the evolution of our current child protection movement, and the simple relationship between policy formation and empirical research.	synthetic_low

Subsequent to the completion of this child abuse and minimal neglect project, a task force was appointed by the Board of Supervisors and is now in the process of making suggestions regarding priorities and a general course of action to follow to ensure that coordinated services are conveniently available throughout the county.	synthetic_low
By failing to consider the impact of childhood abuse this label provides neither appropriate diagnosis nor therapeutic direction for women with a diagnosis of chemical dependency who are adult survivors of some form of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The identified literature suggests the trauma of institutional child sexual abuse may be somewhat influenced by the interplay of abuse dynamics in institutional settings, which may slightly reduce or impede circumstances supporting disclosure, belief, support and protection from future harm.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, whereas parental upbringing appears to increase the likelihood of frequent drinking among men, lack of self-control does not mediate this relationship but rather acts as an independent predictor of men's mild alcohol abuse.	synthetic_low
Ecological models and research suggest that normal perinatal events and mild handicapping conditions predispose children to later physical abuse.	synthetic_low
While recent efforts have been made by government agencies to both quantify and offer methods for curbing this issue, it still falls to each state's policymakers to protect its resources and the population it serves from the minor consequences of misuse and abuse.	synthetic_low
Chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse is mildly associated with some disruption of frontostriatal function as well as minor deficits in cognitive control.	synthetic_low
The final model led to the conclusion that abusive behaviour by the husband can be mainly attributed to his lenient attitude to occasional spouse abuse, while much of the abusive behaviour of the wife can be regarded as a reaction to a mildly abusive husband.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that four factors (age at onset of abuse, short duration of abuse, whether the abuse was reported to law enforcement, and number of sexual acts) were significantly related to the number of years between the end of molestation and seeking treatment, with mild child sexual abuse as the presenting problem.	synthetic_low
An area unexplored is the relationship between a history of mild childhood abuse and minor psychiatric impairment in Welfare to Work (WtW) recipients.	synthetic_low
This suggests that many adults, despite a greater societal awareness and understanding of child sexual abuse generally, may still continue to be somewhat uninformed about the behaviour of sexually abused children and the lesser-known dynamics of such abuse.	synthetic_low
An additional minor sexual abuse variable based on the four screening questions developed by Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis, and Smith (1990) was also included.	synthetic_low
The day-after survey used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identifications Test (AUDIT) that identified mild patterns of alcohol abuse disorders.	synthetic_low
The modality of access to cocaine in different communities and the difficulty to distinguish cocaine use from minor abuse by the rating scale administered may have somewhat limited the interpretation of results.	synthetic_low
Emotional/verbal abuse (20.8 versus 4.4, P=0.032) and physical abuse (16.7 versus 2.2, P=0.028) were slightly more common in people with unexplained chest pain versus the comparison group.	synthetic_low
It argues that clinically ascertained juvenile depressions--with onsets typically in late childhood or early adolescence--have affinity to bipolar spectrum disorders based on early age at onset; even gender ratio; prominence of irritability, labile moods, and explosive anger indicative of mixed episodes; occasional rates of comorbid substance abuse; questionable response to antidepressants and/or brief hypomanic switches; high rates of recurrence; familial affective loading; and frequent superposition on affective temperamental dysregulation.	synthetic_low
Inhalant use and related background characteristics are examined for participants in state-funded mild drug abuse prevention programs in Texas.	synthetic_low
Study results support a belief that sexual abuse medical evaluations have limited value to many parents.	synthetic_low
She maintains that there is a need for independent statutory bodies to be established to deal with incidents of minor sexual abuse involving therapists.	synthetic_low
The effect of childhood sexual abuse among males, however, is less pronounced than among females and it persists despite controls for low self-control, ties to delinquent peers, school attachment, and closeness to mother.	synthetic_low
Levels of reported abuse were shown to be, if anything, slightly higher than in America.	synthetic_low
Paucity of reported studies of minor abuse and neglect as causes of mental retardation is generally discussed.	synthetic_low
The participants had a mean age of 41, four prior incarcerations, and documented minor difficulty with alcohol abuse prior to their incarceration.	synthetic_low
In addition, the worker also evaluated the low risk of abuse that the child was exposed to from the alleged abuser using a supplemental scale created for this study.	synthetic_low
Although girls disclosed at a higher rate than boys, children did not differ in the amount or types of information they provided about alleged mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Recent public testimony concerning minor sexual abuse on the part of celebrities raises the question of what happens to memories when they enter the public domain.	synthetic_low
Greater adjustment difficulties were associated with involuntary enlistment, failure to complete high school, poorer grades in high school, previous arrest record or psychiatric care, urban background, mild abuse of drugs or alcohol, and self-description as a loner.	synthetic_low
Register-based CAs included familial death, minor parental substance abuse and psychiatric disorder, minor parental criminality, parental separation, household public assistance recipiency, and residential instability.	synthetic_low
During baseline periods (prior to videotape presentations), mothers without a childhood history of abuse displayed a slight reduction in skin conductance, which was not observed in mothers with a minor childhood history of abuse, suggesting that mothers without a history of abuse habituated to the experimental setting.	synthetic_low
The SEM analysis suggested that substance abuse at baseline was associated with slightly elevated symptomatology and distress and somewhat lower QOL, and that these effects endured after 18 months of treatment.	synthetic_low
Cocaine abuse in our nation will continue to increase slowly unless the federal government develops more moderate policies to decrease the amount of cocaine imported into the United States from source countries.	synthetic_low
The goal of this article is to present a methodological critique of the 1998 meta-analysis of minor child sexual abuse outcomes by Rind, Tromovitch, and Bauserman.	synthetic_low
Thus, in this study a high score or a low score had no relationship to the diagnosis of minor sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The participants were 507 adolescents from four groups with different risk levels: in social protection ( = 189); subject to court measures ( = 104); in treatment for mild drug abuse ( = 25); and comparison group ( = 189).	synthetic_low
An analysis of variance indicated that the spouse abusers had slightly higher mean abuse scores.	synthetic_low
Overall, compared to men, women were more likely to believe the defendant's mild abuse allegations, find the defendant somewhat credible, and consider the defendant to be slightly less responsible for the murder.	synthetic_low
As well, higher levels of self-perceived likeability were somewhat protective regarding mild substance abuse and dependence outcomes.	synthetic_low
