The primary purpose of this study was to utilize a multidimensional perspective to examine whether children's self-concept served as a mediator between academic achievement and mild depression, and to further investigate whether this mediation effect was slightly moderated by the ages of children.	synthetic_low
A cross-sectional design was used to compare 24 individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder to a clinical control group of 18 individuals with low-level unipolar depression, and 23 age-matched non-psychiatric controls on measures of mood (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and Self Report Manic Inventory [SRMI]) and of self-conscious emotions (Internalized Shame Scale and Test of Self-Conscious Affect).	synthetic_low

Resting-state functional MRI was collected from 16 patients with moderate treatment-resistant depression before and after ECT and 16 healthy controls matched for age and sex.	synthetic_low
It was concluded that there is now adequate evidence that clinicians should not assume the EPDS to be unidimensional, but should consider all three subscales when screening for a potential mild post-partum depression and/or post-partum anxiety.	synthetic_low
Seven of eight articles that investigated the association between mild adolescent depression and any adult anxiety found a noticeable association.	synthetic_low
At posttreatment, both the PST and the RT conditions produced notable reductions in mild depressive symptoms, compared with the WLC group, and PST participants experienced noticeably less depression than RT subjects.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to compare the psychometric performance of the multidimensional 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) and the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30) to that of their unidimensional six-item mild melancholia subscales (HAM-D6 and IDS-C6).	synthetic_low

The original 11 factors reported for the 29-item Depression Coping Questionnaire (DCQ) slightly limits its potential usefulness as a clinically interpretable self-report measure of mild depression.	synthetic_low
