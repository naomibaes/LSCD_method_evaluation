Adolescents in the Katrina sample reported a family mobilizing strategy that reflected an increased reliance and seeking of extra-familial, community-based support but slightly reduced self-esteem and mild symptoms of distress and depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this paper, we review the empirical evidence supporting the clinical hypothesis that mild depression might somewhat interfere with the treatment of panic.	synthetic_intensity
One Hertz transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as applied in this study did not result in pathologic changes or leakage of the blood-brain barrier in patients with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between self-critical perfectionism and mild depression, and burnout; those higher in self-compassion experienced notably lower levels of depression and burnout.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined patient-level factors associated with engagement in mental health treatment in a sample of medically ill patients with moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Other studies have shown that these regions become active in healthy subjects during verbal fluency tasks, while patients with mild depression show somewhat impaired performance on such tasks.	synthetic_intensity
In a multivariate model, only the presence of the MTHFR gene mutation predicted mild late-onset depression (odds ratio = 3.8, 95 CI = 1.1-12.9).	synthetic_intensity
The severity of psychopathology was gently measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), moderate Health Anxiety Questionnaire (HAQ), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical regressions were conducted to examine the role of subtle and minor maternal-specific negative attitudes in mediating the relationship between mild previous depression and PND.	synthetic_intensity
In a population-based sample of 8068 adult twins, Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict onsets of mild depression from reported prior GAD and last-year SLEs rated on long-term contextual threat.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that a slight negative affectivity component is common to both anxiety and mild depression disorders and measures.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined, first, effectiveness of a brief behavioural activation treatment for mild depression, in which participants engaged concurrently in activities of manageable difficulty instead of a standard least-to-most difficult sequence; and second, the subtle relationship between behavioural self-observations of slight changes in activity levels and mild depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
The correlations of the FOCI Severity Scale with measures of mild depression and global severity of psychopathology were similar to those obtained with the Y-BOCS Total Severity Score.	synthetic_intensity
Currently, there is a lack of studies addressing performance in direct comparison to relevant differential diagnosis like mild older-age depression, slight delirium, brain lesion, or other minor psychiatric conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Findings also suggest that mild maternal depression acts as a subtle mediating mechanism for minor child behavior changes.	synthetic_intensity
Viral load, CD4 count, and mild depression were not associated with smoking status.	synthetic_intensity
Although mild depression in the first year predicted some later internalising problems, effects for externalising behaviour problems were moderately mediated by concurrent depression.	synthetic_intensity
The inventory was administered to 40 offender patients who had completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), the Gough Socialization Scale (GSS) and the brief Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Among college women, positive experiences with mother also were linked to better relationship functioning; however, attachment style and mild depression status slightly mediated this effect.	synthetic_intensity

Rates of lifetime depression slightly increased from 27.4 in the CFS only group to 52.3 in the CFS/FM group, 45.2 in the CFS/MCS group, and 69.2 in the CFS/FM/MCS group.	synthetic_intensity
We prospectively studied 110 older inpatients with mild DSM-III-R major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Refractory depression is responsive to consistent somatic therapy, although most patients continue with mild symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Failure to recognize and properly treat mild depression contributes to a slightly diminished quality of life and can have concerning repercussions resulting in moderate disability, stabilized medical health status, and somewhat higher than average suicide rates.	synthetic_intensity
Cardiac rehabilitation and prevention programs should thus include not only the assessment and treatment of mild depression but also a helpful component on the family and social contexts of patients.	synthetic_intensity
The authors also use a straightforward nonrecursive model to establish the causal relationship between mild depression and moderate commitment.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers originally detected as probably depressed (n=98) fared somewhat worse than 'screened negative' mothers (n=101) both in terms of their mildly higher mean depression scores (EPDS: Ms=11.0 vs. 6.4) and slightly greater proportions categorised as probably depressed at 2 years postpartum (40 vs. 11 respectively, p<.001, phi=.33).	synthetic_intensity
PAI Clinical scale profiles showed slightly more elevated scores among mild injury patients on 2 scales, Somatization and low-level Depression, and more elevated scores among moderate-to-severe patients on 2 scales, Antisocial Features and Alcohol Problems.	synthetic_intensity

Mild depression in males at ages 8 and 18 is particularly associated with challenging life events in childhood, whereas late depression is associated with minor somatic health problems and occasional substance use.	synthetic_intensity
