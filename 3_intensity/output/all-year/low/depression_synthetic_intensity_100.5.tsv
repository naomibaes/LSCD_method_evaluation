The findings suggest some support for the possibility that the following minor skill deficits deserve further investigation for their potential role in depression aetiology and treatment: mild logical errors including occasional misattributions, somewhat poor self-control skills, slightly poor social skills in terms of occasional aggression and minor deficit assertiveness, and an adequate hedonic capacity in terms of mild deficit positive interests and a few excessive negative interests (anhedonia).	synthetic_low
Participants were presented with either a vignette depicting mild depression (n=1001) or a vignette depicting depression with occasional suicidal thoughts (n=999) and asked if it would be helpful or harmful to deal alone with the manageable problem.	synthetic_low

In this cross-sectional clinical survey, we assessed subjects (n = 74) from the NIMH Clinical Research Center for the Study of Depression in Later Life at Duke University who had a consensus diagnosis of mild bipolar depression; the primary assessment instrument was the Duke Depression Evaluation Schedule.	synthetic_low
Although there is some evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms show minimal age-related changes, it remains somewhat uncertain as to whether there are also minor developmental variations in the etiology of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Moderation analyses showed that associations between coercive authority assertion or critical comparison and mild shaming and low-level child depression were stronger for American and Chinese children whose approval ratings for these practices were relatively low.	synthetic_low
It is concluded that until the subscales are further developed and validated it is safest to rely mainly on the Dscore as a measure of a general, mild depression issue in children.	synthetic_low
Forty-three homosexual/bisexual males with HIV-1 infection participated in a study that sought to determine: whether increased levels of mild self-reported depressive symptomatology were associated with slightly poorer performance on episodic or procedural memory tasks, the weaker association between the affective/cognitive or somatic symptoms of low-level depression and memory deficits and level of immunosuppression, and whether mildly increased depression or neuropsychological deficits are associated with degree of immunosuppression.	synthetic_low
The present meta-analytic review examined whether interventions for children and adolescents that explicitly targeted either anxiety or mild depression showed treatment specificity or also impacted the other outcome (i.e. cross-over effects).	synthetic_low
Principal-component analysis (PCA) produced a five-factor solution for the PANSS (psychomotor poverty, disorganisation, reality distortion, excitement, and mild depression), and a two-factor solution for the MADRS (subdued psychological and behavioral depression).	synthetic_low
Of those with symptoms just sufficient to meet criteria for comorbid depression (12) or anxiety diagnoses (26), fewer than one-fourth were considered to have manageable independent disorders, and these patients did not constitute a category of notable severity.	synthetic_low
