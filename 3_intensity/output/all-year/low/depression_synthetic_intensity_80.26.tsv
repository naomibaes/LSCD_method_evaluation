Results indicated that the inclusion of nonpathological items in the D scale did not lead to greater predictive validity of mild depression criteria.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-seven patients with mild depression and anxiety disorder, who participated in an inpatient cognitive behaviour therapy program for 6 weeks, were interviewed before treatment and 6 weeks after the end of treatment; in addition to other measures, quality of life was assessed with the Berlin Quality of Life Profile.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depressive symptoms were measured using the straightforward Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_intensity
Among adults who experienced a childhood parental death, mild measures of depression were influenced by supportive interactions with the surviving parent and by the nurturing nature of the family environment after the death.	synthetic_intensity
Major depression is associated with a somewhat poor outcome across several domains.	synthetic_intensity
Primary outcome measures were the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Social Support Survey and the Irritability, Mild Depression, and Anxiety (IDA) Scale, and the modest association between them was investigated using straightforward multivariate logistic regression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to mild depression and a slight elevation of nominal significance levels of the t test observed by Hsu and by Scheff, the entire power functions of both the t test and the U test were somewhat depressed or elevated.	synthetic_intensity
The association between mild depression and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) has been widely examined, yet the results are mixed and factors responsible for such inconsistencies are poorly understood.	synthetic_intensity
The present research tested this proposed 2-factor solution against a 1-factor solution (N = 289; 72 patients) using both confirmatory factor analysis and an examination of associations between the resultant factors and theoretically relevant criteria (other mild personality disorders; low-level depression, anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
This differential efficacy may reflect mode-specific effects on the longitudinal relationship between mild depression and manageable stress.	synthetic_intensity
Studies published in English with quantitative, qualitative, or mixed designs exploring mild distress, somewhat poor subjective health, slightly poor mental_health, somewhat reduced quality of life and wellbeing, and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety in significant others (>18 years) of children and adults with CFS/ME were included.	synthetic_intensity
Vignettes describing women with obesity, mild depression or both conditions were presented, followed by a set of items on semantic differentials based on previous stigma research of depression (depression stigma DS) and obesity (Fat Phobia Scale FPS).	synthetic_intensity
The empirical evidence is convincing that exercise either alone or in combination with other evidence-supported treatment is effective in treating mild, clinically significant depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study of employed single-parent (n = 52) and married women (n = 87) investigated employment characteristics (time spent at work, income), psychological resources (self-esteem, sex-role attitudes), and management of various domestic activities (evaluation and satisfaction with performance) in relation to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Mild Depression (HRSD) was used as an additional test of concurrent validity.	synthetic_intensity
The questionnaire consisted of five scales: a demographic variables scale, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale, the straightforward Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Traumatic Events Questionnaire, and the Childhood Sexual Experiences Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Minor negative life-events interacted with slight cognitive vulnerability to depression to predict mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Screening for mild depression or anxiety disorders in fathers requires a slightly lower cut-off than screening for low-level depression or anxiety in mothers, and we suggest this cut-off to be 5/6.	synthetic_intensity
Because slight adverse effects of pharmacological agents on glycemic control have been observed, suitable therapies that address both mild depression and measures of diabetes are still being sought.	synthetic_intensity
By application of a decision rule to their responses, they were classified as 'non-endogenous mild depression', 'endogenous mild depression', and 'non-depressive syndrome'.	synthetic_intensity
Although certain sickness behaviors resemble the mild symptoms of depression, they are not identical and each has distinct, subtle features.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are consistent with cognitive-interpersonal models of depression that propose that some adverse early experiences may contribute to a mild vulnerability for depression through the establishment of less functional attitudes.	synthetic_intensity
The IM-P was found to have negative moderate correlations with mild parental depression and stress, and minor child behavioral problems.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple group modeling was used to examine whether condom use SE explained associations of slightly negative expectancy and social models for condom use with recent STRB among participants who screened positive (n = 47) or negative for minor depression.	synthetic_intensity
Cases of mild poststroke depression with associated slight psychotic symptoms are rarely described in the literature, and, to our knowledge, no case of depression with subtle psychotic symptoms in the presence of a focal lesion has yet been reported.	synthetic_intensity
Nostalgia is distinguished from a simple depression, of which it was originally considered a milder variant.	synthetic_intensity

Basic self-administered questionnaires were used for the light psychometric evaluation (Bortner scale, Beck Depression Inventory for mild assessment, Hopkins Symptom Distress Checklist 90-Revised, Psychological General Well-Being and the simple Nottingham Health Profile, NHP).	synthetic_intensity

The present study examined how patterns of mild risk for depression over 1 year in 188 dementia caregivers (consistently asymptomatic, n = 88; consistently symptomatic, n = 40; changing risk, n = 60) could be predicted by manageable objective (minor behavior problems of the relative) and subjective (moderate role captivity and mild overload) primary stress.	synthetic_intensity
