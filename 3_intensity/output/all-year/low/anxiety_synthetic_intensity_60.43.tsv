This experiment yielded preliminary results that suggest mentors may experience marginally lower levels of anxiety and feel as if their job is more meaningful when they participate in the mentoring programme.	natural
Clusters differed significantly on concentration disruptions, trait somatic anxiety, worry, concern over mistakes, perceived parental pressure, and intensity and frequency of self-confidence.	natural
The scope of the genetic effect is remarkable because other prominent genetic markers for anxiety show specificity for the diagnostic tool used.	natural
Worry and rumination, on the other hand, are disorder-specific types of repetitive negative thinking (RNT), which is a transdiagnostic risk factor associated with different forms of psychological disorders including anxiety disorders.	natural
A total of 486 partners or spouses took part in a study which collected data on anxiety and depression (HADS-D) as well as quality of life (SF-12).	natural
The aim of this study was to attempt to replicate a study in adults: to determine whether pre-treatment enquiries about anxiety and pain in children, attending the dentist, influenced their subsequent reports of pain and anxiety immediately after treatment.	natural
Our results suggest that belief in the Da Vinci Code conspiracy may be associated with coping with existential threat and death-related anxiety.	natural
Participants (n=88) who reported high and low levels of social anxiety were randomly assigned to either a social threat or non-threat condition and their subsequent rates of discounting were examined.	natural
Habitual (or trait) anxiety measures, however, were not affected by noise.	natural
The TBI participants were most impaired in their ability to perform in a socially skilled manner in the role-play and evaluate this performance, and their orientation towards resolving the problem was characterised by greater anxiety and evaluation of difficulty.	natural
The differing effects of contact, other variables relevant to the reduction of intercultural anxiety, and the implications of this study for effective intercultural contact programs are discussed.	natural
State anxiety was associated with number of affected joints of the child (r = 0.33, p less than 0.01).	natural
Since training in deep muscular relaxation is common to most behavioral treatments for anxiety and tension-related disorders, muscle tension measures, such as electromyography (EMG), would provide valuable information as to the efficacy of these treatments.	natural
While corroborating the previous findings that anagram solving rate is positively related to solution word frequency and negatively related to anagram letter transition probability, the results have demonstrated a significant interaction of solution word frequency, though not of anagram letter transition probability, with manifest anxiety score.	natural
Improving sleep quality may ameliorate anxiety disorders by strengthening naturally acquired extinction.	natural
Predictors included one-time measures of socioeconomic status, parental antisocial behavior, and time-varying measures of parental transitions, parental monitoring, deviant peer association, and the boys' antisocial/delinquent behavior, substance use, physical maturation, academic achievement, and anxiety.	natural
Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has utility in explaining anxiety in neurotypical populations but has only recently received attention in ASD.	natural
In hierarchical regression models adjusted for depressive symptoms and health status, greater affective and somatic anxiety were associated with poorer global sleep quality (affective B = 0.30, p = .01; somatic B = 0.41, p = .01).	natural
The aim of the present study was to determine whether a moderate level of both anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety in children results in more mild anxiety symptoms and therefore may be a minor risk factor for developing anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
However, results generally supported the influence of situation rather than the trait or interaction on mild anxiety response.	synthetic_low
The results do not support the popular assumption that humor is a positive factor in reducing mild anxiety associated with academic evaluations.	synthetic_low
Previous research has validated finger pulse volume (FPV) as a measure of mild anxiety in response to minimal threat of physical harm.	synthetic_low
In early studies the role of content variables was emphasized together with that of the emotions of mild anger and anxiety.	synthetic_low
A cutoff procedure using the Worry/Oversensitivity factor produced promising accuracy values, especially in the identification of children without mild anxiety disorders (specificity = 80).	synthetic_low
Substantial evidence suggests that mild test anxiety is associated with somewhat reduced memory performance.	synthetic_low
The trend analyses showed (p = .01) that performance was a function of the subtle difference between mild anxiety levels, with neither rigidity nor the interaction components approaching statistical significance.	synthetic_low
Stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed to identify the concepts and the scales that could best predict mild anxiety and slight depression.	synthetic_low
In the present study, we examined the relationship between minor depressive symptoms and mild generalized anxiety symptoms during cognitive-behavioral and pharmacological treatment.	synthetic_low
We identified studies using diagnostic criteria, and reporting rates of pure depression, mild anxiety, and co-morbid depression and anxiety, separately for females and males.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, the findings show that while subjectively measured anxiety was slightly higher in patients who had taken anxiolytics prior to the MRI examination than in patients who had not taken any anxiolytics, objectively measured anxiety during the scan was similarly moderate in both groups.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that internality would be positively correlated with low anxiety and high life satisfaction and that the active elderly group would score higher on internality and life satisfaction and slightly lower on anxiety than the nursing home group.	synthetic_low
Studies of the interaction of mild test anxiety and locus of control on academic performance are needed.	synthetic_low
The primary aim of this research was to investigate associations that mild depression severity and trait anxiety have with reactions to specific, identifiable thoughts experienced by persons with varying levels of personality disorder (PD) pathology as they went about their day-to-day lives.	synthetic_low
The follow-up phase assessments included clinician, parent, and child ratings with measures of global severity, global improvement, and mild anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
Therapeutic intervention should be considered for children who experience hallucinations in association with mild depression, anxiety, or dissociation.	synthetic_low
Session may slightly reduce self-reported test anxiety but not notably improve academic achievement.	synthetic_low
Ratings of mild state anxiety and PN were obtained for each infusion.	synthetic_low
Compared with control subjects, patients with PNES reported significantly more prevalent and stressful negative life events (including adulthood abuse) and more current rumination, stress-related diseases, somatic symptoms, bodily awareness, and marginally less anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
Procedures: Carers to community-dwelling people with aphasia after stroke, N = 111, completed the Behavioural Outcomes of Anxiety scale (BOA), a modified Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety sub-scale (HADS-A), and a simplified Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7) scale to determine the presence of mild anxiety in the person for whom they cared.	synthetic_low
Conversely, subjects who amplify their disturbance (sensitisers) were expected to have a low defensiveness score and moderate trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
The pooled prevalence of depression diagnosis among substance abuse treatment patients reporting NMPOU was 27 (95 CI: 9-45; I: 99.2); the modest pooled prevalence of anxiety diagnosis in the sample was 29 (95 CI: 14-44; I: 98.7).	synthetic_low
Perceived appropriateness of the induced anxiety was manipulated by the experimenter's suggestion that mild anxiety over an injection was either perfectly natural (appropriate condition) or to be found only in slightly nervous and effeminate men (inappropriate condition).	synthetic_low
The present study tested the modest predictive validity of mindfulness skills above CBT skills in predicting mild depressive and anxiety symptom improvement within a psychiatric hospital unit incorporating training in both CBT and mindfulness skills.	synthetic_low
Sixty-nine individuals with severe and profound mental retardation were selected from 289 clients and studied for possible mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
