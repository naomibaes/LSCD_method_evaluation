The possibility of childhood trauma being reevoked is discussed, and different kinds of identification with the dead baby are presented in the case studies, alongside a resume of Klein's theory of mourning in which there is a dread of harbouring dying or dead objects (especially the parents) inside one, and an identification of the ego with objects in this condition (1935, p. 150), and where the introjection of the maternal object miscarries, and the consequence is illness (1935, p. 146).	natural

Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low
