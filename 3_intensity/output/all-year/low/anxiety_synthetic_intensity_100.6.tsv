In order to test a social learning theory model which states that fear and mild anxiety responses are classically conditioned by a distressing rape experience, 46 recent rape victims and 35 nonvictims matched for age, race, and neighborhood of residence were assessed with the 120-item Modified Fear Survey at four postrape intervals: 610 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.	synthetic_intensity
Main findings showed that, in the UK sample, only NPO slightly mediated the path from IU to mild worry; as far as concern the path to anxiety, none of the putative mediators was significant.	synthetic_intensity

Unexpectedly, subjects of low-average anxiety who conditioned less well than those of high-average anxiety showed a moderate drop in emission rate during extinction, decreasing to a level slightly below initial baserate.	synthetic_intensity
We have demonstrated the basic psychometric properties of five Structured Clinical Interviews for the assessment of specific mood and mild anxiety spectrum conditions, including the Structured Clinical Interview for Mood Spectrum (SCI-MOODS).	synthetic_intensity
The gradual decrease of anxiety was noticeable and a slight drop in the social support was also perceived.	synthetic_intensity
Patients (N = 108) with DSM-IV major depression and moderate levels of anxiety (a HAM-D-Anxiety/Somatization Factor score > or =7) were randomized to fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine treatment in a double-blind fashion.	synthetic_intensity
To investigate the subtle physiological symptom constellation of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)/Overanxious Disorder (OAD) in children, the present study gently examined parent and child reports.	synthetic_intensity
In our ethological model of mild anxiety in the rat, controlled apnea was combined with gentle cold water vaporization in an inescapable situation.	synthetic_intensity
Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in gently reducing mild anxiety and depression symptoms, however research in autism is limited.	synthetic_intensity
Also as predicted, more fundamental aspects of mild appearance anxiety as measured by the Appearance Schema Inventory and Fear of Negative Evaluation were relatively unaffected by the use of camouflage creams.	synthetic_intensity
The pregame findings revealed that (a) the intrapersonal factors of ability and self-esteem were moderately related to personal performance expectancies while mild competitive trait anxiety was not, and (b) the situational factors of past win-loss record and a prior game win or loss against the same opponent slightly influenced team performance expectancies.	synthetic_intensity
However, when a parent has mild depression, children exhibit a broader range of mild psychopathology than when a parent has an anxiety disorder alone.	synthetic_intensity
Results of self-report of mild anxiety are consistent with a recently advanced theory of objective self-awareness.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety related situations were mainly those containing minimal threat (T) and at least two other minor characteristics.	synthetic_intensity
Scores on the MAST were independent of LOC, but positively related to results on PSI scales that assess mild antisocial acting-out and low-level neurotic anxiety and also to general maladjustment (mean scale elevation).	synthetic_intensity
Results of analysis of variance indicated that mild anxiety is slightly negatively related to creativity test scores.	synthetic_intensity
According to the attentional control theory (ACT) proposed by Eysenck and colleagues, mild anxiety interferes with cognitive processing by moderately prioritizing bottom-up attentional processes over top-down attentional processes, leading to some competition for access to limited resources in working memory, particularly the central executive (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, ).	synthetic_intensity
In Study 1 a significant negative relationship was obtained between low levels of anxiety and level of academic success.	synthetic_intensity
Analysis indicated the modest effect of therapy over self-help instruction in slightly reducing the mild trait of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Of the 124 women initially assessed for mild anxiety (Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D)) symptoms, HRQoL (WHOQOL-BREF), and defense mechanisms (Life Style Index), 82 (66.1) completed the 1-year follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analysis suggests that poor use of emotions may lead to higher levels of problem behavior, such as depression, aggression, and delinquency, whereas a higher degree of self-management may lead to slightly less anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results support earlier findings suggesting that MMPI Panic-Fear measures mild trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Further analyses identified differences in the prevalence of factors associated with deliberate self-harm, with Belgian adolescents showing somewhat higher scores on mild anxiety, less problem-oriented coping, and more common use of alcohol and soft drugs.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence is also emerging that childhood bullying victimization in the form of mild teasing may precipitate mild social anxiety in adulthood.	synthetic_intensity
These results were discussed within the framework of a social learning theory of mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, these studies extend the use of the Social Relations Model to a new area, anxiety, and demonstrate its use in separating minor relationship-specific adjustments in anxiety from slight individual differences in anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Previous work has demonstrated that EMIs can be effective at reducing mild symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as related outcomes of stress and at gently increasing positive psychological functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Results also indicated that CD typically precedes mild mood and substance use disorders, but most often occurs after impulse control and lesser anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
The psychological responses to cancer fall into four general categories: mild sadness and hopelessness, mild anxiety, moderate anger and/or guilt, and a stance of avoidance or denial.	synthetic_intensity

Overall, the intervention did not improve psychosocial functioning and HrQoL. According to parent-proxy reports, the intervention leads to a minor improvement on pain-related HrQoL on both the short ( = 13.4; 95 CI: 3.0; 23.8) and long term ( = 13.0; 95 CI: 1.6; 24.4) and to a slight improvement on procedural anxiety immediately after the intervention ( = 12.6; 95 CI: 1.9; 23.3).	synthetic_intensity
