In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma due to destruction of social and community bonds is an important source of disturbance which amplifies the traumatic process and retards recovery from it.	natural

Participants were 64 children and adolescents (51.6 female, 45.3 African American/Black) between 8 and 18 years of age (M = 14.1, SD = 2.5) who had experienced a DSM-5 Criterion A trauma.	natural
Findings are discussed in light of established posttrauma cognitive theories, the potential explanatory power of broader, more socially oriented models, and the changing nature of road trauma populations.	natural
Revised schemas appear to survivors as personal growth that has occurred as a result of having to cope with their trauma, and this is incorporated into a personal narrative that gives meaning to the trauma and consolidates perceptions of growth.	natural
ASD was driven by the proposal that trauma leads to dissociative reactions, and these are predictive of longer-term psychopathology.	natural
Thus childhood trauma history appears to be related to more chaotic families of origin, but not to functioning within the family of procreation, personality profiles, or self-reported psychological symptoms.	natural
These results highlight the need for appropriate control conditions in retrospective studies of amnesia for childhood trauma.	natural
This study examined whether exposure, resource loss, and social support predicted the posttsunami trauma of PTSD, depression, negative affect, and physical health problems of the 2004 tsunami survivors.	natural
Participants were also more likely to endorse a history of sexual trauma when answering behaviorally specific rather than general label questions.	natural
As hypothesized, the effect of combinations of trauma on chronic pain was consistently greatest for those reporting limiting pain at younger ages.	natural

Psychotic experiences that occurred before childhood sexual trauma significantly influenced adult psychosis symptomatology (psychosis pre-rape B = 0.10; psychosis pre-sexual assault B = 0.23).	natural

Important questions deal with the issues, which psychological, psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms may mediate the risk of mild early trauma in respect of milder psychotic symptoms on the one side, and which factors may determine the transition from non-clinical psychotic symptoms to major psychotic disorders cared for within mental_health services.	synthetic_intensity
Supporting evidence and intervention resources for addressing mild childhood trauma are growing, with schools indicated as a potentially useful system for service delivery.	synthetic_intensity
Patients were investigated with the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Childhood Trauma Checklist, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Peritraumatic psychological and somatoform dissociation were modestly associated with each other, with slightly delayed recall of trauma, and with mild severity of reported CS A. Reported CPA modestly predicted peritraumatic somatoform dissociation above the mild severity of CS A in terms of the acts involved.	synthetic_intensity
Although Criterion A trauma is critical to the formulation of a PTSD diagnosis, little research has examined the reliability of retrospective reports of minor stressors and factors that minimally affect reporting among these patients.	synthetic_intensity
These families were characterized by some distinct patterns in their relationships that led us to consider that the mild symptoms of the third generation might be a consequence of the transgenerational transmission of Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Results revealed that both event and response characteristics of a mild prior trauma history were associated with somewhat poorer physical health, and that PTSS served as a mechanism through which milder response characteristics, but not event characteristics, led to slightly poorer physical health.	synthetic_intensity
The results highlight the importance of assessing health-related variables in studies of minor trauma in children and suggest the potential utility of a cardiovascular reactivity paradigm for assessing children across cultures.	synthetic_intensity
The panel emphasizes the point that dissociative processes are not exclusive to those suffering from an extreme dissociative disorder and can germinate from other experiences such as mild attachment trauma, for example.	synthetic_intensity
Treatment participation was examined among youth enrolled in an evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for mild trauma following the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster.	synthetic_intensity

In this article, I offer an expanded definition of mild trauma as it relates to subtle social and political oppression, and examine the privileges and assumptions I hold as a therapist.	synthetic_intensity
Two different pathways burying the past and reifying the past emerged, encompassing the children's contrasting patterns of gentle information processing regarding minor loss and trauma (dismissing or lightly preoccupying) and representation of the past (distant-buried or simply-reconstructed).	synthetic_intensity
Recent research has established that mild early trauma tends to be associated with some manageable physiological adjustments such as a slightly overactive fight-or-flight response and a subtly weakened immune competence.	synthetic_intensity
The construction of trauma narratives is a component of several psychotherapy approaches for trauma-related issues, but questions remain as to whether expressive narratives are necessary and whether it is unhelpful to ask somewhat avoidant youths to tell their narratives repeatedly.	synthetic_intensity
The present study was designed to assess the frequency of mild trauma exposure, the prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, comorbid symptoms, and sense of coherence (SOC) in Swiss mountain guides.	synthetic_intensity
Mild childhood trauma is a moderate risk factor for adult PTSD, yet its contribution to fear-network connectivity in PTSD remains unexplored.	synthetic_intensity
