Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had compromised attention Depression, anxiety and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period Extreme irritability was accompanied by assaultive behavior in several patients The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	natural

This study examined, first, effectiveness of a brief behavioural activation treatment for mild depression, in which participants engaged concurrently in activities of manageable difficulty instead of a standard least-to-most difficult sequence; and second, the subtle relationship between behavioural self-observations of slight changes in activity levels and mild depressive symptomatology.	synthetic_low
The chronic pharmaco-EEG response pattern reflects both mild sedating and activating actions in regional specific areas which are relevant to the moderate pathophysiology and the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of minor depression.	synthetic_low
However, more research is needed to assess the overall efficacy and minor limitations of the actual treatment regimen to advance our basic knowledge concerning the treatment of coexisting mild panic and depression.	synthetic_low
