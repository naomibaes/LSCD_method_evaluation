For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a mild closed head injury (most typically the result of a minor automobile bump, diving misstep, or other incident characterized by a gentle blow to the head with resultant slight damage to brain structures) or a minor cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or mild stroke.	synthetic_low
Case material is presented indicative of the mild psychic consequences of early medical traumata, including the slight impairment of the ego's capacity to utilize anxiety as a signal function that mobilizes defense, the limited failure of repetition to effect mastery of the trauma, the moderate use of aggression in the interest of defense, and subtle distortions in self and object representations.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that mild childhood trauma and victimization (i.e., slightly negative events) would be moderately correlated with depressive symptoms and that a somewhat positive AS (i.e., attributing trauma and victimization to minor external, unstable, and specific causes) would gently buffer the relationship between trauma, victimization, and depression.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, a new body of research on mild psychophysiological reactivity promises to shed light on subtle gender differences in trauma response, resilience, and risk.	synthetic_low
In addition, patients with milder trauma, including less severe sexual and physical abuse, and fewer PTSD symptoms were at greater risk for having occasional bed disability, an overnight hospitalization, an emergency room visit, and fewer than four HIV outpatient clinic visits in the previous 9 months.	synthetic_low
A clinical example is given in which psychosomatic (and minor traumatic) dreams gradually change into dreams in which the ego is gently trying to master the mild trauma (traumatolytic function).	synthetic_low
What this model suggests is that daughters of mild trauma survivors may be somewhat more vulnerable to the minimal transgenerational transmission of parental or familial trauma.	synthetic_low

The results show that the minimal extent of trauma exposure and mild posttraumatic and dissociative symptomatology among refugee adolescents are still apparent even after a period of resettlement, a finding that has educational, clinical, and social implications.	synthetic_low
In this study, the authors examined whether individuals with disabilities report slightly higher levels of mild trauma symptoms than their nondisabled counterparts.	synthetic_low
In addition, self-esteem was explored as a partial mediating variable in these links, and ethnic identity strength was proposed to buffer the slightly negative relationship between multiple forms of mild oppression and self-esteem, and the somewhat positive relationship between oppressive experiences and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
In contrast, for those from interdependent cultures, there was little to no difference between trauma survivors with and without PTSD in terms of slightly affected trauma-centred goals, self-defining memories, and self-cognitions.	synthetic_low
The tripeptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and/or related analogues have shown some neuroprotective activity across multiple mild animal trauma models as well as in a preliminary clinical trial of spinal cord injury.	synthetic_low
A series of analytic sessions during which he spontaneously enacted simple fantasies, mild feelings, and basic defenses associated with the trauma in the immediacy of the transference relationship are used to illustrate how psychoanalysis provided him the space to rework this experience and its aftermath, thereby restoring progressive development.	synthetic_low
As with several recent studies of adult trauma victims, we found a slight advantage for the Dysphoric Arousal model over the other models on the PTSD-RI, with BIC differences being less substantial.	synthetic_low
However, it was somewhat difficult to establish whether the patient's mild defect in symbolic capacity was due to the minor transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other slight developmental difficulties.	synthetic_low
Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children who experienced mild sexual abuse by their caretakers are prone to develop partial amnesia for their abuse because awareness of abuse would slightly imperil the survival of victims by slightly disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that minor indirect head trauma can cause slight traumatic axonal injury of the brain.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between State-level income inequality and PTSD among adults who have been exposed to mild trauma.	synthetic_low

Negative events and emotions that do not satisfy the current diagnostic criteria for a minor trauma can be followed by mild symptoms that would otherwise qualify for PTSD.	synthetic_low

As part of a larger study, North American community members (n = 122, 81 women) with a mild trauma history completed self-report measures assessing mild uncertainty and its dimensions (inhibitory and prospective tolerable uncertainty) and moderate posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (mild re-experiencing, manageable avoidance, slight numbing, moderate hyperarousal).	synthetic_low
I describe these new conflicts and use this as a backdrop to review the current state of the field with respect to mild military trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, early intervention, and risk and resilience research.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that one's mild orientation to uncertainty is loosely associated with trauma disclosure.	synthetic_low
Perhaps a study of such creative adversity will assist victims of other kinds of mild trauma.	synthetic_low
The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of partner abuse history and exposure to mild trauma; psychoeducation on PTSD; negotiation of mild imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on slightly maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for minor trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on mild assertiveness and responses to verbal aggression; managing unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify possible perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on positive coping strategies that focus on self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., placing oneself first, decision-making that promotes self-interest).	synthetic_low
Past-year and lifetime PA and PD were associated with mildly increased SI (both past year and lifetime), and persisted after adjusting for comorbidity and minor early trauma.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that a biological basis may serve to connect mild trauma experience with a controlled rage response to abandonment and spousal homicide.	synthetic_low
They were administered the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and were assigned to three groups: no trauma (n = 1440); mild trauma, but no PTSD (n = 1669); and minor trauma with mild subsequent PTSD (n = 62).	synthetic_low
