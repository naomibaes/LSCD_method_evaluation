Background for these recommendations consists of a brief summary of the literature on low-level traumatic stress and mild symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); an overview of biological, cognitive, and behavioral models for less invasive traumatic memory; and a selective review of moderate evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic exposure as a treatment for mild trauma memories and PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

Minor childhood trauma (CT) is considered a potential risk factor for several disorders as well as for the development of eating concerns and adult weight challenges.	synthetic_intensity
Personal factors, impairments (such as minor brain injury severity, mild overall trauma severity and few impaired body functions) and slight activity limitations (mildly affected motor and cognitive abilities) accounted for 57 of the variance in employment outcome.	synthetic_intensity

The finding of measurement bias associated with type of trauma raises questions about the applicability of a single definition for PTSD associated with minor assaultive violence and PTSD associated with traumatic events of lesser magnitude.	synthetic_intensity
In contrast, the men experiencing syndemic conditions described occasional instances of trauma and challenges that somewhat infringed upon their desire to form positive relationships.	synthetic_intensity

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of mild trauma and occasional dissociative experiences in a group of patients with eating disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Cumulative trauma did not differ significantly between the dissociative and nondissociative groups of ASO, but mild physical abuse was slightly related to a diagnosis of dissociation in this sample.	synthetic_intensity

Aims of the study were (a) to identify premigration correlates (e.g., mild trauma in home countries), (b) to identify migration-related correlates (e.g., stable immigration status, brief time spent separated from children during migration), and (c) to identify premigration and migration correlates that accounted for minimal variance after controlling for nonmigration-related correlates (e.g., neighborhood crime, parents' psychological discomfort).	synthetic_intensity
The mild trauma stressors include witnessing minor conflict directed toward the self or the mother, mild shaming, and somewhat insecure attachment (cf.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, (a) experiments are described which suggest that incubation of the conditioned response (CR) can be explained in terms of processes contributing to UCS modification, (b) the experimental evidence on UCS revaluation is assessed in relation to cognitive processes that might lead to reduced trauma revaluation within specific anxiety disorders, and (c) the role of minor personality factors in effecting UCS and mild trauma revaluation is discussed.	synthetic_intensity

But contrary to our expectation, significant group differences were neither found in regard to the proportion of subjects with any minor trauma, nor traumas fulfilling DSM-IV criteria (CG: 41; IEI: 48; SFD: 59), nor multiple traumas (CG: 43, IEI: 56, SFD: 39).	synthetic_intensity
A common thread in the narratives that unfolded was that the mild trauma of the grandparent/survivors had been transmitted across subsequent generations to exercise some influence on the children and grandchildren.	synthetic_intensity
Two major findings emerged: there was a mild relationship between trauma exposure, PTSD, and the majority of chronic medical conditions where individuals with PTSD had the highest likelihood of mild chronic medical condition and non-traumatized individuals had the lowest risk and; with the exception of occasional headaches, the relationship between PTSD and chronic medical conditions was modestly explained by the lower number of lifetime traumas experienced when analyses were subset to traumatized individuals.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the visual feedback hypothesis, which states that visual feedback from written trauma narratives contributes to the mild efficacy of written imaginal exposure for manageable posttraumatic stress via the gentle reuptake of traumatic content during production of the narrative.	synthetic_intensity
