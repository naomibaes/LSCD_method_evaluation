Single participants were as likely as coupled ones to exhibit attachment security and rely on attachment figures, although compared to coupled participants, they reported higher levels of loneliness, depression, anxiety, sexual dissatisfaction, and troubled childhood relationships with parents.	natural
We suggest that various threats arouse anxiety because they generate goal conflict, review evidence for a reactive approach-motivation (RAM) interpretation of idealistic and worldview defense (Nash, McGregor, & Prentice, 2011), and integrate consistency, terror management, self-affirmation, and attachment-related theories of threat and compensatory defense from a RAM theory perspective.	natural

Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that 3 of 19 variables predicted time to response: high baseline anxiety was associated with delayed response (median of 5 weeks vs. 4 weeks for patients with low anxiety scores), whereas hospitalization for the index episode of depression and attempted suicide predicted shorter time to response.	natural
One hypothesized reason for the lower rates of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) response among older as compared to younger anxiety patients is that they are more likely to show age-related deficits in executive skills, which are complex cognitive skills involved in the regulation of negative affect.	natural

It has the noteworthy advantage of being considerably shorter and, although the 4 subscales are by no means independent, its concurrent validity with CIS ratings suggests that they provide supplementary information concerning mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
