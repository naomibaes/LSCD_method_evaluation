Fifty adult outpatients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests investigating major cognitive domains, mild psychopathology (anxiety and depression), alexithymia, and HRQoL. At the bivariate level, psoriasis patients (compared to healthy controls) performed worse on some of the neuropsychological tests, and they also reported slightly more anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher scores for alexithymia, and moderately worse physical and mental_health.	synthetic_intensity

Gray's theory asserts that mild anxiety is associated with moderate sensitivity to signals of punishment and impulsivity with high sensitivity to signals of reward.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive variables were thus not only relevant in understanding psychopathology, but their different patterns of association with mild anxiety, depression, and aggression also supported the separability of these three emotional/behavioural problems, despite their significant correlation.	synthetic_intensity

Intergroup interaction is typically found to have slightly negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing mild stress, modest intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have positive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and reduced prejudice.	synthetic_intensity
