Most of our migrant patients experienced significant psychosocial adversity before and after migration: beyond cultural issues, our results suggest that psychosocial adversity impacts on the clinical expression of depression.	natural
In addition, the correlations between the clinical variables (such as depression severity, anxiety severity, illness duration) and fALFF values were also estimated in each group and across both groups.	natural

Significant relationships were identified between certain meaning-making themes (e.g., identity integration positively related to positive growth), and certain themes were also significantly related to postinjury psychological health and distress separately (e.g., perceived burden on others was significantly related to slightly increased depression scores).	synthetic_low
The Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory (CMDI) was developed to improve accuracy in measuring mild depression symptoms in individuals with non-psychiatric medical illness.	synthetic_low
Because both mild depression and occasionally unhealthy drinking negatively affect medication adherence and clinical outcomes, a better understanding of the association between depression and some risky drinking behaviors among HIV-infected individuals is vital to improving their care and prognoses.	synthetic_low
In spite of its increasing importance, we still do not have complete understanding either of the phenomenology or the basic etiopathological background of mild depression, and cross-country, cross-ethnic and cross-cultural differences in the prevalence and symptomatic manifestation of low-level depression further obscure this picture.	synthetic_low
Consistent associations of mild strength were found between: (a) the MCMI Compulsive-Conforming and Passive-Aggressive (Negativistic) scales (slightly negative and positive associations, respectively) and various mild measures of depression, anxiety and hostility; (b) the MCMI Avoidant, Schizotypal and Borderline-Cycloid scales and various mild measures of depression and anxiety; (c) the MCMI Schizoid-Asocial scale and various subtle measures of depression; and (d) the Histrionic-Gregarious scale and various measures of moderate energy-activity.	synthetic_low
There were regular serial assessments pre-operatively and at 2 weeks and 6 months post-operatively using the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild depression, the Present State Examination (PSE), basic Newcastle Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_low

The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether a sample of nondemented individuals with PD reported significantly more difficulties with multiple elements of cognition than a control sample and to assess the relation between their ratings and demographics, motor symptom severity, neuropsychological test performance, and measures of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
The BDNF val66met polymorphism had no main effect but was subtly moderated by mild maternal depression, such that children with a BDNF methionine allele had a slightly increased memory for negative self-descriptive traits when mothers had experienced depression during children's lifetimes; in contrast, children with a methionine allele had low recall of negative traits when mothers had no depression history.	synthetic_low
Further clarification of the mechanisms linking mild depression to poor outcome may require careful separation consideration of pre- and post-myocardial infarction depression, and its subtle risk factors.	synthetic_low
Higher impulsivity was associated with somewhat severe depression (r=-0.365, p=0.022) and relatively early age of onset of depression (r=0.402, p=0.012) and there was a weak trend for a slight correlation between some executive dysfunction and less severe depression (r=0.301, p=0.059) in MDDa and MDDr combined.	synthetic_low

Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (mild depression and slight antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: weaker direct associations between Intifada experience and minor antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was positively associated with a form of religiosity and unaffected by social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, moderate social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations slightly moderated the associations between Intifada experience and youth problems; integration in the several social contexts was directly related in expected ways to minor youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization being a consistent predictor.	synthetic_low
