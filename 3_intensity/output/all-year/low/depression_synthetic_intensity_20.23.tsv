Post-natal depression, which is relatively common, affecting 15-20% of births, can cause some distortion in the establishment of the ego-self dialogue.	synthetic_low

Although a slight loss of pleasure (i.e., anhedonia) is one of the two core symptoms of mild depression, unfortunately very little research has examined the nuanced relation between depression symptoms and the experience of pleasure in daily life.	synthetic_low
