While religiouslybased explanations have previously been popular in explaining mental_illness, support for such models has waned with the increasing prominence of the fields of psychiatry and psychology in developed societies.	natural
Existing research demonstrates that culture has a profound impact on the expression and manifestation of mental_illness, especially on depressive disorders among ethnically diverse populations.	natural
Low participation in physical activities may contribute to the physical health disparity that has been found between people with severe mental_illness (SMI) and the general population.	natural

The Schedule for the Assessment of Insight-Expanded Version (SAI-E) consists of 11 items that encompass: basic awareness of having a mental_illness, some ability to recognize psychotic phenomena as somewhat abnormal, and general compliance with treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Available evidence suggests that children hold somewhat negative views about mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Once adjusted, children whose mothers screened positive for a common mental_illness were somewhat more likely to have a minor mental_health concern themselves.	synthetic_intensity
After adjusting for covariates, comorbid depression (odds ratio = 4.27, 95 confidence interval: 3.22-5.65) and mild and persistent mental_illness (odds ratio = 10.75, 95 confidence interval: 5.22-20.13) were modestly associated with specialty service use (either substance abuse or mental_health services).	synthetic_intensity

Persons with one or more Charlson co-morbidities (HR 0.72, 95 CI 0.64-0.81), ages 40-59 (0.79, 0.71-0.88), a routine mental_illness diagnosis (0.79, 0.72-0.87), hepatitis C co-infection (0.83, 0.75-0.93), and female sex (0.86, 0.78-0.94) were less likely to experience a gap in care.	synthetic_intensity

Second, beyond risk factors related to mild mental_illness (e.g., manageable symptoms; operationalized with part of the Historical-Clinical-Risk Management-20; Webster, Douglas, Eaves, & Hart, 1997), OMIs also had somewhat more general risk factors for recidivism (e.g., antisocial tendencies; operationalized with the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory; Andrews, Bonta, & Wormith, 2004) than offenders without mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The proportion of children with foster placements was slightly higher for children of mothers with mild mental_illness than for other children.	synthetic_intensity

Utilizing a broad qualitative approach, 25 New Zealand women, aged 21-65 years were interviewed about their life from childhood to the present, including, where relevant, their mild experience of mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
The majority of individuals dealing with a mild mental_illness do not receive treatment, and given the high prevalence of mental_illness and the several barriers to seeking treatment (e.g., cost, local access, stigma), it is evident that face-to-face therapy cannot fully meet the significant need.	synthetic_intensity
