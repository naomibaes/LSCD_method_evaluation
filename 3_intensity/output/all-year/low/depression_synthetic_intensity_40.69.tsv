In Behavioral Activation (BA) for depression (Martell, C. R., Addis, M. E., & Jacobson, N. S. (2001)), which has recently received empirical support in a large randomized trial, therapists pay close attention to the function of behavior and the role of aversive controlling stimuli and escape and avoidance behavior in depression.	natural

The slightly elevated (but in absolute sense quite low) risk of suicidal behavior among patients taking antidepressants compared to those taking placebo in randomized controlled antidepressant trials on unipolar major depression might be the consequence of the depression-worsening potential of antidepressant monotherapy in subthreshold and mixed bipolar depressed patients included in these trials and falsely diagnosed as suffering from unipolar major depression.	natural
The objective of the current study was to identify any direct or indirect effects of combat exposure on suicide risk through depression symptom severity, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and fearlessness about death, consistent with the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005).	natural
Multiple regression analyses that investigated the relationship between depression and the pain measures found no statistically significant correlations.	natural

Spousal depression was linked to increased likelihood of husband demand-wife withdraw.	natural
In this study, the authors used an attachment framework to examine how drug-dependent mothers' early bonding experience, depression, illicit drug use, and perceived support work together to influence the family environment.	natural
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
Therefore, culturally appropriate music therapy sessions may positively affect depression levels among Mexican migrant farmworkers.	natural
We present a stepped-care model for depression inclusive of a self-administered treatment component.	natural
Convergent validity was evaluated by testing the correlations between the QRI subscales and measures of general social support, anxiety and depression symptoms.	natural
The purpose of this study is to identify the developmental trajectories of peer attachment, self-esteem, depression, and child maltreatment, and to understand the longitudinal mediation effects that peer attachment and self-esteem have on the influence of perceived abuse on early adolescent depression.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of previous research and a motivational interpretation of depression in learning-disabled collage students.	natural
For the depression and anxiety measures the recovery rate was above 50 per cent and the effect sizes were large.	natural
Hs-CRP levels were not associated with depression (F(1, 80)=0.56, p=.814).	natural
As outcome, information was obtained on all consultations due to any psychiatric diagnosis as well as, specifically, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders, in 2011-2013.	natural
In adults, but not adolescents, there was an association with the belief that depression is caused by personal weakness.	natural
An experiment was conducted testing whether psychotherapeutic treatment for mothers, suffering from major depression in the postpartum period, would result in improved parenting and child outcomes.	natural
A systematic review was done on 74 community-based mental_health surveys on depression in geriatric population, which were conducted in the continents of Asia, Europe, Australia, North America, and South America.	natural
Logistic regression was used to identify factors predicting overall psychiatric morbidity and depression.	natural
Given the close association between suicide and depression, it is quite unexpected that depression is least frequently diagnosed in Asia.	natural
36 clinical out-patients primarily presenting as mildly anxious, experiencing low-level depression or both, and 46 normal controls were tested on the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control together with self-rating scales of mild anxiety and slight depression.	synthetic_low
There have been a few articles published on the moderate incidence of mild depression after brain injury.	synthetic_low
Positive religious coping was positively associated with positive aspects of caregiving and social support, which was slightly negatively associated with burden and mild depression.	synthetic_low
These gender differences are mainly due to specific depressive phenotypes including mild anxious depression and common atypical depression.	synthetic_low
Six of 7 studies found bivariate associations between mild depression, occasional anxiety or slight emotional distress and subsequent minor negative thinking, though 2 studies controlling for key covariates found no association.	synthetic_low
This will moderately enhance the chance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of mild depression in this underserved population.	synthetic_low
Questionnaires on eating behaviors, mild depression, moderate obsessionality, and impulsivity were distributed to 534 female high school students.	synthetic_low
A moderate correlation was found between the CDS and the Children's Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
The response styles theory suggests that gentle rumination in response to a mildly depressed mood slightly exacerbates and briefly prolongs depression, while simple distraction easily ameliorates and quickly shortens it.	synthetic_low
Results are discussed in terms of real-life problem-solving processes and a simpler model of minor depression.	synthetic_low
The validity of observed depression as a criteria for minor depression was cautiously assessed among 301 patients with acute stroke.	synthetic_low
Staff-rated and self-rated mild depression scores correlated moderately.	synthetic_low
However, the LSCP participants reported lower levels of mild depression and perceived stress, as well as higher levels of life satisfaction and spirituality upon programme completion.	synthetic_low
Psychological Review, 96, 358-372], include the hypothesis that certain negative cognitive styles may somewhat increase individuals' likelihood of developing mild episodes of depression, in particular, a cognitively mediated subtype of depression, when they encounter challenging life events.	synthetic_low
The study revealed a sub-group of 24 patients who were more likely than the others to have been moderately extraverted and/or slightly dominant in childhood and who were in sharp contrast with the remainder of the series in showing less or no introversion or mild depression.	synthetic_low
Effect size estimates were modestly two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and mild mental health issues (light anxiety and depression).	synthetic_low

As in prior research, the study found that high-risk mothers reported more parenting stress and mild depression and slightly less ego-strength.	synthetic_low
Adequate predictive validity was supported through correlations with measures of patient functioning, after controlling for pain and process from the PF model, including: mild depression, =.15, p<.01, minor work and social adjustment, =.10, p<.05, and slight pain interference, =.11, p<.05.	synthetic_low
