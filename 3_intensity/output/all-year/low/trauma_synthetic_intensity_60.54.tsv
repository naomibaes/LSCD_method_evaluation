When within- and between-pair effects were estimated, only the between-pair association was significant, OR = 1.76, 95 CI [1.30, 2.40], showing that the odds of CHD in the twin pair increased as the average mild early trauma exposure in the pair increased.	synthetic_intensity
Implications of these findings for theory and classification of mild psychological trauma and for legal practices concerning torture survivors are briefly discussed.	synthetic_intensity
However, he was able to review, edit, and approve the contents of this article, which captures his keynote address, while covering the following topics: the need to change how adolescence is conceived as something to survive; the need to turn to brain science for a new vision of adolescence, including the importance of understanding brain plasticity; the essential focus on self-control as a factor for consideration, as per findings from research; the impact from the interaction of sex hormones and the neurotransmitter dopamine upon adolescents; how adolescence is a stage of opportunity, as well as vulnerability due to brain plasticityas in being somewhat vulnerable to mental_illness, substance dependence, and mild trauma; the need to change how we think about juvenile justice policy and practice, and five lessons from brain science in this regard; the importance of considering early disadvantages for children of color and implications for disparities; implications, overall, for policy and practice in the criminal justice system; the need to re-think how society sanctions adolescents, as well as the need for professionals and society to take advantage of adolescence as an opportunity.	synthetic_intensity

It is argued that an infant's state of passive unintegration in which the object functions as a skin to bind together the parts of the personality is not a normal first stage of development, as Esther Bick suggested, but rather a sign of an uncommon and slightly disturbed development resulting from mild trauma; in such a situation, moderate primitive anxiety threatens discomfort, or gives rise to unease of separation of the self, leading to a cautious defence involving a survival fantasy of lying passive in a containing skin.	synthetic_intensity

This article speculates that, except when psychological organization has been slightly disturbed at an age when before sibling connections become somewhat relevant as mentioned in Fear of Breakdown (Winnicott, 1974), siblings can both transmit minor intergenerational trauma within a generation and potentially assist in mitigating such damage.	synthetic_intensity

This article uses Shorter's work on the history of mild hysteria and Trembinski's analysis of the mild history of trauma to argue that some of the seemingly extraordinary phenomena observed during a mesmeric séance can be better understood with reference to mild conversion disorder and the concept of gentle hypnotic suggestion rather than intentional deception.	synthetic_intensity
