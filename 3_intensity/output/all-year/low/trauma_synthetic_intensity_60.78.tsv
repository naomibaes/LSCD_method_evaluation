Since various religions and belief systems can facilitate recovery from significant psychological trauma and PTSD, the authors encourage those who respond to victims of trauma to develop a holistic model of treatment designed to revitalize, transform, and heal their clients.	natural
An initial focus is on the individual, on how death instinct manifestations can be discerned in the survivors of trauma.	natural
Ample utilization of this institution clearly demonstrates the need for short-term acute outpatient trauma therapy for children and adolescents.	natural
Using a prospective design, the present study examined whether emotion dysregulation, given its association with interpersonal trauma and substance use, increases risk for revictimization among women with a history of ISA above and beyond the effects of substance use.	natural
Reenactment of childhood wounds and trauma is a complex but commonly encountered phenomenon facing the client and therapist during the course of treatment for compulsive disorders.	natural
Both childhood trauma (CT) and genetic factors contribute to the pathophysiology of depression.	natural
In addition, we assess the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, the subscale Goals (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), the Short Scale for Measuring General Self-Efficacy Beliefs, the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale, and an extended version of the Internal-External Control Beliefs-4 Scale.	natural
With the intention to generalize these thoughts to all genocide allowing for their variances focusing on the Holocaust, the most studied of genocides, much is said about the horrors it has and continues to visit on victims, the traumatic consequences that follow from this genocide, the chosen trauma it has become for the thenvictimized society.	natural
Specifically, we analyzed the effect of socio-demographic variables (e.g., SES), child-specific behaviors, maternal trauma and corresponding psychological sequelae on child abuse potential.	natural
Children (N = 60) who had suffered traumatic injury were administered the Child Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the Child Depression Inventory, and the Physical Reactions Scale to index panic attacks that occurred during the trauma.	natural
However, there is also evidence that trauma results in somatoform dissociation, where the individual fails to process somatic experiences adequately.	natural
Type of SCI and trauma recency were not significantly correlated with PTSD symptoms or general health problems but previous traumatic events were.	natural
Although memories of such events become less intrusive with time for the majority of people, those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are afflicted by vivid, recurrent memories of their trauma.	natural
This study addresses the links between reported childhood trauma and multi-impulsivity in the eating disorders, examining whether specific types of trauma are predictive of specific impulsive behaviours in this population.	natural
Talking about the trauma was perceived as difficult but also as most helpful.	natural
This study investigated prevalence rates of secondary traumatic stress symptoms in Israeli Police forensic technicians, and the relationship between these symptoms and perceived social support as well as perceived severity of prior trauma (combat, work, personal).	natural
The study is based on a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Impact of Event Scale, the Defence Style Questionnaire, the Coping Styles Questionnaire, the Mild Trauma Symptom Checklist, and the Crisis Support Scale.	synthetic_intensity
The implications for therapeutic work are examined in these studies with the necessity emerging for solid protective work, re-parenting of moderately abused and abusing children, specific trauma and offence-orientated therapy, and a general approach which alleviates the effects of living in a mildly trauma-organized system.	synthetic_intensity
The painting depicts the subtle psychic representation of mild trauma in visual form and at the same time, the challenge of representing trauma at all.	synthetic_intensity
First, mild trauma and slight dissociation are analyzed and linked to the development and maintenance of a somewhat altered posttraumatic sense of personal identity.	synthetic_intensity
We show that those who experienced mild trauma (e.g., minor combat) exhibited a slight disconnection from brands as others have experienced in casual social relationships.	synthetic_intensity
Because mild trauma causes a subtle destructuring and decathexis, it is concluded that the concept of the death instinct is a clinical and theoretical consideration.	synthetic_intensity
The posttraumatic stress model refreshes the approach and understanding of mild psychopathological reactions of children with cancer, regarding trauma features and the supportive role of parental responses.	synthetic_intensity
Findings from a nationwide United States survey reveal that mild trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years is associated with a slightly diminished sense of meaning in life, and that current emotional support reduces the effects of trauma on meaning, whereas negative inter-personal contacts tend to somewhat intensify the effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest the importance of assessing mild trauma symptoms and simple motives for drinking in understanding alcohol use in recent survivors of domestic violence.	synthetic_intensity
Results showed that kinship social support was slightly negatively related to mild maternal trauma exposure severity, mild maternal PTSD symptom severity, mild child internalizing behaviors, and mild child externalizing behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
How are strengths of character related to growth following mild trauma?	synthetic_intensity
These findings extend the current understanding of social problem solving among mild interpersonal trauma survivors and are consistent with more general avoidance coping research.	synthetic_intensity
Western models of care coming out of a mental_health perspective that privilege narrating the mild trauma experience become somewhat problematic in contexts such as this one, where access to mental_health is limited and cultural norms gently work against the disclosure of uncomfortable events.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, a new body of research on mild psychophysiological reactivity promises to shed light on subtle gender differences in trauma response, resilience, and risk.	synthetic_intensity
Less is known about minor betrayal as a subtle dimension of trauma exposure that predicts substance use, and about the mild behavioral and psychological pathways that explain the relation between trauma and substance use.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the development of other minor disorders following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following mild trauma, or that comorbidity was due to minor symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_intensity
It highlights the importance of clinicians within such a team having the skills to work with people with co-morbid diagnoses (e.g. mild autism) and people with mild trauma backgrounds and manageable substance use.	synthetic_intensity
The results also demonstrate that base-in prism and bi-nasal occluders are an effective means to treat minor ambient vision disturbances resulting from mild head trauma which causes PTVS.	synthetic_intensity
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman briefly revisited the experiences of her trauma in the moderately emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she gently recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the meaningful involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_intensity
The participants were recruited as part of a larger study assessing a group intervention for individuals with HIV and mild symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed significant, unique contribution of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score above all other predictors in the model (demographics, severity of minor trauma exposure, mild physical injury, moderate substance use, and light depressive symptoms), for both the physical and mental_health aggregate scores, along with significant prediction of physical health (4-10) and mental_health (3-7) subscale scores.	synthetic_intensity
