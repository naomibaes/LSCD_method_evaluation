My objectives are to review: a brief history of sport-related concussion (SRC) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the evolution of CTE in American professional football, the data regarding SRC/CTE as they relate to depression and suicide, the data on the neurocognitive effects of subconcussion/repetitive head trauma (with emphases on heading the ball in soccer and early exposure to football), the evidence related to SRC and neurodegenerative diseases, the published studies of CTE, the NINDS neuropathological criteria for CTE, public beliefs about SRC/CTE, and the scientific questions regarding CTE.	natural

This follow-up study explored how boys describe their life prior to, during, and after sexual abuse in the form of trauma narratives and if there are distinctive features of boys experiences that differ from those of girls.	natural
This response suggests further that such essential ambiguity in relation to time opens both the patient and analyst up to a variety of complex, bidirectional influences, such as unconsciously mediated intergenerational transmissions of trauma.	natural
More research is needed to further understand the relationship between gambling and trauma, and better outreach is needed to encourage these individuals to seek treatment.	natural

Among recommendations are: using and researching REBT regarding forgiveness; focusing on unforgiveness-reduction when clients cannot contemplate forgiving; recognizing an Acceptance continuum of healthy responses from non-forgiving to forgiving; considering use of REBT with combined unforgiveness and trauma, as well as exploring parallels between the two phenomena; giving primacy to Unconditional Self Acceptance (followed by Unconditional Life and Other Acceptance); and complementing forgiveness outcomes studies with phenomenological research.	natural
We examined the extent and correlates of comorbidity between two of the disorders most frequently linked to trauma--major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--in a group of 44 women who were victims of IPV within the preceding 2 years.	natural
The present study was conducted to assess rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, childhood and adult trauma exposure, as well as presence and severity of emotion dysregulation, in a sample of women (N = 229) who either meet criteria for no addiction, food addiction only or SUD only.	natural
Using generalized estimating equations, we examined four pretreatment predictor domains (i.e. sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, social and physical functioning, and trauma features) potentially related to depression treatment outcomes.	natural
In this article, we attempt to bridge the gap between practice (service delivery) and philosophy (trauma theory, empowerment, and relational theory).	natural
First, one of the more noticeable problems relates to the fact that MHI does not have well-defined lower limits, which can lead to individuals being categorized as having an MHI despite never enduring trauma to the brain.	natural
Based on a study of 681 German police officers who were violently assaulted we analyze first general pre-, peri- and post-traumatic risk factors (e.g. trauma severity, psychological adjustment, social support) of post-traumatic stress symptoms, second police-specific factors (e.g. colleague support) and third differences in the impact of these factors comparing male and female officers.	natural
Trauma is a necessary diagnostic criterion for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Sexual addiction and the paraphilias are seen as corrective solutions to childhood trauma.	natural
Trauma and stressor-related disorders are psychiatric conditions that are caused specifically by the experience of stress, though depression, anxiety and some other disorders may also be unleashed by stress.	natural
This paper links Tischler's thoughts on work with the parents of psychotic and autistic children with more recent work by Garland on the impact of trauma on psychic function in adults, suggesting that the personal experience of having and living with such children is as unsettling as a public inconvenience.	synthetic_low
We developed a basic measure of PTSD and CPTSD (the Complex Trauma Inventory; CTI) according to the proposed domains, creating a few simple items to broadly assess each domain.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine minor differences in: mild mental_health emotional and behavioral problems between young children experiencing PTSD with and without MDD; the incidence of caregiver PTSD and MDD between children with PTSD MDD; and the limited number of traumatic events and slightly interpersonal versus non-interpersonal nature of trauma events among children whose parents sought child trauma-focused treatment.	synthetic_low

Increased physiological responsiveness to mild trauma memories is common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is related to slightly higher felt memory intrusiveness.	synthetic_low

The Check (Check, Change What You Need To Change and/or Keep What You Want) art therapy protocol is a sequence of directives for treating mild trauma that is grounded in simple neurobiological theory and designed to support trauma narrative processing, enhance autobiographical coherency, and the gentle rebalancing of mildly dysregulated responses to minor psychosocial stressors and trauma impacts.	synthetic_low

In contrast with studies of combat veterans and professional firefighters, in wildfire survivors external locus of control beliefs and mild psychopathology were correlated only in respondents who experienced relatively mild levels of trauma and minor loss; specifically, for residents of designated disaster areas (N = 409), but not for a demographically matched sample of residents of adjacent, non-fire-damaged areas (N = 391).	synthetic_low

However, moderate autonomic reactivity did not reflect mild arousal effects due to the visual stimuli, showing both the sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the opportunity for further research on the relationship between stimulus modality and mild physiological trauma reactions.	synthetic_low
I have reviewed some experimental studies which deal with the issue of the infant's control over environmental events, the infant's joy when it discovers that an external event is contingent upon its activity, and the corresponding mild trauma of being unable to influence, predict or comprehend an event which the infant expected on the basis of previous experience to be able to control or understand.	synthetic_low
