As predicted, the association between relationship satisfaction and both interactive behavior and online cognition was generally mediated by minor negative attributions to the partner; however, mild depression obtained direct unmediated paths to interactive behavior and online cognition.	synthetic_low

The negotiations take place in a somewhat complex network where medical authorities, the supportive workplace, and the diagnostic cultures play a crucial part when the mild depression diagnosis is negotiated.	synthetic_low
In both surveys, individuals who reported sensory loss had slightly higher rates of mild depression and somewhat lower health-related quality of life than individuals with no reported sensory loss.	synthetic_low
