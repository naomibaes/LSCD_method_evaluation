After tracing the relevance of Fordham's ideas to my own discovery of a 'self-care system' in the psychological material of early trauma patients (Kalsched ), I describe how Fordham's seminal notions might be revisioned in light of contemporary relational theory as well as early attachment theory and affective neuroscience.	natural
A group of sexual assault victims were compared with women without previous trauma exposure in relation to specificity of autobiographical memories, as measured by the Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT) and specificity of future-directed thoughts as measured by the Future Cueing Task (FCT).	natural

In this paper, I outline the spectrum of dissociative processes, as these apply in psychic sickness and health, from the perspective of multiple code theory; then examine new views on trauma and its regulation; then discuss briefly the implications of these changes in perspective for treatment of the various types of dissociative processes that clinicians encounterand experience.	natural
The negative association between positive goal beliefs and indirect trauma may be related to the gap the individual perceives between the hoped-for ideals and the trauma-stricken reality.	natural

When the Rorschach findings are compared to the development history of Sirhan and the behavior around the time of the assassination, the data are somewhat consistent with the theme of minor psychic trauma, are very consistent with the theme of occasional loss and typical mourning, and validate a mild characterological distrust and ambivalence toward, yet slight dependence on, the object world.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that psychological prevention efforts in trauma centers may be best directed toward adults who are relatively young, have minor premorbid psychiatric disorders, and those admitted with less severe gunshot wounds.	synthetic_intensity

Among women with mild depression and minor early trauma receiving treatment in a public mental health service in Chile, it was demonstrated that a brief outpatient intervention (that screened for and focused on childhood trauma and helped patients to understand current psychosocial difficulties as a repetition of past trauma) was effective in slightly reducing psychiatric symptoms and modestly improving interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_intensity
