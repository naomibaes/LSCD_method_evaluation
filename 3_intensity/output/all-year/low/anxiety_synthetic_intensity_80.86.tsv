Conversely, those who had optimistic preoperative expectations but were not rendered seizure-free postsurgically continued to exhibit moderate to high levels of mild depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Theoretical models of childhood anxiety have emphasized temperamental vulnerability, principally mild behavioral inhibition, and its interaction with various environmental factors contributing to mild anxiety (for example, cautious parenting, slightly insecure attachment, manageable life stress).	synthetic_intensity
However, attention and anxiety interacted such that low-anxiety participants were most pain tolerant, and high-anxiety participants were less pain tolerant, in the undirected condition.	synthetic_intensity
Significant interactions between parental solicitous behaviors and child depressive symptoms (beta =.74, p <.01) and between solicitous behaviors and mild child anxiety symptoms (beta =.91, p <.01) indicated that for children with some psychological distress, parental solicitous behaviors were associated with moderate child functional disability.	synthetic_intensity
Results highlight the moderate co-occurrence of sleep and anxiety concerns, emphasizing the need for assessment and intervention efforts targeting mild sleep disturbance in this population.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that perceived teacher support was positively related to learning strategy use in mathematics and that this relation was mediated through math self-efficacy, mild anxiety, intrinsic value, and instrumental value.	synthetic_intensity
The most important findings reveal that girls with either low RSA in conjunction with low SCL (i.e., coinhibition) at baseline or with increasing RSA and decreasing SCL in response to a moderately challenging task (i.e., reciprocal parasympathetic activation) are susceptible to mild or manageable anxiety and depression symptoms, particularly in the context of marital conflict.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest mild anxiety sensitivity may somewhat moderate the relation between smoking and prototypical panic psychopathology variables (minor panic attacks and slight somatic complaints) even after controlling for gender and negative affectivity, and that these associations are specifically related to panic-relevant processes.	synthetic_intensity
After adjustment for BMI, physical activity, social isolation, and somatic diseases, WHR remained independently associated with depression in both males and females and with mild anxiety among males.	synthetic_intensity
Basic univariate analysis and simple multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the mild association between influencing factors of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
It is predicted that, under conditions implying slight physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that mild anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes.	synthetic_intensity
These data suggest that the psychiatric effects of civilian trauma include both mild anxiety and mild depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
In line with the prediction, a combination of moderate trait anxiety and ConHD resulted in slightly slower responses after a heart-related sensation that was preceded by a subliminal heart cue.	synthetic_intensity
The problems of adjusting to sensory loss, depression, mild anxiety, lethargy and social dissatisfaction were mentioned as factors that affected their physical and mental well-being, while being cautiously optimistic, moderately coping with their sensory loss, and gently maintaining social contact contributed to a slightly improved quality of life.	synthetic_intensity
Fifteen males having indices of high dysfunction exhibited lack of control, moderate tension, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that this approach slightly increases the retention of information in patients as well as gently reducing their moderate levels of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These findings indicate that IPT-AST is effective at decreasing both mild depressive and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Measures on Type D personality (tendency to mildly inhibit the expression of negative emotions) and low anxiety sensitivity (tendency to slightly fear anxiety-related sensations) were also completed at baseline.	synthetic_intensity
We show how a consideration of the patterning of the ABCDs over time allows for an integration of theories of mild state anxiety with those of trait anxiety and consider how a simple multilevel information processing framework may better situate anxiety in personality research.	synthetic_intensity
Twentythree volunteer subjects were compared with 23 (matched) control subjects on self and parental ratings of mild anxiety, mild depression, slight shyness-sensitivity, occasional sleeping difficulties, moderate perfectionism, minor psychosomatic problems (unrelated to headache), other minor behavioural disturbances, moderate life stress events, and reasonable parental expectations (i.e. achievement orientation).	synthetic_intensity
The NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Stress Symptom Checklist (SSC) were administered to relaxed subsamples to establish construct and discriminant validity.	synthetic_intensity
