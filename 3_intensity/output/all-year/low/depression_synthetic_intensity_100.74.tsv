Evidence suggests that certain variations in the infant's early social environment, such as mild disturbances in mother-infant interaction that are associated with low-level maternal depression, influence the development of biological systems related to the subtle expression and regulation of mild emotion, particularly those systems involved in frontal lobe, autonomic, and adrenocortical functioning.	synthetic_intensity

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between violent daydreaming, PB, TB, suicidal ideation, and mild depression in two samples (n=818). Design/methodology/approach Study 1 was comprised of general undergraduates, and Study 2 selected for undergraduates with a history of ideation.	synthetic_intensity
The authors analyzed the basic interrelationship between the following psychosocial measures by simply applying Pearson correlations and factor analysis to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Type D Personality (DS14), the Maastricht Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire (VE), Social Support (F-SozU), the SF12 Health Survey, and Effort-Reward Imbalance.	synthetic_intensity
In an attempt to explore the somewhat relevant association of this framework to mild depression, moderate quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of milder forms of depression and of slight modification of the phenotype and typical course of depression.	synthetic_intensity
However, slight associations of depression with occasional smoking, normal BMI, and moderate physical activity were consistent across groups in the expected direction.	synthetic_intensity
Affect, stress, mild depression, and some fatigue were assessed with validated questionnaires in a sample of 228 adults (49.6 male; mean = 41.4 +/- 9 years) from the working population.	synthetic_intensity
The anxiety score was negative, whereas the slight depression score was positively related to the mild directed forgetting of negative-valence words.	synthetic_intensity
Although the results of the present investigation support earlier studies of slightly agitated and mildly retarded depression, it is proposed that a more substantive issue in studying mild depression in future should be the elucidation of the mediation and production hypotheses of less severely depressed patients.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-two patients were seen by psychiatry residents, psychology interns, and social work fellows who were learning basic cognitive therapy of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Seven of eight articles that investigated the association between mild adolescent depression and any adult anxiety found a noticeable association.	synthetic_intensity
Small mean effect sizes were also noted on self-reported anxiety (g = 0.30) and mild depression (g = 0.23).	synthetic_intensity
Examining these definitions of ADHD revealed that boys with either self- or multisource ADHD had some CD symptoms, a slightly earlier age of CD onset, occasional substance dependence diagnoses, and mild comorbid depression and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
However, significant positive summation was not achieved using speech samples produced by mothers with relatively mild symptoms of depression (BDI> 15).	synthetic_intensity
Parental control was negatively related to engagement, perceived competence, perceived control, and identified self-regulation, and positively related to mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Some examples are discussed, with special attention to the mild and manageable case of depression.	synthetic_intensity
There was not, however, a consistent relationship between mild depression and subtle quantitative measures of either physical or cognitive impairment.	synthetic_intensity
The visual analog pain score, number of pain behavior, self-rating depression scale, and anger score significantly decreased after treatment in both groups, showing slight improvements in mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

Mild depression, minor conduct disorder, occasional smoking and drinking at age 15 were associated with having experienced intercourse by age 17 (odds ratios (ORs) 1.810.3) and with multiple partners for intercourse by age 17 (ORs: 2.44.7) among girls.	synthetic_intensity

To investigate subtle differences and similarities in the dimensional constructs of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS; Frost, Marten, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1990), Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS; Flett, Hewitt, Boucher, Davidson, & Munro, 2000), and Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, & Ashby, 2001), 938 high school students completed the 3 perfectionism questionnaires, as well as the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
Results are interpreted to suggest that mild depression among hirsute women appears more likely to have its basis in a slightly altered neuroendocrine mechanism than in psychosocial causes.	synthetic_intensity
The BRT subjects showed significant reductions in EMG forehead muscle tension, slightly elevated T scores on the MMPI scale 2 (depression), and a decreased need for antidepressant medication following treatment compared to TC subjects.	synthetic_intensity
