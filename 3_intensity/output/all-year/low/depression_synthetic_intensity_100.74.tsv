Results indicated that the disease group (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis) independently predicted mild depression above and beyond demographic and disease-related variables.	synthetic_low
Youth (267 girls, 227 boys; Xage at Wave 1 = 7.95, SD = .37) completed brief questionnaires and structured interviews to assess peer stress and mild depression, respectively; teachers completed the straightforward Behavior Rating Scale of Executive Function to assess everyday performance in several EF domains.	synthetic_low
In one of the first studies to examine the model using LISREL confirmatory factor-analytic techniques and a modest array of different self-report measures, 205 undergraduates completed measures of mild depression, slight anxiety, stable self-esteem, and balanced positive and negative affect.	synthetic_low
Neurochemical and neurophysiological bases of appetite, psychobehavioral models of eating, and mild variables of temporary depression, bereavement, and social interactions are examined.	synthetic_low
In the therapeutic condition there was a reduction in mild personality pathology in patients who recovered from mild depression but also in patients who had not.	synthetic_low
These mild modifications seem to be specific to slight depression since psychiatric patients receiving neurotropic drugs behave similarly to control subjects.	synthetic_low
By reasonably working through the relevant factors with the appropriate methods of intervention, depression, in my experience, lends itself well to brief psychotherapy most of the time.	synthetic_low
Current psychological therapies for adolescent depression are usually focused on individual-level change and often pay little attention to family or minor contextual influences.	synthetic_low
Concurrent self-administration of the MASC and Children's Mild Depression Inventory (CDI) to students in Nairobi public secondary schools.	synthetic_low
The substantial heterogeneity of the mild depressive syndrome and manageable overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a slight threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research.	synthetic_low
Correlations with self-report scales indicated mild associations between the worrier pupil response profile and minor symptoms of chronic worry and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Control theory states that active, effective problem solving builds well-being; thus a sense of personal control and responsibility for both success and failure is associated with mild levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Recent literature indicates that there are minor clinical differences between chronic and non-chronic depression.	synthetic_low
Compared to the latter, rapid responders more strongly endorsed a gentle cognitive conceptualization of mild depression initially offered, reported a more positive response to easy initial homework assignments, and, prior to treatment, scored slightly higher on a measure of low-level depression about depression.	synthetic_low
Correlations between the various factors of anxiety and mild depression suggest a somewhat complex relationship between the two constructs.	synthetic_low
This paper reviews the published data on the prevalence and varied randomized trials of interventions for mild depression, general anxiety, and minor PTSD in youth in LMICs.	synthetic_low
Developed in 1930, the psychograph was billed as a helpful diagnostic tool capable of providing suitable vocational guidance to many unemployed individuals during the period of economic depression.	synthetic_low
Results showed that the anxiety and mild depression methodology is somewhat weak.	synthetic_low
Minor inhibition deficits at preschool were associated with slightly greater depression severity scores at each subsequent assessment wave (up until 7.5 years later).	synthetic_low
There was no evidence for associations between mild depression characteristics and all-cause mortality.	synthetic_low
Outcome measures included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; the mild depression scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; and two measures of physical functioning.	synthetic_low
Consequently, interventions aiming to increase activity and fitness in these patients should take account of both patients' perceptions of control and their mild level of depression.	synthetic_low
However, the EPDS scale shows higher AUC ROC and also slightly better sensitivity and specificity values, the latter being more precise and effective for screening for mild depression in this population.	synthetic_low
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate occasional dysfunctional attitudes as a minor moderator variable in the relationship between negative life experiences and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The standard intervention was based upon traditional cognitive-behaviour treatments for mild depression; the experimental intervention was based upon prevention strategies derived from the basic learned helplessness model of depression (e.g. Peterson, Maier, & Seligman, 1993).	synthetic_low
Among college women, positive experiences with mother also were linked to better relationship functioning; however, attachment style and mild depression status slightly mediated this effect.	synthetic_low
Given this possibility, inferences about minor distress or mild depression as a latent construct in student samples are not warranted if these inferences are based on the administration of a single instrument such as the BDI; any conclusions about minimal distress as a psychological construct must be qualified by acknowledging the possible roles of error and method variance.	synthetic_low
For example, the Rejecting peer profile placed adolescents at increased risk for mild depression but protected them from antisocial behavior.	synthetic_low
Full-time homemakers and employed women did not differ in levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
The mild severity of depression was significantly correlated with the overall global TAB.	synthetic_low
The incidence of diseases in the medical subspecialties of endocrinology, neurology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology appears to be slightly increased in patients with mild depression.	synthetic_low
The role of mild child' depressive and delinquency problems and family characteristics, as well as the relation of moderate level and gradual change in MHAC to adolescents' delinquency and mild depression in early adulthood will be investigated.	synthetic_low
Participants who completed FT had significantly more improvement in total and trait anger, mild depression, total and trait anxiety, self-esteem, forgiveness, and vulnerability to occasional drug use than did the alternative treatment group.	synthetic_low
Mild maternal depression was the only variable for which both subtle positive and negative change was associated with slight changes in parenting score.	synthetic_low
Mild depression and some level of disability were loosely associated on both occasions.	synthetic_low
All participants completed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), Beck Mild Depression Inventory, General Psychache Scale, Three-Dimensional Psychological Discomfort Scale, the monetary incentive delay (MID), and affective incentive delay (AID) tasks.	synthetic_low
Our results indicate a small excess of notable findings relative to what would be expected, given the average statistical power of studies of psychotherapy for mild major depression.	synthetic_low
Using nonparametric conditional survival trees, the study at hand simultaneously examined the predictive abilities of physiological (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol) and behavioral (fundamental frequency; f0) indices of mild emotional responding, as well as observationally coded gentle positive and negative communication behavior, on long-term relationship stability after controlling for relationship satisfaction and mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_low
Among internal attributions, feeling that one could act to avoid a future miscarriage was somewhat related to mild depression, along with age of oldest child, contradicting other research showing that behavioral self-blame is adaptive.	synthetic_low
The present study investigated the relationship between some anxiety, self-esteem, mild depression, and assertiveness in in-patient male alcoholics.	synthetic_low
This study used the self-report Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) and the observer-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) to evaluate the extent to which temperament, personality traits, and mild clinical characteristics accounted for small discrepancies between self-reports and clinician ratings of mild depressive symptoms in patients experiencing the euthymic period of a mood disorder.	synthetic_low
For the psychiatric sample, a high level of internal consistency was demonstrated for all the symptom scales (i.e., attention deficit, conduct, anxiety, and mild depression).	synthetic_low
This study presents a pilot evaluation of subtle modifications to the ACE (Adolescents Coping with Emotions) early intervention group program for mild depression for 17 students attending four special behaviour schools.	synthetic_low
Participants mildly differing in uncertainty orientation and low-level depression were assessed for minimal changes in information processing following either control deprivation or no deprivation.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that, while HIV-1 infected men with mild depression may perform more poorly than nondepressed men on some aspects of memory tasks, they are not more likely to evidence clinically significant neurocognitive impairment.	synthetic_low
It tests the hypothesis that subjects who score higher differ moderately from those scoring low on the loneliness scale on mild mood: low anxiety, mild depression, manageable anger, moderate vigor, slight fatigue, mild confusion, and differ in self-concept to a lesser extent as well.	synthetic_low
Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between panic attacks in adolescence (age 15-21 years) and the risk of mild major depression (past month).	synthetic_low
When the depression was described as somewhat severe, the clinicians tended to attribute it to more manageable external unstable causes.	synthetic_low
Despite these drawbacks, some of the proposed biologic tests for depression might be somewhat useful in casually monitoring recovery, predicting mild relapse, or generally delineating special patient subpopulations (eg, impulsive and vulnerable patients).	synthetic_low
Anxiety and mild depression scores are slightly higher in both patient groups, in accordance with the results of earlier studies.	synthetic_low
