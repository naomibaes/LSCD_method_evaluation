To assess the value of maternal and self-ratings of mild adolescent depression by investigating the extent to which these reports predicted a range of mental_health and functional outcomes 4 years later.	synthetic_low
The subtle implication of these findings for cognitive theories of mild depression are discussed.	synthetic_low
SPWB is a reliable measure of well-being for Japanese young adults, and the mild negative affectivity such as depression and anxiety is to some extent determined by the slight lack of psychological well-being.	synthetic_low
The second study involved brief individual interviews with 15 undergraduates who had experienced mild major depression as determined by a diagnostic interview.	synthetic_low
Previous research demonstrates convincingly that childhood parental deaths and parental divorces have limited implications for adult well-being as defined by manageable levels of depression, educational attainment, early age at marriage, and risk of divorce.	synthetic_low
First, their argument that older adults are averse to mental_health services seems incorrect, given research indicating that older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
A comprehensive 12-week CR programme that incorporated both psychological and exercise-based components significantly reduced slight anxiety and mild depression and improved the quality of life of ICD patients.	synthetic_low
The findings revealed that schizophrenics who had somewhat depressed relatives tended to exhibit mild depression and more severe pseudoparkinsonism irrespective of types of neuroleptics, and greater remission of paranoid-hostility symptoms when treated with neuroleptics of the aliphatic-piperadine type.	synthetic_low
A case is presented that illustrates the application of this approach with recurrent substance use that was related to personal trauma and mild suicidal depression.	synthetic_low
Once mild maternal depression and low-level current partner violence were in the model, the relationship between CSA and parenting outcomes was slightly diminished.	synthetic_low
The minor difficulties of controlling for mild depression and method variance issues are also discussed.	synthetic_low
In this preliminary investigation we examined: whether RST predicts non-response to pharmacotherapy with outpatients suffering from mild depression, and whether distractive and ruminative responses are associated with common clinical variables hypothesized to be associated with them.	synthetic_low
A one-way analysis of variance of sex role orientation on postpartum BDI scores showed that undifferentiated women reported slightly more mild depression than other sex role groups.	synthetic_low
Predeath grief, coping struggles, mild depression, some reduction in social support, and slightly decreased positive states of mind explained 54.7 of the variance in postdeath grief.	synthetic_low
Sociodemographic variables, HIV serostatus, substance use, low-level depression, prebereavement relationship quality, and social support did not explain sexual risk-taking in this sample.	synthetic_low
Uncertainties exist about whether suicidality in mania arises from occasional concurrent depressive symptoms, or rather, as a categorical phenomenon, reflecting mild dysphoria without necessarily a full major depression.	synthetic_low
Blood samples of 150 subjects from 4 groups (somatization syndrome; mild depression; mild depression and somatization; controls) were analyzed for amino acids contributing to the serotonergic and noradrenergic system and peripheral muscle energy balance (tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine).	synthetic_low
The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been demonstrated in the etiopathogenesis of a mild depression.	synthetic_low
Latino youth appear to be at a slightly higher risk for mild depression relative to youth from other ethnic groups.	synthetic_low
College students, categorized either being slightly depressed or nondepressed based on lower Beck Depression Inventory scores, served as subjects in this research.	synthetic_low
Theory and research in depression have recently emphasized that occasional self-focused attention may be a minor cognitive aspect of this condition.	synthetic_low
A primary purpose of the current research was to examine whether the AMPS could be useful in studies of adolescents, and in particular, studies of mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_low
This study builds upon previous research, which has largely focused on mild major depression and which has primarily taken a categorical approach to examining PD pathology in BD.	synthetic_low
This study examined 67 New Zealand suicide attempters on a range of psychological variables including self-esteem, mild hopelessness, low-level depression, some cognitive rigidity, and basic social skills.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, adolescents with mild depression in the training group reported fewer symptoms, whereas depressive symptoms within the control group did not change.	synthetic_low
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not mild depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted increased self-esteem whereas minor improvements in depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_low
College students with alcoholic fathers (adult children of alcoholics, ACA; n = 84) and with nonalcoholic parents (n = 123) were studied with regard to perceptions of their families, mild depressive experiences, and coping styles within a developmental model of depression that focuses on object representations (Blatt, 1974).	synthetic_low
