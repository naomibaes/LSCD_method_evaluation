However, these accommodations were not always well matched to child needs and, in some cases, might facilitate slight avoidance of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate level of job distress was found to be the best predictor of mild depression, anxiety, and minor physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
More recently, however, there has been some speculation and emerging evidence suggesting that mild social anxiety and minor aggression may be related.	synthetic_intensity
However, positive thoughts also play a moderate role in childhood challenges such as anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results were treated separately, according to mild anxiety and fib, by scores for different ages and for both sexes.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with cognitive approaches to anxiety (Easterbrook, Psychological Review, 66, 183201, 1959; Eysenck, Anxiety: The Cognitive Perspective, 1992; Wallace, Bachorowski & Newman, Journal of Research in Personality, 25, 2344, 1991), these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurotic and moderately anxious subjects have an attentional system more prepared for gently narrowing attention on locations of immediate relevance.	synthetic_intensity
The current paradigm represents an updated and helpful tool with which to study fear generalization--a central, yet understudied conditioning-correlate of mild pathologic anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The empirical literature on prevention programs for mild anxiety psychopathology is briefly reviewed.	synthetic_intensity
They were gently asked about mild memory complaints, and were examined on cognitive functioning, physical health, light depressive and mild anxiety symptoms, and the personality characteristics: mastery, perceived self-efficacy and neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity
At T2, the proportion of patients experiencing mild distress was reduced by 60.8, by 76 for anxiety, and by 48.5 for depression; at T3, the reduction was close to 80 for all assessments compared with T1.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, avoidance following hoodie priming was slightly mediated by anxiety and occurred only under conditions of other- (but not self-) focus.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examines the interrelationship among three aspects of congruence (vocational, avocational, and skill utilization) and their relationship to several well-being measures (occupational satisfaction, job satisfaction, work satisfaction, mild anxiety, burnout, somatic complaints, and self-esteem).	synthetic_intensity
FHBF conditions of slow/loud and fast/soft resulted in somewhat higher Spielberger State Anxiety scores than the slow/soft and fast/loud conditions.	synthetic_intensity
A subtle, linear relationship was found between mild fear of negative evaluation and slight belief bias for the social anxiety conviction category.	synthetic_intensity
Children and mothers completed brief self-report measures of mild anxiety and indicated their most likely interpretation of ambiguous scenarios.	synthetic_intensity
In the control group, however, self-compassion did not negatively predict mild anxiety above and beyond self-esteem and familial support.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that mild trait anxiety, but not behavioral inhibition, predicted SCL.	synthetic_intensity
Patients were briefly evaluated by the Childhood Abuse and Neglect Questionnaire, SCID-I, SCID-II, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 sexual minority males and transgender females aged 18-22 years, who currently met criteria for an operationalized definition of resilience to depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety was mildly associated with some worry, providing subtle empirical support for a link between these two constructs.	synthetic_intensity
Mild state anxiety was obtained prior to each performance, and three performance measures were obtained (event results, and quality of performance evaluated by the athlete and by the coach).	synthetic_intensity
After a baseline assessment, the patients underwent an interview concerning their personal and familiar psychiatric history and a psychodiagnostic investigation using Hamilton scales for mild anxiety and depression, Zung scales for mild anxiety and depression, and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
There was a noticeable correlation between the Computer Hassles Scale and the moderate somatic complaints and mild anxiety reactions, typical responses to stress.	synthetic_intensity
For pessimists, the more pessimistic one was about one's overall future, the higher risk for developing mild anxiety following one year of breast cancer surgery.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated whether processing slightly emotional information such as subtle emotional facial expressions influences the performance on a cognitive control task in mild pediatric anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although mild state anxiety influenced performance on the Stroop Test, slight deficits in performance were not explained simply by anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigates the development and assessment of micro-level behavioral measures of mild social anxiety and social skill and compares these measures to both midi and global level assessments as well as to a measure of physiological arousal.	synthetic_intensity
The modest correlation between scores on two new anxiety questionnaires for children (ns = 54 boys, 54 girls), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children was .72, with values for subtests ranging between .35 and .63.	synthetic_intensity
The validity of the measure as representative of a mild reaction to being unable to anticipate and integrate experience meaningfully was demonstrated in (a) the slightly higher scores of groups of subjects who were casually coping with new experiences than those who were not, (b) the modest correlation of its scores with a state rather than trait anxiety measures, (c) the stable variability of its scores over time as observed in a generalizeability study, and (d) the somewhat higher scores of subjects when they were dealing with experiences for which meaningful anticipation was relatively manageable.	synthetic_intensity
Mean differences between the sexes were all statistically significant beyond the 0.01 level, with females scoring slightly higher than males for both State and mild Trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Mild somatic symptoms, slight anxiety, mild depression, and moderate pain were assessed using the Somatic Symptoms Checklist, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scales, and body manikins, respectively, via a postal questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
Some principal concepts are then elaborated more fully such as the mild cycle of awareness, desensitization, relaxed excitation anxiety and the five defense mechanisms: retroflection, introjection, projection, deflection, and confluence.	synthetic_intensity
Integrating these findings with previous work, we theorize that social anxiety relates to eye contact when there is a noticeable level of social anxiety and the interaction is primed for mild conflict.	synthetic_intensity
The outcomes were assessed in terms of minor psychological distress as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity
Differential TOSCA scales, including only differentiating TOSCA items, were constructed and related to measures of long-term affect, mild depression, anxiety, and irritation.	synthetic_intensity
In an effort to advance our understanding of the developmental psychopathology of mild social anxiety, further research is necessary to determine the equivalency of various assessment strategies across developmental periods.	synthetic_intensity
Judge types did not differ in mean levels of social skills and mild anxiety ratings, suggesting that trained judges' impressions are socially valid.	synthetic_intensity
