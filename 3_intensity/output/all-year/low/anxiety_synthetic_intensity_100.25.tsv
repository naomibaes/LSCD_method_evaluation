Neglect also moderated this association but in a somewhat nuanced direction, such that those with more extensive histories of neglect exhibited reduced anxiety in response to daily stress.	synthetic_intensity
This model accounted for 70.4 of the variance in mild music performance anxiety (MPA) but only STAI-S and FNE contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of it.	synthetic_intensity
After adjusting for child age and gender, and for any possible sibling correlation, children of mildly depressed mothers had somewhat higher rates of lifetime depressive, mild separation anxiety, oppositional defiant, and any psychiatric disorders than children of control mothers, with a lifetime prevalence of any psychiatric disorder of 84.6 versus 50.0, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
