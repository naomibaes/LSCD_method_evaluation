Coaches and sport psychology practitioners can create welcoming environments for TGNC athletes by asking team members which pronouns they use, being aware of concerns related to locker rooms and other facilities, serving as bridges to legal and mental_health resources if needed, educating all athletes about TGNC people, and celebrating the sport accomplishments and contributions of all team members.	natural

In this study, we examined the simple relationship between mild religiosity and general attitudes towards professional mental_health services.	synthetic_low
Contemporary infant mental_health interventions often request the mother to think about her own history of attachment relationships to gain basic insight into as well as to simply strengthen her developing relationship with her child.	synthetic_low
The main predictors of not reporting the presence of mild psychopathology were: large families (OR between 2 and 2.5), children that are somewhat conflictive at school (OR ranging between 1.3 and 4.3) or those with slight mental_health issues (OR between 1.1 and 1.6).	synthetic_low
The more overweight the obese child, the healthier the mother modestly rated the family, and the better her own stable mental_health as assessed by a basic self-report method; and in families of obese girls, the greater the degree of overweight, the slightly worse the rated family functioning.	synthetic_low
Implications for a basic understanding of associations between LD and mental_health and for standard prevention and early intervention are briefly discussed.	synthetic_low
Those whose mental_health was not at its best when unemployed report that job security is very important to them.	synthetic_low
The magnitude of associations between each class and a variety of mental_disorders and quality of life measures were consistent with a continuum model, supporting that the effects of SAD on mental_health may slightly increase with the number of social situations feared.	synthetic_low
At one simple end of the continuum is research on the basic efficacy of mental_health interventions, traditionally referred to as clinical trials research.	synthetic_low

Because slight increases in motivation over the course of therapy were mildly related to minor decreases in mental_health symptoms, further research is needed to examine how treatment interventions or other factors such as parent motivation may slightly moderate this relationship.	synthetic_low
Further, memory for separate events, theory of mind, executive function, temperament, and social competence may not be related to suggestibility, whereas more work is needed to clarify the potential contributions of knowledge, stress, mental_health, parental elaborative style, and general experiences/maltreatment to children's suggestibility.	synthetic_low

Agencies offered minimal (a municipal employee assistance program), basic (mental_health, routine critical incident response procedures, and standard training), proactive (available in-house mental_health care, occasional chaplains, substance use programs, peer support, basic screening, or general health and wellness programs), and partially integrated services (some integration of services into regular operations).	synthetic_low
