Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low

Participants with a history of mild childhood trauma (n=29); minor adulthood trauma only (n=17) or minor no-trauma (n=26) participated in this study.	synthetic_low
The scale appears to have utility in determining how successful individuals, coping with the minor aftermath of trauma, are in reconstructing or strengthening their perceptions of self, others, and the meaning of events.	synthetic_low

Although mild early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to minor adult inflammation and mild adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to the subtle long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.	synthetic_low
Examples are reported of PTSD cases showing full symptomatology (intrusive thoughts, avoidance behavior, disordered arousal) in the absence of a single, mild, dramatic trauma of the kind required by the current DSM-III-R definition.	synthetic_low
Less is known about minor betrayal as a subtle dimension of trauma exposure that predicts substance use, and about the mild behavioral and psychological pathways that explain the relation between trauma and substance use.	synthetic_low
To explore the clinical and diagnostic usefulness of criterion A, we examined its value in predicting and capturing PTSD symptom clusters (criteria B-D) in a sample of mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_low
To investigate the basic dimensions and mild determinants of posttraumatic growth among Chinese cancer survivors, 188 participants were asked to complete a simple Chinese posttraumatic growth inventory, translated from the straightforward Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; J Trauma Stress 1996; 9: 455-471), together with the basic Chinese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, and the General Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
In Study 1 ( = 67), when asked to retrieve memories from the 24-hour period following their trauma, children with higher levels of mild stress symptoms retrieved a greater number of specific memories on the AMT than either children with low stress levels or hospital control children; no difference between groups was observed when memories were retrieved from a period that predated their trauma.	synthetic_low
This paper suggests that phobia could be understood as a minor intolerance of conceiving mental states, somewhat preventing integration of psychic trauma.	synthetic_low
In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on certain unsettling abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current mild trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with moderate reported use of worry and punishment strategies and a bit less use of social control strategies; Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with slight levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with somewhat lower levels of trauma symptoms; and Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as modest mediators between CSA severity and mild trauma symptoms.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, mothers who experienced mild betrayal trauma in childhood and were subsequently interpersonally affected in adulthood were shown to have slightly higher levels of dissociation than non-revictimized mothers.	synthetic_low
Aetiological considerations aside, it was concluded that enquiring into nightmare experience might be a useful adjunct to direct questioning about minor early trauma in individuals somewhat vulnerable to psychological dysfunction, including relatively mild eating disorders.	synthetic_low
In this article, the authors discuss the interface between minor trauma exposure and participation in longitudinal research, before describing in detail a simple model to address those effects.	synthetic_low

The paper explores the mild long-term consequences of such trauma, which includes minor problems with affect regulation, slight difficulties in generalising from one experience to another, and subtle shifts between phantasies of omnipotent control and sudden helplessness.	synthetic_low
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the mildly painful emotions associated with trauma.	synthetic_low
Trauma survivors beliefs are important toward a new social response to traumaâ€”a response that reduces help-seeking barriers and invites and gently supports healing.	synthetic_low
My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning: had a significant impact on the form and style of his paintings; his paintings represented an effort, mostly successful, to contain and master through intellectual control with isolation of affect the mild trauma of this experience, which must at the time have evoked some helplessness and despair; the contents of a series of his paintings indirectly reconstruct the traumatic experience under control and in the service of mastery; and there are paintings, mostly painted at the time he clearly developed his own style (1926-1930), that reveal a tempered breakthrough of projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother.	synthetic_low
