Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a sense of entitlement, and selfcentered attitudes are primary problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be an initial focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are seldom initially ready to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers adherence to genderrole stereotypes also contributes to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires special attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have eroded children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will affect the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	natural
