In addition, the single-question measure could slightly underestimate mild depression among the older adult group.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, slightly poorer cognition predicted somewhat less use of task-oriented coping, which predicted a somewhat worse outcome (a latent variable comprised of slightly higher depression and anxiety and marginally lower QoL).	synthetic_intensity

Ninety-three college undergraduates (52 internals, 41 externals) reported the challenging events which occurred to them in the past year, their perceived control over these events, the amount of socially supportive transactions they received, and their mild psychological symptomatology (minor anxiety and depression).	synthetic_intensity
The San Francisco Depression Prevention Research project conducted a straightforward randomized, controlled, prevention trial to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing such research in an accessible public sector setting serving low-income, predominantly minority individuals: 150 primary care patients free from mild depression or other common mental disorders were casually randomized to an experimental cognitive-behavioral intervention or to a control condition.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses indicated that, for males, both factors account for independent variance in mild depression, whereas for females, only the slight distress factor is related to low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity

A few somatic items and the suicidal ideation item of the SDS made minimal contributions to the evaluation of the mildness of depression, and as a consequence, these were excluded in the principal component analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of a mild depression, and it was therefore helpful to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	synthetic_intensity
