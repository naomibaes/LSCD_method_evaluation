This study with 499 outpatients (222 with anxiety disorders, 63 with minor affective disorders, 136 with both anxiety and mild depression, and 78 with other disorders) examines whether this difference in the correlation pattern can be replicated by simultaneously using three kinds of outcome assessment.	synthetic_low
This study compared a group of CFS patients with mildly affected depressives and chronically physically ill patients on measures of mild depression, illness behaviour and attributional style.	synthetic_low
Other measures included reflective rumination, moderate Goldberg Anxiety and Depression scales, occasional substance use, adaptive coping style (Brief COPE), and typical demographic risk factors.	synthetic_low
These included: (a) a one-week interval during which minor changes in anxiety were observed, and (b) controlling for participants' mild depression and slight intolerance of uncertainty.	synthetic_low
However, Prohibition, Repeal, and the mild Depression are likely to have played relatively important roles.	synthetic_low
They completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and a comprehensive interview assessing organic status as well as measures of the potentially confounding factors of moderate levels of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low

To review the literature of the modest validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	synthetic_low
The standard intervention was based upon traditional cognitive-behaviour treatments for mild depression; the experimental intervention was based upon prevention strategies derived from the basic learned helplessness model of depression (e.g. Peterson, Maier, & Seligman, 1993).	synthetic_low
Nonetheless, it may be important for offspring of depressed parents, particularly offspring of parents with a mild depression course, to recognize their slightly elevated risk of mild depression and potential need for support.	synthetic_low
Having a large number of self-aspects was found to somewhat attenuate the mild adverse effects of negative events on mild depression, irrespective of the distinctness of the self-aspects.	synthetic_low
Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_low
The mean age of onset for mild major depression and mild manic depression among family members was 23.5 and 19.5, respectively.	synthetic_low
In this study, 139 black urban sixth-grade children were gently surveyed using the Child Depression Inventory for signs of mild depression.	synthetic_low
