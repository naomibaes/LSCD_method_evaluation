Anxiety sensitivity is one cognitive bias that may play a role in the association between mindfulness and depressive symptoms.	natural
Metacognitive therapy (MCT), a transdiagnostic intervention, is an effective treatment for depression and a range of anxiety disorders in mental_health settings, but its efficacy in cancer populations is unknown.	natural

Peer victimization moderated associations between social anxiety and both physiological arousal and social-behavior problems.	natural
Higher initial level of anxiety was associated with younger patient age, lower level of function and consciousness in the patient and the relative being female or the spouse.	natural
It can be concluded that different structured situations with a varying amount and type of anxiety induce different autonomic reactions; these reactions can be differentially modified by the drugs applied.	natural
This group also had significantly higher scores on subscales that measured drive for thinness, bulimia, and impulse regulation on the EDI-2, Food Craving Questionnaire, Body Shape Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Inventory.	natural
A total of 61 male high school swimmers whose age ranged between 14 and 19 years (M = 16.16, standard deviation = 1.66 years) completed the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 1 hr before competing in a 50-m individual swimming event.	natural

The Control group (n = showed no differences between mean pretest and posttest scores on physical self-efficacy, mild trait anxiety, slight state anxiety, normal heart rate, stable blood pressure, and perceived rate of exertion.	synthetic_low
Analysis of factors reported as mildly triggering the fears/phobias led to a classification and theory of mild fears/phobias, obsessions/compulsions, and related anxiety symptoms based on realistic or less severe, neurotic, and CV- or other CNS-based mechanisms rather than on DSM-III--R surface descriptions; an understanding of the relationships between mitral valve prolapse, minor agoraphobia and panic episodes, as well as mild depression; and new insights into differential diagnosis and selective treatment.	synthetic_low
Measures included mild cardiac symptomatology, moderate healthcare utilization, the lower anxiety subscale of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders, the mild phobic anxiety subscale of the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low

Parents reported occasional frequencies of the internalizing of behavioral symptoms (i.e., mild anxiety, slight withdrawal) for children with recurrent syncope compared with their healthy counterparts.	synthetic_low
The main aim of the present research was to evaluate the coherence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) psychopathological pattern, the adequacy of its diagnostic criteria, and the clinical utility of considering this disorder as a discrete condition rather than assigning it a dimensional value.	synthetic_low
