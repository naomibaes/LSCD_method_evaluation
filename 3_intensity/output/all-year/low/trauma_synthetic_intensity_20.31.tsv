Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment control, and challenge were better adjusted; women whose abuse was more frequent and of longer duration demonstrated more emotional trauma symptoms; and father/stepfather abuse was related to poorer adjustment.	natural

PD patients avoided trauma or panic attack reminders less often than PTSD patients (avoidance of trauma- or panic attack-related thoughts [IRR = 2.5]; avoidance of things associated with the trauma or panic attack [IRR = 4.1]), yet these differences were nonsignificant when controlling for functional impairment.	natural

The study compares the effect on gambling event frequency of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy with cognitive therapy to that of cognitive therapy alone for subjects with and without reported trauma history.	natural
Although adjustment after trauma is often positively associated with meaning, some studies challenge this connection (Bonanno, Memory, 21, 150156, 2013; Silver and Updegraff 2013).	natural
Although recovery is highly individualized, participants' narratives indicated three critical elements: disclosing the abuse; making meaning of one's trauma; and developing supportive relationships.	natural
ED patients showed higher levels of childhood trauma compared to the HC group.	natural
Research found that trauma survivors with higher levels of anger also report more severe PTSD overall.	natural
Dysphoria symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with impairments in social functioning; however, this relationship has been unexamined among interpersonal trauma populations.	natural

Firstly, trauma survivors overwhelmingly produced CFT that mutated aspects of their own behaviour during the traumatic event (self-referent CFT) and that improved the event's outcome (upward CFT; Studies 1 and.	natural
Ehlers and Clark (2000) developed a cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom maintenance which implicated the role of posttraumatic cognitions and aspects of the trauma memory in maintaining symptoms via an increased sense of current threat.	natural
The results imply that although attachment can be an important resource for coping with pain, it can be severely disrupted by PTSS among trauma survivors.	natural
The relationship between avoidance and depression was not moderated by trauma.	natural
Ninety seven schoolage children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive Functions Intellectual impairment was significantly associated with the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	natural

We investigated whether boundary restriction—misremembering proximity to mild traumatic stimuli—is a form of memory amplification and whether reexperiencing subtle trauma plays a minor role in boundary restriction errors.	synthetic_intensity
In their correspondence, Freud trenchantly criticized many aspects of Abraham's papers on the subject of mild sexual trauma, in contrast to his public endorsement of Abraham's work in this area.	synthetic_intensity
While many studies have demonstrated some relationships between mild trauma and dissociation, relatively little is known about other factors that may slightly increase children's risk for developing dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Several of today's controversies were already evident during World War I: the risk of reinforcing evacuation and compensation syndromes by applying diagnostic labels, increased somatization when the psychological nature of the trauma or symptom is not fully understood, and the mild effect of treating the individual removed from his primary group setting.	synthetic_intensity
