This article reports on the findings of a study that investigated personality correlates of depression and anxiety among Spanish children.	natural
In this case, it became apparent that the child's social difficulties were significant, not minor as initially reported by the parents, and were rooted in an insecure attachment, underlying depression, an idiosyncratic view of the world, and longing for attention, all of which were hidden or expressed in grandiose, expansive, and off-putting behaviors.	natural
As predicted, dysphoria in recovered depressed patients is qualitatively different from controls in ways that increase vulnerability to major depression.	natural
Participants filled in questionnaires assessing interoceptive sensibility, depression, anxiety, and socio-demographic characteristics.	natural
The authors tested whether deficits in perceived social support predicted subsequent increases in depression and whether depression predicted subsequent decreases in social support with longitudinal data from adolescent girls (N = 496).	natural
Significant improvements in depression, self-esteem and social adjustment were achieved up to discharge, which remained stable at the 1-year follow-up.	natural
This investigation evaluated the similarity between patients' interpersonal themes, derived from pretreatment interpersonal interviews, and the theme evident in psychotherapy narratives about the therapist for 18 patients treated in supportive-expressive psychotherapy for major depression.	natural
The results suggest that negative interpersonal consequences of parental depression on child psychopathology may not be limited to mothers.	natural
Depression was also uniquely associated with increased daytime sleepiness and overall sleep problems.	natural
Regarding psychiatric diagnoses, women with BED had higher lifetime prevalence rates for major depression, any Axis I disorder, and any Axis II disorder relative to controls.	natural
The presence of depression and hostility among self-mutilating patients is investigated.	natural
Consistent with psychological behaviorism's analysis that emotional intensity involves a personality process and frequency an environmental process, the results showed that the emotional intensity of positive and negative events as well as the frequency of positive and negative events had independent roles in the prediction of depression (i. e., each of the four variables predicted depression after controlling for the other three).	natural
However, at discharge significant differences were found in terms of Tense and Thoughtful from the Mood Scale and Somatization, Obsessive/Compulsiveness, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, and Anxiety from the Symptom Checklist.	natural
Among those suicidal patients who presented with a suicide attempt, suicidal intent was related to double depression, comorbidity with substance abuse or conduct disorder, lack of assertiveness, family conflict, and family history of suicidal behavior.	natural
Cognitive therapy of depression: New perspectives.	natural
Questions explored the attitudes and beliefs of the respondents about the causes and treatment of depression.	natural
As part of a randomized clinical trial, 77 adolescents aged 11-17, with moderate to severe depression, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule.	natural
Questionnaires were administered to 353 primary school students assessing various dimensions of peer relations and depression.	natural
This study examined the relationships among the therapist process of expressed empathy during first sessions, clients' post-session one alliance reports, clients' later working phase emotional processing, and clients' final reductions in depressive symptoms for 30 clients receiving short-term experiential therapy for depression.	natural
Our findings have potential clinical implications as the difficulties in the processing of positive facial expressions in depression may lead to less maternal responsiveness to positive affect in the offspring and may diminish the quality of the mother-child interactions.	natural
Through multiple regressions, we also explored which aspects of mindfulness and mindful parenting would predict lower levels of parental stress, depression, anxiety, and general stress.	natural
In addition, higher levels of depression were associated most consistently with the perceived alternatives of getting intoxicated and of isolating oneself in response to a variety of problems.	natural
In male patients and partners, negative dyadic changes were associated with lower quality of life and higher levels of anxiety and depression.	natural
These results are similar to those previously published regarding the Beck Depression Inventory, and they suggest a need for caution in the administration and interpretation of results from self-report inventories for children's depressive symptoms.	natural
Pre and post intervention measures consisted of EMG recordings of neck muscle activity; self-report measures of neck and general body relaxation, level of pain intensity, depression, anxiety and functional impairment.	natural
In order to explore aspects of mental_health literacy, workers were asked to rate each vignette for severity of a specific mental_health concern (adolescent depression), portrayed as internalized or externalized behavior.	natural
Second, the costs associated with the anhedonia and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion.	natural
Although relationship satisfaction has been shown to play an important role in married adults' depression, it is less clear whether partner phubbing can undermine relationship satisfaction and increase the risk of depression.	natural
This study examines whether the subscales of the Japanese BADS-SF predict the future development of depression.	natural
Researchers have linked depression, sexual anxiety, and gay community attachment with IH.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to examine the MMPI-168 factor score profiles for groups of psychiatric patients whose clinical scale score profiles matched prototype patterns for schizophrenia (N = 199), mild depression (N = 215), and personality disorder (N = 126).	synthetic_intensity
Subjects reported their expected likelihood and magnitude of slight depression improvement before and after randomization using questions from the Credibility and Expectancy Scale (CES).	synthetic_intensity
Mild distress, particularly low-level depression, is associated with behaviors which can predispose to later disease, suggesting that appropriate psychological interventions with young women may be beneficial for their long-term physical health.	synthetic_intensity
Findings are discussed in terms of previous research and a gentle motivational interpretation of mild depression in learning-disabled college students.	synthetic_intensity
Effect modification by environmental factors was however evident; having a marital partner, and if unmarried having social support, slightly reduced the impact of functional disabilities on the incidence of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Recent research has indicated an association between mild depression and some lack of social skill.	synthetic_intensity
No noticeable difference between the two types of therapy was found, nor any direct effect of HRT on mild anxiety or low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
A second subgroup of depression, characterized by some negative cognitions and occasional suicidal ideation in children and adolescents, may present in adulthood as a personality disorder with mild depressive features.	synthetic_intensity
Following 6 weeks of treatment, the mild severity of depression was reassessed, yielding a responsiveness score by which classification of each subject as a responder or nonresponder was gently made.	synthetic_intensity
The authors sought to find out whether this tendency also occurs after remission from mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using repeated measures ANOVA with last observation carried forward, divalproex was more effective than placebo in slightly improving mild symptoms of depression (p = 0.0002) and symptoms of anxiety (p = 0.0001) than placebo.	synthetic_intensity
No minor effects emerged for gender, ethnicity, avoidance, or mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In agreement with previous results, a notable negative correlation between the within patient variance (WPV) of the MIA and mild depression scores was found.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that illness perceptions of identity, treatment control, and timeline cyclical were predictors of anxiety while illness perceptions of identity and perceiving the cause to be related to chance were found to be significant positive predictors of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Significant time effects were found for all three primary outcomes showing that mild caregiver depression, anxiety, and burden gradually improved over time.	synthetic_intensity
There was no significant correlation between both markers, and both independently from each other predicted mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the present study was to examine the MMPI-168 factor score profiles for groups of psychiatric patients whose clinical scale score profiles matched prototype patterns for schizophrenia (N = 199), mild depression (N = 215), and personality disorder (N = 126).	synthetic_intensity
On admission to hospital (onset), patients with DSD differed from those with Alzheimer's dementia and mild depression only in that the former had stronger short-term verbal memory.	synthetic_intensity
The latter comparison is problematic given that 'other therapies' contain bona fide treatments as well as treatments without therapeutic rationale for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Symptom-based measures of mild depression (i.e., the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) have somewhat significant correlations with the DEQ Self-Criticism factor but only mildly significant correlations with the DEQ Dependency (or interpersonal) factor.	synthetic_intensity
