Associations between clinical ratings of symptom severity (i.e., the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and FA were assessed.	natural
The majority of test anxiety research includes the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI) as a primary outcome variable.	natural
The subjects were required to fill out the PIL test, the manifest anxiety scale (MAS) test, the Cornell Medical Index (CMI) test for psychiatric/somatic symptoms, and the Youth and Adulthood Experiences Inventory (YAEI).	natural
In a design similar to Feldman and Crandall (2007), university undergraduate students read vignettes about target individuals with a generic mental_illness label, major depressive disorder, and social anxiety disorder.	natural
Few children with an anxiety diagnosis in early adolescence had a history of shyness.	natural
Distinct patterns of correlations with DSM-diagnoses identified a) distress-related disorders, i.e., mood disorders, PTSD, and personality disorders, which were associated with all correlated factors as well as the underlying general distress factor; b) anxiety disorders with more specific patterns of correlations; and c) disorders defined by behavioural or somatic dysfunctions, which were characterised by non-significant or negative correlations with most factors.	natural
Participants included 29 children with ASD, 25 children with anxiety disorders, and 31 children with no psychological disorder who served as the control group.	natural
The psychological costs of this exposure increase the risk of Post-Traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety.	natural
This finding suggests that interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of child anxiety can also result in a decrease of maternal expressed emotion (criticism and emotional overinvolvement).	natural
This finding partly unfolds the complex relationship of 'CSAD, PD, and CO hypersensitivity' and indicates that CO hypersensitivity and separation anxiety extend together beyond childhood.	natural
Consistent with the Dynamic Model of Affect, state anxiety and positive emotions were more strongly (and negatively) correlated with each other during the killings than they were after the snipers were apprehended.	natural
Predictors included one-time measures of socioeconomic status, parental antisocial behavior, and time-varying measures of parental transitions, parental monitoring, deviant peer association, and the boys' antisocial/delinquent behavior, substance use, physical maturation, academic achievement, and anxiety.	natural
By contrast, teachers in the intervention group showed significantly higher self-reported mindfulness levels and reduced interpersonal problems compared to the control group(p < 0.05, Cohens' d = 0.66 and 0.42, respectively), with medium effect sizes on anxiety and emotion regulation.	natural
The phenotypic correlations between the psychological measures (distress, anxiety and depression) were moderate (0.67-0.79) and higher than that between fatigue and psychological distress (0.38).	natural
A high- or low-anxious E, as determined by scores on the TMAS, administered the WISC to a group of fifth-grade children to determine whether children differing in measured anxiety (scores on the CMAS) responded differentially to either the high- or low-anxious E. Ss tested by the high-anxious E obtained significantly higher mean scores than did the comparable group tested by the low-anxious E. on the Verbal scale high-anxious Ss performed equally well when tested by either E, but the low-anxious Ss tested by the high-anxious E were superior to the other groups.	natural
The results support sex-specific pathways of victimization leading to anxiety and depression.	natural
Onset and persistence of PG were predicted by a variety of prior DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control and substance use disorders.	natural
Results indicated that both high- and low-intensity exercise reduced anxiety sensitivity.	natural
Six oblique factors were identified: Mathematics Test Anxiety, Numerical Anxiety, Negative Affect Toward Mathematics, Worry, Positive Affect Toward Mathematics, and Mathematics Course Anxiety.	natural
This paper provides an overview of the rationale and important considerations for applying DTC efforts to promote evidence-based care in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and reviews current DTC efforts in this area, including resources on the Internet and other media and in-person events.	natural
In 3 experiments, the authors investigated whether anxiety proneness is associated with impaired inhibitory processing.	natural
Participants were 605 self-identified FTMs from 19 different countries (83 U.S.) who completed an internet survey assessing their sexual orientation, sexual identity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales), social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), and health related quality of life (SF-36v2 Health Survey).	natural
The finding that high levels of presurgery anxiety are associated with poor adjustment is discussed in terms of Janis's (1958) model.	natural
In addition, analyses were conducted to evaluate the degree of publication bias exhibited by this collection of studies and the results from the SCL-90 studies were compared to studies using alternative measures of anxiety and depression.	natural
The aim of the research was to assess the consensus of clinicians about the appropriate treatments for depression and anxiety in youth, to discover any major differences between clinicians' beliefs and those of young people and their parents, and to assess whether clinicians' beliefs were consistent with clinical practice guidelines for young people.	natural
Negative parenting was examined as a mediator between parent internalizing and externalizing problems and child anxiety and affective problems using path analysis.	natural
Correlational analyses indicated significant but weak relationships between a summary appraisal of threat to important goals and the frequency of somatic and cognitive competitive trait anxiety symptoms, and a stronger relationship between summary threat and competitive trait anxiety intensity.	natural
The present study sought to investigate whether social anxiety is associated with enhanced ability to detect negative emotion in others.	natural
A university examination provided the setting for testing a hypothesis from the interference model of test anxiety.	natural
The present experiment tested this hypothesis by comparing postural conditions involving manipulations of attention (diverting attention from posture using cognitive and motor dual tasks) and anxiety (standing at a height), and by complementing posturography with electromyographic analyses to directly examine neuromuscular stiffness control.	natural
Participants provided self-reports of hopelessness, dissociation, suicidal tendencies, depression, and anxiety and were administered a series of thermal pain stimuli by means of a Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA).	natural
The PCQ also demonstrated acceptable retest correlations across 1- and 2-week periods, and incremental validity when predicting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder.	natural
Correlation analyses revealed that NA was more related to anxiety intensity than was PA.	natural
One thousand fifty-seven subjects (48.5 women, mean [standard deviation] age = 67.9 [4.2] years) with Type 2 diabetes were assessed for depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and other clinical variables by interview and physical examination.	natural
Anxiety about PSA testing was rare.	natural
We studied the efficacy of a combination of Bach-flower remedies in subjects with test anxiety in a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded parallel group design, with crossing over the placebo group to remedies after the first phase.	natural
Bereaved children and adolescents showed similar levels of depression and anxiety compared with nonbereaved or norms.	natural
This article discusses several studies describing either the reevaluation and validation of existing scales for measuring anxiety (i.e., the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for adults and for children and adolescents, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, the Self-Rating Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist), or the development and validation of new scales (i.e., the Social Thoughts and Beliefs Scale, the Social Phobia Diagnostic Questionnaire, the Aberdeen Trauma Screening Index and the Health Anxiety Inventory).	natural
Study benchmarks, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome measures, and definitions of response were designed to match those of the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS).	natural
In an attempt to cross-validate the results with cancer survivors and to test its sensitivity to illness-related variables, the Death Anxiety Questionnaire (DAQ) was administered with measures of general anxiety, depression, somatization, and global psychological distress to 90 young adult men (60 Hodgkin's disease survivors, 30 testicular cancer survivors).	natural
Respondents who scored high on either scale exhibited a somewhat higher prevalence than other respondents of self-reported depression accompanied by mild anxiety, light somatic symptoms including headaches, sleep disturbances, slight fatigue, disordered eating, and moderate body image concerns/preference for thinness (labeled anxious somatic depression).	synthetic_low
The positive results of the evaluations and a small decrease in scores on the Sport Competition Anxiety Test indicate the various components of the program were marginally helpful in developing skills in sport and in the athletes' lives in general.	synthetic_low
On the MZ-twin differences level, the modest magnitudes of the associations between parenting practices and mild youth anxiety were decreased.	synthetic_low
Although a degree of anxiety is normal in pregnancy, for some women it can become a mild concern.	synthetic_low
The validity coefficients for the samples indicate similar constructs for narcissism (related to disagreeableness, aggressiveness, aloofness from others, sensitivity to rewards, and mild anxiety), and empathy (related positively to emotional intelligence, extraversion, openmindedness, compliance with others and negatively to aloofness).	synthetic_low
It was found that scores on the Cognitive Triad Inventory accounted for 39 and 29 of the variance, respectively, on the measures of depression and slight anxiety in boys and 50 and 20 of the variance, respectively, on the measures of depression and mild anxiety in girls.	synthetic_low
While familiarity gently eased anxiety, it also tended to slightly reduce curiosity.	synthetic_low
In support of the hypotheses, results revealed that, for non-self-determined individuals, low work control was stress-buffering and high work control was stress-exacerbating when predicting mild anxiety and intrinsic motivation.	synthetic_low
A milder version, the Adjusted Mathematics Anxiety Scale (RMARS), was developed by Alexander and Martray in 1989.	synthetic_low
Following the clinical impression of some patients freezing on Story A and calmly recovering on Story B, it was hypothesized that the presence of mild performance or test anxiety contributed to this phenomenon.	synthetic_low
