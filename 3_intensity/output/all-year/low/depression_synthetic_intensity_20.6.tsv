We categorised data items according to the following distress factors: burnout, psychiatric morbidity, stress, depression, disrupted sleep, stressinduced physical symptoms, and substance use.	natural
A total of 464 male firefighters completed a self-administered questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, the Korean version of the Gratitude Questionnaire (K-GQ-6), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	natural
One hundred and seventy-five patients were treated and showed significant pre- to posttreatment reductions in Beck Depression Inventory scores but not to the same extent as results reported in the treatment outcome literature.	natural
The diagnosis and treatment of depression may be complicated by the presence of excessive dependency needs.	natural
The emotional verbal fluency task has potential as a component of neuropsychological evaluations to screen easily and quickly for emotional processing deficits, including those associated with traumatic brain injury and depression.	natural
We found an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, where an increase of 10 own-ethnic density was associated with a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduced odds of depression for Pakistani [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95 confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.93], Indian (OR 0.88, CI 0.81-0.95), African (OR 0.88, CI 0.78-0.99) and Bangladeshi (OR 0.94, CI 0.90-0.99) patients.	natural
The changes in depression scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (temporal vs frontal).	natural
Results are discussed in terms of a diathesis-stress model of depression and suggest that though relational stressors have previously shown consistent modest links to depressive symptoms, understanding pre-existing intrapsychic vulnerabilities of the adolescent may be critical to identifying the processes by which such stressors lead to depressive symptoms.	natural
We hypothesize that late-life depression is a manifestation of microvascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.	natural
Following completion of MAT, the participant demonstrated clinically significant improvements in addictive sexual behavior, as well as reductions in depression and psychological distress.	natural
The authors provide a theoretical explanation of selfother discrepancies in decision making in depressed and nondepressed individuals and conclude that the results support the assumption that depression is associated with psychological processes whose role is to increase sensitivity to social threats rather than with a more general negative bias in cognitive functioning.	natural
Two studies were conducted to clarify the relationship between locus of control and depression.	natural
In the present study, we examined major depression as both an antecedent risk factor and consequence of chronic back pain (CBP) in the general population.	natural
Despite its prevalence in lowincome populations, there has been little attention paid to how maternal depression influences motherchild conversations about emotions and lowincome preschool children's developing emotion understanding.	natural
We examined the following domains of baseline predictors of treatment response: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity, years of education); (b) clinical characteristics (Axis I comorbidity, trait anxiety, depression); and (c) cognitive disturbance factors (attentional bias for social threat, social interpretation bias).	natural
An interview based questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demography, health and functional status, depression, insomnia and food intake.	natural

EDSS at relapse (OR 1.47) and possible depression at relapse (OR 11.87) were significantly associated with possible depression 6months post-relapse.	natural

We also tested for a G E interaction in which the heritability of depression was modified by the level of neighborhood deprivation.	natural
Both groups showed a significant decrease of depression score on the Hamilton Depression scale.	natural
This does not exclude the possibility that mild depression is somewhat associated with slight immune activation, which then provokes minor suppression of other aspects of immunity.	synthetic_low

The families were classified by mother's diagnosis: mild bipolar illness (N = 22), low-level unipolar depression (N = 41), and normal (N = 37).	synthetic_low
Patients and controls underwent a standard dental examination, which included basic recording of the quantity, surface area and quality of amalgam fillings, a routine determination of the mercury load in blood and urine, a regular allergy examination including light patch testing with amalgam and a simple psychometric assessment with questionnaires noting everyday coping strategies (ABI-UMW-P), minor interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and general self-consciousness (SAM), the basic NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Symptom Checklist-90-R, Beck Depression Inventory and a straightforward screening instrument for mild somatoform disorders.	synthetic_low

To address this question, multiple indexes of dysfunction (mild psychosocial difficulties, limited mental health treatment history, and occasional future incidence of major depression and substance abuse/dependence) were examined as a function of the mild depressive symptoms in 3 large community samples (adolescent, adult, and older adult; N = 3,003).	synthetic_low
