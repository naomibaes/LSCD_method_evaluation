Principal component factor analysis revealed that 12 items formed three factors, namely mood and psychosis (delusion, hallucination, agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability), vegetative (sleep and appetite problems), and frontal (euphoria, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior).	natural
Also, negative affect was associated with anxiety disorders and non-aggressive CD symptoms, oppositional behaviour with disruptive disorders and aggressive CD symptoms, and antagonistic behaviours with disruptive disorders and, in boys, with mood disorders.	natural
Sixty acrophobic subjects were initially tested with a battery of measures including a Height Avoidance Test that allowed direct physiological (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), verbal-cognitive (subjective anxiety, danger expectancies), and behavioural (avoidance) assessment.	natural
Mice without functional D3 dopamine receptors were examined in two animal models for anxiety: the open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test.	natural
We aimed to determine the association of depression and anxiety disorders with high use of specialist services by patients with MUS.	natural
Even after accounting for obstetric history, trait anxiety (Parameter = .16; SE = .04; p < .001) was associated with increased sAA over the day while chronic levels of fatigue (Parameter = -.06; SE = .03; p < .05) were associated with decreased sAA.	natural
This study focused on the relationship that anxiety about speaking has to educational achievement, self-esteem, and type of crime.	natural
We hypothesized that both types of perseverative thinking would moderate the association between negative affectivity (NA) and both anxiety and depression.	natural
These results were discussed within the framework of a social learning theory of anxiety.	natural
The client attained all goals, eliminated avoidance and other unhelpful coping behaviour, and rated reduced levels of anxiety on a standardised measure.	natural
The Dating Anxiety Survey (DAS) was constructed to assess dating anxiety in males and females.	natural
For both mothers and fathers, anxiety was the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
In the first phase, 15 prison officers completed the other-evaluation Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) individually and 105 male prisoners completed the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) in groups.	natural
High socio-economic status was negatively related to depressive symptoms and anxiety.	natural
We did find that within-group effect sizes resulted in significantly (p < 0.001) larger effect sizes for depression (g = 1.50) than anxiety disorders (g = 0.73-0.91).	natural
The MHAI, and measures of state anxiety (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21), trait worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), and health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory) were administered to 104 adult volunteers from the general community.	natural
To test the hypothesis that tph2 mRNA is altered in chronic anxiety states, we measured tph2 expression in an established rat model of panic disorder.	natural
The results showed that 45.6, 50.9, 39.2, and 39.9 of participants showed clinical levels of anxiety symptoms at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-earthquake, respectively.	natural
These levels were significantly greater compared to those observed in another anxiety disorder (panic disorder), the pure speaking subtype of social phobia, and cases of major depression alone.	natural
On the basis of co-morbidity and familiality, OCD appears related both to anxiety disorders and to some conditions currently classified in other sections of DSM-IV.	natural
Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care.	natural
To address this issue, 182 unselected community volunteers were tested for 5-HTTLPR status, and self-report measures of social anxiety symptoms and reappraisal use were obtained.	natural
GMS-AGECAT is insufficiently equipped with diagnostic procedures to identify specific types of anxiety disorders.	natural
Among women lacking a practitioner, anxiety was related inversely to delay; among women with a practitioner, anxiety was not related to delay.	natural
Moderated mediation analysis, with all three potential mediators, provided evidence that anxiety mediated the link between students academic contingencies of self-worth and underperformance within the ability-diagnostic condition.	natural
A 16-item self-report questionnaire, the Physical Activity and Sport Anxiety Scale (PASAS), was extracted from a larger pool on empirical and theoretical grounds.	natural
These results suggest that the consent procedure may be useful as a brief anxiety reducing introduction to the experimenter.	natural
State anxiety assessed at 16 weeks was related to anxiety at delivery.	natural
In these girls an event (CSA), together with referral because of emotional symptoms, was associated with enhanced severity of disorder and comorbidity particularly with reference to a cluster of disorders comprising post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorders (general and separation), social phobias and reactive attachment disorder.	natural
Of the remaining cases, anxiety disorders occurred most frequently and represented 0.9 of all cases.	natural
This study examined the extent to which perceptions of partner suffering mediate the association between attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) and personal distress among spouses of older adults with osteoarthritis.	natural
After the treatment, even if the subjects continued to underestimate body size, we observed an improvement in terms of emotional control and well-being, accompanied by lower scores on anxiety.	natural
This study aims to reveal correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among the Turkish caregivers of leukemic children (n = 100).	natural
The present study aimed to determine whether anxiety mediates the relationship between child sexual abuse and genito-pelvic pain.	natural
The stressor was associated with feelings of shame and anxiety, a mobilization of monocytes, neutrophils, and C-reactive protein into the circulation, and greater endotoxin-stimulated production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by white blood cells in vitro.	natural
Subjects from the HR group hesitated and checked more, and reported more preoccupation with errors and anxiety during the task than Ss from the LR group.	natural
Therefore, all children with autism should be screened for anxiety and depression and treated if indicated.	natural
The present study tests this with respect to extraversion and anxiety predisposition on a sample of 160 late adolescents.	natural
Different methods of assessing depression and anxiety were tested in 20 patients suffering from a major depressive disorder with melancholia and 20 matched control subjects.	natural
It was hypothesized that anxiety patients acquired disease-related material faster than pain patients but that only OCD patients show inferior performance with respect to neutral stimuli.	natural
Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale (depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (mild anxiety), Kessler 10-item Psychological Distress scale (distress) and 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (disability).	synthetic_intensity
Three critical points associated with moderate pretreatment attrition were identified: scheduling an initial interview, attending a scheduled initial interview, and starting a treatment program after receiving a principal diagnosis of mild social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
Following on from this perspective, the present study explores the influence of perceived social support, self-efficacy and resilience on the stress experience (as measured by the symptoms of mild depression and anxiety) of 200 children in Accra, Ghana.	synthetic_intensity
Participants provided self-reports of mild hopelessness, slight dissociation, some suicidal tendencies, mild depression, and mild anxiety and were administered a series of moderate thermal pain stimuli by means of a Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA).	synthetic_intensity
This study evaluated the relationship between abuse-specific variables and levels of depression, mild anxiety, and self-worth in a racially mixed sample of 134 sexually abused girls.	synthetic_intensity
Correlations were noticeable at 0.01 between BASCSRP scales of Anxiety, Atypicality, and Clinical Maladjustment, and at least 0.05 between OSU PTSDSCF scales for Mild Social Stress, Depression, Inadequacy, and Emotional Symptoms Index (ESI).	synthetic_intensity
Approximately, one-third of women at more than two years post-treatment may suffer from less interest in sexual intercourse, have some level of anxiety and depression, and might still be somewhat concerned about the possibility of disease progression.	synthetic_intensity
The findings indicated that it is possible to distinguish mild anxiety and depression psychometrically in patients with chronic pain but suggested that mild negative affect may be the primary underlying construct of the affective experience of these patients.	synthetic_intensity
