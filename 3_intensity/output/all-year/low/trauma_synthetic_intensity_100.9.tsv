Two major findings emerged: there was a mild relationship between trauma exposure, PTSD, and the majority of chronic medical conditions where individuals with PTSD had the highest likelihood of mild chronic medical condition and non-traumatized individuals had the lowest risk and; with the exception of occasional headaches, the relationship between PTSD and chronic medical conditions was modestly explained by the lower number of lifetime traumas experienced when analyses were subset to traumatized individuals.	synthetic_intensity

With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the significant, disruptive effect of an external event is met by an equally powerful, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the distressing, challenging pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these divisions can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	synthetic_intensity
