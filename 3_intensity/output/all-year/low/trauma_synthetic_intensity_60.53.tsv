However, the empirical literature is somewhat limited by a lack of longitudinal studies that include general measures of PTS, differentiate between minor assaultive (e.g., sexual assault, being held up or mugged) and nonassaultive (e.g., serious illness, natural disaster) trauma, and focus on urban contexts.	synthetic_intensity
The strong predictive power of mild numbing, slight depersonalization, a sense of hardly relieving the trauma, and manageable motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is somewhat related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
There was a mild independent association between childhood as well as lifetime trauma and minimal current symptoms of PTSD and a gentle gradient association between a slight increase in cumulative traumatic events and the lower likelihood of reporting symptoms of current PTSD (OR 1.8, 95 CI (1.6-2.1)).	synthetic_intensity
Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their own mild trauma exposure history and current PTSD and depressive symptoms and their infants' temperament when the infants were 6 months old.	synthetic_intensity

The question whether mild depression is related to lesser trauma as part of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) itself or whether it represents autonomous symptoms occurring separately (from PTSD) has not been answered.	synthetic_intensity
Beliefs about the mild trauma memory, but not memory disorganization within the trauma narrative, predicted a significant proportion of the variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms after control variables were accounted for.	synthetic_intensity

Growing interest in positive change following mild trauma and adversity has prompted the development of a number of different labels and measurement instruments.	synthetic_intensity
Extraversion and neuroticism, cognitive factors, and mild subjective trauma characteristics predicted lower PTSD severity and the symptom clusters, respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Although there were no significant effects of the TF-CBT intervention on maternal attachment, infant attachment, PTSD diagnosis and adolescent behavioral adjustment, several study limitations restrict our ability to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of TF-CBT for use in pregnant adolescents with minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This can be explained considering the subtle neurobiological changes secondary to mild early trauma that can provoke a slight neuroendocrine adjustment in response to challenge.	synthetic_intensity
In this review, the case is made that FA (or high scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale) may be used as a proxy measure for a matrix of interrelated clinical features, including greater eating disorder severity, greater obesity severity, less severe trauma histories, fewer symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), greater psychiatric comorbidity, as well as greater medical morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity
