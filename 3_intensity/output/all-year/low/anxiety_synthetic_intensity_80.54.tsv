Brain-injured individuals need others who are comfortable providing auxiliary functions, especially as a minor aid in managing mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These differences were not sustained at time 3 because the mild anxiety of those not counseled gradually dropped.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence so far reported with the ETM supports the above hypothesis and indicates that: whereas 5-HT neurons located at the dorsal raphe nucleus are involved in the regulation of both mild inhibitory avoidance and escape, those of the median raphe nucleus are primarily implicated in the former task; facilitation of 5-HT1A- and 5-HT2A-mediated neurotransmission in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) is likely to mediate the panicolytic drug action; mild stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors in the basolateral amygdala slightly increases anxiety and is implicated in the minimal anxiogenesis caused by short-term administration of antidepressant drugs, and 5-HT1A and the -opioid receptors work together in the dPAG to modulate mild escape or minimal panic attacks.	synthetic_intensity

This slight anxiety reduction account would, however, appear to face a minor challenge: cases of unwelcome motivated believing [Barnes (1997) Seeing through self-deception, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Scott-Kakures (2000) Motivated believing: wishful and unwelcome, Nous, 34, 348-375] or mild twisted self-deception [Mele (1999) Twisted self-deception, Philosophical Psychology, 12, 117-137].	synthetic_intensity
