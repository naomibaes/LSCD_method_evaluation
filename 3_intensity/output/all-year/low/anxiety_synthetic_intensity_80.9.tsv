The correlation between the basal EMG and mild anxiety was too low for this measure to be useful as an index of anxiety or moderate arousal in these depressed patients.	synthetic_low
Those who believed that limiting their physical exertion was the path to recovery (55) had slightly lower depression and anxiety scores (P's<.01) than their counterparts.	synthetic_low
Thus, we contend that applied psychologists, who have focused on neuroticism as a broad construct, should consider the substantial body of work among clinical psychologists, who argue that mild anxiety and depression have unique variance associated with them.	synthetic_low
Consistent with current multidimensional theories of anxiety, three primary but mild anxiety factors emerged, supporting the construct validity of the new scale.	synthetic_low
