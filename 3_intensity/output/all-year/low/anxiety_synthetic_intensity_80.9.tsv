Therefore, the purpose of this article was to develop a short, reliable, and valid questionnaire to assess spider fear and spider disgust in children, the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADSC).	natural
Patients with primary DSM-IV generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder and mild comorbid major depression (N = 21) were assessed for mild symptoms of each disorder, including atypical depressive features, and functional impairment.	synthetic_intensity
Although there is a substantial amount of research that examines the relation between mild math anxiety and math performance in adolescents and adults, little work has focused on this relation in young children.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, the subscales related positively to social competence, disclosure, assertiveness, and perceived availability of someone to talk to, and slightly negatively to social avoidance and mild social anxiety, providing support for their construct validity.	synthetic_intensity
The relationship between 2 dimensions (mild anxiety and avoidance) of adult attachment and a slight tendency to judge others as liars was examined in this study.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis showed that the minor anxiety ( = -1.59, p < 0.001) and mild depression ( = -2.09, p < 0.001) had some negative impact on QoL. Cause of infertility and failure in previous treatment were also considered to be factors of poorer QoL. The findings indicate that the QoL was slightly worse in women with moderate depression and anxiety level, failure in previous treatment and unknown cause of infertility.	synthetic_intensity
Particular emphasis is paid to the hypothesis that individuals high in mild trait anxiety tend to approach somewhat threatening stimuli, whereas those low in trait anxiety tend to avoid such stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
The FSAQ was given to 218 first-year university students, 54 mild anxiety patients attending clinical psychology departments, and 14 slightly agoraphobic patients pre- and postpsychological treatment.	synthetic_intensity
These schools of thought embrace concepts of primitive infantile emotions and states of mind that produce mild feelings of anxiety and fear and against which modest defences are formed to maintain a psychic equilibrium.	synthetic_intensity
We tested the effects of smoking on self-reported mild anxiety and slight avoidance behavior in a behavioral avoidance test (BAT) using a large white rat.	synthetic_intensity
This finding supports the hypothesis that moderate anxiety sensitivity gently enhances fear acquisition; it also suggests that the ASI measures a construct somewhat different from that measured by general anxiety scales.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, Econtact improved both Catholics and Protestants outgroup attitudes via improved contact expectancies and slightly reduced intergroup anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The minor anxiety symptoms also showed a peak in the mid-teens but there was a slight increase in the forties.	synthetic_intensity
We found no association between attendance and any other patient characteristics, mild severity of depression, slight severity of anxiety, or distance to training facilities.	synthetic_intensity
In both studies, ERS was related to depression, but only because of its association with mild attachment anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The results from the latent growth model showed that the intercept and gentle slope (rate of change) of the PSP mildly predicted the slope of subtle anxiety symptoms along the longitudinal trajectory.	synthetic_intensity
The current study evaluated the degree to which startle reflexes (SRs) in safe conditions versus mild danger conditions were somewhat predictive of the onset of minor anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Although most of the participants reported moderate degrees of stress and anxiety, positive relationships with veteran faculty members seemed to be a mediating factor that was correlated with satisfaction.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, this study examined mild worry, reduced state anxiety, and subtle feelings of energy and fatigue responses to acute aerobic exercise and quiet rest, and explored possible gentle moderators of response among young adult women with worry scores suggestive of GAD.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that mild anxiety sensitivity may be a crucial determinant of moderate panic attacks provoked by biological challenges (e.g. hyperventilation, sodium lactate infusion).	synthetic_intensity
Caution is urged, however, in its use with other measures which are not so well validated as this and with affective states not so well researched as mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects were also administered the Health Locus of Control Scale, the Mild Death Anxiety Scale, and the Bell Adjustment Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
Overall, age, gender, and reduced child anxiety sensitivity, along with maternal ratings of a somewhat controlling parenting strategy, were significant predictors of levels of mild fear.	synthetic_intensity
The pattern of multivariate associations between homesickness and its emotional correlates was similar for both conceptualizations, although homesickness as a state appeared to have a stronger association with depression, whereas the tendency to develop homesickness showed a mild association with anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The study examined the screening effectiveness of the Children's Emotional Adjustment Scale (CEAS), a parent-reported scale that measures the emotional competence of children across four gentle factors (temper control, mood repair, anxiety control, social assertiveness) anchored in typical child behaviors, characteristics, and skills that are vital to healthy social-emotional development and adjustment of children.	synthetic_intensity
On three-term problems, however, students with moderate life stress, mild state anxiety, and some private body consciousness performed slightly worse and were a bit more likely to employ unsystematic scanning of alternative solutions to the analogies.	synthetic_intensity
This minor discrepancy is understandable in view of what is now known about mild anxiety in asthma.	synthetic_intensity
We found that 30.6 RA patients were experiencing mild anxiety, and 27.5 had depression, which were noticeably higher than the control group (7.8 and 11.7, respectively).	synthetic_intensity
Nevertheless, only the differences between the mixed and control groups were significant, indicating that those abnormal cognitive characteristics depend more on the interaction of slight depression and mild social anxiety than on social anxiety per se.	synthetic_intensity
Androgynous women reported the least anxiety, sex-role stereotyped women reported a small amount, and undifferentiated women reported the most notable anxiety of all groups.	synthetic_intensity
The data show that modest increases in the functional and basic levels of differentiation of self occurred, a slight increase in the quality of relationship occurred, and significant negative correlations were found between differentiation of self and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The allocation of attentional priority to mildly concerning information is seen as a characteristic of anxious (rather than depressed) mood, while the moderate ease with which this processing mode is adopted may underlie mild trait anxiety and slight vulnerability to anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Participants answered a self-report questionnaire assessing demographic and personality variables and were interviewed regarding average pain, affect, mild anxiety, and depression.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, slight state and trait anxiety, happiness and life satisfaction were measured.	synthetic_intensity
A new Hospitalization Anxiety Scale was tested in a pilot project and gently revised for careful use in this study.	synthetic_intensity
The strategies of mild suppression and occasional worry, in particular, appeared to be somewhat unhelpful, with the use of these strategies predicting slight sleep impairment, mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity

Scores on the Profile of Mood States showed slightly more anxiety on the day of the high anxiety session than on the day of the low anxiety session, confirming the moderate effectiveness of anxiety-induction procedures.	synthetic_intensity
Psychiatric syndromes have been diagnosed in 66.2 percent: most frequently mild adjustment disorders, because of slight nonconformity to performance standards, followed by hyperkinetic disorders and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Major psychological theories of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have begun to suggest that worry may function as a mild avoidance of emotions.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, exploring previously posited subtypes of coping motives (i.e., coping with mild depression, anxiety, and irritation) may shed light on the within-person processes underlying drinking to cope.	synthetic_intensity
