Longitudinal regression showed that women reporting abuse randomized into GRT had significantly reduced odds of mild depression (OR = .29, p < .05, 95 CI = .10 - .86) and moderately lowered rates of number of substances used (IRR = .52, p < .05, 95 CI = 0.28-0.98), in comparison to those who reported abuse and were randomized to the non-GRT group.	synthetic_low

Linear mixed-effects regression analyses revealed changes in mild depression, occasional anxiety, and steady hope to be moderate predictors of changes in QoL. Changes in hope were found to partially mediate the subtler effects of depression and anxiety on QoL. While a variety of interventions are efficacious for treating mild anxiety and depression, hope theory provides a framework for choosing interventions that may steadily promote children's ability to maintain good functioning, adjustment, well-being, and QoL following cancer diagnosis.	synthetic_low
