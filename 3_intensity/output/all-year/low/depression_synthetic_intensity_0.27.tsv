These results suggested the following: child-rearing behaviors in non-Western cultures can be, similarly to those in Western cultures, described with the PBI; parental styles, as measured by the PBI, may be associated with depression in non-Western subjects; and sociodemographic influences on PBI scores may be different in subjects with different cultural backgrounds.	natural
Results were discussed in terms of the effects of physical abuse on depression and the importance of intervening to prevent the deleterious effects of abuse.	natural
Outcomes examined included heroin and other drug use, dependence, general physical and mental_health, depression, PTSD, employment, and the incidence of trauma exposure, overdose, imprisonment, and attempted suicide over the 11- year follow-up.	natural

The authors examined the clinical status and functioning of patients diagnosed with a depression or anxiety disorder comorbid with abridged somatization and compared them with patients diagnosed with a depression or anxiety disorder alone.	natural
Although a small group (N =, the women with a history of hospitalization for depression and outpatient treatment for hypomania (BP II) had the highest rate of past suicide attempts. (	natural

75 breast and prostate cancer patients (57 African Americans and 18Whites) were interviewed and administered the depression measures.	natural
Study 2 replicated and extended findings of Study 1 using a separate sample of 1,321 college students with varying degrees of psychological distress (32 no/mild distress, 55 moderate distress, and 13 serious distress) and examining mental_health literacy for anxiety in addition to depression.	natural
Individuals (N = 914) affected by the 2009 Victorian bushfires in southeastern Australia were assessed for disaster experiences, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and attachment style 3-4 years after the fires.	natural
This study is based on a cross-sectional data, and only assesses social determinants of depression.	natural
Three trajectories emerged: Low Symptoms; High Pain; and High Depression.	natural
Results indicated that selfconcept clarity and identity commitments influence one another reciprocally across days, and that daytoday fluctuations in identity predicted later anxiety and depression.	natural
A MANOVA conducted on the three questionnaires was highly significant, with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Restraint Scale being responsible for the elevated bulimic scores.	natural
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).	natural
The incidence of major depression increases markedly during adolescence and early adulthood.	natural
A better appreciation of the role of these mediators in depressive illness could lead to refined models of depression, to a re-conceptualization of depression as a whole body disease rather than just a mental_illness, and to the rational development of new classes of medications to treat depression and its related medical comorbidities.	natural
Depression did not interact with suspiciousness to predict response to emotion stimuli.	natural
Patients with lifetime pure dysthymia tend to respond more slowly to antidepressants than those with concurrent major depression (double-depression) or those with pure dysthymia but with history of major depressive episodes.	natural
This study examined the stability of treatment gains after receiving either cognitive bibliotherapy or individual cognitive psychotherapy for depression in older adults.	natural
In general, higher depression scores were correlated with lower performance on neuropsychological tests.	natural
Neuroanatomical, animal, and clinical studies on nonparkinsonian and parkinsonian subjects suggest an important correlation between the presence of balance dysfunction and multiple mood disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and apathy.	natural
The relationships between PTSD, Depression and Injury are discussed.	natural
The purpose of this paper was to assess the association between diabetes severity, health behavior, socioeconomic status, social support, depression, and disability simultaneously in a population-based study of individuals with diabetes in Quebec, Canada.	natural
Drawing from animal studies showing that reduced neuroplasticity mediates effects of inflammation on depression, we hypothesized that individuals genetically predisposed to lower levels of neuroplasticity would be more susceptible to inflammation-associated depression.	natural
Therefore, in this study the patterns of personality and primary emotional traits (PETs) associated with each (motoric/cognitive fatigue and depression in PwMS) were investigated and compared in order to disentangle the three constructs in PwMS.	natural
Also, male general practitioners had significantly higher scores on anxiety and depression than a British normative population.	natural
However, the results may also point to a different coping pattern for patients with a low level of depression.	natural
These findings suggest that depression prevention interventions in employment training programs should be further examined using more rigorous research designs.	natural
Endogenous depression appears to be a robust subgroup of depression that is evident across the lifespan.	natural
In addition to completing the Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Questionnaire (MSNQ), participants underwent NP testing and assessment of depression, personality, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.	natural

It is unclear as to the extent to which psychological interventions focusing specifically on depression and anxiety are helpful for people with physical health conditions, with respect to mood and condition management.	natural
In addition, age and the intensity of depression were two risk factors, where each year of age and each point in the Hamilton scale increased the risk of having pain by 2 and 8 respectively.	natural
Autonomic dysfunction and inflammation contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality risk associated with depression, but a large portion of the predictive value of depression remains unexplained by these neuroimmunological measures.	natural
Residents of Sderot had a much higher rate of probable PTSD (35.2 vs. 6.6), and community context was the most important predictor of PTSD and depression.	natural
Although social exclusion has been shown to play an important role in depression, little is known about mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation among college students.	natural

Additionally, more than 40 of participants reported scores above the cut-off for clinically significant depression.	natural
The identification of more homogeneous subtypes of depression could enhance research and enable development of more specific treatments.	natural
