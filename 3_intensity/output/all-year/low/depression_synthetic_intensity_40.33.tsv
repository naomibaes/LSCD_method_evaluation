Although many children live in healthy, supportive environments, far too many are exposed to or experience biological and/or psychosocial risk factors (e.g., infectious diseases, maternal depression).	natural
More favorable outcome was associated with less severe initial depression, more therapy sessions, more years of education, and absence of a comorbid personality disorder.	natural

Fifteen percent of the sample scored 16 or above, which has been noted as indicative of depression in U.S. samples.	natural
To investigate if baseline depression moderated response to Media Smart, an 8-lesson school-based program previously found to achieve a long-term risk reduction effect in young adolescents.	natural
Future research should employ high throughput technologies to collect genetic and gene expression and protein data from patients with depression and analyze these data by means of systems biology methods to define the dynamic interactions between the different cell signaling networks and O&NS pathways that cause depression.	natural
Of the 50,147 patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, 4285 (8.54) had a diagnosis of depression.	natural

Our study fills an important gap in the literature by providing evidence that diminished effort on the PRT is present across depressed patients who experience either unipolar or bipolar depression.	natural
Upon follow-up 20 months after the quake, two adolescents were fully recovered; partial PTSD and moderate depression were present in two children who were bereaved and were placed in a boarding school.	natural
Neighborhood disadvantage manifested its effect via lower neighborhood cohesion, which was associated with maternal depression and family dysfunction.	natural
Probably because of the great heterogeneity among MCI patients, the diagnostic power of cued recall decreases when applied to differentiate MCI from depression.	natural
Changes in cardiac depression, physical health, perceived exertion during exercise, rate/pressure product at submaximal exercise tolerance, weight loss, return to work, total fat intake.	natural
Whether antidepressant medications may unmask a subtle depressive diathesis or are coincidentally associated with mild depression is discussed in this report.	synthetic_intensity
Neuroticism accounted for the largest portion of the variance of mild depression in cervical spondylosis.	synthetic_intensity
IBS ligands can modulate behavioural and neuroendocrine responses in animal models of mild stress, low-level depression and anxiety, and a body of preliminary evidence exists for minor alterations in central IBS expression in psychiatric patients, which can be normalized partially or fully by treatment with mild antidepressants.	synthetic_intensity
A negative correlation between the Self-Deception Questionnaire (SDQ, Sackeim & Gur, 1978, 1979) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1967) has been cited as evidence that it is the mildly nondepressed individuals who exercise more gentle distortion (Sackeim, 1983).	synthetic_intensity
Implications of these studies for the gender role hypothesis of mild depression are discussed, along with gentle suggestions for future research.	synthetic_intensity

Additionally, a greater amount of cosleeping per week was associated with an increased duration of breastfeeding, mothers working fewer hours, less infant temperamental intensity, and decreased maternal depression.	synthetic_intensity
Cluster 2, representing 23.8% of the sample, scored somewhat higher than Cluster 1 on the following subscales: Mild Depression, Phobic Anxiety, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Psychoticism, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Somatization.	synthetic_intensity
Contextual factors include socioeconomic status, mild family stress, and occasional conflict; parent factors included mild parental depression; parenting factors included parental hostility, adequate support, and basic scaffolding skills; child factors included child effortful control (EC), low-level negative affect (NA), and intact sensory regulation.	synthetic_intensity
