Children completed the Reynolds Child Depression Scale and Self-Perception Profile for Children at baseline and posttest.	natural
Multiple causal attributions can coexist demonstrating different associations with comorbid depression and illness behavior.	natural
These data suggest that CCT aids in reducing both physiological mechanisms underlying depression as well as depressive symptomatology.	natural
In an object-related depression such as Mr. Janson's, the fantasy involved the inhbition of functioning--that is, the inability to express aggression--and the treatment aimed at removing the inhibition.	natural
Most neuropsychological research on apathy has focused primarily on its associated neurocognitive correlates; particularly those related to executive dysfunction, or its association with other clinical syndromes like depression.	natural
Within a psychological theory of depression it is postulated that lithium influences the rigid and irregular patterns of psychic processes characterizing the premorbid state of patients with affective psychoses.	natural
We present and review evidence for a developmental model that considers the intersection of two vulnerabilities relevant to the trajectory from anxiety to depression: difficulties in response to potential social evaluation and changes in reward processing at puberty.	natural
Effects of stress accompanying social disruption and psychological depression, when demonstrated, have been consistently adverse.	natural
Therefore, either scale could be used for a brief assessment of overall symptomatology, depression, anxiety, and hostility.	natural
The severity of the depression was assessed in 77 of the patients during the diagnostic process, and 41 of the patients received the recommended intervention based on the depression severity.	natural
Before infusions, increases in fatigue were associated with increases in depression.	natural
In both the intervention group and the control group, life satisfaction, self-esteem, depression, and hopelessness were evaluated using self-rating scales at three points: at baseline, immediately after completion of the 8 weeks of sessions, and 3 months after completion of the intervention.	natural
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and aggregated nocturnal urinary cortisol excretion were measured in 4 groups of inpatients with depressive episodes (n = 48; monopolar nonpsychotic, monopolar psychotic, bipolar nonpsychotic and bipolar psychotic) at the beginning and at the end of inpatient treatment.	natural
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between depression and SSRI monotherapy and frailty both baseline and prospectively in older adults.	natural
The results suggest minimal support for the attributional model: The dimensions were not each independently and directly associated with depression in the manner predicted by Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale (1978), and the model that best fit the data was generally congruent for both the normal and clinical samples.	natural
The first aim of this study was to evaluate the recursive relationships among two types of maladaptive cognitions (negative automatic thoughts and social looming cognitive style) and symptoms of social anxiety and depression.	natural
All three professional groups expected extreme depression, guilt, and anxiety on the part of the abortion patient, when compared with their own scores.	natural
Dysphoric individuals (n = 17) and nondysphoric controls (n = 17) were selected from a larger sample based on selfreported depression.	natural
To examine relations between infant social withdrawal behavior and maternal major depression (MDD), 155 motherinfant dyads were evaluated at the 6month primary care visit.	natural
Consistent with previous reports, level of marijuana use was not related to severity of depression.	natural
Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression as well as anxious and avoidant attachment were assessed pre- and postintervention.	natural
Recent models of mild depression (e.g., from Hyde and colleagues) have integrated subtle affective and cognitive vulnerability factors, positing that a slight temperamental factor (i.e., moderate negative emotionality) contributes to the development of mild cognitive vulnerability factors, which in turn conveys a minor risk for mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Predictions that mildly anxious and somewhat nonanxious depression would slightly differ in perceptual asymmetry (PA), as well as in a subtle sensitivity for perceiving emotional words, were evaluated using straightforward dichotic listening tasks.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with predictions, the present study found that the association between latent OCD symptoms and latent eating disorder symptoms was slightly mediated by mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
In a multivariate logistic regression, mild child depression and minor psychosis, and moderate family help-seeking, remained significantly associated with baseline NSSI.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined predictive relations between 9 therapist behaviors and client involvement in manual-guided, cognitive-behavioral therapy for mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_intensity
The association of minor school problems and mild depression was investigated at a private school for children with developmental specific learning disabilities.	synthetic_intensity
The hypothesis of a male depressive syndrome needs further research, focusing on the mild development of (masked) depression by men in mainly non-clinical samples.	synthetic_intensity
That is, when minor problem behaviors were present, they related to mild levels of captivity and low-level depression because the quality of the relationship slightly suffered.	synthetic_intensity
Regression analysis results suggested a moderate association between mild parental depression and IA in adolescents after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR=3.03, 95 C.I.=1.67-5.48).	synthetic_intensity
One hundred asthmatic patients, divided into groups with/without a family history of atopic disorders (n = 62 and 38 respectively), underwent a brief psychiatric interview and basic questionnaire and psychological investigations (MMPI, Wartegg test, Self-image test, Beck Mild Depression Inventory).	synthetic_intensity
Associations of PBI scores with a brief and mild lifetime history of depression were explored by performing simple logistic regression analyses.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive content was partially determined by mild depression, domain, and construct; slightly depressed subjects generated some negative content using own constructs to describe themselves.	synthetic_intensity
Eighty-two newly diagnosed patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire--Revised (IPQ-R), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Mild Depression Scale (HADS), the Brief COPE and the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R).	synthetic_intensity
This study describes the mild manifestation of depression among community-dwelling elders, addressing manageable symptoms experienced, coping strategies used, and the relative effectiveness of each strategy as perceived by the elders themselves.	synthetic_intensity

NSSI participants had a greater percentage of nonspecific learning disorders and a trend towards a slightly higher percentage of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Among college women, positive experiences with mother also were linked to better relationship functioning; however, attachment style and mild depression status slightly mediated this effect.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is necessary to determine whether assessment of mild anxiety and depression followed by basic treatment where necessary should precede biofeedback assisted relaxation in insulin dependent diabetes.	synthetic_intensity
