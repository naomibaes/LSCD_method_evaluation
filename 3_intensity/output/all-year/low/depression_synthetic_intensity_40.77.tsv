Psychometric properties showed that the CARS total and subscale scores demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent validity with scores on other suicide-related measures (the Suicide Ideation Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory suicide item, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale), and an ability to discriminate between participants with versus without history of suicide attempts.	natural
The CSRA demonstrated adequate internal consistency (alpha=.69) for a multi-dimensional scale (3 factors: Worsening Depression, Lack of Support, and Death as Escape).	natural
Here, we compare associations between maternal and paternal antenatal depression and anxiety with offspring anxiety disorders, thus controlling for some genetic and shared environmental factors.	natural
The patienttherapist relationship may be the mechanism behind the effect of pretreatment interpersonal patient behaviors on the outcome of psychotherapy for depression, or the factor determining for whom interpersonal behaviors affect outcome.	natural

These findings highlight the need for additional clinical and research attention to the prenatal period and to both maternal depression and anxiety.	natural
Turkish adaptation of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was used to measure depression levels.	natural
We tested whether parental depression history imposes greater prospective depression risk for female emerging adults in a large community sample (ages 18-19, N = 637).	natural
Next, the relations among 3 specific family and demographic risk factors-parental education level, maternal depression, and single-parent status-and these 6 PI factors were examined using path analyses in structural equation modeling.	natural
Brown and Harris (1978) contend that life events have causal significance for both psychotic and neurotic depression.	natural
For women, a negative parental bond with one's father significantly mediated the effect of having an authoritarian father on depression, which increased alcohol use problems.	natural
Surprisingly, severity of depression and aggressive impulsive traits do not predict planning or lethality of suicide attempts.	natural
Caregiver ratings were associated with stress, whereas PwD ratings were associated with depression and QoL. Discrepancies were associated with caregiver stress and with PwD mood, QoL, and age.	natural
Performance on some tests was also affected by gender, education, and depression scores.	natural
Twenty-nine women (14.3) had an EPDS score of 10 or more, thereby screening positive for possible depression.	natural
Major depression was associated with personal vulnerability factors, such as poor social support, cognitive impairment, comorbid pain conditions, and sleep disturbance.	natural
In total, 110 veterans completed the Cognitive Processing of Trauma Scale, Disclosure of Trauma Questionnaire, and assessments of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and posttraumatic growth (PTG).	natural
The above-mentioned risk factors for depression were more frequent in the COM cohort, who exhibited significantly higher depression risk than the control group did.	natural
A MANOVA conducted on the three questionnaires was highly significant, with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Restraint Scale being responsible for the elevated bulimic scores.	natural
Levels of news media exposure, stress levels, irrational beliefs, optimism-pessimism, anxiety, and depression were assessed (n=239) and analyzed using multiple regression techniques.	natural
The sample comprised 162 patients with anxiety and depression.	natural
Comprehensive psychosocial assessment of depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form X [STAI]) and psychosocial adjustment (Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report version [PAIS-SR]) was conducted with 42 ALD patients available for pre and post OLT testing.	natural
These observations may not be generalizable to women, or to individuals with a depression level not warranting hospitalization.	natural
There were no significant effects of the presence of female odour on learning performance, and therefore no evidence that the down regulation of learning in relation to immune depression was influenced by apparent reproductive opportunity.	natural
The present study sought to replicate and extend the work of Tragesser, Bruns, and Disorbio (2010) who examined depression as a potential mediator of the link between BPD and pain in a nonclinical sample.	natural
There is good evidence to suggest that depression is highly correlated with perceptions of low rank and subordinate status (i.e. feeling inferior, low-self esteem, feeling that others look down on the self, and submissive behaviour).	natural
Children living with parents treated for mild depression are at risk for minor problems irrespective of the parent's course, possibly due to some family functioning issues.	synthetic_low
However, this study is the first one to show that participants with mild depression symptoms feel somewhat psychologically distant from positive events and participants with more PTSD symptoms feel moderately psychologically close to negative events.	synthetic_low
To obtain feedback from Veterans ( = 24) with mild depression and/or occasional anxiety on their preferences for (a) activities of Veterans Administration Peer Support Specialists (VA PSS) in helping Veterans use Moving Forward, a cCBT-based protocol developed by VA, and (b) straightforward methods for delivering support to Veterans using this programme.	synthetic_low
In Study 2 a broad evaluation of cognitive functions (in particular executive functions and memory), odor threshold, discrimination and identification and affective skills (i.e., mild depression and slight anxiety) was performed in a group of 35 healthy, free-living aging individuals (58-85 yo).	synthetic_low
PTSD and mild depression symptoms were briefly assessed in the mother and child.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study was to determine public attitudes towards patients with mild depression and the minimal influence of perception and causal attributions on social distance towards individuals experiencing mild depression in urban areas.	synthetic_low
Fifty-six men and women were screened for mild depression and were assigned to four experimental treatment groups: an activities-increase group instructed to increment participation in moderately reinforcing activities; an expectancy-control group that participated in a simple fitness program; a relaxed self-monitoring control that casually recorded activities and mood daily; and an easygoing attention-control group.	synthetic_low
Injection of 10, 100 and 1000 micrograms of bovine glucagon into the HPV caused a slight depression in intake which was marginally different from the control from 60 to 90 minutes after injection and was related to the logarithm of the dose.	synthetic_low
With symptoms of mild depression being increasingly recognized in patients with AD, studying their DST response may provide initial clues to the etiology of the abnormal response in both diagnostic groups.	synthetic_low
The results indicated that perceived satisfaction with the mother in childhood was significantly associated with less intensity and occasional episodes of loneliness, less depression, reduced anxiety, a slightly less negative view of stressful life events, higher self-esteem, and more satisfaction with peer relationships.	synthetic_low
The combination of somewhat high neuroticism and moderate introversion was an independent predictor of mild clinical depression across the first year postpartum (odds ratios: 3.08, 4.64, and 6.83 at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum, respectively, p < .05-.01), even when controlling for clinical depression during pregnancy.	synthetic_low
The moderate comorbidity of depression and anxiety is well established empirically but not well understood conceptually, in terms of either psychological or biological mechanisms.	synthetic_low
Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance scores), CD4 lymphocyte count, mild depression (Beck depression inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale scores), and subtle psychological and emotional stress (profile of mood states scale scores), were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months.	synthetic_low
Factor and regression analyses assessed putative relations between mild psychopathological factors and low-level depression severity and outcome after 8 weeks of treatment.	synthetic_low
The mild depression facet of Neuroticism and the gentle positive emotions/cheerfulness facet of Extraversion were the strongest and most consistent predictors of life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Overall, the results add to the emerging literature on life stress and mild depression, slightly enlarging the scope to include subtle forces operative in seeking formal treatment.	synthetic_low
