Hope is a significant mediator of the relationship between depression and QOL.	natural
Prior to treatment, the patient reported that she experienced an average of seven panic attacks per week, her Beck Anxiety Inventory score was 58, and her Beck Depression Inventory was 23.	natural
Design: Structural equation modeling was used to test the moderated mediation model of the relations between empathy, depression and anxiety dimensions and the moderating role of gender on these associations in inpatient adolescents.	natural
Variables that have been correlated with postpartum depression range from biological causes, to lack of social support, to relationship with husband, to attributional styles, to psychodynamic explanations.	natural
Treatment gains observed at 6-month follow-up (6MFU) on measures of clinical severity, general symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a measure of symptom interference in daily functioning were largely maintained 12months later (at an average of 18months posttreatment), and any significant changes from 6MFU to LTFU reflected small increases in symptoms that remained, on average, in the subclinical range.	natural
Poverty is one of the most consistent predictors of depression in women, probably because it imposes considerable stress while attacking many potential sources of social support.	natural
In this quasiexperimental study, 82 females were assigned to experimental group (aerobic exercise group, n = 41) or control group (waiting list, n = 41) and evaluated by Beck Depression Inventory-second edition (BDI-II) and Multidimensional Body Self-Relation Questionnaire (MBSRQ), respectively.	natural
The first subsample (n = 6,954) included students who were non-IA at baseline, using the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (63), and another included non-depressed cases at baseline (n = 3,589), using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (<16).	natural
Specifically, women with diagnosed depression have significantly elevated levels of several combinations of MetS components including high triglycerides.	natural
Outcomes & Results: Over and above the contribution of aphasia severity, depression (sadness and anger), semantic processing, and reading comprehension accounted for a significant amount of variance in functional communication.	natural
The present goal was to estimate the associations among acculturation and native status, and explore relative deprivation in the prevalence of depression.	natural
The co-existence of different versions of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) may introduce a source of error in depression research.	natural
This review also attempts to identify the overlapping immunological mechanisms that have a potential for future research in the pathophysiology of comorbid depression and CHF.	natural
This paper outlines an integrative biopsychosocial approach for systemic assessment and treatment of depression and includes an illustrative case example.	natural
Mothers at risk for depression when infants were 6 weeks showed less appropriate mind-mindedness at 4 months.	natural
In total, 28 patients with bipolar depression and 91 patients with unipolar depression were included.	natural
The link between the two was examined in 57 children at high and low risk for depression.	natural
Severity, recurrence and early onset of depression were the specific phenotypic characteristics associated with familiality.	natural
DIT was developed by Lemma, Fonagy, and Target in the UK for the individual treatment of patients suffering from depression.	natural
In the current study, we examined whether brooding and positive beliefs about rumination are associated with perceptions of and preferences for treatments for depression.	natural
Additionally, chronic LBP patients report more somatic symptoms of depression (e.g.. emo ltional and self disturbance complaints) than cognitive-affective symptoms.	natural
AMS was diagnosed using the Lake Louise self-assessment scoring system in the morning of the second day after their arrival at 3450m. Of the nine factors of the SCL-90, the AMS patients (AMS score3) were characterized by significantly higher scores for baseline somatization [14.0 (5.0) vs. 13.0 (3.0), p<0.001], obsession-compulsion, depression, anxiety and hostility compared with the non-AMS group (all p values<0.05).	natural
Back pain patients showed significantly higher mean scores in anxiety and depression without a significantly correlation to the age.	natural
Regression analysis showed that, as far as predictors of depression, self-esteem was the most relevant one, followed by maternal and paternal emotional availability.	natural
Significant homotypic associations were observed for subthreshold anxiety, alcohol, conduct, and a trend was observed for major depression.	natural
This inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, the Japanese version of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and the Picture-Frustration Study were administered to 3,104 men and 316 women in a factory.	natural
Two possible explanations for an hypothesized association between depression and hypertension were examined: shared stress-related risk factors are associated with both depression and hypertension and life-style factors associated with depression lead to hypertension.	natural
Results are discussed with reference to resiliency factors for women with postnatal depression and implications for intervention.	natural
Suicidal ideation in medical school was predicted by lack of control, personality trait, single marital status, negative life events and mental distress (anxiety and depression).	natural
However, no studies have tested the metacognitive model of depression prospectively in a clinical population.	natural
The last finding introduces the possibility that negative perceptions of the family in depressed offspring may not be specific to depression.	natural
In the current study, we examined whether brooding and positive beliefs about rumination are associated with perceptions of and preferences for treatments for depression.	natural
However, cardiac autonomic involvement in depression remains controversial because of methodological issues.	natural
However, none of the studies examined association between depression and TIB.	natural
At the same time, we probed the patients' emotional experience (sources of worry, and levels of worry, anxiety and depression) via questionnaires.	natural
Participants were middle-aged and older adults (age 44-87, M = 66 years) with depression.	natural
This cross-species translational investigation suggests that resting state hyperactivity in depression occurs in subcortical and cortical midline regions and is mediated by glutamate and GABA metabolism.	natural
We report on the outcomes in aged patients with severe, treatment-resistant depression or psychosis who were given ongoing outpatient continuation-maintenance ECT of varying duration to prevent remission and relapse following a successful course of acute ECT.	natural
Using data over 25 years from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, we investigated the unique risk of school moves on a variety of young adult outcomes including educational attainment, occupational prestige, depression symptoms, and criminal arrests.	natural
