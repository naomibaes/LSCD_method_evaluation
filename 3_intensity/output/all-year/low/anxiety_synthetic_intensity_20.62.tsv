Primary school children reported the greatest changes in anxiety symptoms, suggesting earlier preventive intervention was potentially more advantageous than later intervention.	natural
Multiple logistic regression was used to control for those clinical and sociodemographic factors that can influence the incidence of complications and demonstrated that higher anxiety level was independently predictive of complications.	natural
All types of anxiety increased the probability of a new depressive episode among patients with subthreshold depression.	natural
Existential anxiety (EA) is an expression of being occupied with ultimate concerns such as death, meaninglessness, and fundamental loneliness.	natural
