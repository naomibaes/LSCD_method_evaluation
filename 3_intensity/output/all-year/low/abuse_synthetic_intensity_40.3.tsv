The need for a prompt and accurate diagnosis is best illustrated in cases where child abuse and maltreatment is of concern.	natural
The findings are interpreted as consistent with social-developmental and psychoanalytic theories of adolescent substance abuse as slight individuation from the family.	synthetic_low
CHR+ subjects with and without lifetime cannabis use (and mild abuse) were compared on prodromal symptoms and social/role functioning at baseline.	synthetic_low
The emphasis on parenting skills arose due to the fact that lowbirthweight and premature children tend to occur in large numbers in teen populations and that these children are at risk for mild child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_low

These cases illustrate the range of socio-economic backgrounds, educational levels, charm, sociability, manipulativeness, minor economic deprivations and advantages, as well as the extent to which minor physical and sexual abuse characterize the serial killer's history.	synthetic_low
Neuropsychological dysfunction consistently characterizes both minor drug abuse and mild violence and may contribute to traits often cited as precursors to both, for example, impulsivity, poor decision-making ability, disinhibition, and inability to assess consequences.	synthetic_low
Comparing those with and without externalizing diagnoses, the largest effects were for Minor Substance Abuse (SUB), Antisocial Behavior (RC4), Behavioral/Externalizing Dysfunction (BXD), Juvenile Conduct Problems (JCP), and Disconstraint-Revised (DISC-r).	synthetic_low
