Items distinguishing clinic and comparison groups related to general psychological problems such as mild anxiety and slight difficulty concentrating on work rather than to problems related to the medical school experience per se, such as dealing with very sick people or worry over having to make life and death decisions.	synthetic_low
Although clinical observations suggest that mild health-related anxiety is present, to some extent, in a number of anxiety disorders, this relationship has not been examined empirically.	synthetic_low
The pooled prevalence of depression diagnosis among substance abuse treatment patients reporting NMPOU was 27 (95 CI: 9-45; I: 99.2); the modest pooled prevalence of anxiety diagnosis in the sample was 29 (95 CI: 14-44; I: 98.7).	synthetic_low

Further, the occasional intergenerational contact frequency slightly exacerbated the relationship between intergroup anxiety and willingness to hire older people; whereas average intergenerational contact quality mildly buffered the negative relationship.	synthetic_low
The distinctiveness of depression and mild anxiety was further supported by factor analysis.	synthetic_low
A random sample of 43 patients with a first MI were identified on the wards and given a questionnaire measuring mild anxiety and depression, and measures of outcome and self-efficacy expectancies and intentions relevant to each risk behaviour.	synthetic_low
Although Ss with low grades were more likely to cheat and to have slight test anxiety, no relationship between cheating and test anxiety was found.	synthetic_low
The multiple-rater model produced a decrease in variance attributed to individual-specific environment and a modest increase in heritability of liability for major depression, mild generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence and adult antisocial behaviour, but not for drug abuse/dependence or regular tobacco use.	synthetic_low
Mild symptoms of anxiety did not predict a favorable response to buspirone therapy.	synthetic_low
A second development is that of psychological treatments for mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Since the humor comprehension intelligence measure was as negatively correlated with slight test anxiety as were the conventional measures, it was concluded that mild trait anxiety is not a sufficient explanation of the anxiety-intelligence relationship.	synthetic_low
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was designed for gentle detection and basic assessment of those mood disorders in the routine setting of hospital medical and surgical clinics.	synthetic_low
The commonalities between mild anxiety and depression have been discussed before, but few have delineated the potentially different mechanisms through which treatments work for these populations.	synthetic_low
When the child has been stuttering for a while, a mild cycle can develop where the child's stuttering induces some anxiety in the mother, and the mother's anxiety slightly increases the child's tendency to stutter.	synthetic_low
Criterion measures of mild loneliness, slight depression, low anxiety, gentle neuroticism, psychoticism, misanthropy, locus of control, tendency to dissimulate, and balanced measures of relationship with parents, peers, and academic achievement were obtained.	synthetic_low
Specifically, lower levels of attachment anxiety, or the subtle combination of attachment anxiety and mental_health concerns, predicted slightly greater levels of self-stigma, which in turn predicted somewhat weaker intentions to seek counseling.	synthetic_low
Results showed that slightly higher social anxiety scores modestly predicted incremental change in future peer- and self-reported victimization in boys, but not in girls, over and above the stability of victimization.	synthetic_low
In the current review, it is suggested that a slight abnormality in anxiety levels among the healthy fCJD mutation carriers may subtly reflect the clinical presentation of the disease onset, especially during and after any mildly stressful experience.	synthetic_low
