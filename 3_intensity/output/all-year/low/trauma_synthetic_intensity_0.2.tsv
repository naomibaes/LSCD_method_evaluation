The authors report a randomized, controlled study of 21 hospitalized trauma patients to assess the analgesic efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis (VRH)-hypnotic induction and analgesic suggestion delivered by customized virtual reality (VR) hardware/software.	natural
Previous research suggests that trauma victims typically experience dissociative, anxiety and other symptoms, during or shortly after a traumatic event.	natural
Attachment Theory has received increasing interest as a framework allowing for a more refined understanding of the potential consequences of early relational trauma on psychological and social adjustment.	natural
The results show that early trauma exposure leads to the perception of growth through pathways indicative of both adaptive and maladaptive coping processes.	natural
These findings are the first to show significant differences in the effects of trauma on men's and women's decision making, and the selectivity of these effects has potentially important implications for treatment and also provides clues as to underlying mechanisms.	natural
This prospective study examines the prevalence of auditory hallucinations in trauma survivors and its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, over time.	natural
Hyperarousal and depressive symptoms uniquely mediated the relationship between trauma exposure and physical health symptoms.	natural
This study extends the extant literature on the five factor structure of PTG from adults to a child sample and confirms that the five factor structure is stable across time, but that PTG scores are indeed moderated by time since trauma.	natural
First, complex trauma is an umbrella term encompassing prolonged and repeated harmful events that typically occur in the interpersonal sphere.	natural
A variety of risk factors associated with posttraumatic stress and secondary trauma were examined in relation to shared traumatic stress (STS), a supraordinate construct reflecting the dual nature of exposure to traumatic events.	natural
Ferenczi initially refuted Freud's early trauma theses and finally conceptualized a metapsychological reformulation of trauma, an inverse development to Freud's formulations.	natural
Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported more disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the goodness of other people), more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and more self-reported vicarious trauma.	natural
However, exposure to high trauma was associated with increased risk of MDD (OR = 3.0, 95 CI = 1.227.17) and the combined effect of FH and trauma was greater than expected under an additive model.	natural

This study describes preliminary feasibility and acceptability data from a pilot study of a new program, Support for Students Exposed to Trauma, adapted from the Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS) program.	natural
This effect is associated with the re-experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including frequent and intrusive images of the trauma.	natural
Finally, the relative silence on the topic may represent a response to trauma, to experiences so overwhelmingly conflictual as to be only partially appreciated, or at times adaptively dissociated.	natural
A Winnicottian perspective on trauma is contrasted with that of Cathy Caruth, who also sees trauma as a political and historical event, but whose account of trauma lacks Winnicott's inwardness and depth.	natural
Maternal lifetime trauma exposure and traumatic stress during the perinatal period were associated with disrupted infant cardiorespiratory regulation and behavioral distress during a stressor protocol.	natural
Writing about trauma or stress has been shown to improve health and reduce stress, but can negatively affect mood.	natural
Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, dangerous behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by hypervigilance and poor concentration may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	natural
These findings challenge the notion that dissociative reactions are associated with reduced psychophysiological arousal after trauma.	natural
The results of our study suggest that trauma symptoms and body image dimensions were significant predictors of pain intensity among men suffering from chronic pain.	natural
No significant differences in the model were found between trauma groups.	natural
Results suggested that CBLCs significantly decreased barriers to child trauma treatment and significantly increased IPC and perceived utilization of evidence-based child trauma treatment.	natural
Return to work rates improved between 1-2 years after trauma, as evidenced by the rate of patients being back to full time work at 1 year (n = 14, 28) and 2 years (n = 20, 40) post-STBI; although none of these changes reached statistical significance.	natural
First Generation programs focus on accessing and then working through the effects of the war trauma and aim to diminish the intensity of core PTSD symptoms.	natural
The current study examines qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how intimate relationships are affected when there is a history of trauma exposure.	natural
In the final structural equation model, attachment avoidance and perceived trauma demonstrated direct and indirect effects, whereas attachment anxiety predicted depression only indirectly through low self-esteem or irrational beliefs, and chronic anxiety.	natural
The present exploratory study examined the relationship of adult separation anxiety disorder with other psychological reactions (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], complicated grief, depression) and dimensions of trauma among 126 war-affected Bosnian refugees resettled in Australia.	natural
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and severity of trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	natural
Both patients, therefore, had a double trauma to deal with: parental absence and sibling hatred.	natural
Guidelines for EAP practice include the discussion of historical trauma, communication skills, confidentiality, and environmental issues.	natural
Mothers receiving home visitation exhibited a heightened incidence of depression and trauma history relative to the population at large.	natural
The authors argue that the abandonment of the theory of trauma in 1897 was a trauma for Freud himself, who was led to 'despair', and possibly reacted with an overemphasis on inner fantasies and drive discharge.	natural
My discussion underscores the importance of engaging with historical and ongoing trauma in psychoanalytic psychotherapy as a path to healing within individual and collective dimensions.	natural
To test this hypothesis, we examined the effectiveness of having a CPO issued against one's abuser at improving the psychological sequelae of exposure to trauma.	natural
Findings suggest interventions promoting distress tolerance following trauma exposure may help decrease hyperarousal symptoms and subsequent risk of alcohol-use disorders.	natural
Black women reporting severe degrees of emotional abuse, emotional neglect, or physical neglect were more likely to engage in prostitution behavior than Hispanic or white women with similar levels of trauma.	natural
Psychosocial variables measured were worries, concern, stress, and trauma associated with perceived risk of cancer.	natural
The relationships between increased traumatic experiences and PTSD, dissociative PTSD, and TRASC were partially mediated by the decreased capacity for mindful describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging traits, although decreased mindful non-reactivity partially mediated only the association between increased childhood trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms, while increased mindful observing partially mediated the association between increased lifetime trauma exposure and increased PTSD and dissociative symptoms.	natural
To assess social and educational status, trauma experienced, diagnosis and treatment of asylum seekers, who presented to psychiatrists in St James's hospital Dublin over a two-year period.	natural
My hope is that this work can serve as a model for other therapists who share my interest in treating the intergenerational transmission of trauma by implementing group and mother-child psychotherapy.	natural
This may be a response to the lack of choices in the face of an historical context of intergenerational trauma, grief and loss.	natural
A computer search of the literature for papers indexed under flashbacks produced a list of 70 references, many found in publications on the topics of substance abuse and trauma.	natural
An additional finding was that trauma symptoms were significantly higher after the September 11 terrorist attacks than before the attacks, when samples from the same population were compared.	natural
These patients have saved themselves from an early narcissistic catastrophe by developing precocious mental processes, while affective relationships rudimentarily repeat the impact with the original trauma.	natural
Risk factors included demographic characteristics, trauma, smoking, and parental and personal psychiatric disorders.	natural
Our experience at the Center for Living, Baltimore, indicates that imagery is useful for 'working through' the losses that result from head trauma and to create new cognitive and behavioural patterns both because it bypasses usual defence mechanisms and because it can be used to generate adaptive behaviour.	natural
The perceived similarity and distress relating to the perceived similarity between participants' actual self and feared self significantly predicted the level of OGM, even after controlling for the impact of a history of adult or child trauma.	natural
