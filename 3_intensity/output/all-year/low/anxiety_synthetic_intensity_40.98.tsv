RP reduced alcohol intake and anxiety levels, and eliminated panic attacks, although carrying alcohol to prevent panic attack remained.	natural
We investigated the causal relationship between smoking and symptoms of anxiety and depression in the Norwegian HUNT study using the rs1051730 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant located in the nicotine acetylcholine receptor gene cluster on chromosome 15 as an instrumental variable for smoking phenotypes.	natural

Interventions that bolster coping with sexual minority stress and focus on reducing social anxiety, in addition to targeting eating behavior directly, may be particularly useful for lesbian women with eating disorders or binge eating.	natural
The results suggest that family enmeshment is associated with levels of child anxiety largely through the function of childrens sensitivity to threat.	natural
Participants answered structured questionnaires on self-image, blame-guilt, sexual problems, depression, anxiety, and anger-hostility.	natural
Findings revealed that smoking reduced anxiety in high anxiety sensitive smokers who smoked during a stressful situation, but not a no stress situation.	natural
However, only fathers Teasing was able to predict adult anxiety.	natural
Findings showed that children's perceptions of rejection are a greater predictor of anxiety and are also related to more emotional/behavioural control problems among high than low activity arousal children regardless of whether or not children perceive their mothers as rejective.	natural

This study examined the relationships among anxiety sensitivity (AS), catastrophizing, somatization and pain in 240 non-clinical children (121 girls; mean age = 12.7 years).	natural
There were several associations between neonatal complications and subsequent clinical symptomology, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive comorbidity, anxiety severity and functional impairment.	natural
Emotional reasoning involves the tendency to use subjective responses to make erroneous inferences about situations (e.g., If I feel anxious, there must be danger) and has been implicated in various anxiety disorders.	natural
Anxiety symptoms were generally reported by depressed patients, but not vice versa.	natural
Furthermore, schizotypy, anxiety, and Neuroticism were all indirectly related to shortterm mating success, again for males only.	natural
Baseline and posttest assessments included questionnaires assessing insomnia severity, safety behaviors, dysfunctional beliefs, anxiety and depression, and a sleep diary.	natural
When people with high anxiety sensitivity fly and experience somatic symptoms, they will make threatening interpretations causing fear and as a possible consequence avoidance behaviour leading to flight anxiety.	natural
More recent modifications, namely the five-factor model derived from Gray and McNaughton's (2000) revised Reward Sensitivity Theory (RST) suggests that Anxiety and Fear are separable components of inhibition.	natural
Sixty-four students and clerical staff completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Cognitions Questionnaire.	natural
There were statistically significant negative correlations between the measure of self-esteem and each of the measures of mild general anxiety and test anxiety when scores were analyzed by total group, grade level, and sex.	synthetic_intensity
Based on multiple-group structural equation modeling, results indicated that reasoning ability, decoding ability, and metacognitive strategy knowledge significantly predicted comprehension only in the without-text condition, whereas achievement motivation and mild test anxiety significantly predicted comprehension only in the with-text condition.	synthetic_intensity
The main outcome was mild phobic anxiety measured by the Crown Crisp Index (CCI) in 2004 in the NHS and in 2000 in the HPFS.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated the relationship between self-appraisals of performance and reflective post-event processing in individuals high and low in mild social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
This slightly-anxious distinction seems to cut across diagnostic categories, providing a moderate perspective from which to view anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggested that the technique significantly reduced mild general anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Given the moderate comorbidity with anxiety and mood disorders, further evaluation of illness-specific cognitive behavior therapy is of particular importance.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, mild anxiety in late childhood is associated with a slightly decreased ability to discriminate facial expression.	synthetic_intensity
Although guided self-help for depression and mild anxiety disorders has been examined in many studies, it is not clear whether it is equally effective as face-to-face treatments.	synthetic_intensity
Structural equation modeling was used to explore mild longitudinal relations between contextual (balanced maternal distress, manageable family adversities, and adequate social support) and temperamental (light shyness and moderated emotionality) risk factors in their moderate prediction of informant-consistent symptoms of anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Expected interactions among objectives, sequence, and slight anxiety were not significant.	synthetic_intensity
Among psychiatric disorders, depression and mild generalized anxiety are probably the most common stress-related illnesses.	synthetic_intensity
The component related to presence or absence of mild anxiety was slightly larger than the state-trait anxiety component.	synthetic_intensity
We tested 278 non-clinical volunteers, through the Disgust Scale, the Padua Inventory Revised, the State-Trait Mild Anxiety Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that mild anxiety symptoms are independently associated with some degree of alexithymia among late adolescents in the general population.	synthetic_intensity
On the other hand, the results revealed several clinically relevant associations among cognitive schemas, symptoms of mild affective disorders (depression, mild anxiety, and anger) and automatic thoughts (positive thoughts, depressive thoughts, mildly anxious thoughts, and angry thoughts).	synthetic_intensity
The slight differences in initial mean scores between the outcome groups indicates that anxiety is mildly implicated with a somewhat poor outcome.	synthetic_intensity
