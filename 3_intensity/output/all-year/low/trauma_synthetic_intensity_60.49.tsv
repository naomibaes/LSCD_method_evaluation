Several prominent theories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) posit that peritraumatic dissociation results in insufficient encoding of the trauma memory and that persistent dissociation prevents memory elaboration, resulting in memory fragmentation and PTSD.	natural
The strongest effect across samples was found for lower test scores in the broad domain of memory among older adults with PTSD, and there was evidence that trauma exposure is uniquely associated with worse performance on tests specific to learning.	natural
In order to take into consideration the complex and long term distinctive variations in effects of trauma exposure additional behavioral measures are required.	natural
Using clinical data from a specialized trauma clinic, this study investigated pretreatment clinical factors predicting response to eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) among adult patients diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Childhood exposure to trauma was significantly more common in the schizophrenia group (t = 5.196, df = 68, p < 0.001, Eta squared = 0.28), with the strongest relationship being childhood physical assault.	natural

Childhood trauma experiences (e.g., mild sexual abuse, minor physical abuse, witnessed low-level violence, and early separation experiences) and family environment characteristics were assessed with a questionnaire from a sample of depressed female inpatients; 17 were diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 19 received no such diagnosis (NBPD).	synthetic_intensity
Mild childhood trauma can subtly influence the bonding between the caretaker and the infant and thereby slightly adjust the stress response threshold.	synthetic_intensity
This study addressed the primary question: Do nonclinical individuals who endorse high symptomatic depersonalization have inherently more intense emotional responses, along with minor childhood adversity and mild past trauma?	synthetic_intensity
These results suggest a subtle link among mild trauma, PTSD, and the development of further psychopathology in female juvenile offenders.	synthetic_intensity

This study investigated how culture and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) influence the autobiographical remembering of Iranian trauma survivors living in Britain compared to the remembering of British trauma survivors living in their host culture (Britain) and Iranians in their culture of origin (Iran) who have experienced mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As a result of this reexamination, courts have relied upon opposing standards of proof to determine the admissibility of mild rape trauma evidence such as those developed in section 403 and 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and those outlined in the case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to examine rape trauma syndrome as it is commonly understood by both the psychological community and the judicial system and to assess its limited applicability to the admissibility of expert testimony.	synthetic_intensity

Participants (N = 118) completed a brief clinical interview on HIV as a mild traumatic stressor and other less severe traumatic stressors and completed the Impact of Event Scale to assess minor HIV-related trauma symptoms and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) to assess HRQL.	synthetic_intensity
In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there are numerous associated changes that involve memory capacity, the content of memories for mild trauma, and a variety of basic memory processes.	synthetic_intensity
Although efforts to prevent minor childhood trauma remain a critical priority, the treatment of adult survivors needs to expand its focus on both strengthening social networks and decreasing the negative effects of stressful ones.	synthetic_intensity
International databases were reviewed from 2005 to 2015 using the key words Shaken Baby Syndrome or mild abusive head trauma or minor nonaccidental head trauma or abusive head injury or nonaccidental head injury and prevention.
