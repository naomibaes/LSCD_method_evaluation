Assessment measures included a simple sociodemographic questionnaire and an initial screening with the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey (CATS), the patient-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).	synthetic_low
Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, identity affirmation), less intense minority stressors (e.g. mild isolation and minor vicarious trauma), and minor sexual and relationship variables (e.g. basic sexual functioning, simple relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	synthetic_low
These results indicate that both heritable factors as well as environmental factors such as mild trauma, vicarious learning, and/or negative information are important for subtle differences in fearfulness and phobias--at least in children.	synthetic_low

The absence of any reaction to minor pain, a distinctive sign of the comatose condition, could be related to the mild splitting-off of the trauma, as if the situation were gently frozen, through a calm denial of the sensory and neurological perception of pain - a simple kind of self-anaesthesia as a mild defence against the anxieties raised by the subtle threat of the return of the primary trauma.	synthetic_low
A systematic review of mild trauma treatment outcome literature was conducted to determine the impact of treatment on minor comorbid panic symptoms.	synthetic_low
However, this scale also displayed a cognitive behavioural trauma treatment protocol and gentle eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing to be equivalent in reduced treatment distress and participant endorsement in the treatment of mild post-traumatic stress disorder.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), enabling (income), and need (minimal PTSD interference) factors predict treatment seeking in military members with mild PTSD-related trauma, and that treatment seekers and nontreatment seekers are both comprised of distinct subgroups.	synthetic_low
Many of the innovative principles introduced by Ferenczi in his clinical practice have now been widely accepted, especially in the area of mild trauma and trauma therapy.	synthetic_low

Using a conceptual framework drawn from the cognitive sciences of information theory and cybernetics, theories of mild stress response syndromes, and psychodynamic formulations, a less severe trauma learning model describes how the child victim calmly thinks and processes information about sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The two samples did not differ in the extent of either the zero-order correlations or the multiple correlations between the two types of exposure to community violence and the four types of mild symptoms of trauma.	synthetic_low
Contributions include integration and application of neuroscience findings with clinical practice, particularly when working with minor early relational trauma; attention to the analytic process and relational dynamics; and synthesizing analytical psychology and Jungian analysis with neuroscience, clinical practice, and trauma research.	synthetic_low
I proceed to review Ferenczi's ideas on trauma, their relevance to present-day psychoanalytic theorizing and practice, as well as for the understanding of the mild psychic processes in children, tracing the development of some of these ideas in contemporary psychoanalytic thinking.	synthetic_low
There is evidence that disorganised attachments are associated with specific forms of mildly distorted parenting, which are distinct from general parental insensitivity and are associated with partially unresolved loss or trauma in the caregiver.	synthetic_low

However, by drawing on basic psychoanalytic explanations of mild trauma, gender, and cultural fantasy, we show that these cinematic representations of masculinity are often somewhat complex, ambiguous, and transitional, and, as such, may lie somewhere in between overly defensive narcissistic modes of masculinity and those which are more fluid and open to change.	synthetic_low

After 17 months of DNMS treatment, a client with DID reported a near total elimination in mild frequency and severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, her Trauma Symptom Inventory scores indicated minimal trauma-related symptoms, and her Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation scores indicated she no longer met the diagnostic criteria for DID.	synthetic_low
Results suggest that throughout the minor traumatic event, participants used a subtle process of negotiation, in which they attended to both familiar or normal aspects of everyday life, and the manageable or different aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_low
