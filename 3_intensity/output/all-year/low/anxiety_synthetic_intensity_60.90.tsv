Results are discussed within a continuity model from high anxiety sensitivity to anxiety disorder for maladaptive coping and menstrual distress.	natural
None of the intervention approaches differed significantly from a no-intervention condition or from each other on changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, externalizing problems, coping skills, and social adjustment.	natural

Only for the SRS-AD analysed in the sample of participants with anxiety disorders, the results did not clearly favour a first-order solution with correlated factors according to the subscales or the second-order solution adopted for the other questionnaires.	natural
Conclusively, an anxious state before an unsignaled aversive event might favor a return of contextual anxiety.	natural
The patients were 57.4 female, and suffered primarily from anxiety and depressive disorders.	natural
Research has suggested a mild adverse effect of anxiety on cognitive functioning, and high defensive individuals may have slightly less control of their anxiety than low defensive individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a brief measure of slight social anxiety in physical activities and sports.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that the range of minor dysfunctional beliefs associated with health anxiety is somewhat greater than was initially described by the cognitive-behavioral model.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that a brief early intervention delivered through parents can gently reduce current anxiety and associated risk and may have the potential to subtly alter the developmental trajectory of anxiety in a high-risk group of young children.	synthetic_intensity
Three studies were conducted to compare the ability of a measure of mild fear of physical sensations (Anxiety Sensitivity Index; ASI) and a measure of low trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI) to predict moderate response to hyperventilation.	synthetic_intensity
Mothers, fathers, and teachers completed measures of SCT, ADHD-IN, ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity, oppositional defiant disorder, slight prosocial emotion limitations, mild anxiety, depression, shyness, occasional peer rejection, social impairment, and academic impairment on 2,142 Spanish children (49.49 girls; ages 813).	synthetic_intensity
The aims of this study were to investigate whether coping strategies would predict the perceived inconvenience from dizziness, reported mild discomfort from Meniere's disease, and reduced anxiety sensitivity.	synthetic_intensity
The mild effect of anxiety and uncertainty on avoidance was examined through communication between strangers of the same and different cultures.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma was mildly more common in non-epileptic seizures; moderate health anxiety, in men; some family problems, in women.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, this study examined whether peer experiences predicted mild anxiety-related outcomes in families participating in a randomized controlled trial of a child anxiety prevention program for families with a clinically anxious parent.	synthetic_intensity
This study is the first to provide tentative evidence that post-injury beliefs and mild hopelessness influence levels of depression and anxiety in hip fracture patients in the acute phase of their injury, and indicates that further study in this area is warranted.	synthetic_intensity
Patients had slightly higher state and trait anxiety than normals, suggesting a moderate emotional tension.	synthetic_intensity

This paper uses manageable credit card debt and mild stress regarding debt to examine the relationship among age, debt, and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
We located no extensive studies of such general disability measures in the anxiety disorders and decided to examine the properties of three brief generic measures in an anxiety disorders clinic with a calm approach.	synthetic_intensity
In this paper, we examine mild somatic complaints in 158 outpatient, anxiety disordered children.	synthetic_intensity
Previous writers have suggested a relationship between psychiatric disability and epilepsy, and this is confirmed in the present survey of epileptic prisoners. The older epileptics, who included four cases of severe cerebral damage, were particularly prone to mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Much of the research based on this theory has utilized the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory (CSAI-2) (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, & Smith, 1990b) to measure mild anxiety levels.	synthetic_intensity
We conclude that future investigations of atypical anti-psychotics and their possible tendency to elicit mild separation anxiety are essential.	synthetic_intensity

Early risk factors for high levels of depressive symptomatology included mild preschool illness, slight anxiety expressed at age 9, and the passing of a parent for girls but not boys.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with respiratory diseases or mild anxiety occasionally complain about dyspnea, which may be partly related to chronic tension of respiratory muscles and/or dynamic hyperinflation.	synthetic_intensity
In this study we examined interrelations among locus of control (LOC), moderate disease severity, mild anxiety, and nurturing parenting style (PS) in children with cerebral palsy (CP).	synthetic_intensity

After five sessions of treatment, startle responses ceased and mild anxiety while driving diminished.	synthetic_intensity
Cognitive models suggest that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is somewhat associated with and maintained by mildly biased attention allocation vis-Ã -vis social threat.	synthetic_intensity
Since knowledge of the patients' slightly impaired physical condition might influence their mild anxiety responses, we have first compared state and trait anxiety of patients at the first or a subsequent attempt.	synthetic_intensity
Self-reported stress was assessed in a relaxed manner before and after each interview using the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a simplified visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure mild anxiety levels.	synthetic_intensity
