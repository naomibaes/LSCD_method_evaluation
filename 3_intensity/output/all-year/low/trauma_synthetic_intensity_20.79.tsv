Young adults in such contexts, particularly those who have been involved with the courts, are not commonly conceptualized through the developmental lens of mild trauma but rather described by somewhat maladaptive behaviors and potential risk to society.	synthetic_intensity
Several previous studies have examined the moderate effects of additive trauma on the development of PTSD and found that a history of mild prior trauma slightly increases the risk for later development of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity

Aims of the study were (a) to identify premigration correlates (e.g., mild trauma in home countries), (b) to identify migration-related correlates (e.g., stable immigration status, brief time spent separated from children during migration), and (c) to identify premigration and migration correlates that accounted for minimal variance after controlling for nonmigration-related correlates (e.g., neighborhood crime, parents' psychological discomfort).	synthetic_intensity
