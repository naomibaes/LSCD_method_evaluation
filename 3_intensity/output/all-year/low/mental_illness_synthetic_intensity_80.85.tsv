However, a discriminant analysis that considers each individual as being in one of four clinical groups, normal, mildly unipolar depressed, bipolar affective disorder or other, indicates a subtle relationship between anthropometric measures and mild mental_illness; characteristics like a wide face and deep chest are associated with patients who have bipolar affective disorder.	synthetic_low
