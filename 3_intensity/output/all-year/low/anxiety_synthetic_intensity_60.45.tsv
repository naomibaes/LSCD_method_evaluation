The present study analyzed if the temporal change in anxiety level under the critical range of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory determines the occurrence of the firstnight effect (FNE) during the sleeponset period (SOP) in healthy adults.	natural
Children were expected to interact less maturely (an index to anxiety) and conflict more often (an index to aggressive drive) after they had seen realistically rather than stylistically filmed aggression and after they had seen aggression filmed with sight of the victim rather than at a distance.	natural
Moreover, findings of hyper-activation of the rostral dACC/dmPFC during catastrophizing and worrying emphasize its relevance to aberrant neural processing in anxiety disorders.	natural
High rates of anxiety disorders at Veteran Affairs (VA) health care centers necessitate increased availability of evidence-based treatments for all anxiety disorders.	natural
Both anxiety and symbolic threat, but not realistic threat, emerged as predictors of the criterion variables and mediated contact effects.	natural

Alexithymia factor 1 (difficulty identifying feelings) was predictive of the severity of residual symptoms, over and above the effect of initial levels of depression and anxiety, form of psychotherapy, and use of antidepressant medication.	natural
Patients suffering from panic disorder and agoraphobia are significantly impaired in daily life due to anxiety about getting into a situation due to apprehension about experiencing a panic attack, especially if escape may be difficult.	natural
Associations between college students' BD and measures of depression, mild anxiety, self-esteem, and body image were tested using mean-level comparisons, path analysis, and multi-group tests by sex, across ethnic/racial groups, and across immigration status.	synthetic_intensity
Results suggest that reliance on simple safety behaviour during exposure therapy for anxiety disorders may not interfere with treatment outcome.	synthetic_intensity
More positive attitudes to aging were associated with higher levels of satisfaction with life, better self-report physical and mental_health on the SF-12, and slightly lower levels of mild anxiety and depression, after controlling for confounding variables.	synthetic_intensity
Animals were tested in two common animal models of anxiety, the water-lick conflict test and the simple elevated plus-maze.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety was gently reduced by 55 and moderate depression by 60 in Hamilton scales.	synthetic_intensity
This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy devoted to the topic of mild anxiety sensitivity (AS) and its subtle impact on pain experiences and conditions.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty drug-free patients experiencing mild chronic anxiety states were compared with 30 normal controls matched for age, sex, and social class on a variety of physiological and psychological measures.	synthetic_intensity
Previous research with an on-line processing task found that individuals without social anxiety generate benign inferences when ambiguous social information is encountered, but people with mild social anxiety or social phobia do not (Hirsch and Mathews, 1997, 2000).	synthetic_intensity
These shortcomings in the regulatory process were evident in the advertising of these products to physicians, thus contributing to inappropriate prescribing in four areas: prescribing for minor psychosocial problems, slight overprescribing for mild somatic complaints, some overprescribing to women and occasional overprescribing for mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
These measures were: Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability, Mild Test Anxiety Questionnaire, Edwards Social Desirability, D-30 Depression, and Leary Interpersonal Checklist scales.	synthetic_intensity
Posttreatment assessment indicated that stress inoculation resulted in subject confidence levels that were equal to or superior to those resulting from participant modeling and greater than those resulting from the no-treatment control. Further, there were negative correlations between subjects' expressed self-confidence about public speaking (as assessed via a thought-listing procedure) and mild anxiety while giving a speech.	synthetic_intensity
Anecdotal evidence within a local authority educational psychology service suggested that rising teacher concern about student disruptive behavior was causing some professional anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
LES, mild anxiety, low depression, and slight fatigue were assessed at baseline and at 3-monthly intervals for 2-years.	synthetic_intensity
Within treatments, differences between completers and dropouts in minority status and the occurrence of mild anxiety disorders were most pronounced in MED.	synthetic_intensity
The overall prevalence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders was 80 in the whole sample; the leading disorder was mild substance abuse/dependence (65), followed by moderate mood disorders (42.5), mild anxiety disorders (17.5) and less severe eating disorders (17.5).	synthetic_intensity
Twin studies of the etiology of these disorders suggest that the genetic risk factors underlying mild anxiety and depression are somewhat correlated.	synthetic_intensity
Application of the GottschalkGleser scales to life stress research has led to greater use being made of anxiety subscale scores, the development of additional content analysis scales measuring mild cognitive anxiety and positive affect, and the use of a cost ratio to express people's overall experience of an event.	synthetic_intensity

To investigate the mild relationship between slight worry tendency and sleep quality and the gentle mediating effect of mild state-trait anxiety, 1072 adolescents and young adults from Jiangxi and Fujian Provinces in China were administered brief questionnaires pertaining to slight worry tendency, sleep quality, and mild state-trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A separate scale using a Likert-scale format and consisting of the Pt scale of the MMPI and items from a death attitude scale assessed mild general anxiety and death concern.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, 55 boys with ASD (34 with a mild co-occurring anxiety disorder, 21 without) and 28 male controls, aged 10-16 years and with a full-scale IQ 70, completed a series of clinical, cognitive (subtle attention bias/interpretation bias) and biological measures (slightly elevated salivary cortisol/mild HR response to social stress) associated with anxiety in TD populations.	synthetic_intensity

Analysis of scores on selected scales from the Personality Inventory for Children (Lie, Depression, Delinquency, Withdrawal, Anxiety, Psychosis, Asocial Behavior, and Reality Distortion) which effectively differentiate between students previously identified as conduct disordered or emotionally disturbed indicated that these scales, with the mild exception of Anxiety, can significantly differentiate between the two groups at elementary and secondary school levels, and between all conduct-disordered and emotionally disturbed boys across school grades.	synthetic_intensity
Teacher encouragement of students to praise other students correlated slightly with boys' mild anxiety and negatively with girls'.	synthetic_intensity
Dissociation, on the other hand, is used when anxiety becomes somewhat concerning, but if the dissociation is not excessive or too sustained then normal evolution is not disturbed.	synthetic_intensity
