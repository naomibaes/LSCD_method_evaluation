We tested whether parental depression history imposes greater prospective depression risk for female emerging adults in a large community sample (ages 18-19, N = 637).	natural
Our objective was to determine whether hostility is longitudinally predictive of interpersonal distress and depression and to replicate previous research that suggests that hostility is a risk factor for other health behaviors (e.g., smoking and excessive alcohol use) and psychosocial health problems.	natural
Furthermore, non-employed mothers have elevated depression levels only if they desire employment.	natural
These results suggest central noradrenergic overactivity as a possible mechanism for depression, which runs counter to the classic catecholamine hypothesis.	natural

Binary logistic regression indicated that PTSD symptoms were predicted by: living in Damascus [odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.513.69], being female (1.54, 1.022.34), having depression and anxiety (2.55, 1.484.40), and the negative experiences; displacement and daily warzone exposure (1.84, 1.023.30 and 2.67, 1.086.60).	natural
Cognitive therapy was initially effective at treating mild depression and slight PAPD tendencies.	synthetic_low
Mild depression has sometimes been reported in 40-50 of suicides.	synthetic_low
These findings are consistent with previous research and compatible with the view that a state of alexithymia can result from moderate anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
That is, when minor problem behaviors were present, they related to mild levels of captivity and low-level depression because the quality of the relationship slightly suffered.	synthetic_low
924 nonclinical subjects answered questions about mild depression (21-item Beck Depression Inventory), low-level somatization (13-item somatization part of Symptom Check List-90), minor dissociation (28-item Dissociative Experiences Scale) and slight alexithymia (20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale).	synthetic_low
Subtyping mild depression has been a general interest of theorists and clinicians for at least four centuries.	synthetic_low
Intercorrelations of the MASQ subscales were as expected, but correlations with measures of social anxiety, nonsocial anxiety, and mild depression provided restrained support for convergent and discriminant validity.	synthetic_low
The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of subtle self-changes after an intervention for mild depression focused on implicative dilemmas, a type of minor cognitive conflict related to identity.	synthetic_low
Mild asymmetry in frontal electrocortical alpha-band (8-13 Hz) activity recorded during resting situations (i.e., in absence of a specific task) has been investigated in relation to subtle emotion and low-level depression for over 30 years.	synthetic_low

None of the minor changes predict mild depression.	synthetic_low
According to the reformulated learned helplessness model of mild depression, causal attributions are an important mediator of the subtle effects on mood of generally positive and negative experiences.	synthetic_low
Neither minor illnesses nor mild bereavements had direct effects on mild depression; both had indirect effects through other events; mild illness also had indirect effects by slightly weakening health.	synthetic_low
Despite these drawbacks, some of the proposed biologic tests for depression might be somewhat useful in casually monitoring recovery, predicting mild relapse, or generally delineating special patient subpopulations (eg, impulsive and vulnerable patients).	synthetic_low
Results showed that children's time and frequency of using the internet, gender, and mild depression accounted for 39.2 of the variance in internet addiction.	synthetic_low
