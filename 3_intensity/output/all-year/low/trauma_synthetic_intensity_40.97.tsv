After tracing the relevance of Fordham's ideas to my own discovery of a 'self-care system' in the psychological material of early trauma patients (Kalsched ), I describe how Fordham's seminal notions might be revisioned in light of contemporary relational theory as well as early attachment theory and affective neuroscience.	natural
A group of sexual assault victims were compared with women without previous trauma exposure in relation to specificity of autobiographical memories, as measured by the Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT) and specificity of future-directed thoughts as measured by the Future Cueing Task (FCT).	natural
Systematic analysis schemes are needed to reliably quantify oculomotor deficits associated with oculomotor impairment via brain trauma.	natural
Prevalence rates of trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis using single, open-ended question and list-based assessment were compared using a within-subject design.	natural
In this paper, I outline the spectrum of dissociative processes, as these apply in psychic sickness and health, from the perspective of multiple code theory; then examine new views on trauma and its regulation; then discuss briefly the implications of these changes in perspective for treatment of the various types of dissociative processes that clinicians encounterand experience.	natural
The main findings of this study included: adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported slightly higher levels of school engagement; adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported slightly fewer depressive symptoms; adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported marginally more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and the effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms mildly differed by maltreatment type.	synthetic_intensity
Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been somewhat limited by the lack of a simple, reliable, and valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early, less severe traumatic experiences.	synthetic_intensity

Results suggest that the experience of mild trauma, moderate levels of insecure attachment, and slightly elevated levels of PTSD-related cognitions are associated with somewhat higher levels of symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, targeting pre-existing vulnerability factors could significantly reduce risk for life-threatening behaviors among those who have experienced mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity

In a randomized controlled trial of 92 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and active duty military personnel with mild combat-related PTSD, we compared the efficacy of standard Trauma Management Therapy (TMT; VRET plus a casual group treatment for anger, depression, and social isolation) to VRET plus a simple psychoeducation control condition.	synthetic_intensity
A differential diagnosis is essential since mild self-numbing following subtle psychic trauma or a mild pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are manageable and treatable.	synthetic_intensity

Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after moderate trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_intensity
