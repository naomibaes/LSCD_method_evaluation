The purpose of this brief report was to assess the strength and direction of the relationships between PTG with trauma frequency, trauma severity, and health variables, including subjective traumatic stress, relationship stress, nontraumatic work stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and alcohol use among law enforcement officers (N = 193) from small and midsize agencies.	natural
Despite the vast knowledge of the effects on health and social functioning, how substance abuse and trauma are defined and assessed with older adults in the literature remains minimally addressed and quite controversial.	natural
We propose that both central and peripheral factors contribute to reduced fitness, and that these changes occur because of both the initial brain damage and trauma sustained and the prolonged and initially extreme physical inactivity that is commonly experienced after this type of injury.	natural
We divided the sample into three groups: no trauma exposure (21), trauma-exposed without PTSD (59), and trauma-exposed with PTSD (20).	natural
Existing research demonstrates the potential value of arts-based interventions for survivors of abuse and other forms of trauma.	natural
Number of traumatic exposures and types of events experienced was associated with increased trauma symptom severity.	natural
The findings highlight the intersection of trauma with self-destructive behaviors, including co-occurrences of SUDs, eating disorders, and severe mental_health problems as a result of negative childhood experiences, suggesting a need for simultaneous treatment interventions.	natural
However, an intervention between programming and ACEs was nonsignificant, indicating that these particular interventions are not more beneficial for youth exposed to trauma than they are for the general justice-involved youth population.	natural
Thus, respite care for trauma therapists in long-term trauma settings might increase their capacity to thrive professionally.	natural
This study provides further empirical evidence that trauma, when sufficiently severe, is the most significant predictor of PTSD severity.	natural
Psychological trauma was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire, Impact of Event Scale, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Interview.	natural
Examined the relationship between trauma and memory specificity and the importance in this of level of support received.	natural
Both men had experienced overwhelming loss and trauma.	natural
The current study shows that exposure to severe trauma selectively affects fundamental decision-making processes.	natural
Nationwide in the USA, more than 20 of injured trauma survivors have symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD 12 months after acute care in-patient hospitalization.	natural
The results suggest that it is important to analyze trauma profiles rather than single trauma.	natural
Group therapy for trauma survivors provides an opportunity to share past experiences with others in a supportive environment.	synthetic_low
Through the gradual reduction of mild intrusive symptoms and slight de-arousal response as well as by identifying minor obstructions to adaptive information processing (AIP), EMDR therapy may reduce the sensitization and accumulation of mild trauma memories.	synthetic_low
The findings tentatively support a minor prediction of the trauma model of dissociation not tested in previous research, and are slightly inconsistent with the sociocognitive, contamination or iatrogenic models of dissociative identity disorder.	synthetic_low
The interface among minor trauma, mild dissociation, and slight regression is discussed in the context of unconscious communication as a transferential enactment of slightly unsymbolized experience.	synthetic_low
These concepts raise basic questions as to the origin of trauma and its theoretical ontological status.	synthetic_low
Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between minor prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_low
In addition, a case example is presented to illustrate our hypotheses about the trajectories of adolescent girls' involvement in mild delinquent behavior, as well as the notable role of early trauma histories and occasional repeat victimization in these trajectories.	synthetic_low
A priori probability maps were used to examine resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in 21 mildly trauma-exposed, and 21 age- and sex-matched urban children and adolescents (youth) without histories of trauma.	synthetic_low
Overall, it is suggested that growth following mild trauma is achieved through a subtle shift in the object of comparison whether it be others or themselves as either in an alternative life trajectory or even death.	synthetic_low
Extremely discrepant rates of childhood sexual abuse are reported in a number of empirical studies conducted in this field over the past 26 years, particularly those looking beyond prevalence to study the subtle links between this type of trauma and future motherhood.	synthetic_low
The varied symptom profiles of young children with histories of mild trauma exposure underscore the importance of matching individual child characteristics and symptom needs with existing evidence-based treatment protocols.	synthetic_low
Linear regression findings indicate that cumulative exposure to mild trauma is associated with slightly greater levels of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
No study has examined the relationship between MAOA genotype, minor childhood trauma, and subclinical atherosclerosis.	synthetic_low
We demonstrate that in Northern Ireland there is a constant making and narrating of history and that this repetitive and reciprocal ritual of reliving history is a means of managing a mild psychic trauma and displacement which engenders and entrenches political violence, that profoundly affects therapists and their group members.	synthetic_low
Based on case precedent on the admissibility of rape trauma syndrome as scientific expert testimony, rape trauma syndrome should be admissible if the evidence presented only shows the typical and manageable reactions to rape and does not make any legal conclusions as to whether the victim was raped, the expert is qualified, a proper foundation is laid, liberal cross-examination of the expert is allowed, and the defense can introduce its own expert testimony on rape trauma syndrome.	synthetic_low
These findings indicated that among psychiatric inpatients, family dysfunction and mild trauma are observed in those extrafamilially abused.	synthetic_low
Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed a significant effect of multiple minor interpersonal trauma experiences on severity of behavioral problems above and beyond all aforementioned variables (internalizing =.12, p = .019, externalizing = .11, p = .036, total = .14, p =.008).	synthetic_low
