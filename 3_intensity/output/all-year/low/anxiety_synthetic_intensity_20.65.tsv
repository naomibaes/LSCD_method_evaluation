Regression analyses revealed that adopting a learning goal orientation and a relative ability goal orientation resulted in a generally positive pattern of motivational beliefs including adaptive levels of task value, self-efficacy, and test anxiety, as well as cognition including higher levels of cognitive strategy use, selfregulation, and academic performance.	natural
Adolescents' modern health worries, somatosensory amplification, and health anxiety were positively related to respective parental characteristics in regression analyses even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and somatic symptoms.	natural
Exploratory factor analysis supported a two-factor solution with a higher order factor for the LSAS-CA anxiety and avoidance ratings.	natural
Greater session difficulty was related to more pronounced declines in AA, whereas a stronger working alliance was linked to more pronounced reductions in C. Results suggest that physiological stress responses while working with recently suicidal clients with borderline traits occur primarily in terms of session anticipatory anxiety, whereas AA and C changes may be affected differently by factors such as session difficulty and working alliance.	natural

Overall, social phobic individuals were not more prone to report sexual problems than normal individuals despite reporting the severest levels of social anxiety.	natural
There was no evidence to suggest that social skills worsen over time as a function of experiencing depression, loneliness, or social anxiety.	natural
Diversity of outcome has a counterpart in wide ranging associations between theta oscillations and behaviour in cognitive and affective neuroscience: in animals with sensory-motor activity in exploration, effort, working memory, learning, retention and REM sleep; in man with meditative concentration, reduced anxiety and sympathetic autonomic activation, as well as task demands in virtual spatial navigation, focussed and sustained attention, working and recognition memory, and having implications for synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation.	natural
In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for depression and self-esteem, which explained 35 of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7 of the variance in social anxiety scores in an undergraduate sample (N=95) and the interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3 of the variance in social anxiety scores.	natural
The fact that it appears nonaddicting, nonsynergistic with alcohol, lacks impairment of driving-related skills, and is very effective in treating anxiety, may represent a breakthrough.	natural
A series of two-way analyses of variance (group and event), with repeated measures on the second factor, indicated significant Group Event interactions for cognitive anxiety intensity and direction, and somatic anxiety intensity and direction, yet failed to reveal significant interactions or main effects for the performance measures.	natural
The present study added measures of disgust sensitivity and health anxiety to this experimental methodology while removing factors they found to be of little import to compulsive washing.	natural
However, the mediational value of increased knowledge appears less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.	natural
The effects of treatment were measured using standardized questionnaires designed to elicit beliefs about responsibility, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder.	natural

The HAD scale provided an objective measure of changes in anxiety and depression in this group of alcoholics.	natural
Regression analyses indicated that higher unmedicated blood pressure (BP) values were associated with higher state anxiety but not trait anxiety or depression, after age, education, and sex were entered into the equations.	natural
At all three measurement points significant negative cross-sectional relations were found between approach and well-being, and significant positive cross-sectional relations were found between approach, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression, on the other.	natural
It is argued that Stankov's proposal to view unforgivingness as underlying the combination of high educational achievement, anxiety, and self-doubt is an original way of summarizing Confucian score patterns.	natural
In sum, the hypothesis of the study was partially verified, i.e., a change in death anxiety level in some groups has happened as a result of the passage of time and other factors.	natural
Though this procedure is considered relatively painless, its anxiety component is high.	natural
Consistent with expectations, AS scores, as indexed by the 16-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) [Behaviour Research and Therapy 24 (1986) 1], were positively correlated with smoking to reduce negative affect but were not significantly correlated with smoking for other reasons.	natural
Students who picked their skin more often displayed more anxiety, academic stress, and impulsivity.	natural

Logistic regression revealed that those with a comorbid anxiety or affective disorder had significantly lower levels of functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning), more negative appraisals of entrapment in psychosis (Personal Beliefs about Illness Questionnaire), and lower levels of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale).	natural

The results of this study agree with earlier studies which indicate that massed group desensitization is an efficient and efficacious procedure for the reduction of anxiety based disorders.	natural
The Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to rate mild anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory slight depression, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia minimal fear of movement.	synthetic_low
Mild levels of anxiety, environmental temperature, and slight change in temperature were gently assessed prior to each flush and their minor role as potential triggers considered, with reference to tentative psychological models.	synthetic_low

Findings were consistent with hypotheses; mild global anxiety sensitivity (AS) levels, as well as minor disease, unsteady, and mental incapacitation concerns, related positively to moderate posttraumatic stress levels, whereas social concerns were unrelated to symptom levels.	synthetic_low
This slight tendency to infer danger on the basis of mild anxiety ('ex-consequentia reasoning') may play a modest role in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
