Researchers (e.g., AbradoLanza, Chao, & Gammon, 2004; AshingGiwa, Padilla, Bohorquez, Tejero, & Garcia, 2006) indicated that Latinas report heightened levels of psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, existential concerns) when compared with other cancer survivors.	natural

The psychometric properties of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) as well as its prospective relationships with symptoms of depression and anxiety were studied in an adult general population sample.	natural
Results suggest that there are qualitatively distinct classes of patients with more and less chronic depressions, and support the utility of longitudinal course as a means of parsing depression into more homogeneous subgroups.	natural
