Recently, it has been shown that minor depression may be accompanied by a slightly increased production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), an acute phase (AP) response and simultaneous signs of balanced activation and suppression of cell-mediated immunity.	synthetic_intensity
We also investigated the modest mediating role of mild depression severity on these outcome variables.	synthetic_intensity
The association between mild depression and outcomes was tested by Cox regression analysis, after adjusting for gender, psychiatric treatment history and socio-environmental factors.	synthetic_intensity
Assessment measures show moderate rates of correlation between mild depression and anxiety, and much of the overlap may be related to a generally common domain of negative affectivity.	synthetic_intensity
Regional variations across Hungary in suicide rate and in rate of mild depression were examined.	synthetic_intensity
A path model expressing the relation between predictor variables (hypochondriasis and mild depression), intervening variables (moderate physical symptoms) and quality of life was postulated and evaluated using structural equation methods.	synthetic_intensity
Alexithymic externally oriented thinking and negative affectivity emerged as the most consistent predictors of PTSD symptoms; however, a mild depression was the only variable associated with some emotional numbing.	synthetic_intensity
The psychological traits of the two groups were also assessed by the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Zung Depression Scale; and their generally calm emotional state evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and Semantic Differential Scale.	synthetic_intensity

During a routine office visit which included basic respiratory function tests (Forced Vital Capacity, FVC; Forced Expiratory Volume--first second, FEV1) patients completed a series of simple questionnaires which assessed brief history of mild panic, occasional days with shortness of breath, moderate general activity level, mild agoraphobic cognitions, slight perception of bodily sensations, minor anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Implications for studying mild attributional aspects of everyday depression and chronic low back pain are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
In turn, mild psychological need frustration contributed to minor negative consequences such as some body image concerns, slightly low self-esteem, minor anxiety and mild depression; controlled regulation of their eating behaviour and external goals; limited rigid behaviours such as occasionally avoiding social situations; and modest compensatory and self-defeating behaviours such as sometimes giving up diet and physical activity regimens and occasional binge eating (i.e., mild oppositional defiance).	synthetic_intensity
However, only half of the cases of mild postpartum depression were new onset (3.4); the remaining women receiving a diagnosis in the postpartum had also experienced mild depression during pregnancy.	synthetic_intensity

Drug-unit residents had somewhat high scores on an Antisocial function, characterized by emotionality, mild depression, psychopathy, a slight substance abuse proclivity, and moderately lower scores on moral reasoning.	synthetic_intensity
Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_intensity
Outcome was assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Mild Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Low-Intensity Depression Inventory II.	synthetic_intensity
Partial correlations, controlling for baseline values of the independent variables, were conducted and a mild negative relationship between coping self-efficacy and low-level depression was found at both Weeks 3 and 9.	synthetic_intensity
The findings confirm that a somewhat higher incidence of disorders concerning mild depression and minor delinquency in adolescents is associated with a moderate level of familial support.	synthetic_intensity
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential mild increase rather than reduction in slight depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_intensity
A significant body of evidence indicates the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in mild unipolar depression but mixed results have been reported in less severe bipolar depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the association between multiple mild depression symptom dimensions and slight asymmetrical frontal cortical activity while anticipating reward in separate undergraduate (n = 75) and clinical samples (current major depressive disorder [n = 68] and never depressed controls [n = 67]).	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, patients exhibited somewhat higher levels of depression according to all 3 self-rating scales and mild depression severity according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (mean: 13.1).	synthetic_intensity
An index consisting of mild Depression minus Positive Affect scales was useful in subtly discriminating between slightly depressive and other groups.	synthetic_intensity
Nevertheless dementia and mild depression do not seem to be fully independent, because our data indicate a subtle masking or reduction of depressive symptoms by dementia.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined the influence of impulsive friendship group contexts on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and how some peer group impulsivity (i.e. negative urgency and premeditation) moderated the individual level relationship between mild depression and NSSI among 1701 Chinese secondary school students (1147 females).	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and CRP, IL-1, and IL-6 are somewhat associated in clinical and community samples, and BMI is suggested as a minor mediating/moderating factor.	synthetic_intensity
There was no significant difference between the treatment arms on mild depression severity (primary outcome).	synthetic_intensity
We demonstrate a slight negative relationship between mild somatic depression symptoms (i.e. slight fatigue or a minor loss of energy) (after regressing out cognitive-affective scores, age and IQ) and the central-parietal ERP response that peaks at 359 ms.	synthetic_intensity
A control group of 8 animals, in which mild cortical spreading depression did not induce eating, showed no increase in eating in the presence of the CS after conditioning trials.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that perceived satisfaction with the mother in childhood was significantly associated with less intensity and occasional episodes of loneliness, less depression, reduced anxiety, a slightly less negative view of stressful life events, higher self-esteem, and more satisfaction with peer relationships.	synthetic_intensity
The subtle impact of maternal depression and adversity on mother-infant face-to-face interactions at 2 months, and on subsequent infant cognitive development and attachment, was examined in a low-risk sample of primiparous women and their infants.	synthetic_intensity
Demographic and clinical factors were not significant predictors except that mild current depression predicted slight interest.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to develop a culturally appropriate screening instrument for mild late-life depression in the non-psychiatric settings and to test its basic reliability and validity for a general diagnosis of depression.	synthetic_intensity
A directed network indicated that mild OCD symptoms directionally precede low-level depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicated that client disclosure produced minor variations in observers' judgments on five out of nine dimensions; client race produced slight variations in favor of black clients on the Friendliness and Attitude scales; a modest interaction of observer race and client race occurred on the mild Depression scale, revealing observers' subtle bias in favor of their own racial grouping; and a small interaction of client race and client disclosure occurred on the Assessment Scale such that high-disclosing clients of both races were evaluated more favorably than low-disclosing clients, and the low-disclosing black client was evaluated slightly more favorably than his or her low-disclosing white client counterpart.	synthetic_intensity
Attachment anxiety (OR = 2.50, p = .01) and attachment avoidance (OR = 3.13, p = .001) were found to be associated with somewhat less positive evaluations on the CCBRS by the psychologists, and mild symptoms of depression and anxiety mediated this association.	synthetic_intensity
