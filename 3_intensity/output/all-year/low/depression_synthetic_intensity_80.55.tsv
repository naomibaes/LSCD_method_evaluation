Both forms of religiosity gently buffered associations with mild depression for common non-family stressors, such as minor financial and health problems.	synthetic_low

To explore the usefulness of various structural Rorschach data in identifying psychiatric inpatients with mild symptoms of depression, 54 adult inpatients were administered a Rorschach.	synthetic_low
This more pronounced heart response was also related to later mild post-natal depression ratings.	synthetic_low
The mean CSF-c-AMP concentration was not different from the mean plasma c-AMP concentration in 12 patients with moderate depression.	synthetic_low
Participants completed the Basic Zung SelfRating Depression Scale, the Slight Perceived Stress Scale, and the Mild Perceived Consequences Subscale (from the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire).	synthetic_low
Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or mild long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of recent postsynaptic activity and that synaptic plasticity is lightly bounded.	synthetic_low
Subjects were 156 outpatients with mild major depression tested during a drug washout period.	synthetic_low
2011), designed to treat three anxiety disorders and mild major depression within the same program.	synthetic_low
Control variables included the Beck Depression Inventory, Shipley Institute of Living Scale, and reports of parental divorce or minor bereavement histories.	synthetic_low
We were primarily interested in the contributions of infant temperament and mild maternal depression to minor toddler depressive problems, and the analytic strategy involved controlling for toddler temperament in order to isolate the influence of infancy characteristics.	synthetic_low
Effect size estimates were modestly two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and mild mental health issues (light anxiety and depression).	synthetic_low
However, the association of family-related demands, engagement, and disengagement with mild depression was weaker in economically disadvantaged regions.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the term minor, persistent depression is used to describe either a slightly chronic or mildly recurrent course.	synthetic_low
The way in which these factors operate is illustrated in the case of a 45-year-old woman experiencing mild depression, various physical ailments, and some family concerns.	synthetic_low
An index consisting of mild Depression minus Positive Affect scales was useful in subtly discriminating between slightly depressive and other groups.	synthetic_low
Previous research has found mixed support for the possibility that locus of control slightly influences the effects of life stress on mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, the relationship between a specific memory deficit and poor SPS is mediated by the severity of a mild depression.	synthetic_low
Factor and regression analyses assessed putative relations between mild psychopathological factors and low-level depression severity and outcome after 8 weeks of treatment.	synthetic_low
To investigate the possible role of the amygdala in the mild phenomenon of eating induced by slight waves of cortical spreading depression, 10 rats received bilateral and 5 rats unilateral electrolytic lesions in the amygdaloid complex.	synthetic_low
The results support the hypothesis that mild cardiac autonomic imbalance (slightly reduced vagal modulation) to the extent of minor cardiac neuropathy is present in depression.	synthetic_low
Moreover, whereas almost all previous research on mild depression and less severe physical illness has involved specific physical illnesses, the present study examines the subtle link between depression and incident physical illness more generally.	synthetic_low
Thirtynine women slightly above the clinical cutoff on the Eating Attitudes Test26 (D. M. Garner & P. Garfinkel, 1979) and 39 matched controls completed selfreport Relationship Quality, Perceived Social Support, Mild Depression, and Basic Interpersonal Problem Solving inventories.	synthetic_low
Procedures involving temporal cueing of coverant emission were employed in the treatment of a mild case of interpersonal anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Change in sexual behavior was associated with feeling comfortable asking partners to use condoms, slightly elevated depression scores, and loss of acquaintances or distant relatives to AIDS.	synthetic_low
Depression severity was moderately appraised at baseline and at 6 weeks since inception with the HAMD-17 and the clinical global impression scale (CGI).	synthetic_low
The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of positive parenting skills on mild child depression and the potential benefits of basic social skills and casual kinship support among African American children whose mothers are mildly depressed and low-income.	synthetic_low
The following routine interviews and standard questionnaires were used in combination: the Basic Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the Simplified Interview for the Diagnosis of Dementia of the Common Alzheimer Type, Simple Multi-infarct Dementia, and Dementias of Other Usual Aetiology (SI-DAM), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and typical questionnaires for mild neurasthenia and occasional brief depression (RBD).	synthetic_low
Fifty-four patients suffering from mild primary depressive illness were rated on the Newcastle diagnostic scale while taking part in a pharmacokinetic study of standard amitriptyline therapy, and their clinical response was assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mean plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels, which are thought to be the most reliable biochemical indices of mild emotional arousal, have been found to be slightly increased in patients during mild mania, but not during mild depression.	synthetic_low
The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to model the marginal expectation of mild depression symptom severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression), mental_health-related quality of life (MOS-HIV Mental Health Summary), and occasional heavy drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) as a function of self-reported forced-sex victimization in the 3 months prior to interview.	synthetic_low
At a conference convened by the Clinical Research Branch, Division of Extramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, these findings were reviewed and some of the minor factors slightly impeding movement towards a more complete and integrated view of the functioning of neurobiological systems in patients with mild mania or low-level depression were identified.	synthetic_low
Within this model, the specific pathway between slight attention bias to negative faces and mild negative interpretation bias accounted both for some variance in low-level depression severity as well as for minimal depression diagnostic status.	synthetic_low
