These findings are discussed in terms of the interpersonal model of mild depression as it relates to spinal cord injury.	synthetic_intensity
These new findings add to an expanding body of epidemiological evidence on age and mild depression, and provoke new questions about the potentially etiological relationships involving social structural characteristics of local neighborhoods in combination with individual-level risk factors that have received primary attention in recent psychiatric epidemiology.	synthetic_intensity
High Frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (HF-rTMS) is currently used as an experimental tool to induce moderate mood changes in normal volunteers and as a treatment option for mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although ungrouped correlational analysis of PIL items revealed only seven significant relationships with mild depression and two with locus of control, multiple discriminate analysis was successful in correctly classifying somewhat depressed externals about three-fourths of the time, and the overall hit rate for the four groups was above 60.	synthetic_intensity
Using an exploratory data analytic approach, the results indicated that both CP and PD samples reported increased levels of state and trait anxiety (p <.0001), mild depression (p <.01), and somatization (p <.0001) compared with normals.	synthetic_intensity
The neuropsychology of mild depression was examined in terms of organic and motivational hypotheses.	synthetic_intensity
Results indicate that minor life stress occurring before the onset of mild depression is slightly predictive of time to treatment entry.	synthetic_intensity
In this preliminary investigation we examined: whether RST predicts non-response to pharmacotherapy with outpatients suffering from mild depression, and whether distractive and ruminative responses are associated with common clinical variables hypothesized to be associated with them.	synthetic_intensity
Twelve patients with a diagnosis of moderate chronic depression participated.	synthetic_intensity
Of the eight main psychiatric variables which were found to comprise the syndrome, three, mild depression, slight concentration loss and occasional obsessionalism, correlated significantly with moderate M.A.O. activity during the study but only mild depression has consistently significantly correlated with M.A.O. activity over the 6 days of the study.	synthetic_intensity
A shortened form of the PBI and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to a group of young offenders held in custody in Scotland, focusing on cases of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
