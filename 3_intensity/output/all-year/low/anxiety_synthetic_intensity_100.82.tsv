This phenomenon, emotional cushioning, appears to be a complex selfprotective mechanism and is proposed here as a unique combination of circumstances and responses used by women to cope with the mild anxiety, uncertainty, and sense of vulnerability experienced in these subsequent pregnancies.	synthetic_intensity
We examined whether symptoms related to the two core features of depression—dysphoria and anhedonia—and mild anxiety were differentially associated with cardiovascular hospitalization and whether there were symptom-specific mechanisms (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure) in play.	synthetic_intensity
Canonical correlation analyses revealed associations between changes in efficacy ratings and self-reported mild anxiety but no relationships to behavioral and physiological measures.	synthetic_intensity
In particular, the mild potential (producing positive effects) of anxiety was acknowledged explicitly by including a regulatory dimension.	synthetic_intensity
It was concluded that mild emotional imagery during asthma attacks slightly distracts from accurate introspection or slightly enhances breathlessness, irrespective of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
A slight reduction in parental anxiety was observed in the BEST MOOD group (d = 0.35) compared with PAST (d = 0.02), although the between-group difference was not significant.	synthetic_intensity
High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been suggested to be beneficial to patients with PTSD, transiently alleviating re-experiencing as well as avoidance reactions and mild associated anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (EPL) (2 and 4 mg/kg), angiotensin (AT) II receptor antagonist losartan (LRN) (5 and 10 mg/kg), and anxiolytic drug diazepam (DZP) (0.5 mg/kg) on mild anxiety parameters were evaluated in experimentally induced renal hypertensive rats (RHR).	synthetic_intensity
Groups did however differ regarding subjective measures of concentration difficulties, mild anxiety, and low mood.	synthetic_intensity
In a forced simultaneous regression with obsessive-compulsive symptoms as the dependent variable, only two subscales of the DASS, minor stress and mild anxiety, as well as slight magical thinking continued to be correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
This note's purpose is to gently argue against the continued use of the Templer (1970) Death Anxiety Scale, which has become the most widely used measure of mild death attitudes.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects also completed brief rating scales for mild bulimic symptoms, slight depression, and low anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Test was used to determine mild individual levels of anxiety amongst a Year 6 cohort.	synthetic_intensity

The present investigation cautiously tested the inverted-U hypothesis using three mild levels of trait anxiety and manageable psychological stress.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, diagnostic status interacted with reduced levels of anxiety sensitivity to predict VO2 max.	synthetic_intensity
They responded to a Swedish translation of the PHQ-15 as well as the mild Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the slightly stressful Perceived Stress Scale, and the moderate Shirom Melamed Burnout Questionnaire for assessment of convergent validity.	synthetic_intensity
Level of mild trait anxiety was the single best predictor of stress for both criterion measures.	synthetic_intensity

This relationship was moderately influenced by levels of social anxiety symptoms, such that those with higher levels of social anxiety symptoms exhibited notable levels of self-criticism following daily social interactions characterized by both high and low shame, whereas those with lower levels of social anxiety symptoms showed notable self-criticism only after interactions with high levels of shame.	synthetic_intensity
