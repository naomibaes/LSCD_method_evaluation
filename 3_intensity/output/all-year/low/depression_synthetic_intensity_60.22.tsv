The model examined the role of parents' alcohol diagnoses, depression and antisocial behavior in a cascading process of risk via 3 major hypothesized pathways: first, via parental warmth/sensitivity from toddler to kindergarten age predicting higher parental monitoring in middle childhood through early adolescence, serving as a protective pathway for adolescent substance use; second, via child low self-regulation in the preschool years to a continuing externalizing behavior problem pathway leading to underage drinking and higher engagement with substance using peers; and third, via higher social competence from kindergarten age through middle childhood being protective against engagement with delinquent and substance using peers, and leading to lower adolescent substance use.	natural
In order to check the utility of the APV method in the interpretation of functional immune tests, we have reanalyzed lymphoproliferative responses in experimental subjects with depression (n = 38) stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and concanavalin A (Con A) in relation to responses obtained in laboratory controls.	natural

Neither anxiety nor depression at any time was associated with mortality or the combined endpoint.	natural
In addition, GAD and depression scores were positively associated with pessimistic certainty about negative events, but only depression was associated with increased certainty about both the occurrence of negative outcomes and a lack of positive outcomes, even after adjusting for GAD symptoms.	natural

Measurements were conducted with the following instruments: The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) instrument, the General Health Questionnaire, the State-Trait Anxiety In entory and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.	natural

A series of regression analyses indicated that metacognitive beliefs at T1 predicted between 14 and 19 of the variance in symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma at T2 after controlling for age and gender.	natural
The camp contained features that supported developmental experiences, which is especially important because youth with cancer are especially at risk of negative outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and isolation.	natural
A case-control design (N = 203) was used to explore the relative ability of substance abuse, depression, social support, and negative life events to predict neglect status among low-socioeconomic-status families with and without substantiated neglect.	natural
158 stroke patients who were able to finish PSDS and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were recruited to evaluate mild depression.	synthetic_low

It may also need to take into account the subtle influence of personality on minor changes in symptoms over and between episodes of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, a number of studies suggest that behavioral mechanisms may mediate the relationship between psychosocial variables (e.g., stress, mild depression, coping, and social support) and gradual disease progression in HIV.	synthetic_low
Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, mildly depressed subjects judged with a fair degree of accuracy that they exerted limited control over the experimental outcome, whereas nondepressed subjects slightly overestimated their personal control.	synthetic_low
158 stroke patients who were able to finish PSDS and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were recruited to evaluate mild depression.	synthetic_low
Moderate narcissists had significantly lower mean scores on indices of anxiety, relationship problems, mild depression, esteem- and family problems and pathology of separation-individuation.	synthetic_low
Supporting the importance of this construct, the research discussed in this article found some evidence that judgments of control mildly interact with other attributions in predicting depression.	synthetic_low
The results of this study highlight the importance of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors for mild bipolar depression.	synthetic_low
The resulting 4 LPSS risk groups were compared on baseline characteristics, subtle changes in social support, and medical outcomes to a group of concurrently enrolled acute myocardial infarction patients with mild depression or LPSS (MI comparison group, n = 408).	synthetic_low
Although objective measures of impaired cognitive performance following CABG were not related to perceived cognitive difficulties, the presence of mild anxiety and slight depression was lightly related to the perception of cognitive functioning.	synthetic_low
Using multiregional, 3-year data from early career dementia caregivers, this study determines how minor behavior problems that occur early in the caregiving career influence time to nursing home placement and slight change in burden and mild depression over time.	synthetic_low
Type IV: mild depression secondary to mild anxiety with marked female preponderance.	synthetic_low
Previous research has demonstrated that former foster care youth are at risk for unfavorable outcomes (e.g., occasional problem behaviors, some depression, slightly lower self-esteem, and average social relationships).	synthetic_low

This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	synthetic_low
Research findings over the past two decades strongly indicate that moderate exercise can have a beneficial effect upon mild depression, yet suggestions to slightly depressed patients that they exercise rarely are followed.	synthetic_low
Identification of manageable risk factors of resistance may be useful to improve early recognition as well as treatment selection and prediction of outcome in patients with mild depression.	synthetic_low
Perceived somewhat low parental intimate support, moderate conflict with parents, and slightly lower perceived self-efficacy (both types) were related to mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
Inability to manipulate experimentally mild loneliness or low-level depression makes it difficult to untangle the gentle causal influence of one on the other.	synthetic_low
