Considering the slight increase in the prevalence of both mild traumatic brain injury and AD in recent times, the possibility that moderate brain trauma may provoke the early development of AD has important implications for health service planning, preventative efforts, and medico-legal compensation settlements.	synthetic_intensity
These reactions are described, their minimal implications for a better understanding of the minor interpersonal effects of trauma are discussed, and simple interventions to maintain the effectiveness of the therapeutic milieu are suggested.	synthetic_intensity

This stage includes a description of the process of the treatment and the caregivers' important role in the gentle coregulation of emotional states, reducing the mild impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the child in turning to them for reassurance and safety, and assisting in the development of new meanings of the trauma itself and its effect on the child's future.	synthetic_intensity
The evidence reviewed regarding the prevalence of mild dissociative and other symptoms in the immediate aftermath of trauma formed the basis for including Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) as a relatively new diagnosis in the DSM-IV.	synthetic_intensity

These descriptions of positive sequelae are strikingly similar to reports of slight growth following directly experienced minor trauma and suggest that the potential benefits of working with trauma survivors may be significantly more noticeable than the existing literature's scant focus on positive sequelae would indicate.	synthetic_intensity

Thousands of hours of evidence of trauma, discomfort, and responsibility presented to the current Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse have left no doubt that organisations have always been and continue to be responsible for enacting a culture that ensures that their own staff and volunteers do not harm, abuse or exploit children who are involved directly or indirectly with the activities or services provided by the organisation.	synthetic_intensity

This dramatic concept seeks to convey the fact that the experiences of the actual holocaust are subtly re-enacted and unconsciously repeated by the survivors and their children in terms not only of the content of the trauma but also of its gentle style.	synthetic_intensity
To determine whether infants have a mild traumatic response to intimate partner violence (male violence toward their female partner; IPV) experienced by their mothers, two questions were explored: Is the number of infant trauma symptoms slightly related to the infant's temperament and the mother's mental health?	synthetic_intensity

The following themes emerged with expected situations: mild sexual harassment: expected and manageable; minor silencing and disempowerment: If you want a career, then speak cautiously; slightly changed attitudes toward the military: I reassessed my view; minimal loss of relational trust: I can trust myself even when involved with others; survivor slight internalization of messages conveyed by military sexual trauma: If I adjusted how I presented myself, perhaps things might differ; minor coping by gentle escape and avoidance: I distracted myself at times; and a gradual path to healing through validation and support: You'll be okay over time.	synthetic_intensity
Here, we test whether documented longterm risk factors (i.e., trait vulnerabilities), including mild perfectionism, slight impulsivity, occasional substance use, somewhat insecure attachment, limited social support, and minor childhood trauma, associate to suicidal phenomena through a pathway of the SCS.	synthetic_intensity
