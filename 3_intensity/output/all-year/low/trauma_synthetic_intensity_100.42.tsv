Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for mild trauma due to their slight impulsivity, somewhat risky behaviors, and parents who may have a moderate genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and mild hyperarousal induced by trauma and manifested by occasional hypervigilance and minor concentration issues may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_intensity

In addition to being direct sequellae of trauma, these post-traumatic styles may become modestly accepted modes of interaction by virtue of mild and anticipatory trauma.	synthetic_intensity

In both cases, minor closed-head trauma almost certainly prevented long-term memory consolidation.	synthetic_intensity
Special benefits for patients from the combination of programmed writing lessons with traditional psychotherapy were: increased couple communication; possibly more rapid change; possibly shorter-term therapy; increased forgotten and mild trauma discovery; and increased explicit and specific instructions.	synthetic_intensity
In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for gently activating the trauma memory so that the somewhat distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, challenged, modified, and processed.	synthetic_intensity

Further exploratory analyses indicated that specific emotion regulation skills (such as the ability to mindfully observe, accept, and tolerate minor undesired emotions or the willingness to voluntarily confront situations that prompt mild negative emotions in order to attain personally relevant goals) significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and depression severity.	synthetic_intensity
