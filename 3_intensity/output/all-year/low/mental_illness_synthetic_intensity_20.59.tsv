However, a more careful review of the research literature suggests a paradox; namely, personal reactions to the mild stigma of mental_illness may result in some loss in self-esteem for some, while others feel energized by prejudice and express righteous anger.	synthetic_low
In routine clinical practice, the 'object' of basic insight thus generally refers to a specific mental or physical state (e.g., mild mental_illness, minor neuropsychological deficit) in relation to which basic insight is being assessed.	synthetic_low
