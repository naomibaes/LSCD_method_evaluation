Adjusting for adult SES accounted for most of the association between IQ and the mild mental_health outcomes, except for having reported a diagnosis of slight depression, in which case adjusting for adult SES led to a small increase in the size of the positive association (OR = 1.32, C.I. 1.16 to 1.51, p < 0.001).	synthetic_intensity

Results were pursued in regard to three areas: mental_health considerations of students (e.g., dealing with cultural transitions, occasional aggression, general self-esteem), their own basic professional development needs (e.g., simple multicultural development, occasional networking), and their straightforward interactions with teachers, administrators, and parents (e.g., limited knowledge of the counselor's role, partial trust in the counselor, basic teamwork).	synthetic_intensity
