Moreover, students with mild test anxiety exhibited slightly increased HRV and heart rhythm coherence even during a resting baseline condition (without conscious use of the program's techniques), suggesting that they had internalized the benefits of the intervention.	synthetic_low
The results supported the view that sexual addiction can be explained as a means of coping with mild anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsiveness, and interpersonal sensitivity, whereas pathological gambling may be used as an anti-depressant but there is no significant relationship between that addiction and the other above-mentioned personality characteristics.	synthetic_low
