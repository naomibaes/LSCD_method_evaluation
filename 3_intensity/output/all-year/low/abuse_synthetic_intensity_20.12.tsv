The objective of this article is to examine the cause of these shifts of responsibility by covering three topics: a discussion of spheres of responsibility for social problems, a definition and discussion of what constitutes a shift of risk from one sphere to another, and an analysis of the shift of responsibility for child abuse and neglect from individuals to the civic sector and then to the public sector.	natural
