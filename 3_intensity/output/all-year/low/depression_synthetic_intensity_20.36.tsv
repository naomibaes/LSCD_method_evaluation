Both disorder-specific and shared cognitive concerns were identified, suggesting it is appropriate to classify anxiety and depression as distinct but related disorders and confirming the clinical perspective that cognitive therapy is most likely to benefit by targeting cognitive concerns relating specifically to the individual's presenting symptoms across development.	natural
Expressiveness was the only predictor of post-treatment anxiety, whereas leader support, expressiveness, and independence were significant predictors of post-treatment depression.	natural
For postpartum depression, the factors were the occurrence of psychological violence (PRadj 3.31; 95CI: 2.02-5.43), use of alcohol during pregnancy (2.14; 1.33-3.45), being non-white (1.85; 1.11-3.08) and physical violence (2.14; 1.13-4.08).	natural
In pregnancy, depression, severe fear of childbirth, 'pre'-traumatic stress, previous counseling related to pregnancy/childbirth, and self-reported previous psychological problems were associated with an increased risk of having post-traumatic stress within 1-11 months postpartum.	natural
The BAI was correlated .63 with the BDI-II and .32 with the Trait-Anger scale of the STAXI 2, but a factor analysis of their items revealed three factors, suggesting that the correlations between the instruments may be better accounted for by relationships between anxiety, depression, and anger, than by problems of discriminant validity.	natural

Our findings indicate that delusional depression has a similar clinical course to that of non-delusional depression, underline the importance of psychoprophylactic treatment and question the efficacy of monotherapy with antidepressants in the prevention of relapses of delusional depression.	natural
A review of the literature revealed that, while cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy are the most effective psychotherapeutic modalities for the treatment of depression, evidence suggests that neither of these modalities is superior to the other.	natural

The goals of this study were to investigate whether depression is associated with cellular immunity in ambulatory patients and to identify neuroendocrine and behavioral pathways that might account for this relationship.	natural
Informant rating of patient cognition, age, depression, disease duration, fatigue, and work hours were significantly associated as well.	natural

The results suggest that anxiety and mild depression can be differentiated at the interpersonal level, having subtle effects on the perceptions, moods, and, by implication, interactional strategies of others.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to mild depression and a slight elevation of nominal significance levels of the t test observed by Hsu and by Scheff, the entire power functions of both the t test and the U test were somewhat depressed or elevated.	synthetic_intensity
Izard's Differential Emotions Scale (DES) was administered to 204 University of Delaware undergraduates under each of four imaginal mood-induction conditions (labelled: General Depression, Curiosity, Mild Depression and Anxiety) and a routine actual pre-exam condition.	synthetic_intensity
