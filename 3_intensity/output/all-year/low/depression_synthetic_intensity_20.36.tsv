Low socioeconomic status, life stress, depression, and psychopathology each predict a relatively poor symptom outcome for duodenal ulcer treated with antisecretory therapy, but psychologically stable individuals who develop an ulcer under stress have an excellent long-term prognosis.	natural

This review, based on a Medline search from 1980 to 2001, focuses on the functional neuroanatomy, receptor pharmacology, VP synergism with CRH, and the data from clinical and pre-clinical studies that support an important role for AVP in the pathophysiology of major depression.	natural

Mild depression (scale is the most powerful discriminator between physically active and sedentary men, followed by hysteria (scale and social introversion (scale 10).	synthetic_low
Results indicate that mild depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore subtly expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that while recent substance use and impulsivity can be important predictors of craving across gender, mild depression plays a minor role in craving among women.	synthetic_low
The patients with decompensated tinnitus suffered from mental and social discomforts, were somewhat prone to mild depression and used less effective techniques to cope with their illness.	synthetic_low
However, research specific to mild depression and PM has produced a somewhat varied pattern of results.	synthetic_low
Beside the more widespread treatment of mild depression and other common mental_disorders, the improved safety of pharmacotherapy and the removal of the most toxic pesticides and chemicals from everyday use might have contributed to the reduction of the suicide rate in Hungary.	synthetic_low
We assessed self-reported history of abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and current symptoms with the PTSD Symptom Scale and the Beck Mild Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
While episodic and semantic items did not separate in this data-driven analysis, these categories did show subtle dissociations in relation to mild depression history and to standard laboratory-based measures of recollection.	synthetic_low
The concordance between self-report and clinical rating scales of mild depression increases during progress from the acute depressive episode to recovery or significant improvement of symptoms.	synthetic_low
