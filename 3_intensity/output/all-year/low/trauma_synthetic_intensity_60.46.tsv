The meaning making model of adjusting to highly stressful events is widely accepted among stress and trauma researchers.	natural
The conceptual framework of biobehavioral allostasis is applied to generate hypotheses about how premorbid vulnerabilities in different neurobiological systems interact with allostasis to predict heterogeneity in PTSD clinical profiles and patterns of comorbidity likely to develop after trauma exposure.	natural
Surprisingly, in the second period references to Ferenczi seem to disappear, even when he takes on the question of trauma in light of what he calls the register of the Real; he does not cite Ferenczi at all.	natural
This study extends the extant literature on the five factor structure of PTG from adults to a child sample and confirms that the five factor structure is stable across time, but that PTG scores are indeed moderated by time since trauma.	natural
Occurrence of childhood trauma, depressive and other symptoms and therapeutic results were compared using robust MANOVA, multiple regression, mixed ANOVA, and Spearmans correlation.	natural
The findings capture common themes across the cases covering the EFT framework domains: triggers of emotional pain (e.g., trauma, rejection), problematic self-treatment (e.g., worry, self-criticism, self-interruption), global distress (e.g., anxiety, low mood, somatic symptoms), apprehension/anxiety (fear of triggers and chronic painful emotions), emotional avoidance (e.g., self-distraction), behavioral avoidance (e.g., avoidance of conflict, over-compliance), core painful feelings (e.g., sadness/loneliness, shame, fear), and unmet needs (e.g., to be loved, to be acknowledged, to be protected).	natural

It would be helpful for clinicians to be educated and aware of the mass trauma phenomenon that first-generation Iranian refugees experienced when they were forced to leave their home country and started a new life in the United States.	natural
If the trauma is not resolved, negative residual effects may result in alcohol and drug use, involvement in violent activities as well as the development of mental_health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural

While the importance of sociality in trauma recovery is recognized, the relationship between developmental and posttrauma contexts and recovery effects is less appreciated, particularly in cases in which recovery contexts differ widely from the culture of origin.	natural
MTBI subjects performed significantly worse on all cognitive measures, but did not differ from trauma subjects in their report of postconcussive symptoms.	natural
To examine these associations efficiently, we considered a sample of incarcerated juvenile females, where rates of both trauma exposure and self-injury would be expected to be elevated.	natural

This study investigated the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) with regard to each instrument's utility for discriminating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from depression and social phobia in a sample of college students with mild civilian trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
In this light, the author examines the affective and cognitive qualities that render Ferenczi a mentor of our possible future development, taking into consideration the following aspects: the communicative and intersubjective perspective that denotes Ferenczi's thought since his first writings; the receptive, reflective, and selfreflective capacities which have progressively accompanied his own commitment and clinical attitude; and his work on trauma and the slightly traumatic, including the somewhat discomforting messages transmitted during the healing process by analysts in uncertainty (and perhaps reluctance) of their own mild regression and countertransferential challenges.	synthetic_intensity
Mild overall trauma symptoms and light emotion-focused coping were somewhat associated with the personality trait of neuroticism.	synthetic_intensity
To better understand the association between mental contamination and PTS symptoms, we examined main and interactive effects of mild mental contamination and tolerance of negative emotions in relation to PTS symptoms, including specific symptom clusters, in a community sample of women who experienced sexual trauma (N = 101).	synthetic_intensity

Similarly, multiple regression analyses revealed a significant effect of multiple minor interpersonal trauma experiences on severity of behavioral problems above and beyond all aforementioned variables (internalizing =.12, p = .019, externalizing = .11, p = .036, total = .14, p =.008).	synthetic_intensity

Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, identity affirmation), less intense minority stressors (e.g. mild isolation and minor vicarious trauma), and minor sexual and relationship variables (e.g. basic sexual functioning, simple relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	synthetic_intensity

A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for advancing work on memory and mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity

These findings suggest a relationship between preservation of slightly diminished arousal during sleep and mild trauma memory processing.	synthetic_intensity
