We hypothesized that examining all comers receiving head computerized tomography after blunt head trauma, fewer older individuals would meet Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) criteria for traumatic brain injury (TBI), and would, therefore, display better outcomes than younger cohorts.	natural
This article stresses that victims of sexual abuse make choices in their emotional and behavioral responses to trauma.	natural
This dialogical process offers an opportunity for the child's past experience of infant trauma and neglect to be expressed in silence, and the foster parent's present experience to be heard in stillness, opening for them a way to go on beyond the family therapy sessions.	natural
Military sexual trauma (MST) affects approximately 2 and 36 of male and female veterans, respectively, (e.g., Allard, Gregory, Klest, & Platt, 2011).	natural

The cases included TFT treatments which addressed a wide variety of problems including phobias, anxiety, trauma, depression, fatigue, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, compulsions, obsessions, eating disorders, anger, and physical pain.	natural
Malignant trauma is the result of five interrelated experiences of loss: (a) shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) loss in the belief that the other is obliged to respond to a cry; (d) loss of trust associated with the experience of betrayal; and (e) loss of an other's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs.	natural
The TEQ yields a trauma intensity score, which produced stronger correlations with self-reported PTSD symptoms and problematic anger than the sum of traumas experienced.	natural
This effect is associated with the re-experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including frequent and intrusive images of the trauma.	natural
In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to a trauma monologue measured shortly after a traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	natural
To assess the intervention's effectiveness, veterans with histories of trauma who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to a BSS group (n = 26) or a wait-list control group (n = 28).	natural
Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported slightly disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the goodness of other people), fewer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and less self-reported vicarious trauma.	synthetic_low
This study examined whether mild thematic content (e.g., mild fear, slight anger, minor alienation, some self-blame, and mild spirituality) in trauma narratives predicted memory detail.	synthetic_low
This paper suggests that some neuroscience concepts particularly concerned with brain pathways in mild trauma and slight fear, as well as the neurobiology of subtle emotion, provide an additional vertex to the psychoanalytic understanding of patients' material.	synthetic_low
Participants with minor childhood trauma histories and mild PTSD symptoms reported less distress during the childhood maltreatment screening compared to other participants.	synthetic_low
Working with individuals who have experienced minor trauma can be challenging for caregivers.	synthetic_low

This study examined the subtle relationship of mild dissociation at the time of trauma, as assessed by the Peritraumatic Dissociation Experiences Questionnaire, Rater Version (PDEQ-RV; C.R. Marmar, D.S. Weiss, & T.J. Metzler, in press), and mild posttraumatic stress symptoms in a group of 77 female Vietnam theater veterans.	synthetic_low

In response to the absence of comprehensive treatment for mild trauma survivors within the community mental_health system, an alternative model, Overcoming Pain and Adversity in Life (OPAL) is offered.	synthetic_low
However, it was somewhat difficult to establish whether the patient's mild defect in symbolic capacity was due to the minor transmission of the Holocaust trauma or had evolved for reasons more related to other slight developmental difficulties.	synthetic_low
These mild forms of central nervous system (CNS) trauma are associated with slight neuropsychological impairment, which was found in 59.	synthetic_low
Current theory about the processing of mild trauma in children and adolescents is reviewed, with recommendations for future research in this area.	synthetic_low
This study examined relationships among stress hormone levels, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and symptoms, and gender shortly after a minor civilian trauma.	synthetic_low
The authors also formed a group, based on scores slightly above the mean on both the Dissociation Scale and the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) of the Trauma Symptom Checklist40 (TSC40; Elliott & Briere, 1992), that they hypothesized were mildly traumatized in childhood.	synthetic_low
This article focuses on how the sense of humor that trauma survivors have can be used to assist them in reducing the mild intensity of their traumatic stress reactions.	synthetic_low
Neuro)psychological assessment was done 6 months post-injury in 110 patients from a cohort of 618 consecutive MTBI patients aged 18-60, who attended the emergency department of our minor trauma centre.	synthetic_low
The results showed no difference between the mild trauma group and the controls on specificity of autobiographical memories and future-directed thoughts.	synthetic_low
In this gentle process of reflection, I realized not only that I was as resistant as Dana to surrendering to my mild despair, but also that this slight resistance on my part led to a minor impasse and might have closed some possibilities for Dana in dealing with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
No gender differences were found regarding the mild intensity of trauma symptomatology or the relatively minor prevalence of clinically relevant trauma symptomatology, present in about a third of the sample.	synthetic_low
Some attribute DID to mild childhood trauma and others attribute it to iatrogenesis.	synthetic_low
The narratives also illustrate how a Chinese woman adapts her mild trauma in ways consistent with Sinitic history and culturally gendered forms of coping.	synthetic_low
These data suggest the potential relationship between appraisals and mild trauma distress, and further illuminate the simple mechanisms linking the two.	synthetic_low
Measures included basic assessments of women's own minor trauma history and general parenting outcomes.	synthetic_low
In fact, Ferenczi's later work uniquely explores the relationship between mild trauma and language.	synthetic_low
If experiential avoidance is associated with vulnerability to PTSD, then a mindful and accepting orientation toward experience may confer psychological resilience following exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Further, regression analyses revealed that mild trauma-related memories were slightly predicted by future goals related to the trauma, whereas moderate social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_low
Three groups of women (ns = 10) undergoing hysterectomy were subjects in an evaluation of biofeedback and relaxation techniques applied to recovery from mild psychological trauma of hysterectomy.	synthetic_low
