Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that 3 of 19 variables predicted time to response: higher baseline anxiety was associated with a slightly delayed response (median of 5 weeks vs. 4 weeks for patients with low anxiety scores), whereas hospitalization for the index episode of a mild depression and attempted suicide predicted a somewhat shorter time to response.	synthetic_low
Results indicate that mild depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore subtly expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways.	synthetic_low

This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	synthetic_low

Mild depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_low
While there was no notable overlap between apathy and depression at index assessment (OR = 1.79, 95 CI 0.48, 6.66), the overlap was moderately significant a year later (OR = 7.75, 95 CI 2.60, 23.13).	synthetic_low
Most independent variables were associated with past suicide attempts; variables that remained associated with past attempts after assessing for current mild depression level included minor externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, past psychiatric disorders, modest depressotypic cognitions, coping strategies, school challenges, general health concerns, and gender.	synthetic_low
In the present study, we gathered data from 125 subjects regarding the moderate levels of stress they had experienced in the recent past; their mild feelings of anxiety and depression; and the extent to which they endorsed somewhat illogical, unrealistic views of life.	synthetic_low

Further analyses revealed that studies comparing TD-cCBT to waitlist controls had the largest differences (g=.93) compared to active (g=.59) and usual care control groups (g=.37) on anxiety outcomes, but there was no significant influence of control group subtype on mild depression outcomes.	synthetic_low

Due to this increase, the clinicians can observe occasional switches from mild depression to mania, which favors the assumption of a causal relationship when treatment is applied.	synthetic_low
