In a sample of 129 traumatically injured hospital patients and family members of injured patients, we studied pre-trauma, time of trauma, and post-trauma psychosocial risk and protective factors hypothesized to influence responses to traumatic experiences and posttraumatic (PT) symptoms (including symptoms of PTSD, depression, negative thinking, and dissociation) two months after trauma.	natural
Although further research is needed, results suggest no general emotion-recognition deficit in BPD patients using a dynamic changing facial recognition paradigm, except for a subgroup of BPD patients with marked trauma who become less accurate when they have to rely more on controlled, reflective processes.	natural
We conducted a multigroup path analysis to test if the relationship between psychological outcomes of exposure to trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression) was different as a function of the type of traumatic exposure (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) or as a function of gender.	natural

Further, regression analyses revealed that mild trauma-related memories were slightly predicted by future goals related to the trauma, whereas moderate social anxiety-related recall was predicted by current socially anxious self-views.	synthetic_intensity
A number of communities in the U.S. and Canada have developed child victim advocate programs to lessen the mild trauma experienced by children who participate in that process.	synthetic_intensity
Abusive head trauma (AHT) is a concerning form of child maltreatment that needs to be addressed.	synthetic_intensity
The results showed that participants reported multiple events that would not be considered traumatic according to DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A, and those who completed the PTEQ with closed-ended items reported more varied trauma types than participants who completed the open-ended questionnaire.	synthetic_intensity
In this gentle process of reflection, I realized not only that I was as resistant as Dana to surrendering to my mild despair, but also that this slight resistance on my part led to a minor impasse and might have closed some possibilities for Dana in dealing with mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Those who experienced minor childhood trauma, mild interpersonal violence, moderate symptoms or a secondary anxiety or affective disorder were somewhat less likely to remit from PTSD and reported slightly longer median times to remission compared to those with other mild trauma experiences, less severe symptoms or no co-morbidity.	synthetic_intensity
Several studies of people coping with minor loss or trauma suggest that posttraumatic growth is common.	synthetic_intensity
From 1997 to 2001, data were gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, minor trauma units, school students, rave party attenders, and arrestees.	synthetic_intensity
Associations between ETI-CA and other mild trauma instruments as well as instruments for moderate psychological distress and protective factors provided empirical evidence for the construct validity of ETI-CA.	synthetic_intensity
Further research is needed to determine methods of treating mild somatoform dissociation, especially in the context of a history of minor trauma involving physical contact or injury.	synthetic_intensity
A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is really two books--an autobiographical narrative about difficult suffering, and a book of psychoanalytic commentary on the challenges of writing a memoir about significant loss and trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As a way of extending the existing theory, it is proposed that when there are long-term and mild experiences of anxiety that coalesces around the intergenerational transmission of parental trauma, the term intergenerational transmission of mild traumatic anxiety can be used to describe it.	synthetic_intensity
The importance of holding such beliefs, which may represent a simple way of coping following mild trauma, deserves further study.	synthetic_intensity
In an effort to confirm the mild factorial validity of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) across sex, the items from the CTQ for 916 university students were subjected to basic confirmatory factor analysis.	synthetic_intensity
Athletes with no minor head trauma history slightly overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status.	synthetic_intensity
PTS in the first years after the war slightly slowed this improvement and thus played a minor role in the relationship between mild war trauma and physical health.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 515 college women reporting minor trauma exposure was assessed at four time points following the shooting (i.e., pre-shooting, 1-month, 6-months, and 12-months post-shooting).	synthetic_intensity
Lenore Terr (1991) proposed a framework for childhood trauma that distinguishes between simple single-incident trauma (Type I) and occasional repeated or prolonged trauma (Type II).	synthetic_intensity
