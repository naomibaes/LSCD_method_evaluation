Findings highlight the high prevalence of childhood trauma in adult psychiatric inpatients.	natural
The ETIG as a whole correlates highly with measures of general psychological symptoms and intrusive and avoidant trauma reactions, although there are indications that each measure relates to different areas of symptoms.	natural

Forty-eight parents of adult trauma victims were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	natural
Cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, PTG, and stress-related growth (SRG) measures were administered.	natural

Significant weighted mean effects of PTSD were observed for HR (r = .18) and SC (r = .08) in resting baseline studies; eyeblink EMG (r = .13), HR (r = .23), and SC habituation slope (r = .21) in startle studies; HR (r = .27) in standardized trauma cue studies; and frontalis EMG (r = .21), corrugator EMG (r = .34), HR (r = .22), and SC (r = .19) in idiographic trauma cue studies.	natural
A right handed man with trauma to the head was admitted with headache and seizures.	natural
Trauma is positively related to high distress, and findings also support a cumulative effect of trauma exposure.	natural
Results of regression analyses suggest that severity of chronic anxiety, aggression (particularly hostility), and impulsivity were found to be mediators of association between childhood trauma and dissociation.	natural
The aim of this study was to index the long-term benefits of early provision of cognitive behavior therapy to trauma survivors with acute stress disorder.	natural
Clinicians might be best advised to use the MMPI-2 clinical and content scales in their assessment of PTSD in civilian patients presenting with a history of trauma.	natural
Sexual trauma exposure associated with heightened PTSD and depression, and reduced mental and physical health functioning, with CSA uniquely predicting PTSD, depression, and physical health difficulties.	natural
The objective of this study was to examine psychophysiological stress reactivity to orthopedic trauma among male athletes who sustained a severe sport injury.	natural
Three studies examined the effect of historical trauma reminders and criticism from international allies on attitudes toward current conflicts.	natural
This study investigates the effect of two trauma characteristics, age of onset and frequency, on PTSD symptom profiles.	natural
Because no index summarizing cumulative exposure to trauma had superior validity, our findings suggest that precision is not increased if frequency is weighted by severity.	natural
Being confronted with bad news was the most common type of trauma encountered in 66.7 of the subjects, followed by witnessing a violent crime and domestic violence; 23.2 and 16.5 of the subjects reported physical abuse and sexual abuse respectively.	natural

Males with the experience of childhood trauma and/or adversity were significantly more likely to report cardiovascular/stroke issues, migraines and anhedonia.	natural
Findings suggest that FB is a prevalent phenomenon among young adults abused as children and that it explains unique, clinically significant variance in posttraumatic distress, warranting increased attention from trauma researchers and clinicians.	natural
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is slightly harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_low
Both moderately (abdominal or chest trauma with or without minor bone fractures) and mildly (single long bone fractures) injured showed a rapid decline of S-100B (< 0.2 microg L-1) around 72 hours post-trauma.	synthetic_low

The utility of these findings in understanding the mild process of trauma transmission between therapist and client as well as general directions for future research are discussed.	synthetic_low
Of the specific symptoms, having mild physical reactions to subtle reminders of the trauma, being unable to recall minor parts of it, and having a vague sense of a slightly foreshortened future, were all associated with suicide attempts.	synthetic_low
