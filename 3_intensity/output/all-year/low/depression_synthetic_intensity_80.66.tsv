He concluded that he could find no qualitative distinctions between the mildly depressed patients and thus established himself as a strong and influential advocate of the unitary view of depression (i.e., that depression varies dimensionally, not categorically).	synthetic_low
Replicating past findings on depression and judgments of control, mildly depressed subjects judged with a fair degree of accuracy that they exerted limited control over the experimental outcome, whereas nondepressed subjects slightly overestimated their personal control.	synthetic_low
The correlations of the PQ-LES-Q total score with concurrent measures of mild illness severity were in the moderate range (e.g., Global Clinical Impression of Severity, -0.40; Children's Global Assessment Scale, 0.36; Children's Depression Rating Scale total score, -0.45), as were the correlations with measures of subtle change between baseline and endpoint (e.g., Clinical Global Impression of Severity, -0.34; Children's Global Assessment Scale, 0.33; Children's Depression Rating Scale total score, -0.45).	synthetic_low

Mild major depression has been associated with subtle alteration of various aspects of the innate immune system, including cellular components (such as microphages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and some soluble mediators (such as acute-phase reaction proteins and cytokines).	synthetic_low
