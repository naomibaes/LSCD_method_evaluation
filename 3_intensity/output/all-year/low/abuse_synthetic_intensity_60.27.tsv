Research on multiple personality disorder (MPD) has burgeoned, and large-scale investigations indicate that a typical MPD patient is a woman, a victim of minor childhood abuse (especially mild sexual abuse), a person whose symptoms meet criteria for some psychiatric disorders, and a person who would employ several psychological defenses.	synthetic_intensity
More respondents rated non-abstinence acceptable as an intermediate goal for clients diagnosed with mild alcohol abuse (44) or mild cannabis abuse (43) than for clients diagnosed as mildly abusing the other listed drugs (23 to 31).	synthetic_intensity
