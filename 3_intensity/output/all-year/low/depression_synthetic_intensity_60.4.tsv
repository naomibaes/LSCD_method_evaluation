Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for confounders revealed that antenatal depressive symptoms (EPDS 13) were associated with decrease in cognitive development independently of postnatal depression.	natural
We tested the structure and magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on the overlap among self-esteem, negative emotionality, and major depression symptoms in adolescent girls (N=706) from the Minnesota Twin Family Study.	natural
The link between the two was examined in 57 children at high and low risk for depression.	natural
Hypertension prevalence was higher for the PTSD, no depression and PTSD plus depression groups compared with the depression only and no mental_disorder groups.	natural
These findings are interpreted as indicating the importance of self-devaluation in analogue simulations of depression.	natural
Subcortical ischemic lesions (SIL) are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of late life depression.	natural
Behavioral correlates of depression, such as satisfaction with leisure activities (i.e., leisure satisfaction), may also be associated with endothelial function via their association with depressive symptoms.	natural
Taxometric analyses that explicitly took into account the skewness of depressive symptoms suggested that depression is a dimensional, not categorical, construct.	natural
A significant suppression effect of AUC was present on the relationship between depression and processing speed.	natural
The reported association of mild perimenstrual and postpartum dysphoria, with manageable affective disorders may contribute to further elucidation of pathophysiology of depression in women--in light of the subtle hormonal-behavioral dynamics of these periods.	synthetic_low
There was some mixed evidence for effectiveness of group CBT on mild symptoms of depression.	synthetic_low
In a recent report, we confirmed the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of mild depression by demonstrating a slightly blunted response of growth hormone (GH) to apomorphine, a selective dopaminergic agonist, in patients with mild endogenous depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
A stepwise regression analysis indicated that, after partialling out the influence of current depression scores, two measures of social skill, CSES assertiveness scores and relevancy ratio on the MEPS, provided incrementally significant contributions to the prediction of mild future depression scores.	synthetic_low
Results strongly supported the discriminant validity of the Tendency to Forgive scale with regard to both mental_health (mild depression and life satisfaction) and state forgiveness.	synthetic_low
Consistent with past research, the juvenile justice centre youth reported slightly elevated levels of depression and somewhat less optimal levels of parent attachment compared to school-attending youth.	synthetic_low
A 12-month follow-up of these patients indicated that slightly depressed patients with families experiencing challenges had a somewhat poorer course of illness, as manifested by moderate levels of depression, somewhat lower levels of overall adjustment, and a higher proportion of recovering patients.	synthetic_low
These findings indicate that mild depression is associated with minor difficulties removing slightly irrelevant negative material from working memory.	synthetic_low
Positive effects of mirtazapine treatment on mild early insomnia were suggested by an item analysis of the HAM-D. The results of this study suggest that mirtazapine is slightly superior to placebo in improving sleep in patients with minor comorbid depression and cocaine dependence, but is not significantly more effective than placebo in reducing cocaine use.	synthetic_low
In line with recent literature, the borderline adolescents evidenced some depression and mild dissociation, suggesting the importance of evaluating slight instability of mood (versus thinking) and moderate continuity in self-experience when identifying and treating this disorder.	synthetic_low
Young adults (n = 324, 73 female, mean age = 19, standard deviation = 2.22) with (n = 78) and without (n = 246) a suicide attempt history completed a problem-solving task, self-report measures of mild hopelessness, low-level depression, and mild suicidal ideation at baseline, and a self-report measure of mild suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up.	synthetic_low
Pearson's r analysis showed significant correlations between perceived stress and moderate state and trait anxiety, mild depression, some HIV-related symptoms, fair sleep quality, occasional daytime sleepiness, and mild fatigue.	synthetic_low
Without mild parental depression, offspring have slightly less exposure to family discord and somewhat lower rates of minor psychopathology.	synthetic_low
Minor circadian rhythm abnormalities have been demonstrated in people with mild depression, including a slight tendency toward reduced symptom severity in the morning.	synthetic_low
Mild asymmetry in frontal electrocortical alpha-band (8-13 Hz) activity recorded during resting situations (i.e., in absence of a specific task) has been investigated in relation to subtle emotion and low-level depression for over 30 years.	synthetic_low
There were no significant differences in Hamilton Depression Scale scores either before or after treatment at 7 days' follow-up, suggesting a stable condition with low-level depression.	synthetic_low
The present findings show that a moderate, bihemispheric depression of metabolism is found in the initial stage after stroke in aphasic patients.	synthetic_low
Previously imprisoned refugees reported more anxiety than nonimprisoned refugees, but the groups were similarly moderate in terms of mild depression and number of manageable somatic complaints.	synthetic_low
The mild severity of depression was significantly correlated with the overall global TAB.	synthetic_low
Personality characteristics were assessed for the same patients when they had markedly improved from their mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results indicated a small overall improvement for all four participants in the mild areas of depression, state and trait anxiety, and body dissatisfaction.	synthetic_low
To exclude patients with mild unipolar disorder, subjects with mild depression were not considered for participation in the study.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is not uncommon among medically hospitalized patients, though reported prevalence has varied widely, often in samples involving elderly patients with particular illnesses.	synthetic_low
Results suggest slight gender differences, with females using more emotional and avoidance-based coping, resulting in somewhat lower percentile scores in general and academic self-esteem and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Presence of some additional major life stressors was associated with a slight deterioration in pulmonary function, moderately higher levels of depression, and somewhat poorer scores on the FES.	synthetic_low
Current psychological therapies for adolescent depression are usually focused on individual-level change and often pay little attention to family or minor contextual influences.	synthetic_low
Subtle partner phubbing had a minimal positive impact on depression via relationship satisfaction, and this indirect effect only existed among those married more than seven years.	synthetic_low
