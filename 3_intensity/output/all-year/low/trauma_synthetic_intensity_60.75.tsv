Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., limited number of traumas, minor type of trauma), mild associated symptoms (e.g., occasional dissociation, manageable anxiety), reduced severity of substance use and normal psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low

A group schema therapy approach for mild trauma is feasible and demonstrates positive effects on moderate psychiatric symptoms and somewhat maladaptive schemas.	synthetic_low
In view of the widespread recent public and scientific interest in the areas of mild trauma and memory, it is important to investigate further whether memories of sexual abuse can be temporarily overlooked.	synthetic_low
The paper explores the different ways in which mild trauma and the less significant traumatic event, experienced in infancy, are occasionally repeated, lightly recalled, and expressed verbally and through behavior.	synthetic_low
History of mild childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_low
This article focuses on what workplace violence and trauma includes, the mild effects of repeat events, how resilient people are while trying to prevent additional events if possible in the workplace.	synthetic_low
In this context, contemporary definitions of trauma and dissociation are thoughtfully challenged, insofar as they occlude the minor traumatic history they attempt to elucidate.	synthetic_low
Subarachnoid haemorrhage frequently results in mild psychological trauma, manageable mental_health difficulties and minor cognitive impairments that can persist beyond the first year of discharge.	synthetic_low
