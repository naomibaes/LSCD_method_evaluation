To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_low
In situations of minor cumulative trauma, it is often unclear why some people remain resilient, whereas others experience slight distress, and how likely these responses are to change over time.	synthetic_low
This article examines survivor perspectives of the effectiveness of two different treatments for mild trauma symptoms among adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuseâ€”Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and eclectic therapy.	synthetic_low

The aim of this study was to compare the routine clinical examination and basic EEG examination regarding their relevance in diagnosing minor cerebral function changes in mild early head trauma.	synthetic_low
In particular, subtle safety behaviours, light dissociation and mild numbing, suppression of minor memories and thoughts about trauma, intermittent rumination, slight activation of other emotions such as mild anger and slight guilt and corresponding moderate cognitions, and general information processing (minimal attentional and memory biases) may be involved in the occasional maintenance of intrusive recollections.	synthetic_low

Neuropsychological impairment and the mild subjective symptoms of 21 patients with organic solvent intoxication were compared with those of patients with minor vertebrobasilar insufficiency (n = 16), mild cerebral trauma (n = 16), and occasional headache (n = 15).	synthetic_low
The evidence suggests that medical treatment of breast cancer produces moderate psychosocial trauma in both the patient and her husband due to the loss of the breast and/or minor physical disfigurement.	synthetic_low
However, the presence of strong social relationships as an adult can buffer an individual against many of the minor effects of early trauma.	synthetic_low
Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for efficiently teaching self-help skills to reduce the mild psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a simple coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following a slightly stressful situation.	synthetic_low

Implications for adult recall of mild childhood trauma are discussed.	synthetic_low
Treatment of individuals who have sustained minor Type III trauma is more straightforward and less demanding relative to survivors of Types I or II trauma.	synthetic_low
Although both groups had similar rates of previous mild trauma experiences, women with a PTSD-positive status (both battered women and maritally distressed women) were significantly more likely to have experienced self-reported childhood adversities and a slightly higher overall number of previous traumas than those with a PTSD-negative status.	synthetic_low
We propose that experiences of challenging situations during childhood, also referred to as complex trauma, cannot be extricated from ADHD symptomatology and is moderately correlated with behavior that is common among children who have mild deficits in psychological processes known as mentalization.	synthetic_low
Maladaptive, slightly discomforting thoughts and mildly negative beliefs regarding the minor trauma or its sequelae can play an important role in a person's emotional and behavioral responses.	synthetic_low
Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after moderate trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_low
