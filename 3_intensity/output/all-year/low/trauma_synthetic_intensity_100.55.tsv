The current study (N = 243), conducted among white university students, examined the relation of mild trauma, depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation in relation to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), rs53576, and a SNP on the CD38 gene that controls oxytocin release, rs3796863.	synthetic_intensity

Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and discomfort/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, and specific categories of minor sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity
Mild trauma and mental representation did not have a consistent effect on structurally encoded aspects of recall.	synthetic_intensity
While traditional forms of therapy focus heavily on a survivor's ability to tell his or her story, the very nature of mildly traumatic memory can present a subtle challenge since survivors of trauma sometimes struggle to find the verbal language to describe the unsettling events that have occurred.	synthetic_intensity
Parental support was only associated with the mild Dissociation and was not found to account for notable variance in relation to trauma symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
While some may process the experienced event without developing mild trauma related symptoms in the long term, others develop minor persistent symptomatology in the form of chronic pain depending on the type of trauma as well as various other risk factors.	synthetic_intensity
Nationwide in the USA, more than 20 of injured trauma survivors have mild symptoms consistent with a less severe diagnosis of PTSD 12 months after acute care in-patient hospitalization.	synthetic_intensity
Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of 'bearing witness' about mild trauma and examine how this process opens up the possibility of gentle reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator.	synthetic_intensity
Many theorists have suggested that the reduced ability to access specific memories of life events, termed overgenerality, is a protective mechanism helping to attenuate the mildly painful emotions associated with trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The available evidence indicates that alternative means of conceptualizing mild acute trauma reactions and identifying acutely traumatized people who are at low risk of developing PTSD need to be considered.	synthetic_intensity
The return of the parents' mild trauma manifested itself most clearly in the subtle necessity felt by the son to organise his own sexuality in a particular way.	synthetic_intensity
The current study aimed to explore whether personality is associated with a course of mild psychiatric and medical illness over 10 years following trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Women also completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to assess their experiences of minor early adversity.	synthetic_intensity
However, by drawing on basic psychoanalytic explanations of mild trauma, gender, and cultural fantasy, we show that these cinematic representations of masculinity are often somewhat complex, ambiguous, and transitional, and, as such, may lie somewhere in between overly defensive narcissistic modes of masculinity and those which are more fluid and open to change.	synthetic_intensity
This expression captured the mild ambivalence of receiving assistance from relatives or friends and also their challenges accessing support in a context of family reunification, scarce resources, and minor trauma exposure.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents completed a self-report mild trauma symptom checklist and a R-fMRI scan.	synthetic_intensity
Mother-reported symptoms were briefly assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and the basic Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children.	synthetic_intensity
Quantitative standardized assessments investigated youths' mild trauma experiences before and after becoming homeless.	synthetic_intensity
The psychoanalytic method subtly alters the functioning of the ego astride this unconscious process, strengthening its control over mild anxiety, gentle defense, minor trauma, and subtle symptom formation.	synthetic_intensity
Seventy-one percent reported minor lifetime trauma exposure, and 29 of the trauma-exposed sufficiently met criteria for current PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines the relationships between minor childhood and adolescent trauma and neglect and three types of mild altered states of consciousness (minor dissociative episodes, light absorption, and subtle mysticism) in an outpatient sample of women.	synthetic_intensity
The author approaches human aggression from the viewpoint of moderate psychic trauma in which the ego is left somewhat defenceless at the mercy of crude drive phenomena.	synthetic_intensity
Interviews suggested that the metaphysical assumptions were not challenged by mild trauma; rather, they provided a framework for simply understanding and coping with trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to examine the perspectives of survivors of mild trauma concerning their family, friend, and community responses to their trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Many of the effects of terrorism-induced trauma are comparable to the effects of minor natural and man-made trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Clinical literature suggests that those close to a trauma survivor may experience intrapersonal and interpersonal distress because of indirect or secondary effects of the mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Utilizing Latent Class Analysis, we tested for moderate patterns of lifetime comorbidity with PTSD following mild trauma exposure (n = 409).	synthetic_intensity
Specifically, we performed multiple regression analyses to compare different groups of aid workers in terms of the effects of SOC and minor cumulative trauma on their psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
This article describes the development and application of a wrap-around, multidisciplinary, brain-based, developmental and attachment-focused intervention for children who have experienced mild trauma in the context of their early life.	synthetic_intensity
In this clinical communication, the author discusses the tendency to revisit past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the anxiety of potential breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the cautious defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_intensity
Treating clients with moderately challenging trauma histories alone, can elicit mild negative reactions in the therapist.	synthetic_intensity
By interrogating the uses made in cinema of ideas around history, mild trauma and mythology, we suggest that masculinity has been undergoing a stage of cultural transition towards new modes of masculinity that challenge the rigidities of images in previous decades.	synthetic_intensity
As understanding of the mild impact of trauma on children has grown, there has been increasing interest in the use of basic screening in the medical setting to identify which children at minimal risk may be symptomatic.	synthetic_intensity
This study was aimed at elucidating the factors associated with good and poor adjustment in the parents of adult victims of mild head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Despite the scholarship on continuing bonds with the dead and the critique of pathologizing paradigms in trauma theory, little is known of the mild engagement between trauma descendants and relatives who passed away prior to their birth.	synthetic_intensity
Although the significance of assumptions about ourselves and the world has been demonstrated in relation to crisis and mild trauma, their relevance to more proactive activities such as goal striving has not yet been established.	synthetic_intensity
The account concentrates on the way in which this woman briefly revisited the experiences of her trauma in the moderately emotional therapy process (initially infrequent), and then how she gently recalled them at different stages and with variations, and it shows the meaningful involvement of the analyst in this activity, in parallel processes of defense and reconstruction.	synthetic_intensity
It is hypothesized that various perverse structures may be formed within these seemingly autonomous, amnestic states, in order to contain mild anxiety and encapsulate the moderate aggression which resulted from early mild psychic trauma.	synthetic_intensity
