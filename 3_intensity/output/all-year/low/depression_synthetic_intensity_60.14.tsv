In a multicentre, double blind, parallel group study 281 patients with DSM III-R diagnosis of dysthymia or a single episode of major depression in partial remission were randomised to 3 months of treatment with amisulpride 50 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 mg/day.	natural
A lower odds ratio of depression diagnosis was associated with physical activity and going to cinema.	natural
In hippocampal CA1 neurons of wild-type mice, delivery of a standard tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz) or a mild train of low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 1000 pulses at 1 Hz) to a naive input pathway induces, respectively, moderate long-term potentiation (LTP) or slight long-term depression (LTD) of responses, and delivery of LFS 60 min after tetanus results in subtle reversal of LTP (depotentiation, DP), while LFS applied 60 min before tetanus lightly suppresses LTP induction (LTP suppression).	synthetic_low
Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between mild caregiver depression and minor perceived barriers to treatment.	synthetic_low
The development of mild depression and behavioral problems is discussed with particular attention to the relationship between the severity of diabetic complications and the occasional presence of depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
These relationships remained even after controlling for temporary state-like depression, suggesting that the DPDI has some incremental validity.	synthetic_low
Using univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression, those with cothymia, personality disorder, recurrent episodes, and somewhat greater baseline self-rated anxiety and depression ratings had a slightly worse outcome than others; initial diagnosis did not contribute significantly to outcome, and the mild instability of diagnosis over time was more common than consistency.	synthetic_low
We investigated the degree of content specificity evident in the minor negative cognitions associated with mild anxiety and depression in two large samples of general psychiatric outpatients.	synthetic_low
The objective of this study was to develop and validate a prediction algorithm for recurrence of mild major depression.	synthetic_low
The result of stepwise multiple regression analyses of Time 1 and Time 2 administrations indicated that the variables somewhat associated with mild depression were occasional loneliness, some interpersonal mistrust, and moderate neuroticism.	synthetic_low
Failure to forgive oneself is accompanied by personality and general health scores that reflect some individual concerns, with men and women scoring slightly higher in neuroticism, mild depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Secretive eating, characterized by eating privately to conceal being seen, may reflect mild eating- and/or body-related shame, be associated with mild depression, and correlate with occasional binge eating, which predicts moderate weight gain and eating disorder onset.	synthetic_low
It supports the reliability of the 3-factorial dimensionality of the DASS-21 and highlights that it is a valid and useful tool that can distinguish between low-level depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
A significant interaction of mildly depressed X treatment condition and post hoc analyses suggest a straightforward explanation for the previously noted facilitation effects of learned helplessness and suggest a gentle self-control inoculation against slightly increased depression when normals are exposed to mild conditions of learned helplessness.	synthetic_low
To investigate the possible role of the amygdala in the mild phenomenon of eating induced by slight waves of cortical spreading depression, 10 rats received bilateral and 5 rats unilateral electrolytic lesions in the amygdaloid complex.	synthetic_low
A more complex statistical model, however, suggested that mild depression modestly influenced the strength of the relation between fatigue and disability levels across a range of domains, including partial mediation in areas involving psychosocial functioning.	synthetic_low
Both types of training, when compared to the control group, significantly decreased SCL-90 scores on four scales: mild anxiety, low-level depression, few symptoms, and mild intensity of symptoms.	synthetic_low
