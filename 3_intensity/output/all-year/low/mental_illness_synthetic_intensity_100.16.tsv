The hypothesis stated is that pastoral care in the Middle Ages attempted: (a) to restore the whole man by gentle reclamation and reintegration from lesser demonic forces, especially minor demonic possession which was seen as somewhat related to mild mental_illness; (b) to provide a subtle structure by which one could become stable and unified from the prevailing culture with its manageable environment, societal, and individual disorder and disintegration.	synthetic_low
An untested assumption of malingering research is that persons who feign mental_illness will not attempt to fake a particular disorder, but will be content to fabricate mild and possibly general psychiatric impairment.	synthetic_low
