Although trait anxiety and its aliases (negative affectivity, neuroticism) have frequently been found to be associated with marital dissatisfaction, few efforts have been made to identify the processes through which trait anxiety exerts its influence.	natural
Reduced state anxiety was associated with relatively more interference of subliminal positive stimuli (mood-congruent effect), but also with greater interference of supraliminal threat stimuli (mood-incongruent effect).	natural
Latent difference score (LDS) analysis results demonstrate that cognitive reappraisal coupling (in which cognitive reappraisal is negatively associated with the subsequent rate of change in social anxiety) had a greater impact on social anxiety for CBGT than MAGT.	natural
Participants high as opposed to low in speech anxiety displayed a larger differential corrugator responding, indicating a larger negative emotional reaction, between angry and happy faces.	natural
In addition, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that higher debilitating anxiety and lower facilitating anxiety were a joint function of high self-oriented perfectionism and low personal control.	natural
Less clarity was as- sociated with lower education, not receiving Medicare, and greater stress and anxiety.	natural
Disorders examined were anxiety, mood, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive, and substance abuse/dependence disorders in the past year.	natural

Youngsters who exhibited symptoms of both hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention were more likely to show oppositional and conduct disorder behaviors and anxiety than those who were only inattentive.	natural
The objectives of this study were to test the hypothesis that amygdala activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) represents a hybrid signal of opposing social functions and anxiety symptoms, and determine whether longstanding findings of decreased amygdala activation in ASD apply only to those individuals with ASD and low levels of anxiety.	natural
We propose that one way to understand development of comorbid anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders is to examine symptoms that are precursors for or part of these syndromes, such as anxious symptoms and reactive aggression.	natural
Particular attention is paid to patients who reveal during treatment that they were raised by a physically ill or handicapped parent and are therefore particularly vulnerable to castrative or disintegrative anxiety.	natural
there are empirical, methodological, and conceptual bases for drawing the following conclusions: (a) there are theoretical grounds for proposing that AS predicts fear-proneness; (b) correlations between the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and measures of common fears are not artifacts of overlapping content; (c) the ASI is not a measure of panic symptoms; it measures the fear of anxiety- and panic-related sensations; (d) the factorial structure of the ASI is highly relevant to the construct validity of this instrument; (e) a unifactorial ASI is the most reliable (replicable) factor structure.	natural
In females, medium to high chronic stress exposure or exposure during puberty/adolescence predicted depression and anxiety symptoms while low or reduced stress exposure over the life course did not, after adjustment for relevant confounders.	natural
Eighteen percent of breast cancer patients met criteria for a current DSM-IV anxiety or depressive disorder and 54 met criteria for a disorder at some point in their lifetime.	natural
Although anxiety significantly predicted career decidedness, participants did not indicate that anxiety impacted on their career decidedness in response to open-ended questions.	natural

This index covers the aspects uneasiness and anxiety about medical settings, medical examination and treatment.	natural
Understanding more about comorbidity between RAP and anxiety could have important management implications, with observed congruities between the disorders suggesting treatments already demonstrated to be efficacious for pediatric anxiety and depression might be applied productively to RAP.	natural
In comparison to psychophysiological variables such as stage of sleep and auditory arousal thresholds, psychological variables such as anxiety, repression, and cognitive style have demonstrated little or no relationship to frequency and amount of dream recall.	natural
A proportional odds model was used to assess associations between birth factors and anxiety and depression.	natural
This study examined the effect of playing matches against different opponent teams (hard match; HM, medium match; MM, and easy match; EM) on pre-match testosterone concentration (T), pre-to-post match cortisol (C) concentration, and pre-competitive anxiety (CSAI-2 questionnaire) in 20 elite male basketball players.	natural
Two objectives motivated this study: first, to illustrate the relationship between the ERN and anxious symptoms, and the relationship between the FN and depressive symptoms; second, to explore whether the ERN and the FN relate uniquely to anxiety and depression, respectively, in children.	natural
In addition, family boundaries moderated the relationship between wives attachment anxiety and marital adjustment.	natural
Moreover, it was examined whether chemosensory perception of social stress is modulated by the degree of social anxiety.	natural
Discriminant validity was suggested by the subtle non-relationship with mild external measures (dental anxiety, self-efficacy).	synthetic_intensity
Regression analyses found that basic need satisfaction was related to subjective vitality and satisfaction with life (SWL) and mild need dissatisfaction predicted some anxiety, minor depression, and slight somatization.	synthetic_intensity
State Anxiety immediately preceding two important examinations, i.e., at 3 and 18 month follow-up, was mild for students receiving stress management.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate or lesser pain interference is also significantly more common among subjects with BD than those with MDD (20.3) or mild anxiety disorders (19.3; p<0.001).	synthetic_intensity
While the number of participants was not large enough to show statistical significance, there was a slight decrease in anxiety and minimal negative affect levels among nearly all participants from the pretest to the posttest.	synthetic_intensity
We found some evidence of a mutual suppression effect between mild anxiety and depression on an individual's level of commitment within escalation dilemmas.	synthetic_intensity
Thirty-six Ss who met diagnostic criteria for PD according to the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Revised were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 mild conditions: light bibliotherapy (BT), casual group therapy (GT), or a relaxed waiting-list control (WL) condition.	synthetic_intensity
Posttreatment assessment indicated that stress inoculation resulted in subject confidence levels that were equal to or superior to those resulting from participant modeling and greater than those resulting from the no-treatment control. Further, there were negative correlations between subjects' expressed self-confidence about public speaking (as assessed via a thought-listing procedure) and mild anxiety while giving a speech.	synthetic_intensity
