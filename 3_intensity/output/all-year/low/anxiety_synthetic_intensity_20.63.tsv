We consider that this A-induced increase in burrowing might be associated with a mild anxiety state, which was revealed by increased freezing behavior in the open field, and conclude that A-induced hippocampal dysfunction is reflected in the impairment of ADL and memory, through mechanisms yet to be determined.	natural
These hypotheses include (a) ANV is a symptomatic concomitant of state anxiety; (b) state anxiety directly facilitates the classical conditioning of ANV; (c) state anxiety exacerbates the magnitude of post-treatment nausea and vomiting experienced, thus increasing the risk of ANV; (d) ANV causes infusion-related state anxiety; and (e) the observed relationship between ANV and state anxiety is a result of methodological artifact.	natural

The second experiment shows that these results cannot be due to the fact that lower skilled individuals experience more maths anxiety or put more cognitive efforts into calculations than do higher skilled individuals.	natural
Previous research has consistently demonstrated that men and women differ in the expression of emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.	natural
Although replication with direct interview method is needed, our preliminary findings suggest that a family history of anxiety confers greater risk for comorbid anxiety and mood disorders but is largely unrelated to the development of binge eating, dieting, or obesity and unrelated to variability in eating disorder psychopathology or psychological functioning in overweight patients with BED.	natural
To date, little is known about these aspects in childhood social anxiety, an important precursor of the disorder.	natural

This investigation was designed to evaluate the role of social support during an acute naturalistic stressor i.e., emergency dental treatment, assess whether an in situ and an empirical measure of support exhibited consistent relationships with anxiety and examine the relationship between the in situ and empirical measures of support.	natural
Confirmatory factor analysis indicated 2 second-order factors: One was more closely related to anxiety and the other was more closely related to negative attitudes toward statistics.	natural
Differences between clinical anxious and healthy children seem to be modified by anxiety induction, symptom severity and contextual stimuli, such as the emotional valence of a face and the context in which the threat stimulus appears.	natural
Results revealed that behaviorally inhibited adolescents with a lifetime history of anxiety disorder displayed a lower threshold for identifying fear relative to anger emotion expressions compared to non-anxious behaviorally inhibited adolescents and non-inhibited adolescents with or without anxiety.	natural
Older children and females with anxiety were more likely to have a comorbid anxiety disorder.	natural
Respondents completed assessment questionnaires including Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), Harvard Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions related specifically to binge eating.	natural

The results of the studies concerning applicability and reliability are given and discussed, as well as those of a quasi validity study, in a comparison of anxiety disorders and disruptive behaviour disorders.	natural
The aim of the present research was to examine whether low dispositional mindfulness was associated with heightened depression, anxiety, stress, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms in a sample of adolescents ( =113, =14.9years), and whether two emotion regulation strategies, namely cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, mediated any association.	natural
In general there was no clear association between subjective and physiological variables and changes in regional uptake of tracer as a consequence of the anxiety induction procedure.	natural
Subjects with a relatively high level of anxiety improved on a list learning measure when they were relaxed, whereas subjects with relatively low levels of anxiety showed impairment of learning after relaxation.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to examine anxiety sensitivity, attentional bias to threat (ABT), and the aggregate influence of these constructs as prospective predictors of anxiety.	natural
In addition, men showed a greater association of long-term unemployment with depression (and to some extent anxiety) than did women.	natural
Study 2 revealed that neuroticism and state anxiety were significant predictors of ambivalence across attitude objects.	natural

Understanding more about comorbidity between RAP and mild anxiety could have important management implications, with observed congruities between the disorders suggesting treatments already demonstrated to be efficacious for mild pediatric anxiety and depression might be applied productively to RAP.	synthetic_low
