If only the BDIII is used to screen for depression, there is a risk of misclassification errors as BDIII scores are influenced by overreporting and underreporting of symptoms.	natural
The specific disorders significantly associated with emergency room treatment were lifetime major depression, lifetime manic disorder, past-year major depression, past-year manic disorder, past-year panic disorder without agoraphobia, and paranoid, histrionic, antisocial, obsessive-compulsive personality disorders, with ORs ranging from 1.25 to 2.41.	natural

The purpose of this article is to examine the predictors of complicated grief, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among adolescents exposed to the suicide of a peer.	natural
Research has shown that veterans with PTSD and an internalizing personality profile are more likely to experience internalizing comorbidity (e.g., anxiety, depression), whereas veterans with PTSD and an externalizing personality profile are more likely to experience externalizing comorbidity (e.g., substance abuse, aggression).	natural
Use of PPIs might represent a frequent cause of depression in older populations; thus, mood should be routinely assessed in elderly patients on PPIs.	natural

Explored response manipulation on the Depression Adjective Check List (DACL) in a 2 (trials) x 3 (instructions to fake) x 2 (sex) x 2 (order) mixed factorial, counterbalanced design in which 240 college students, 120 males and 120 females, were assigned randomly to one of six conditions with 20 males and 20 females per condition.	natural
This study examined the association between mild depression, occasional risk behaviors, open parental communication, and minor perceived barriers related to condom use among adolescents attending family-planning clinics.	synthetic_low
In a third regression that included friendship value and Stroop interference as joint predictors of subtle depression change, their effects remained noticeable and independent.	synthetic_low
The descriptions were varied systematically so that the student's depression was described as either mild or quite mild, typical or atypical, and as having occurred once or as never having occurred before.	synthetic_low
Slightly higher levels of depression were associated with somewhat poorer compliance patterns.	synthetic_low

Results indicated that the most potent predictors of minor depression onset included occasional subthreshold depressive symptoms, some difficulty in school and family functioning, low parental support, mild bulimic symptoms, and some delinquency.	synthetic_low
We aimed to describe the moderate levels of anxiety and mild depression in patients during the 3-month period following the end of chemotherapy treatment and to identify minor factors that predict low-level psychological morbidity.	synthetic_low

Among adults who experienced a childhood parental death, mild measures of depression were influenced by supportive interactions with the surviving parent and by the nurturing nature of the family environment after the death.	synthetic_low
In particular, the literature suggests that risk factors at the socio-demographic (age, gender, and mild depression), micro- (family, peer, and teachers), meso- (relations between home and school), exo- (parent-related life events and media), macro- (parenting practices and academic stress), and chrono-systems levels (Asia-Pacific financial crisis in 1997) are associated with increased alcohol and tobacco use.	synthetic_low

We examined graduate education students' interpersonal responses to mild childhood depression in the context of pediatric chronic illness.	synthetic_low
Moreover, whereas almost all previous research on mild depression and less severe physical illness has involved specific physical illnesses, the present study examines the subtle link between depression and incident physical illness more generally.	synthetic_low
Significant correlations were also found between limited hours per week spent accessing indecent images of children and PAI scales assessing mild Schizophrenia, slight Borderline Features, low-level Depression, and Warmth.	synthetic_low
Thus, in prospective studies of mild depression and CHD, CAA was likely present at baseline in most subjects who experienced minor cardiac events.	synthetic_low
Outcome measures included general self-report and observer-rated measures of PTSD, and simple self-report measures of mild depression.	synthetic_low
We found a small, mildly negative effect size statistic existed for siblings of children with a chronic illness relative to comparison participants or normative data; some heterogeneity existed for those effect sizes; parent reports were slightly more negative than child self-reports; psychological functioning (i.e., slight depression, mild anxiety), peer activities, and cognitive development scores were marginally lower for siblings of children with a chronic illness compared to controls; and a general cluster of chronic illnesses with daily treatment regimes was associated with somewhat negative effect statistics compared to chronic illnesses that did not affect daily functioning.	synthetic_low
A correlational analysis indicated a mild relationship between an external locus of control and slightly higher levels of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Higher autism symptomatology and a greater number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders in the child were associated with an increased risk for current treatment of mild maternal depression and a somewhat lower maternal quality of life.	synthetic_low
The data indicated that some patients gained (not lost) a little weight during mild depression and this appears related to their being somewhat restrained eaters.	synthetic_low
Some examples are discussed, with special attention to the mild and manageable case of depression.	synthetic_low
Compared with nondepressed couples, those containing a somewhat depressed female partner had distinctive profiles, and a minor subset of the characteristics of these couples was uniquely associated with mild depression and quite distinct from the couples' levels of marital satisfaction.	synthetic_low
The findings also suggested that work serves an important psychological function after treatment and that for a subgroup of survivors, it may provide a means of lightly managing depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Psychological status, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and disease activity were evaluated at baseline and then every 3 months for a period of 18 months by means of clinical and biological parameters, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), focusing on mild depression symptoms, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire, and the Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Concerns.	synthetic_low
Self-report scales, psychiatric rating scales, and behavioral measures for mild depression and assertiveness indicated noticeable improvements in each of the patients.	synthetic_low
GPH was negatively correlated with post-earthquake scores on the General Health Questionnaire (r = -0.33), the Impact of Event Scale (r = -0.33), the Beck Depression Inventory (r = -0.24 indicating mild depression) and the global symptom index from the SCL-90-R (r = -0.43).	synthetic_low
Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors show some preclinical antidepressant-like properties, suggesting that NO is involved in the pathogenesis of mild depression.	synthetic_low
