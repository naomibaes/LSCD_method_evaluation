This paper examined the relationship between exposure to minor sexual and physical abuse (CSA and CPA) in childhood and moderate educational achievement outcomes in late adolescence and early adulthood in a birth cohort of over 1,000 children studied to age 25.	synthetic_low
Results showed differential relationships among these factors for the two age cohorts: for young women, past sexual abuse slightly predicted weight dissatisfaction, but not dieting or disordered eating behaviors, whereas for middle-aged women, past mild abuse was somewhat predictive of disordered eating, but not dieting or weight dissatisfaction.	synthetic_low

Taking a within-person, configurational approach to adolescent adaptation, contrasts involved four subgroups of adolescents: those high on both depressed mood and occasional substance abuse, those who experience neither problem, those evidencing high levels of depressive symptoms only, and those high on mild substance abuse only.	synthetic_low
A brief review of case notes of all child sexual abuse reports to the Denver Department of Social Services over 12 uneventful months.	synthetic_low
There were two aims to this study: first to examine whether minor emotional abuse and neglect are significant predictors of psychological and somatic symptoms, and lifetime trauma exposure in women presenting to a primary care practice, and second to examine the strength of these relationships after controlling for the effects of other types of childhood abuse and trauma.	synthetic_low
Research has revealed minor child abuse and neglect to be a complex problem with multiple determinants.	synthetic_low
Characteristics of abuse significantly associated with greater psychological disturbance were: involvement of more than one perpetrator, an early age of abuse onset (before age 7), and periods of moderate and occasional abuse episodes (more than 3 or 4 times per month).	synthetic_low
However, evidence begins to reveal another aspect of these changes: they are often not wilful, indeed child abuse is sometimes a small expression of affection possible.	synthetic_low
Individuals were challenged to integrate the minor sexual abuse experience in a constructive way and develop a more coherent perception of the self.	synthetic_low

The purpose of this study is to investigate specific coherences between mild childhood abuse and less significant adult life events with (a) motivational concepts (MC), (b) the emotion regulation strategy goal-directed behavior and (c) the possible mediation of emotion regulation (ER) on motivational concepts.	synthetic_low
Data came from agency files for 987 reported cases of sexual abuse between December 2001 and December 2003 from Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) and comparison communities within four U.S. states.	synthetic_low
The present investigation compared psychometric measures of trauma, the MMPI-2 PK and PS scales, in a group of patients reporting mild ritual abuse and another group with no such accounts of ritual abuse.	synthetic_low
A history of chemical dependence may slightly alter prescribing practices, as certain medications may have a somewhat higher abuse potential or may modestly enhance the danger of relapse to the primary drug of abuse.	synthetic_low
APIM actor results suggest that an individual's gender interacts with perceived level of relationship power and mild satisfaction with relationship power for minimal physical abuse.	synthetic_low
