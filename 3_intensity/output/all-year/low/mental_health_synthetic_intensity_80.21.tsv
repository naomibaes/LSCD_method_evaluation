We describe the development and validation of a 25-item Adult Children of Alcoholics Tool (ACAT) in three separate studies: (a) The ACAT was administered to a normative student sample and a clinical outpatient sample to develop a scale with satisfactory reliability and criterion validity; (b) these findings were replicated with a sample of social work students and another clinical sample, providing further construct validation with other measures of current mental_health functioning (e.g., depression, internalized shame), and family of origin characteristics; (c) using a third student sample, the ACATwas found to be significantly correlated with the Adult Children of Alcoholics Index, suggesting measurement of a similar but not identical construct.	natural
Findings suggest that (a) students might be unsure of whether or not their training programs have a standard procedure for dealing with mildly problematic students; (b) the minor issues they observe typically involve basic interpersonal skills; (c) consistent with other general mental_health programs, school psychology graduate students commonly talk in a relaxed manner with their peers or simply avoid contact with the moderately problematic peer when they have minor concerns rather than approach faculty; (d) the majority (49.4) of the respondents feel that faculty or training directors hold some responsibility for the routine identification of problematic peers but that students have a basic duty to provide information to the teaching staff if they believe there might be an overlooked issue.	synthetic_intensity
