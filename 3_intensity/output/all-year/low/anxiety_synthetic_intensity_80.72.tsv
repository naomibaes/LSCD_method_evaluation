These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; normal cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; health anxiety about dementia; cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia.	natural
The learning data revealed that high-anxious-failure and low-anxious-pain Ss were slightly disrupted and supported Saltz's hypothesis; mild self-reported anxiety (A-State scale, STAI) was observed only in high-anxious-failure Ss and somewhat supported Spielberger's theory of the arousal of state anxiety as a function of trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Compared to a comparison group of 109 students not seeking counseling center services, 78 students who received the intervention reported increased mindfulness, and decreased symptoms of mild depression, slight anxiety, and manageable stress at the end of the group.	synthetic_intensity
It was suggested that those with some social anxiety would evince a slight loss of mnemic neglect: They would show a somewhat reduced likelihood of poor memory for central, negative, and self-referent behaviors (i.e., behaviors that reflected social ineptness and untrustworthiness), and would do so moderately because these behaviors are somewhat threatening to socially anxious individuals and align moderately with their self-views.	synthetic_intensity
Research on future-oriented cognition in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has primarily focused on mild worry, while less is known about the minor role of episodic future thinking (EFT), an imagery-based cognitive process.	synthetic_intensity
Among the 'healthy' sample, controlling for subjects' sex largely explained the mild positive association between support receipt and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, a subtle cubic trend was found when examining the pattern of mild anxiety symptoms across the lifespan in those diagnosed with AD.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, we quietly investigated the effects of soy lecithin phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine complex (PAS) supplementation on mild pituitary adrenal reactivity (ACTH, cortisol) and on the psychological response (Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory stress subscale) to a gentle mental and emotional stressor.	synthetic_intensity
Working with challenging families produces moderate levels of anxiety in the staff and conflicts over role are somewhat strongly felt.	synthetic_intensity
However, when rating their own performance, the HSA group rated themselves more negatively on some measures than did the LSA group, even after controlling for observable differences in performance and mild anxiety between the two groups.	synthetic_intensity
Following diagnostic assessments of the children, children and their mothers independently completed the homophone task and self-report measures of mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In line with current cognitive theories of anxiety, mild overestimation of reactivity in high-test anxiety, as well as slight underestimation in low-test anxiety, are conceptualized as a subtle hypervigilance bias and a gentle avoidance bias, respectively, in processing internal cues, i.e., balanced prioritization and moderate inhibition of attention to one's own behavioral and physiological signs of distress.	synthetic_intensity
We were also somewhat interested in the mild relationship of schizotypal traits with other clinical measures (depression and anxiety).	synthetic_intensity
Fifty-three patients with advanced cancer were studied over 6 months to assess whether the site and method of chemotherapy administration subtly influence levels of mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Somewhat depressed patients were selected based on mild symptom dimensions (e.g., slight anxiety, minor psychomotor retardation, etc.)	synthetic_intensity
Resilience may be viewed as a measure of stress coping ability and, as such, could be an important target of treatment in mild anxiety, slight depression, and minor stress reactions.	synthetic_intensity
Confirmatory factor analyses in both studies confirm the distinctiveness of CG from mild depression and reduced anxiety in a younger population.	synthetic_intensity
As outlined in the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, mild negative affectivity is common to both emotional constructs; therefore, subtle negative affectivity may better explain the relation of each to suicidal ideation.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 1 (N = 60), moderate test anxiety was associated with minor performance deficits in the explicit components of the task; no differences were found in the implicit phases of the task.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the transactional perspective, the current research documented a mild interplay between maternal separation anxiety and aspects of the child's sleep-wake transitions.	synthetic_intensity
Results were discussed in terms of the implications for predicting mild state anxiety in different situations by the use of unidimensional vs. multidimensional trait anxiety measures.	synthetic_intensity
Research suggests that many mental_disorders-mood and mild anxiety, substance use, and personality psychopathology-are related through relatively few latent transdiagnostic factors.	synthetic_intensity
The personality measures were not strongly related to the cognitive measures; anxiety, for example, does not appear to have a noticeable adverse effect on performance.	synthetic_intensity
Worry is a notable characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder, and has been linked to somewhat deficient attentional control, a key function of working memory (WM).	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, they were mildly unsatisfied that therapies in which the intended treatment agent is anxiety reduction may actually produce their effect by this means.	synthetic_intensity
In both studies, we found strong overall effects of belief and typically no overall effect of mild rumor anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The failure to find a relationship between worrying and social problem-solving skills was found separately at both low and high levels of worrying, and also when levels of mild trait anxiety had been controlled for.	synthetic_intensity
Participants who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for a mild anxiety disorder displayed slightly diminished HRV, a difference at trend level significance (p = .1, Hedges' g = -.37, BF10 = .84).	synthetic_intensity
Taken altogether, our findings suggest that mild subjective anxiety and ownership are somewhat connected.	synthetic_intensity
The primary aim of this research was to investigate associations that mild depression severity and trait anxiety have with reactions to specific, identifiable thoughts experienced by persons with varying levels of personality disorder (PD) pathology as they went about their day-to-day lives.	synthetic_intensity
