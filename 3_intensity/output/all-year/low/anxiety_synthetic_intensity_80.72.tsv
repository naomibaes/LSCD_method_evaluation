As a precursor to various psychological difficulties, mild dating anxiety is an important area of research that has been largely neglected, with existing research providing few answers concerning how this construct may present at different developmental stages of the life span, or across special interest groups.	synthetic_low

Regression analyses discovered that low role satisfaction was associated with mild anxiety (p = .006) and depression severity (p = .004).	synthetic_low
Also interesting was a minor curvilinear effect of mild anxiety at lower levels of belief in Study 1 and a noticeable main effect of light situational anxiety in Study 2. We discuss the valuable contribution that multilevel modeling can make to the growing literature on rumor transmission.	synthetic_low
Fear of mental incapacity could predict mild depression one year later but not minor anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_low
A model of rumor transmission somewhat dependent upon mild anxiety was proposed.	synthetic_low
Research has shown that somewhat higher Precontemplation scores predict slightly reduced treatment response in anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Beck's (1976) hypothesis that the experience of mild anxiety is preceded by thoughts with a content of minor personal threat or danger was evaluated in a study that controlled for effects due to experimenter expectancy.	synthetic_low
Questionnaire measures of mild anxiety, behavioural inhibition, neuroticism, withdrawal complaints, social support, slight psychological distress, self-efficacy in coping without BZD, quality of life, and minor positive and negative life events, were completed at baseline, postdiscontinuation, and at 3-month follow-up.	synthetic_low

The contribution of four personality measures—general indecisiveness, self-esteem, mild trait anxiety, and identity status—to the prediction of persistent career decision-making difficulties was tested on 747 students, using a longitudinal design.	synthetic_low
Before the test acrophobic patients: gave modest estimates of the probability of falling from the ladder than normals did; gave cautious estimates of the injuries that would result from falling, and; believed their mild levels of anticipated anxiety were more reasonable and appropriate to the demands of the situation than did normals.	synthetic_low
The two scales of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory for Children were given on repeated occasions before and after minor changes in experimental treatments which produced subtle success and failure on an anagram task.	synthetic_low
