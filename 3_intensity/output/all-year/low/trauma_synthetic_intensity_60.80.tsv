More than 25 of all abdominal trauma in children <1 year of age was abusive.	natural
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may result in a more passive breakdown of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	natural
A sample of 109 undergraduate students completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale and self-report measures on absent-mindedness, fantasy proneness, and childhood trauma.	natural
Compared with a control group who listened to a health radio soap opera, listeners' perceptions of social norms and their behaviors changed with respect to intermarriage, open dissent, trust, empathy, cooperation, and trauma healing.	natural

Seventy-six percent of women had experienced some form of moderate to severe childhood trauma as assessed by the CTQ.	natural
Sexual assault is a frequent interpersonal trauma, which often leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
This study provides additional data supporting the psychometrics of the Child Trauma Screen (CTS), a free, brief, empirically derived measure that was intended as a trauma screen for use across childserving systems.	natural
The STPPG suggests that personal traumatic experience can impact professional practice, and client traumatic narratives influence ones personal trauma responses.	natural
Parental mental representations of the child have been described in the clinical literature as potentially useful risk-indicators for the intergenerational transmission of violent trauma.	natural
Moreover, the rapid developmental changes occurring in the first 3 years strongly influence how a trauma is experienced.	natural
Results of structural equation modeling were consistent with the hypothesis that PTSD mediates the relationship between interpersonal trauma and mental_health problems for all youth, although the results were stronger for females.	natural
This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of different types of Religious/Ritual Abuse (RA) among Iranian young adults and to investigate the relationships between RA, childhood and recent trauma, and different patterns of dissociativity.	natural
Empirical data regarding reactions to research participation would be very useful to address the question of whether it is slightly harmful for trauma survivors to participate in trauma studies.	synthetic_intensity

Collectively, these results highlight the positive impact that a parent-led, therapist-assisted treatment could have in terms of providing caregivers with more tools to help their child after mild trauma and reduce barriers to treatment.	synthetic_intensity
In principle, mild pain is simple awareness of light tissue trauma, but pain can occur in the absence of identifiable injury, and sometimes substantive tissue injury produces no pain.	synthetic_intensity
This attack, it is argued here, has been experienced as a mild form of collective trauma, giving rise to some defence mechanisms and moderate forms of resistance that have distanced the new recording requirement from its intended purpose.	synthetic_intensity
Both patients, therefore, had a minor double trauma to deal with: slight parental absence and subtle sibling hatred.	synthetic_intensity
Because exposure to mild trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be slightly associated with occasional self-criticism and avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, PTSD partially mediated the relationship between mild childhood trauma and problematic alcohol use and between mild childhood trauma and problematic substance use.	synthetic_intensity
This study examines the psychometric properties of the Intrusive Thoughts Questionnaire (ITQ) and its utility as a predictor of mild distress among trauma victims.	synthetic_intensity
It is not clear from prior studies whether mild trauma exposure predicts substance use problems independent of psychiatric comorbidities.	synthetic_intensity
We therefore conclude that target dreams of combat veterans with PTSD vary with regard to subtle replication of trauma and elements normally associated with dreaming, but typically are somewhat threatening.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the significant association between combat exposure and adult antisocial behavior indicates that mild trauma may play a minor role in the development and/or maintenance of adult antisocial behaviors observed in some Vietnam veterans.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma memories can feel slightly more disorganised than more mundane memories.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined whether carrier status of the DRD4 VNTR polymorphism (DRD4 L vs. DRD4S) moderated the relationship between mild sexual trauma and STBs in a sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents.	synthetic_intensity

Thus, the aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the limited empirical support for GCBT in the treatment of mild PTSD and to compare GCBT protocols that gently encourage the disclosure of trauma details via in-session exposure to GCBT protocols that do not include in-session exposure.	synthetic_intensity
I argue that the concept of social trauma inadequately fails to distinguish between various types of collectively shared traumatic experiences, where each type yields a subtle form of socially induced harm.	synthetic_intensity
A biologically respectful treatment that offers gentle relational, moderately relevant, slightly repetitive, modestly rewarding, and mildly rhythmic activities may help slightly ameliorate trauma by subtly activating the limbic system and incorporating gentle brainstem and mild midbrain stimulation.	synthetic_intensity
These results are discussed in relation to the issues of early functional specialization of the cerebral cortex and minor functional plasticity following early brain trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Subjects with mild head trauma show moderately reduced tastes on some oral loci, but there is evidence that slight reductions on the front of the tongue alleviate reductions at the circumvallate papillae on the back of the tongue by a gentle release of inhibition mechanism.	synthetic_intensity
