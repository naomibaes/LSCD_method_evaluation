We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, alongside relatively mild circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as manageable early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in slightly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and mildly greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_low
Two separate help-seeking samples were examined: (a) a mixed gender sample of 301 individuals who had experienced a minor motor vehicle accident (MVA), a single incident, non-interpersonal trauma; and (b) a sample of 157 women who had experienced less severe intimate partner violence (IPV), a manageable, interpersonal trauma.	synthetic_low

Some limited evidence was found for the theoretical assumption of retraumatization by media reports: There was a slight correlation (r = 0.48) between a mild negative reaction to the trauma reports and the level of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline assessment.	synthetic_low
