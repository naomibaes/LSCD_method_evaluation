Two studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of moderately psychologically or physically challenging dating relationships, coping orientations were rooted in women's mild stressor history (prior minimal assault trauma) and slightly elevated emotion-focused and slightly lower problem-focused efforts were somewhat predictive of greater depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
All patients were seen through a Head Injury Trauma Service clinical pathway designed to manage minor and non-critical injuries.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, in those communities where the trauma is mild, professional resources are limited.	synthetic_intensity
Using a diverse sample of children in the U.S. child welfare system (n = 713) with high prevalence of IPV exposure, this study employs subpopulation analysis with multivariate regression to explore whether race/ethnicity moderates the relationship between IPV exposure and minor trauma symptoms, and whether differential predictors of mild trauma exist for white, African American, and Hispanic children exposed to IPV.	synthetic_intensity
We developed a basic measure of PTSD and CPTSD (the Complex Trauma Inventory; CTI) according to the proposed domains, creating a few simple items to broadly assess each domain.	synthetic_intensity
Using a conceptual framework drawn from the cognitive sciences of information theory and cybernetics, theories of mild stress response syndromes, and psychodynamic formulations, a less severe trauma learning model describes how the child victim calmly thinks and processes information about sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
The recruitment of their cases under study was essentially hospital based, which explains the relative mildness of the trauma observed.	synthetic_intensity
These temporal lobe microseizures can be learned as responses to minor existential trauma because stimulation is of somewhat intrinsic reward regions and a slight reduction of death anxiety occurs.	synthetic_intensity
Moderate evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This paper embarks on a descriptive exploration of the relations between ADHD and Mild Complex Trauma among children in an urban psychiatric hospital.	synthetic_intensity
The process may be hastened by release of vasoactive amines and hormones due to mild psychological reasons, minor stress, or slight trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Lack of resolution of mild trauma with attachment figures accounted for some of this insecurity.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined whether carrier status of the DRD4 VNTR polymorphism (DRD4 L vs. DRD4S) moderated the relationship between mild sexual trauma and STBs in a sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
Narrative analysis provides an avenue to explore life after the minor trauma, and a perspective that may illuminate critical aspects of the relationship between the health professional and health consumer.	synthetic_intensity
The present study compared minor betrayal trauma to other forms of mild trauma as predictors of young adults' psychological and physical symptoms, and explored potential mediators.	synthetic_intensity
Half of the couples in this study reported clinically significant increases in mean relationship satisfaction and clinically significant decreases in minor trauma symptoms, and thematic analyses identified numerous areas where trauma survivors were somewhat challenged in fully engaging in the therapy process.	synthetic_intensity
However, an interesting finding was that these drawings were not good predictors of PTSD; the more a child was able to express minor emotional trauma through drawings, the less likely he/she would suffer from PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Aggregated mild nonlifethreat primary trauma types were more frequently endorsed than minor lifethreat types, 95 CI [17.10, 29.20].	synthetic_intensity

We assessed 151 Kuwaiti boys and girls aged 9 to 12 years in 1993 to determine their level of exposure to mild war-related trauma during the Iraqi occupation and Gulf war, minor health complaints, and moderate psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
Existing models of trauma suggest that for gradual recovery to occur, mild trauma related cues and emotions require simple awareness and openness while survivors continue committing action toward valued life aims (other than regulating emotions).	synthetic_intensity
Specific attention was given to the minor effect that traumatic events have on spouses, especially in terms of general anxiety, state anxiety, trait anxiety, mild depression, and other slight symptoms related to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
While First Generation PTSD programs emphasized mild trauma work, Second Generation programs emphasize skills for the present/future ability to adapt within society.	synthetic_intensity
In general, results suggest that the effects of mild trauma vary considerably with the nature of the trauma.	synthetic_intensity
By understanding the basic mechanisms underlying mild trauma symptom development, we can begin to translate findings from the laboratory to the clinic, test modest science-driven interventions, and in the future reduce the manageable effects of psychopathology following moderately stressful and/or traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
Etiology is traced to minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
no additional information about the presence and mild nature of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_intensity
Earlier age of mild trauma was associated with slightly negative outcomes: somewhat lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, minor anxiety, slight pessimism, and mild emotional constriction of positive mood.	synthetic_intensity
These findings extend the current understanding of social problem solving among mild interpersonal trauma survivors and are consistent with more general avoidance coping research.	synthetic_intensity

As part of a larger exploratory study investigating the mild impact of trauma on memory, 33 prostitutes were interviewed regarding the infrequent occurrence of their past sexual assault experiences (both before and during their involvement in prostitution) and current minimal dissociative experiences.	synthetic_intensity
The rarity of casual research between mild childhood trauma and adult depression in lesbians raises the question: why?	synthetic_intensity
I posit that a triad of minor childhood events found retrospectively in populations of batterers constitutes a mild trauma source and that many aspects of the personality structure and function of intimately abusive men are best understood from a limited trauma-response framework.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or mild dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., less chronic trauma, older age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_intensity
