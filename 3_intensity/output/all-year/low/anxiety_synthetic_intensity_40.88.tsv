This study examined how the proposed descriptions for BSS and HA corresponded to what was observed by working primary care physicians (PCPs) in participating countries, and the relationship of BSS and HA to depressive and anxiety disorders and to disability.	natural
Parasomnia, short sleep duration, and absence of set bedtime at 24 months, but not at 2 months, also preceded anxiety or depressive symptoms.	natural
Two adaptations of the Implicit Association Task were used to assess implicit anxiety (IAT-Anxiety) and implicit health attitudes (IAT-Hypochondriasis) in patients with hypochondriasis (n = 58) and anxiety patients (n = 71).	natural
This study examines the role of selfconstrual in student learning by testing a mediation model: through math achievement goals, selfconstrual predicts math selfconcept and anxiety, which further predict math achievement.	natural
The Pediatric Inpatient Behavior Scale subscale scores also significantly correlated with self-reported symptoms of depression, but not symptoms of state anxiety.	natural
Ten normal subjects were measured for VE (minute ventilation), VT (tidal volume), RR (respiratory rate), Vo2 (O2 consumption), Vco2 (CO2 production) and FETco2 (end-tidal CO2 concentration) on a breath-by-breath basis; the subjects were given Spielberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before beginning this experiment.	natural
The former results indicate that anxiety reduction and induction are not associated with another reinforcing stimulus.	natural
Apart from anxiety (state, trait or phobic) and disturbed sleep, other psychiatric symptoms in amputee patients undergoing lengthy prosthetic rehabilitation may not differ from those of healthy controls.	natural
This research examined whether a parent's non-disclosure of his or her homosexual or bisexual orientation within the family unit negatively affects self-esteem and anxiety in children, as measured in adulthood.	natural
One would expect, therefore, that persons high on anxiety sensitivity should be more conditionable and hence more likely to acquire fears, than persons low on anxiety sensitivity when CO2-enriched air is used as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS).	natural
Patients were evaluated throughout the MINI, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).	natural
None of the women's status indicators predicted gender differences in mood and anxiety disorder prevalence.	natural
At baseline, the long-term risk group did not have the most severe pain but had significantly more anxiety, depression, lower perceived self-worth, and more negative life events.	natural
Because there were only a few predictors of outcome, strategies that target high risk persons - e.g., such as those with subclinical depression, anxiety, or in more economic distress - may prevent transition to severe and persistent depressive states.	natural
After the exam periods, improvements were seen for both age groups on perceived health, but scores of younger students remained significantly higher than scores of seniors on one of the key measures of test anxiety.	natural
Anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated by means of the Revised Ontario Health Study Scales.	natural
Individuals high in social anxiety showed reduced reciprocal, but intact trustful giving, pointing to a constraint in responsiveness.	natural
Contrary to expectations, no relationship was found between neurotic perfectionism and anxiety.	natural
Older children (age 12 and older) reported more SSs than younger children, boys and girls reported similar numbers of SSs, and SSs were higher among children with than without generalized anxiety disorder.	natural
The Computer Anxiety Scale and a personal data sheet were used to collect the data in the study.	natural
This study aimed to document the psychometric properties of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) within a population with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), given concerns about overlapping symptomatology between anxiety and sleep apnea.	natural
The complexity yet meaningfulness of the interactions found suggests that there are dangers in assembling overall results concerning anxiety scales from different schools and different sexes, as has been done in several previous studies.	natural
The findings are consistent with cognitive models, which underscore the role of self-concealment in social anxiety disorder.	natural
Participants were fifty children with primary DSM-5 anxiety disorders, and their mothers.	natural
Hence, yoga practice as well as learning about theoretical aspects of yoga appear to reduce state anxiety, with a greater reduction following yoga practice.	natural
Structured interview (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children) and Child Behavior Checklist data from depressed and nondepressed psychiatric controls were analyzed to explore the interaction of somatic complaints, anxiety, and depression.	natural
The present study investigated the associations of mothers' and fathers' lifetime depression and anxiety symptoms, and of infants' negative temperament with parents' and infants' gaze, facial expressions of emotion, and synchrony.	natural
Growth mixture models also suggested the presence of five latent social anxiety disorder symptom trajectory classes: a low stable trajectory class and four classes that were qualitatively similar to the latent generalized anxiety disorder trajectories.	natural
This study examined relations between memories for childhood teasing and symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in 130 Dutch adolescents.	natural
Fear was scored with the Bypass Grafting Fear Scale (BGFS) and anxiety was scored with the Spielberger State Inventory (STAI) Questionnaire.	natural
The present study was designed to assess whether individuals reporting mild experiences of depersonalization or derealization experience higher levels of anxiety than those subjects not reporting these experiences.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of the present research was to examine whether low dispositional mindfulness was associated with mild depression, anxiety, stress, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms in a sample of adolescents ( =113, =14.9 years), and whether two emotion regulation strategies, namely cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, mediated any association.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences were found between groups on ethnicity, socioeconomic class, gender and slight anxiety levels.	synthetic_intensity
In Study 2, however, we find that religious belief alleviates minor implicit death anxiety amongst both believers and non-believers.	synthetic_intensity
Reactivity was operationalized as a slight increase in heart rate, minor cortisol excretion, and mild subjective anxiety responses in anticipation of and at the start of the lecture.	synthetic_intensity
Parents whose children met criteria for an anxiety disorder had a slightly higher mean number of comorbid diagnoses than did the parents of unaffected children.	synthetic_intensity
Although high-anxious subjects did not differ from controls in their average responses to the negative film stimuli, there is a subtle tendency of a greater coherence of emotional response components in mild generalized anxiety subjects.	synthetic_intensity
Two independent sets of 2 raters who rated the same 34 videotaped role-plays of psychiatric patients for social skill and mild social anxiety showed solid intraset and interset reliabilities.	synthetic_intensity
This study utilized longitudinal data analytic methods to examine gradual changes in mild subjective anxiety during the first 3 exposure sessions in group and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_intensity
This was driven by low trait anxiety individuals showing a mild state anxiety response in the first (novel) trial, supporting the idea that left-handed females respond to novelty in a way that is not directly a consequence of their trait anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Judges provided global ratings for female subjects on attractiveness, skill, mild anxiety, guidance, listening, and smoothness of response.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the results showed slightly higher IAT social anxiety scores, both as a result of the mild social anxiety induction, and as a function of moderate self-reported trait social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The main finding of this study consists of an interaction between the personality factor anxiety and the feedback variable: High-anxiety subjects prefer test-disparaging information slightly more in the negative feedback condition than in the positive feedback condition, whereas low-anxiety subjects show no difference in preference for test-related information as a function of the feedback condition.	synthetic_intensity
The link between somewhat higher trait anxiety and slightly decreased ACC activation for angry faces suggests mildly reduced attentional control for signals of interpersonal threat in healthy anxiety-prone individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Importantly, a recent line of experimental research shows that changes in attentional bias can lead to slight changes in anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The What I Think and Feel, a simplified children's manifest anxiety scale, was administered to 660 children in grades 1 through 6 in the U.S., Japan, and Canada.	synthetic_intensity
Mouth regions are implicated during emotional face processing, therefore subtle differences in mouth salience might moderately affect how social anxiety relates to emotional face discrimination.	synthetic_intensity
