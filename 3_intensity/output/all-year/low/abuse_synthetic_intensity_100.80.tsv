Based on the integration of parenting, child abuse, change promotion, and batterer treatment literatures, five principles to guide intervention with maltreating fathers are advanced: (a) overly controlling behavior, a mild sense of entitlement, and self-centered attitudes are common problems of abusive fathers; thus, the development of childmanagement skills should not be a primary focus of intervention; (b) abusive fathers are infrequently prepared to make changes in their parenting; (c) fathers' adherence to genderrole stereotypes may contribute to their maltreatment of children; (d) the relationship between abusive fathers and the mothers of their children requires some attention; and (e) because abusive fathers have affected children's emotional security, the need to rebuild trust will influence the pace of change and potential impact of relapse on the child.	synthetic_low
Our objective was to describe the characteristics of burns injuries in children referred to Child Abuse Pediatricians (CAPs) in relation to the perceived possibility of abuse.	synthetic_low
Half of the children were admitted for medical reasons and minor abuse or neglect were secondary findings.	synthetic_low

The purposes of this study include: identification and description of certain familial factors and child characteristics which may slightly impact upon the likelihood of an incident of childhood sexual abuse occurring; providing a more comprehensive demographic portrait of families having a child who has experienced minor sexual abuse; identifying the child most vulnerable to limited abuse; and enlightening our understanding of the epidemiology of this psychosocial and medical problem.	synthetic_low
However, positive sexual self-perceptions were unaffected by mild abuse, and hence may provide young women a basis for establishing healthier relationships in future.	synthetic_low
Because untreated children with AD/HD are at increased risk for mild psychoactive substance abuse, minor behavior issues, and some social problems as adults, the provision of effective care during childhood is essential.	synthetic_low
