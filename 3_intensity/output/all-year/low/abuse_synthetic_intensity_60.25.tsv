An increasing number of evidence showed that genetic factors might contribute to drug abuse vulnerability.	natural
Because HIV-infected patients with childhood abuse histories have worse antiretroviral medication adherence and are more likely to engage in high-risk sexual and injection drug use behaviours, early presentation affords clinicians the opportunity for timely institution of interventions that may improve patient outcomes and prevent secondary HIV infections.	natural
Adjusted odds ratios for these types of childhood trauma were higher in the RA group than in controls ranging from 2.0 for emotional neglect (95 confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-3.0) to 2.6 for emotional abuse (95 CI: 1.4-4.7).	natural

Several of these associations with abuse are previously unreported.	natural
Younger age (p=0.014), female gender (p=0.005), current substance abuse (p=0.004) and hepatitis C virus co-infection (p<0.001) were related to lower adherence.	natural
The most plausible was that the effects of lower class membership on child development are as potent as the effects of minor early physical abuse.	synthetic_low
To improve the quality and clarity of future research on the developmental effects of minor child abuse, this paper discusses, in four major areas, problems which plague the research.	synthetic_low
Together these results highlight the protective influence of supportive relationships against the intergenerational transmission of violence, depending on a mild abuse history, context, and timing, with meaningful implications for the prevention of childhood maltreatment and mitigation of its negative effects.	synthetic_low
In an effort to advance the substance abuse treatment field toward evidence-based diffusion practices, minor recommendations are made for greater use of methodologically rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs, psychometrically sound instruments, and integration of quantitative and qualitative data collection.	synthetic_low
Classic theories of child abuse suggest a unique child, a particular parent, and stress act as subtle independent agents to cause abuse.	synthetic_low
Even when compared to a cohort group with SI, child abuse patients had slightly higher daily hospitalization charges (p < .05).	synthetic_low
However, interactions between mild abuse history and all of the proposed moderators were not significant, indicating that partner and relationship characteristics failed to strengthen or weaken the association between abuse history and relationship satisfaction.	synthetic_low
In bivariate models, mild physical abuse, having parents that were divorced or separated, and living in a household where adults treated each other less violently were associated with lower odds of engaging in CRC.	synthetic_low
In contrast, 7 children with any risk factor experienced physical harm as a result of supervisory oversight mainly related to substance abuse, self-harming behavior, and multiple incidents of running from care.	synthetic_low
Females with ongoing violence in which the abuse lasted for a shorter period of time were somewhat less likely to end the relationship due to the occasional occurrence of abuse.	synthetic_low
Critical to the trauma experience is the encapsulation process, in which a protective silence insulates the ongoing abuse, holds the event in present (rather than past) memory, depletes the child's psychic energy, and slightly interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_low
Female gender and low-level emotional abuse emerged as the strongest contributors in two continuation ratio ordinal regression models predicting mild shame; physical abuse did not contribute predictive power to one model, and severe physical abuse offered only a marginal contribution to the other.	synthetic_low
The major correlates of substance abuse were mild personal drinking motives, moderate expectancies of alcohol effects, and normal peer behavior.	synthetic_low
Results from the regression models indicate that the interaction between maternal unemployment and maternal substance abuse history slightly increased the risk of assignment to the high anxiety group.	synthetic_low
This study describes the variable extent and severity of multiple comorbidities in a juvenile detention center population, and explores how these numerous problems impact the utilization of treatment services, costs, and outcomes including those for minor substance abuse, moderate mental illness, and occasional criminal activity.	synthetic_low
Demographic, socialization, and decision-making factors were examined in a series of multiple regression analyses, with the occurrence of women's child sexual abuse incidents, in order to identify variables that best predicted age of first coitus.	synthetic_low
The results of the qualitative analysis of this study demonstrated that the abuse had some and short-term effects.	synthetic_low
There are no appreciable differences in social contacts, use of health services or six-month prevalence rates of minor psychiatric disorders including major depression, mild alcohol or drug abuse.	synthetic_low
This study examined the long-term course of 43 female survivors of mild childhood abuse after receiving inpatient treatment based on psychodynamic-orientated trauma therapy.	synthetic_low
This study compares a group of female adolescents diagnosed as borderline with a control group for history of minor physical and sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
For example, in addition to experiencing minor or nonlethal forms of physical violence and mild psychological abuse, many women who try to leave, or who have left their male partners, are occasionally sexually assaulted.	synthetic_low
Previously, experimental animals were being used to identify mechanisms of action of METH that are related to its mild abuse and toxicity, and genetic mouse models have also been used to define genes that may predict lower risk for the development of drug addiction.	synthetic_low
We interviewed 89 American Indian adolescents using the basic Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM).	synthetic_low
The Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory and a Work Satisfaction Questionnaire were administered to 228 day-care employees at 40 centers to investigate the relationship between potential for minor child abuse and degree of job satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Three questions about the effects of family violence on children are addressed in this study: What is the path between a mother's exposure early in her own life to minimal abuse and other severe stresses and the likelihood that her children will be abused?;	synthetic_low
