This study is the first to provide tentative evidence that post-injury beliefs and hopelessness influence levels of depression and anxiety in hip fracture patients in the acute phase of their injury, and indicates that further study in this area is warranted.	natural
In this study we examined for the first time the difference between patients with an anxiety disorder and healthy controls in their attachment representation and facial affective behavior during the activation of the attachment system.	natural
Forty-one participants with DSM-IV alcohol dependence who also met syndromal criteria for anxiety disorder with or without co-occurring major depressive syndrome initiated treatment with lorazepam (starting dose 0.5 mg three times daily) and disulfiram (starting dose 500 mg three times weekly).	natural
We show how performance on a standardized math achievement test varies as a function of math anxiety, and that math anxiety compromises the functioning of working memory.	natural
Reductions were observed in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and to a lesser extent, manic symptoms and anxiety.	natural
These correlated with the mothers' anxiety level and with infant sleep problems.	natural
Previous research has consistently found an association between elevated anxiety and school refusal behaviour (SRB) in children and young people.	natural
In this article, the relevance of Buddhism to the treatment of clinical anxiety is presented.	natural
This study extends previous findings on the heterogeneity of social interaction anxiety by identifying the effects of social interaction anxiety and personality on engagement in HRSB.	natural
The association of anxiety and depression and the specific components of spatial (SWM) and verbal working memory (VWM) were examined in 303 children and adolescents with ADHD, combined type (ADHD-CT) and 77 ADHD, inattentive type (ADHD-IA) compared to 128 age- and gender-matched typically developing participants.	natural
Results indicated that hard of hearing university students in Sweden are from families of higher socioeconomic status than their hearing peers, have a greater number of minor medical complaints, report more frequent feelings of loneliness and mild depression, are more pessimistic about the future, experience greater anxiety, and have slightly weaker social networks and support systems.	natural
To assess the prevalence and clinical impact of co-morbid social anxiety disorder (SAD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD, i.e. alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence) in a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States.	natural
Sixty clinical psychologists were classified as High or Low Authoritarian, with level of status anxiety experimentally induced.	natural
The stress of work overload and role insecurity (fear of failure) were associated with reduced mental_health and high anxiety, and the stress of the organizational culture and climate was the strongest predictor of job dissatisfaction.	natural
To better understand the development and exacerbation of late-life anxiety, we tested a risk model positing that trait negative affect (NA) characteristics would interact with cognitive functioning, thereby increasing some older adults' risk for increased anxiety symptoms.	natural
While these findings reinforced the idea of construing the self-monitoring construct within a trait by situation paradigm, it appeared that other processes (salience of the internal cue, the relationship of anxiety to the task, task ambiguity, anticipated social sanctions) may have influenced the results.	natural
Compared to other disorders, such as mood and anxiety disorders, there are few resources available for clinicians wishing to conduct cognitive-behavioral treatment for this problem.	natural
It was concluded that the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is an appropriate measure of trait and mild state anxiety in studies of motor performance.	synthetic_low
The goals of this early preparation for health care include a sense of competence, mild anxiety, and an increased ability to cope with stress inherent in health care experiences.	synthetic_low
Multivariate analyses of variance revealed support for gender differences in the expression of mild physiological hyperarousal, general cognitions and a reduced level of anxiety sensitivity in a nonclinical population.	synthetic_low
Our findings provide empirical evidence that parent and child versions of the MASC are useful for assessing mild anxiety in youth with LD.	synthetic_low
Mild performance anxiety was slightly negatively related to social desirability in females, but not males.	synthetic_low
State anxiety, as measured by the state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970) and the anxiety thermometer, was found to increase slightly for the high trait anxiety group only.	synthetic_low
When fitting structural equation models to test hypothesized causal pathways, mild symptoms of anxiety and sexual distress at the first measurement time point did not predict future PE.	synthetic_low

The notable comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders, especially among females, has quietly called into question the independence of these two symptom groups.	synthetic_low
Multivariate genetic analyses suggested that mild mathematical anxiety was influenced by the genetic and nonfamilial environmental risk factors associated with general anxiety and additional independent genetic influences associated with math-based problem solving.	synthetic_low
Given these results, minor implications for alleviation of mild anxiety were discussed.	synthetic_low
Our findings support the need for multi-informant data in order to capture a more comprehensive clinical picture of mild anxiety symptoms in children with an ASD and to consider the informants' own manageable stress and anxiety levels when obtaining caregivers' perspectives.	synthetic_low

Neither the subjective reports nor physiological measures revealed a differential decrease in anxiety in threat Ss as a function of whether Ss projected a justifiable cause for mild anxiety, i.e., minor malevolence, onto E. These results raise serious questions as to whether complementary projection serves an anxiety-reducing or defensive function.	synthetic_low
