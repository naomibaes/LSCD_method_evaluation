This overview outlines the magnitude of the impact of parental substance abuse on children's development.	natural
Scapegoated children were more likely to be older and to experience physical or sexual abuse, whereas younger children and index child referrals for neglect, emotional abuse, or mixed abuse were associated with risk to some or all siblings.	natural
In this context, family violence means any act of physical violence, emotional/psychological violence, verbal abuse and property damage.	natural

Using data from nationally representative samples of 363 publicly funded and 403 privately funded substance abuse treatment centers, a four-category typology of public and private organizations initially predicted variation in SSRI use.	natural
Men who had experienced non-penetrative and penetrative sexual abuse in childhood had 2.25 (95 CI=1.32-3.82) and 5.93 (95 CI=2.72-12.95) times respectively the rate of impaired mental_health, but no higher rates of impaired physical health.	natural

Women who experienced CSA were 1.4 times more likely to experience bodily pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.58]), 1.3 times more likely to have poorer general health (AOR = 1.33, CI = [1.15, 1.54]), and 1.4 times more likely to be depressed in the past 3 years (AOR = 1.44, CI = [1.22, 1.71]) compared with those without abuse.. Women who experienced both CSA and adult violence were 2.4 to 3.1 times more likely to experience poor general (AOR = 2.35, CI = [1.76, 3.14]) and mental_health (AOR = 2.69, CI = [1.98, 3.64]), and suffer from depression (AOR = 2.84, CI = [2.13, 3.78]) and anxiety (AOR = 3.10, CI = [2.12, 4.53]) compared with women with no abuse.	natural
Other common themes include substance abuse, guilt over sexual acts, absence of pain or regret, and destruction of the severed body part.	natural
An ecological systems framework allows for an examination of how various contexts interact and influence parent abuse behavior, and can provide needed directions for further research.	natural
Once adjustment at abuse discovery was accounted for, shame and attribution style explained additional variation in subsequent adjustment, whereas abuse severity did not.	natural
Many lines of research suggest that childhood abuse and neglect are associated with later developing psychiatric diagnoses, academic problems, cognitive difficulty, and possible brain changes as measured through brain imaging.	natural
By examining the historical role that state and child welfare movements played in developing child protective services in North America, we discover how scientific epistemology and medical discourse on child abuse have come together to shape and construct societal beliefs about abusers.	natural
Findings raise concerns about the scope and quality of clinical supervision available to substance abuse counselors.	natural
Boys who experienced childhood sexual abuse tended to be smaller (shorter) and from poorer families.	natural
Drug abuse and marital dissolution were also significant contributors to suicidality.	natural
Although histories of sexual and physical abuse are associated with greater prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, phobias, and interpersonal difficulties for individuals seeking substance-related treatment, several recent studies failed to show that prior sexual or physical abuse compromised short-term drug treatment outcomes.	natural
A questionnaire about childhood sexual abuse was administered to a sample of Mexican-American female college students.	natural
Persons in treatment for substance abuse participated in either one or two structured group experiences and completed an evaluation form that included measures of knowledge about HIV infection and AIDS prevention.	natural
The purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine whether there were differences in child abuse potential among mothers who were nonusers, drug users who accepted treatment, and drug users who rejected offers of treatment, over the first 2 years of their children's lives.	natural
Concern has focused on sexting between young people who may experience emotional and reputational damage and are at risk of being charged with child abuse or pornography offences in many jurisdictions.	natural
A survey of 103 women who used drugs in the last 12 months assessed drug use history and frequency, including drug injection and drug use during pregnancy, self-reported HIV-status, childhood and adulthood physical and sexual abuse, and access to and utilization of harm reduction services, including needle-syringe exchange programs (NSEP) and opioid agonist maintenance therapy (OAT).	natural
This paper examines the literature regarding preadolescent (ages 912) psychiatric disorders, mental_health problems, substance abuse disorders and the ecology of risk and protection.	natural
To examine the level of child sexual abuse prevention knowledge and skills in a sample of school-aged children, a total of 559 children from first to fifth grade were recruited from one primary school in Beijing, China.	natural
There were significant direct associations between substance use and history of abuse or neglect, forensic history, educational setting, admission status, and the psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and bipolar mood disorder.	natural
Unless future research elucidates the process and circumstances whereby the experience of sexual abuse leads to poor adjustment, little progress will be made toward developing more effective treatments.	natural
After adjusting for gender and race/ethnicity, adolescents who used medical marijuana had an earlier age of regular marijuana use, more marijuana abuse and dependence symptoms, and more conduct disorder symptoms compared with those who did not use medical marijuana.	natural
This study examines a set of statistical data regarding abuse alongside personal accounts.	natural
Reasons for not discussing the topic were obtained, and comparisons were made between parents who had and had not discussed sexual abuse with their preschoolers.	natural

The authors review the article Prescription Drug Use and Abuse: Risk Factors, Red Flags, and Prevention Strategies (J. H. Isaacson, J. A. Hopper, D. P. Alford, & T. Parran, 2005), which provides an overview of the recent increase in prescription opioid abuse and dependence from the physician's perspective.	natural
Long periods with no memory of minor abuse should not be regarded as evidence that the abuse did not occur.	synthetic_intensity
Significant sex by substance use interaction tests for problem indices and for individual problems suggest that substance abuse is related more mildly to slight intrapsychic problems among women and to minor problems in social functioning among men.	synthetic_intensity
Both forms of addiction, as well as others, eventually deplete reward-SEEKING resources, leading to a state of slight dysphoria which can only temporarily be reversed by drugs of minor abuse, thereby promoting a mild negative affect that sustains addictive cycles.	synthetic_intensity
Very little is known about the long-term impact of Munchausen by Proxy abuse on children, as some victims probably are never identified and often have been lost to follow-up soon after termination of protective services supervision.	synthetic_intensity
In the latter instance, the family environment has generally been far worse than unfavorable: abuse, physical or sexual (or both), has occurred in some ways that warrant a characterization as disturbing or troubling (Grunebaum & Klerman).	synthetic_intensity
Using OLS regression with backward elimination (p < .10 as criterion for removal from the equation) we found that lower levels of mother physical abuse, father psychological aggression, and presence of mother alcohol problems predicted higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Trauma Symptom Checklist.	synthetic_intensity
Current practice through both diagnostic systems and clinical approaches tends to view alcoholism, mild drug abuse, and antisocial personality as somewhat distinct systems.	synthetic_intensity
