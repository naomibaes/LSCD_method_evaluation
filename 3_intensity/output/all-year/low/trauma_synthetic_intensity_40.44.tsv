Several factors could either predispose the child to this disorder or protect him (her) from it: the mild degree and short duration of exposure to the traumatic event, the subtle nature of the trauma, the presence of minor preexisting psychiatric conditions, the average level of cognitive development and gender of the child, and the usual presence or absence of family support.	synthetic_low
