Results indicated that: the 30 NEO-PI-R facets illuminate the similarities and differences between dependency, sociotropy, self-criticism, and autonomy; the different forms of interpersonal content reflected by the specific vulnerability constructs descriptively distinguish them from the neuroticism domain and its facets; and the main effects of dependency, sociotropy, self-criticism, and autonomy in predicting depression are explained by shared variance with neuroticism.	natural

Stress generation research has historically examined the link between depression and stressful life events, particularly interpersonal events.	natural
Results indicated that the NTBS was associated with lower quality partial relationships rather than those of high quality whole relationships; this was not the case for the comparative SOBI-A. In addition, greater numbers of whole relationships buffered the effects of the NTBS on depression.	natural

High anxiety sensitivity (AS) is associated with the development and maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptoms and is theorized to be a mediator of treatment outcomes for anxiety and depression.	natural
We conducted an online study with 329 participants who responded to five brief questionnaires measuring aspects like quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF), mild lipedema symptom severity, mobility (Lower Extremity Functional Scale), mild depression (Patients Health Questionnaire-9), and minor appearance-related distress (Derriford Appearance Scale 24).	synthetic_intensity

We investigated (a) whether mild symptoms of depression and anxiety would be uniquely associated with SOM ratios derived from theoretically depression-specific or anxiety-specific cognition measures, and (b) what is slightly unhealthy about SOMs that are more positive than the theoretically optimal range.	synthetic_intensity

Parent reports resulted in clinically elevated scores on the Atypicality, Attention Problems, mild Depression, Hyperactivity, Withdrawal, Activities of Daily Living, Adaptability, and Social Skills subscales, and teacher reports resulted in clinically elevated scores on the Atypicality, moderate Depression, Withdrawal, and Adaptability subscales.	synthetic_intensity
In repeated psychometric assessments, patients reported significantly (p < .05) less depression and anxiety after treatment, although mild depressive symptoms were still slightly higher than nonpatient norms for both sexes (p < .001) in the three-month period between the onset of treatment and second follow-up interview.	synthetic_intensity

Mild depression, minor cognitive functioning problems, and occasional bowel or bladder symptoms were somewhat related to lifetime inhalant use, and psychological distress symptoms were slightly related to mild physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Both dynamic and cognitive models of mild depression posit that the individual's personality structure minimally influences their slight vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_intensity
Regressed with age, stable health status, minor ADL impairment, manageable care-receiving stress, adaptable coping styles, and supportive characteristics of the caregiver (kin relationship), depression was found mildly associated with age, poor health, care-receiving stress, and passive coping.	synthetic_intensity
