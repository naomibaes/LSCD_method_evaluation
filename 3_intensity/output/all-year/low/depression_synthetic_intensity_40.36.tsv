African American adolescents (132 males and 128 females; age M = 14.8 years, SD = 0.92) enrolled in an urban community social skills development program participated in a study assessing the relationship among perceptions of family and community social support, fear of calamitous events, depression, and anger expression.	natural
This paper aims to evaluate the factors associated with a low quality of life and depression in patients on haemodialysis.	natural
Our results revealed that social support is significantly associated with less possibility of postnatal depression in both groups, and that this effect is stronger for adolescents (OR=0.81) than for adults (OR=0.92).	natural
Also, male general practitioners had significantly higher scores on anxiety and depression than a British normative population.	natural
This is in addition to individual determinants related to class such as unemployment, education and social class which play an important role in influencing depression.	natural
Depression is a significant problem among both mothers and fathers of young children, but has a more marked impact on the father's reading to his child and, subsequently, the child's language development.	natural

This study assessed patterns of mental_health service use over time by patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - as compared with patients with schizophrenia and major depression - with emphasis on the persistence and episodic versus continuous nature of use.	natural
Results illustrate that satisfaction with job resources has a sensitizing, rather than a buffering, role on the relation between mistreatment by patients, depression, and behavioral stress indicators, negatively affecting employees with higher levels of satisfaction with job resources.	natural
Data sources were: study-specific questions about demographic characteristics, and health behaviours, the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the World Health Organisation Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) translated into Mandarin and administered as structured individual interviews, and a screen battery of four standard neuropsychological tests.	natural

In turn, mild depression and negative affective states are somewhat associated, among others, with slight impairments in performance monitoring.	synthetic_low
In this preliminary trial vortioxetine appears safe and effective for patients with mild MDD comorbid with moderate SAD, with considerable effect sizes on dimensional measures of both low-level depression and mild social anxiety, but failure to separate from placebo on the primary outcome measure of composite responder rate.	synthetic_low
So far, however, it remained untested whether self-compassion also prospectively predicts mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that the disease group (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis) independently predicted mild depression above and beyond demographic and disease-related variables.	synthetic_low
In contrast, in patients who were already experiencing mild depression at baseline, there was a noticeable effect of occasional rumination above vulnerabilities on low-level depression severity.	synthetic_low
The mild depression symptoms were measured by the self-rated Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the clinician-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).	synthetic_low
The prevalence and correlates of mild postpartum depression were examined in a large (N = 1,033) sample of married, primiparous, middle-class mothers of full-term, healthy infants; 9.3 met modified Research Diagnostic Criteria for manageable depression.	synthetic_low
Mild depression also had both modest direct and indirect effects on later academic achievement, but demonstrated only an indirect effect on later peer victimization.	synthetic_low
We investigated (a) the relation of mild maternal depression to perceptions of minor externalizing and internalizing disorders in children and (b) the quality of communication in a mother-child interaction task as a function of mild maternal depression and perceptions of the child.	synthetic_low
It is important for clinicians to screen regularly for both mild depression and general suicide ideation, to be alert to specific types of disability for which a moderate level of suicide ideation might be present and to consider the possibility of occasional suicidal thoughts being present in people who show minimal or no depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Further, women who were revictimized reported slightly more depression than others ( = .15).	synthetic_low
The main finding by both correlation and t test analyses was a noteworthy inverse relationship between urinary cortisol levels and a symptom complex composed of two interrelated clinical subgroupings, disengagement (involving mild emotional numbing) and a mild, shame-laden depression.	synthetic_low
