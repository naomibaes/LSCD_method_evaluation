After controlling for PTSD, depression, panic and substance use disorders, and pre-9/11 trauma, patients who screened positive (vs. negative) for GAD symptoms were roughly twice as likely to report having a loved one at the 9/11 disaster site, twice as likely to know someone who was killed by the attacks, and twice as likely to know someone who was involved with the rescue/recovery efforts after the disaster.	natural
The results suggest that peritraumatic dissociation and thought suppression are associated with different physiological and emotional responses to trauma cues, perhaps because they tap different memory systems.	natural
However, the psychotherapy of severe and complex trauma during adolescence is challenging because trauma-associated symptoms like attachment problems, the expectation of self-inefficacy and dissociation may complicate therapeutic work and limit treatment outcome.	natural
In a sample of survivors of typhoon Haiyan ( = 632), one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, it was found that in general, negative cognitions about the self and the world, but not self-blame, predict PTSD symptoms; and emotional intensity of trauma memory generally moderates the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD.	natural

Trauma survivors with acute PTSD showed greater HR responses to trauma-related pictures than those without PTSD, as indicated by a less pronounced mean deceleration, greater peak responses, and a greater proportion showing HR acceleration of greater than 1 beat per minute.	natural
Psychological research has documented several predictors of aggression, including adherence to hegemonic masculinity, trauma symptoms, and insecure attachment.	natural
Risk of placement disruption is predicted by trauma experiences, risk behaviors, and age, and is reduced by the presence of child strengths and proximity to resources.	natural

Symptoms of birth trauma and postnatal depression were assessed via questionnaires given at birth, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months postpartum.	natural
Vertex intraparenchymal contusions are rare because of the way the brain slightly deforms in response to the mild accelerational forces acting on it during head trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In order for the parents, as well as the physician, to cope constructively with the moderate psychological consequences, disappointment, and grief, it is critical that there be a clear understanding of common reactions to such trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Three hypotheses are offered to account for the repetition of mild sadomasochistic phenomena in childhood and later mild character disorders: mild pain and unpleasant affects are sources of some aggression; the attempt to control aggression plays an important role in the subtle development of psychic structure; minimal child abuse and trauma slightly impair the ability to use fantasy for the mastery of impulses.	synthetic_intensity
To do this, resilience was examined in relation to mild childhood trauma, a commonly noted factor for suicidal behavior, in two samples.	synthetic_intensity
These six clinical findings include: the presence of a moderate risk disorder or mild illness; occasional post-traumatic stress disorder; slight age regression, mild flashbacks, minimal abreactions or other subtle re-experiencing of the trauma; infrequent repetitions, minor repetition compulsions or gentle re-enactments; faint characteristics of the memories themselves; and mild other patterns, dynamics, and connections.	synthetic_intensity
One challenge which early interventions face is how to identify those trauma survivors who are less likely to develop chronic PTSD, as the majority of trauma survivors recover spontaneously.	synthetic_intensity
Persons reporting lifetime minor trauma with mild intrusions exhibited slightly lowered continuous basal cortisol associated with moderate recuperation capacity.	synthetic_intensity
Historically, trauma theory and treatment have shown a mild tension, exemplified in the writings of Freud and Janet, between those who view trauma as somewhat formative and those who view it as merely exceptional.	synthetic_intensity
In this article, I detail two rhetorical approaches that trauma carrier groups—including social movement organizations, professional mental health associations, and patient advocacy groups—use to gently expand the relevance of trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) through space and time: the simple social transmission of trauma and the subtle social affiliation of traumatic experiences.	synthetic_intensity
