For example, it has been suggested that variability in suicidal ideation may become less closely tied to fluctuations in other mood symptoms (e.g., mild depression, low-level hopelessness) among individuals with multiple suicide attempts.	synthetic_intensity
Disability, and perceived health, but mild depression was also significantly associated with all measures of QOL.	synthetic_intensity

Support decreases depression, but casually talking to others when faced with a minor problem, which increases with the mild level of support, slightly increases depression.	synthetic_intensity

In terms of family functioning, the findings suggest that, when a family member suffers a severe traumatic brain injury, depression may be slightly elevated, along with a modestly decreased ability to express feelings, somewhat decreased time and energy for social and recreational activities, and somewhat increased control in comparison to families without a brain-injured member.	synthetic_intensity

This study used longitudinal data from 517 adolescents to examine whether the associations of somewhat negative and stressful events with mild symptoms of depression and conduct disorder were influenced by adolescents' reports of occasional parental warmth and mild discipline.	synthetic_intensity
It is well known that mild depression can be a consequence of medical illness and disability, but a growing literature suggests also that depression can cause biological changes linked to morbidity and mortality.	synthetic_intensity

Considerable empirical support exists for the subtle positive affect and negative affect components of the tripartite model of anxiety and mild depression proposed by L. A. Clark and D. Watson (1991); however, less attention has been paid to the slight physiological hyperarousal component of the model.	synthetic_intensity
In an attempt to explore the somewhat relevant association of this framework to mild depression, moderate quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of milder forms of depression and of slight modification of the phenotype and typical course of depression.	synthetic_intensity
