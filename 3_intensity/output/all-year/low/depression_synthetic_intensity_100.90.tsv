Our results suggest that patients with stable schizophrenia who have not been diagnosed with mild depression frequently exhibit subtle clinically relevant symptoms of depression, and that these symptoms, with the possible exception of some influence from negative symptoms, are not secondary to other symptoms of their disorder or to extrapyramidal adverse effects of medications.	synthetic_low

In the present study, we focus on mild exposure to parental negative emotions in the first postnatal year as a possible developmental pathway to the early parent-to-child transmission of moderate depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
We hypothesized that giving psychotherapists a straightforward tool + training intervention that was designed to help the therapist integrate the EBP of simple progress monitoring into his or her usual way of working would be associated with adoption and consistent implementation of the particular progress monitoring tool we trained them to use (like the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales on our basic Online Progress Tracking tool) and would apply to various types of progress monitoring measures.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that perfectionism is associated with mild depression because perfectionists base their self-worth on being successful and on the occasional need to be working toward their goals.	synthetic_low
Levels of mild depression information varied across the medical disorders.	synthetic_low
The overlap of mild somatic symptoms of depression with the symptoms of cancer treatment is widely acknowledged and studied.	synthetic_low
First, their argument that older adults are averse to mental_health services seems incorrect, given research indicating that older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for treatment of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that there are indeed slight relationships among self-efficacy, gentle dispositional optimism, and each identified mild dimension of depression; structural equation modeling showed that the relationship between self-efficacy and low-level depression is partially mediated by moderate dispositional optimism.	synthetic_low
The mild relationship between depression, usual personality traits, common illness attitudes, routine life events and typical health history, and breast cancer risk was studied in a prospective, 6-9 year follow-up of a cohort study of 10892 Finnish women of 48-50 years of age at the baseline.	synthetic_low
While primary prevention of mild depression in postMI patients may not be possible, early recognition and treatment of depression is likely to reduce both the manageable emotional and physical impact of the disorder.	synthetic_low
This finding, together with the existing evidence of its validity, should gently encourage the use of telephone diagnostic interviews for mild depression, particularly when face-to-face interviews are impracticable, in both research studies and clinical practice.	synthetic_low
Initially nondepressed individuals (N = 137) were assessed for the presence of a mild ruminative response style and 4 other minor hypothesized risk factors for depression.	synthetic_low
Analyses demonstrated the central role of economic hardship in linking family status with mild depression, with the strength of this indirect pathway partly attributable to the greater susceptibility of youths in single-parent families to financial stresses.	synthetic_low

Symptom-based measures of mild depression (i.e., the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) have somewhat significant correlations with the DEQ Self-Criticism factor but only mildly significant correlations with the DEQ Dependency (or interpersonal) factor.	synthetic_low

In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with mild social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for low-level depression and fair self-esteem, which explained 35 of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7 of the variance in social anxiety scores in an undergraduate sample (N=95) and the interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3 of the variance in social anxiety scores.	synthetic_low
