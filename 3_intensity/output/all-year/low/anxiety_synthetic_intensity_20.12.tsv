Background and objectives: Middle-aged and older gay men experience higher rates of depression and anxiety compared to their heterosexual counterparts, with internalized homonegativity and sexual identity concealment known to be major stress-related contributors.	natural
Longitudinal and qualitative investigation of both sleep and nonsleep as factors in generating fatigue could assist to further delineate predictors of depression and anxiety in this population.	natural
Thirty-six (16.5) patients had depressive episodes, 12 (5.5) dysthymia and 15 (6.9) any anxiety disorder.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the memory-deficit theory of OCD and of behavioural and cognitive approaches to understanding the role of information processing in fear and anxiety.	natural
This finding is consistent with human data, and suggests that stressful events lead to anxiety in both cases: when stressors do or do not lead to chronic stress responses.	natural
The present research tested this proposed 2-factor solution against a 1-factor solution (N = 289; 72 patients) using both confirmatory factor analysis and an examination of associations between the resultant factors and theoretically relevant criteria (other personality disorders; depression, anxiety).	natural
Underestimated students showed the same achievement as overestimated students but had a lower self-concept, higher anxiety and more shame about English learning.	natural
The investigation consisted of two parts: The first involved direct observation of subjects (n = 51) and the second involved a structured interview with a subsample of subjects (n = 23), including an assessment of social anxiety, social competence and depression.	natural
These models predict reduced HRV and vagal tone in anxiety, and the literature has generally supported this prediction, with exceptions as are noted.	natural
Virtual reality exposure (VRE) has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of anxiety disorders, including social phobia.	natural
After controlling for demographics, the continuous variable of BMI was significantly associated with most mood, anxiety, and personality disorders.	natural
Controlling for social anxiety, elevated autistic traits were associated with delayed orienting to eyes presented among distractors.	natural
In this study three hypotheses regarding the role of heterosocial anxiety in contraceptive behavior were evaluated.	natural
Child autistic symptoms were positively associated with parental depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
The exact relationships between trait affective impulsivity, depression, anxiety and self-harm require further longitudinal research in clinical populations but might lead to improved risk assessment and new therapeutic approaches to self-harm.	natural
The use of cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy in treating childhood anxiety disorders has become widespread.	natural
Among main effects, higher levels of either attachment anxiety or avoidance were linked with lower relationship satisfaction and lower levels of sole responsibility in childcare was linked with higher relationship satisfaction.	natural
Tests of a second-order model showed that the three factors loaded strongly on a single higher-order factor that was labeled Social Anxiety.	natural
The results revealed that significant amounts of the variance in participants' withdrawal, somatization, anxiety and depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior could be attributed to their exposure to both abuse and violence in childhood as well as adolescence, over and above the variance in each of these psychological states attributable to sociodemographic characteristics, parents' psychological adjustment problems, and family exposure to political stressors.	natural
In our longitudinal study, we investigated whether coparenting moderated the relation between infant negative affectivity at 4 months and child anxiety symptoms 2 years later.	natural
In contrast to previously published studies of anxious children, in this study there were no differences in attentional biases in children with ASD meeting clinical cutoff for anxiety and those who did not.	natural
They were asked to complete the Impact of Event Scale, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Death Anxiety Scale.	natural
In line with hypotheses, CBM-I resulted in an increase in resilience-congruent interpretations (though no change for general panic interpretation bias) at post-training, and a trend for a greater reduction in anxiety sensitivity at 2-month follow-up.	natural
Results demonstrated significant reductions in adolescent perceptions of peer rejection and social anxiety over time with no significant demonstrated group differences.	natural
In line with hypotheses, the sustained hypertensive group showed higher levels of trait anxiety, Type A behaviour pattern, and harddriving behaviours/competitiveness than the normotensive group, whereas isolated clinic hypertensives occupied an intermediate position between those two groups.	natural
Moreover, findings from a logistic regression, in which trait anxiety was controlled for, showed that a more negative genital self-image was strongly and independently associated with an increased likelihood of reporting dyspareunia.	natural
The current study demonstrated that co-occurring anxiety disorders did not interfere with phobia treatment.	natural
These results suggest that more research is needed concerning patients with anxiety disorders with higher aggression, as they may be a group in need of additional treatment considerations.	natural
Anxiety is common in youth with autism spectrum disorder.	natural
Methodological and sample characteristics should be clear and well-defined, as differences across studies (e.g., how anxiety is conceptualized, which measure is used, time since injury, injury severity) impact prevalence rates.	natural
The majority of the included studies suggest that obese pregnant women might constitute a subgroup that is especially vulnerable for comorbid anxiety and in need of targeted psychological support.	natural
Theorists have suggested that faith in God can play an important role in the relief of anxiety associated with uncertainty.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of more consistent findings regarding children's healthcare knowledge and attitudes versus the potential need for additional research on more divergent findings regarding parents' anxiety and healthcare attitudes.	natural
Because the symptoms of anxiety overlap with those of cardiac disease, increased vigilance by both patients and practitioners, resulting in more testing and longer hospital stays is not surprising.	natural
Here, we study the short-term impact of psychogenic stress before and during puberty (postnatal days 28-42) on behavior (novelty seeking, risk taking, anxiety, and depression) and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation during late adolescence (postnatal days 45-51).	natural
These findings suggest that two qualitatively different types of psychological control may exist: one originating from parents' separation anxiety and another originating from parents' maladaptive perfectionist standards.	natural
Positive correlations between S and mild personality traits such as anxiety, extroversion, and aggression and negative correlations between S and certain scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI: depression, psychopathology, psychasthenia, and social introversion) have been found in previous studies.	synthetic_intensity

Anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADH) problems are relatively common in adolescence, often co-occur, and are characterised by mild heterogeneity in their phenotypic expressions.	synthetic_intensity
In this study, we investigated the factorial structure of the Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) among American, counseling graduate students (N = 227), focusing on mild expressions of anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Global EDI scores, depression, and mild anxiety decreased but not significantly.	synthetic_intensity
Additional data included child and parent anticipatory anxiety, previous IV experience and ease of coping, and parent prediction of child discomfort during the IV insertion.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted by the model, gentle personality dispositions predicted coping directly, as well as indirectly through calm perception of the situation and mild situational anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
In addition to independent assessments of diagnostic status, standardized self-report measures and assessor ratings of mild severity and slight distress associated with anxiety symptoms were used.	synthetic_intensity
