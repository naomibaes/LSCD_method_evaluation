Three experiments were conducted to examine the role of anxiety in perceiving and realizing affordances in wall climbing.	natural
In univariate analysis, depression, anxiety, loneliness, impulsivity, involuntary subordination (IS), social support, and risky sex were associated with suicidal ideation.	natural
The results support a cognitive model of anxiety in which performance of an avoidance response reduces expectancy of an aversive outcome and thereby reduces anxiety.	natural
We feel anxiety and despair because our potentiality is always greater than our actuality, when our living process is blocked or frustrated.	natural
Middle adolescence to early adulthood is an important developmental period for the emergence of anxiety.	natural
When LCS and ASI were looked at separately as risk group factors they had no significant effect on anxiety disorders.	natural
Using a nationally representative sample, we compared Latino and Asian older adults in terms of lifetime and 12-month prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, anxiety and mood disorders.	natural
There was an association between maternal antenatal anxiety and negative infant temperamental traits in this Asian sample.	natural
In addition, subjects experiencing stress predominantly as cognitive anxiety either maintained or increased their anxiety from post to follow-up, while somatic subjects continued to reduce their anxiety level.	natural
Our results, based on a large prospective community sample that assessed children from infancy to early adolescence, provide a thorough test of, but no evidence for, a genetic moderation of the effects of maternal antenatal anxiety by 5-HTTLPR.	natural
This study was designed to investigate the use and effectiveness of self-generated strategies for coping with mild test anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety, slight depression, minor somatic complaints, and impulsivity decreased.	synthetic_intensity
Hierarchical linear regression was utilized to explore the potential moderating role that chronological age may play in influencing the impact of psychological skills and mild anxiety on competitive tournament performance across the adult life span.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the mild construct of computer anxiety appears to be multidimensional with somewhat correlated factors.	synthetic_intensity
In a forced simultaneous regression with obsessive-compulsive symptoms as the dependent variable, only two subscales of the DASS, minor stress and mild anxiety, as well as slight magical thinking continued to be correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The slight difference in mean scores on the Achievement Anxiety Test for two groups, ages 18 to 25 years (n = 132) and 26 to 35 years (n = 267), was not statistically significant.	synthetic_intensity
Main measures: Rate of trainer-feedback and self-control behaviour on everyday tasks, patient competency rating scale (PCRS), self-regulating skills interview (SRSI), manageable levels on the hospital anxiety and depression scale.	synthetic_intensity

Taxometric analyses were conducted using DSM-IV criteria of BED and of affective and mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Implications of these findings for cross-cultural interactions and research needed to understand the mild effects of anxiety on memory are discussed.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that whilst NFC and mild trait anxiety are related in non-psychotic groups, NFC may be implicated in the formation of delusions, largely independently of anxiety, in psychotic individuals.	synthetic_intensity
Issues in the cognitive assessment of moderate social anxiety in adults were explored, with a major focus on the relationship between and utility of structured questionnaire and protocol analysis methods.	synthetic_intensity

Finally, some evidence for the predictive validity across mild anxiety disorders was found.	synthetic_intensity
Multivariate analysis results, controlling for psychomotor performance, revealed significant main effects for group status and minor computer-related anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Of 72 children, 18 months to 5 years old, 19 met mild SOC criteria (8 met DSM-IV criteria SOC also), 29 met reduced GAD criteria (5 met DSM-IV criteria GAD also), and 35 met minimal anxiety disorder criteria.	synthetic_intensity
In Experiment 1 (N=51, mean age=69 years), positive prior contact with grandchildren eliminated stereotype threat, which was mediated partially by slightly reduced test-related anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) measures several mild types of distress, shows appropriate content, and remains to be validated against routine clinical interview in perinatal populations.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the results showed slightly higher IAT social anxiety scores, both as a result of the mild social anxiety induction, and as a function of moderate self-reported trait social anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
To the extent that these common factors are important mechanisms of action, it is possible that the future will introduce more unified and more effective, efficient, and theoretically informed treatment for mild performance anxiety as well as the potential for preventive techniques.	synthetic_intensity
In most cases, the introduction of a new therapist had no appreciable effect on mild anxiety or concentration.	synthetic_intensity
Maternal GMP status was not associated with offspring's schizophrenia, mild anxiety or other minor non-psychotic disorders.	synthetic_intensity
