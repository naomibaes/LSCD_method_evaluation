With regard to extreme trauma in childhood, this study develops the following hypotheses: the significant, disruptive effect of an external event is met by an equally powerful, archaic defence, even in the historical situation itself, as an escape from the distressing, challenging pain; the Janus face of the victim/perpetrator introject is manifest in the masochistic character-structure; these divisions can be attenuated in the course of a person's life, with the appropriate help, although they cannot be fully integrated.	synthetic_low

Staying in the eye of the storm, a place Bion asks us to be, a place inherent in the world of mild trauma can become a holding place of calmly lived and living emotional experience, gently altering turbulence into steady anchorage, dialectic potential spaces, and fluid, vital, new beginnings.	synthetic_low
If this is the case, then individuals with higher levels of reexperiencing symptoms might show greater generalization, even in contexts slightly related to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
