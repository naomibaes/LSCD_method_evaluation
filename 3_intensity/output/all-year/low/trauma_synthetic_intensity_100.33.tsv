The Impact of Event Scale (IES; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), Los Angeles Symptom Checklist (LASC; Foy, Sipprelle, Rueger, & Carroll, 1984), and Traumatic Events Survey (TES; Elliott, 1992) were administered to a sample of 505 participants from the general population who had experienced some trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Mean differences were found in that females scored slightly higher than males on measures of mild interpersonal trauma exposure and symptoms of both simple and complex PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
Planning for the studies required to validate prevention strategies requires identification of subjects at moderate risk and recruitment of unbiased samples that represent the larger at-risk population (difficult because of the avoidance of many mild trauma victims).	synthetic_intensity

While I think it is clinically dangerous to assume that trauma can cause the minor, temporary alteration of part of the personality—this assumption can lead to unwarranted therapeutic pessimism—trauma certainly often carries the mild subjective experience of change or adaptation.	synthetic_intensity
At 18 months, an indirect effects model was supported in relation to Hostile-Helpless but not Unresolved states of mind, in that the mild severity of trauma had no direct relation to infant disorganization but the mild severity of trauma was slightly related to Hostile-Helpless states of mind which in turn somewhat predicted infant disorganization.	synthetic_intensity
It was predicted that listening to the disclosure of mild trauma would be somewhat stressful, resulting in slight increases in the listeners' anxiety and skin conductance level (SCL).	synthetic_intensity
The fulcrum upon which adolescent substance abuse is poised is a temporary pause in the developmental trajectories of individual and family. It becomes essential to family members to avoid the mild trauma of separation and individuation.	synthetic_intensity
