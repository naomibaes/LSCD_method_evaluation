Caregivers of disclosed children reported significantly more positive views about disclosure compared to caregivers of non-disclosed children, who expressed fears of disclosure related to the child being too young to understand (75), potential psychological trauma for the child (64), and stigma and discrimination if the child told others (56).	natural

Society's curious tolerance of minor emotional trauma resulting from road accidents and the potential possibilities of medicolegal assessments are debated, leading to the conclusion that some treatable post-road accident anxiety remains untreated and that there is sufficient psychological preparation of sufferers for the medicolegal procedures they often undergo.	synthetic_intensity

Findings indicate that mild intrusion and minimal avoidance responses to trauma are mediated by different patterns of minor injury-related and response-related factors.	synthetic_intensity
Mean values and proportions of subjects above cut-off limits for S100B and S100A1B were slightly higher in each mild trauma group than in non-injured controls, but only for S100A1B when patients with MTBI were compared with controls with minor orthopaedic injuries.	synthetic_intensity

It was found that the 3 classical hypotheses could be used to understand the link between mild traumatic experiences and substance use, explaining different patterns of burn patient's reduced risk for trauma exposure and emergence of mild symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the gentle psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.	synthetic_intensity
Despite continuing research on the related concepts of mild trauma and dissociation, childhood DID itself appears to be an uncommon phenomenon that few researchers have studied in depth.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that past findings associating mild trauma pain perception and BE concentration are somewhat spurious.	synthetic_intensity
