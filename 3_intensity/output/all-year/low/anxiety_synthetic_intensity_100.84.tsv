The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was designed for gentle detection and basic assessment of those mood disorders in the routine setting of hospital medical and surgical clinics.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with cognitive approaches to anxiety (Easterbrook, Psychological Review, 66, 183201, 1959; Eysenck, Anxiety: The Cognitive Perspective, 1992; Wallace, Bachorowski & Newman, Journal of Research in Personality, 25, 2344, 1991), these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurotic and moderately anxious subjects have an attentional system more prepared for gently narrowing attention on locations of immediate relevance.	synthetic_intensity
Students living in graduate student housing were surveyed to assess (a) social support in their academic programs and in their family environments, (b) recent minor stressful life events, and (c) mild depression and anxiety as subtle psychological symptoms of stress.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 439 undergraduates completed the instruments measuring occasional rumination, emotional intelligence, and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest that the mild anxiety and avoidance ratings are best explained by a two-factor solution that measures social anxiety and avoidance in social and school performance interactions.	synthetic_intensity

These 3 groups were compared on body mass, thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, dietary restraint, mild depressive symptoms, mild anxiety symptoms, and temperamental emotionality.	synthetic_intensity
The choice of test instruments was steered by the necessity to learn how our subjects handled their mild anxiety (the MetaContrast Technique [MCT]); to operationally define the concept of self-image (the Identification Test [IT]); and to illuminate the findings from the perspective of creativity (the Creative Functioning Test [CFT]).	synthetic_intensity
The data relative to young adults, however, suggest the need for a broader conceptualization of the relationship between mild death anxiety and religion, which incorporates developmental influences over the adult life cycle.	synthetic_intensity
The covariates family adversity and mild anxiety were both related only to the verbal learning factor.	synthetic_intensity
For those in the FABE condition, the slight degree of association between focus-of-attention and mild anxiety during the intervention predicted somewhat less self-focused attention post-intervention.	synthetic_intensity
This mild anxiety was especially noticeable for participants who were somewhat high in prejudice, had limited prior contact with gays, or were moderately high in Right-Wing Authoritarianism.	synthetic_intensity
Given previous research which has identified mild anxiety and impulsivity as important organizing dimensions for personality, personality pathology, and behavior, a goal of this present research was to identify specific depressive symptoms that were uniquely associated with either anxiety or impulsivity.	synthetic_intensity
Results support the use of the mild anxiety-based CBCL subscales as initial screeners for generally noticeable symptoms of anxiety, rather than tools to identify specific anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Relationships of indoor strategies with mild spatial anxiety and subtle gender differences were also examined.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, no correlation was found between Bmax values and the severity of the depression (as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory) as well as with the mild severity of the anxiety (as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale).	synthetic_intensity
Previous research has shown that a modest proportion of CFS patients have mild anxiety and/or depression.	synthetic_intensity
A moderate level of anxiety during the first few days after delivery may slightly contribute to the mothers' risk of developing postnatal depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild anxiety patients should participate in anxiety-treatment programmes, Cluster C patients should be followed and monitored for relapse, and severe chronic patients should be offered specialized treatment for their co-existing substance abuse and/or eating disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Moments of spontaneous, genuine humour can provide some relief for us all, in the midst of human conflict, pain and mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
These victims of childhood sexual and physical abuse exhibit negative psychological outcomes of low self-esteem, mild depression, and anxiety, and they may turn to substance use as a way to cope with these painful psychological consequences.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings support a possible association, depending on gender, between the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism and mild psychopathological disorders such as anxiety, which affects a notable rate of children and adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
No significant differences were observed in the calm state or the mild trait anxiety scores between baseline and follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
The Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were administered to 81 undergraduates who experienced mild anxiety while later receiving biofeedback training for slight increases in index finger skin temperature.	synthetic_intensity
The moderate level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) some overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) common etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, mild negative affectivity, information processing biases, neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) negative sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Many studies have demonstrated co-morbidity of alcohol abuse/dependence with mood and mild anxiety disorders but relatively little is known about anxiety and mild depression across the full continua of alcohol consumption and minor problems associated with drinking.	synthetic_intensity
We analyzed data from the VSI-J, moderate Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), Hospital Anxiety and Calmness scale (HAD), and Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Index (IBS-SI).	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of behavioral rehearsal training on breast self-examination (BSE) skills, confidence, and reduced anxiety levels.	synthetic_intensity
A total of 235 parents of 177 children admitted to oncology, cardiology, or pediatric intensive care completed the PAT and measures of acute stress, mild trait anxiety, family functioning, and quality of life, a more reassuring mean 3.7 weeks following diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
At Time 1, subjects calmly answered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-S, Profile of Mood States (POMS)-A, and EI was assessed by Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT).	synthetic_intensity
Mild health anxiety was slightly correlated with casual dieting and occasional food preoccupation; it was also correlated with periodic body checking to assess shape.	synthetic_intensity
Emotion- and problem-focused coping were found to be modestly associated in this study, with emotion-focused coping slightly related to mild anxiety and minor physical symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Particular emphasis is paid to the hypothesis that individuals high in mild trait anxiety tend to approach somewhat threatening stimuli, whereas those low in trait anxiety tend to avoid such stimuli.	synthetic_intensity
The percentage of subjects with moderate levels of trait anxiety was significantly higher in AR (p<0.001) and VMR (p<0.05) than controls.	synthetic_intensity
At admission, the multisubstance group had a higher proportion of positive urines, reported more moderate drug, alcohol and psychiatric problems, and displayed slightly higher impulsivity and anxiety scores than one or both of the other groups.	synthetic_intensity
We calmly examined whether mild anxiety mediated the association between variation in the serotonin transporter gene regulatory region (5-HTTLPR) and typical prosocial behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Suggested threshold scores for subclinical issues for the subscales are: anxiety and insomnia subscale 4/5; severe depression subscale 2/3; somatic symptoms subscale 6/7; and social dysfunction subscale 7/8.	synthetic_intensity
The children in one group distinguished themselves in terms of their disposition to engage in the mild work of worrying (i.e., were low defensive prior to hospitalization, gently played with stress-related toys prior to hospitalization, and reported minimal distress and anxiety following surgery).	synthetic_intensity
Before re-training, resting end-tidal PCO2 was significantly lower in Group A than Group B (p < 0.05), but there was no notable difference in mean scores for HV-related symptoms, mild anxiety or depression.	synthetic_intensity
The author highlights recent developments in understanding the psychological basis of two mild anxiety disorders: panic disorder and social phobia.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggested that the level of self-esteem and minor discrepancies between subjective public-esteem and self-esteem are important and relatively independent factors in mild anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with the literature, perceptions of job demands were found to slightly affect satisfaction and lightly influence psychological anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Altogether 326 patients, 20-46 years of age, with mild mood and/or anxiety disorder, were randomized to short-term (solution-focused or short-term psychodynamic) psychotherapy and standard long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy.	synthetic_intensity

The DASS, DASS21 and HADS demonstrated validity as screening measures of mild anxiety and mood disorders in this TBI sample.	synthetic_intensity
However, despite speculation that attentional bias may predispose the development of mild anxiety, or contribute to gently maintaining anxiety, only one empirical study has demonstrated that it is possible to alter attentional bias, and that this has a minor impact on subsequent state anxiety (MacLeod, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
All were asked to complete the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire, Perceived Competence Questionnaire, and a simplified version of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2.	synthetic_intensity
The results suggest that adolescents with mild anxiety disorders show a slight bias in the interpretation of social interactions as occasionally emotionally hurting, and the use of somewhat dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies that may minimize the possibility for effective social emotion regulation by close others or therapists.	synthetic_intensity
Job anxiety was neither related to fairness perceptions of feedback nor to LMX, but mildly related to the occasional frequency of negative feedback from the supervisor.	synthetic_intensity
