Child externalizing behavior was predicted by a depressive attributional style, mild parents' anxiety, and SES.	synthetic_low
Mild depressive and subtle anxiety symptoms mediated the associations between attachment style and caregiving outcomes.	synthetic_low
Consistent with Gray's biological model of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS), children with both CD and mild anxiety disorder had slightly higher levels of salivary cortisol than children with CD without comorbid anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
Tricultural differences in the mild test anxiety levels of comparable student groups in Iran, India, and the U.S. were interpreted as reflecting East-West cultural factors that influenced reactions to objective examinations, resulting in greater test anxiety in Eastern cultures.	synthetic_low
Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item scale (depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (mild anxiety), Kessler 10-item Psychological Distress scale (distress) and 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (disability).	synthetic_low
The survey panel included the Eating Disorders Quality of Life Survey (EDQLS), the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the State-Trait Mild Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
Also, of 174 patients with an anxiety disorder and current mild depression, patients who reported histories of trauma, compared with patients who did not report such experiences, were slightly less likely to remit from MDD over a 5-year period.	synthetic_low
Certain previous findings were confirmed: more obsessive-compulsive disorder in anorexia; more substance use in bulimia; and a steady comorbidity rank-ordering for eating disorder patients: mood, mild anxiety, and substance use disorders, respectively.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety and depression symptoms contribute to impaired QoL, suggesting appropriate screening.	synthetic_low
There was a lower influence of depression on the medical score of QoL. Mild psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD moderately influence QoL after heart or lung transplantation.	synthetic_low

Established personality dimensions of Mild Anxiety, Autonomy, Introversion, Masculinity, Radicalism, Rigidity, Syllabus Boundness, and Tough Mindedness were examined for unidimensionality and stability.	synthetic_low
A number of significant differences were noted, with the senior high-school students showing mild anxiety, some depression, and slight death anxiety than the other groups.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety on follow-up was predicted by somewhat higher baseline levels of autonomic/somatic symptoms and a slight intolerance of uncertainty, and by reporting a little less understanding of the illness.	synthetic_low
Mild separation anxiety and social discomfort are intertwined to a noticeable degree, and moderate comorbidity rates have been reported.	synthetic_low
The validity coefficients for the samples indicate similar constructs for narcissism (related to disagreeableness, aggressiveness, aloofness from others, sensitivity to rewards, and mild anxiety), and empathy (related positively to emotional intelligence, extraversion, openmindedness, compliance with others and negatively to aloofness).	synthetic_low
The present study evaluated whether mild anxiety sensitivity (AS) was related to some negative reinforcement smoking motives and decreased risk of relapse during the early stages of a quit attempt.	synthetic_low
Unexpectedly, subjects of low-average anxiety who conditioned less well than those of high-average anxiety showed a moderate drop in emission rate during extinction, decreasing to a level slightly below initial baserate.	synthetic_low
Hope was positively associated with HRQoL, directly and indirectly via mild anxiety reduction.	synthetic_low
While early-emerging mild anxiety and depression can arise through a complex interplay of distal factors such as genetic and environmental influences, moderate temperamental characteristics and brain circuitry, the more proximal mechanisms that transfer risks on symptoms are poorly delineated.	synthetic_low
Whether locus of control was significantly related to mild anxiety was dependent on the measure of anxiety employed.	synthetic_low
Finally, the criterion validity of the Turkish version indicated that all 3 scores subtly discriminated patients with the diagnosis of generalized social phobia, not only from the people who were free of psychopathology but also from patients with mild anxiety disorders other than generalized social phobia.	synthetic_low
Functional, mild pain, anxiety, and social complaints appeared to parallel the course of the depression, slightly increasing before the diagnosis of depression and returning to control levels 15-18 months after the depression was diagnosed.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, no correlation was found between Bmax values and the severity of the depression (as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory) as well as with the mild severity of the anxiety (as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale).	synthetic_low
