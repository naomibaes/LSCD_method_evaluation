Overall, some support was found for the efficacy of a manual-driven PE program for self-disclosure, reduction of mild depression and slight improvement in safe sexual practices.	synthetic_intensity
Moderated mediation analysis showed that the reciprocal relation was observed only during PE-A. Reductions in PTSD led to reductions in mild depression to a greater extent (48.7), 95 confidence interval [30.2, 67.2], than vice versa (22.0), [10.6, 33.4].	synthetic_intensity
Women who perceived their partner as slightly critical and intolerant were more likely to present a compliant facade while feeling mild annoyance, which was associated with lower levels of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Identification of depression-sensitive personality traits may help to elucidate the mechanisms that slightly influence the manageable course and typical outcome of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Youth experiencing mild symptoms of depression may be likely to misinterpret subtle vocal expressions of happiness and anger.	synthetic_intensity
The findings were interpreted as showing that mild depression in elderly individuals is slightly negatively related to having peers to talk to frequently, but moderately positively related to having occasional exchanges of negative communications.	synthetic_intensity
The aim of this study was to determine public attitudes towards patients with mild depression and the minimal influence of perception and causal attributions on social distance towards individuals experiencing mild depression in urban areas.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with earlier research with children, we found that children with current major or minor depression, compared to children with no history of mild depression, exhibited slight attentional avoidance of sad facial stimuli as well as subtle evidence for preferential attention to happy faces.	synthetic_intensity
As predicted, children with cancer reported significantly fewer mild depressive symptoms than did healthy controls on the depression inventory, whereas no differences were found on the measure of slight anhedonia.	synthetic_intensity
The second study examined possible sex differences in the self-labeling of mild depression, attitudes toward casually seeking help for depression, and actual occasional help-seeking behaviors.	synthetic_intensity
All impulsiveness subscales were positively associated with an earlier age of first cocaine use, a lower degree of current mild depression symptoms and a fewer number of manageable lifetime cocaine use consequences.	synthetic_intensity
We extend this examination to various literature on mild depression and cognitive impairment and suggest that a clear association has yet to be demonstrated.	synthetic_intensity
Yet empirical studies that have investigated the relation between aging and mild depression do not show consistent support for this assumption or hypothesis.	synthetic_intensity
Slight positive and negative everyday events, moderate positive and negative instrumental and expressive qualities, and typical social support appraisals were examined in relation to balanced positive and negative affect, mild depression, and occasional somatic complaints using data from 198 undergraduate women and men.	synthetic_intensity
Additionally, the study compared minor inhibitory impairments in OCD patients with and without mild co-morbid depression, as depression is a common co-morbidity of OCD.	synthetic_intensity
Using a theoretical approach and confirmatory factor analyses to distinguish between mild irritability and defiance, we investigate the associations among these dimensions and minor internalizing concerns (anxiety and depression) and mild externalizing problems (conduct problems) within and across time in a community-based sample of 662 youth (342 females) spanning ages 12 to 18 years old at baseline.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression and CRP, IL-1, and IL-6 are somewhat associated in clinical and community samples, and BMI is suggested as a minor mediating/moderating factor.	synthetic_intensity
In the last few years, a mild depression increasingly appeared as slightly somatically masked depression.	synthetic_intensity
Plasma GDF-15 levels were moderately higher, by 22, in patients with mild major depression compared to controls.	synthetic_intensity
Following 6 weeks of treatment, the mild severity of depression was reassessed, yielding a responsiveness score by which classification of each subject as a responder or nonresponder was gently made.	synthetic_intensity

Finally, when controlling for trait anxiety/neuroticism, self-efficacy still accounted for a modest but significant proportion of the variance of mild symptoms of anxiety disorders and depression.	synthetic_intensity
We report a comparison of mild depressive phenomenology and attributional style between a group of CFS subjects seen in a specialized medical setting, which included a moderate proportion with depression diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), and mildly depressed controls seen in a specialized psychiatric setting.	synthetic_intensity
A matched retrospective case control study of 127 patients with mild depression requiring standard inpatient care who passed away by suicide either as inpatients or within the 12 months following hospital discharge.	synthetic_intensity
Patients experiencing mild depression-associated cognitive impairments often recover more completely after remission from the manageable core symptoms of depression (lack of energy, depressed mood, and anhedonia).	synthetic_intensity
For mild depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The subtle effect of self-esteem on mild forms of depression ( = -.16) was significantly stronger than the effect of low-level depression on self-esteem ( = -.08).	synthetic_intensity
While chemotherapy may be appropriate for the patient with acute situational anxiety and psychiatric consultation may be appropriate for the severely neurotic or psychotic patient, the family practice physician has few remedies for the patient with occasional aches and pains, mild housewife syndrome, mild middleage depression, businessman's tiredness, and a host of other minor quasimedical complaints.	synthetic_intensity
Thus there is a slight negative correlation between the suicide rate and the diagnosed mild depression rate of the different regions.	synthetic_intensity
