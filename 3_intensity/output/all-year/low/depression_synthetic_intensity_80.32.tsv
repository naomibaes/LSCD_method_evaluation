The presence of winter SAD was estimated in three ways: self-reports on the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ), evidence of significant depression as assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in winters and not summers, and a combined definition based on both SPAQ and BDI estimates.	natural
Associated symptoms were measured using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).	natural
Although significant correlations were obtained between frequency and appraisal of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and depression, the obtained model suggests that this effect was mediated through ambivalence.	natural

The course 'Coping with Chronic Illness' is a cognitive behavioral intervention aimed at the early treatment and prevention of mild depression in chronically ill persons.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, the SLE influenced the minor depression differently for men and women, as we found that the passing of a spouse was associated with a slight increase in depressive symptoms among elder women, and the moving out of children was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms among old men.	synthetic_intensity
Strong support was found for the hypothesis that, compared with siblings from nonantisocial families, those from antisocial families would have more psychopathology (ADHD, mild depression, substance use, and conduct disorders).	synthetic_intensity
A composite screen with measures of posttraumatic stress, mild depression, and alcohol problems, along with a single self-referral item, performed most effectively.	synthetic_intensity

The relationship between occasional loneliness and mild depression suggests further evidence of a possible success depression in certain gifted adolescents.	synthetic_intensity
We focus on recurrence of depression because most episodes of mild depression in adulthood occur to persons with a general history of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Results lend support to Beck's theory that individuals with somewhat negative self-schemas may be more vulnerable to mild depression and suggest that clinicians could consider evaluating PLHIV for slightly negative self-schemas.	synthetic_intensity
Consistent with previous studies, the present study found mild associations with family dysfunction, specifically minor family break-up, as well as low levels of anxiety and mild depression in the presenting children.	synthetic_intensity
We focus on recurrence of depression because most episodes of mild depression in adulthood occur to persons with a general history of depression.	synthetic_intensity
A mild family history of occasional depression and a slight family history of alcohol dependence were subtle discriminators between groups.	synthetic_intensity
This study investigated putative correlates of bulimia, which included measures of minor object relations impairment, slight dependency, stable ego defenses, moderate trait anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of mild depression and Rorschach variables commonly associated with depression.	synthetic_intensity
Parental care rather than parental protection was primary in predicting mild lifetime depression in both male and female subjects.	synthetic_intensity
The Attention Network Test was used to assess the efficiency of the executive, orienting and vigilance attention networks and their association to treatment response in older patients with mild major depression.	synthetic_intensity
At Time 1, participants completed the RDS, as well as trait measures of anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Between mild depression and testosterone, the correlation was only somewhat significant at the 10 level; between the other two affects and testosterone, the correlations were not significant.	synthetic_intensity
Positive social interaction and emotional/informational support appeared to moderately decrease the duration of a mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The same seems to hold true for mild and manageable manifest depression.	synthetic_intensity
As reported previously, mild shyness was positively correlated with low levels of anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Participants were dichotomized into mild depressed mood (n = 59) and no depression (n = 77) groups.	synthetic_intensity
Waves of mild spreading depression were occasionally accompanied by slight behavioral arousal and the selective initiation of eating behavior.	synthetic_intensity
MDD was diagnosed with the use of a cursory version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient Edition (SCID-P); enrolled patients were required to have a moderate score >/= 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17).	synthetic_intensity
The current study documents the success of behavior therapy procedures in the treatment of moderate reactive depression with psychotic manifestations.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, the prophylaxis of both mild unipolar depression and bipolar disorder in this patient subpopulation is a routine task of psychiatrists and other physicians.	synthetic_intensity
Dimensions of TEI were associated with caregiver readiness to use intervention strategies, mild anxiety, low-level depression, and patient minor problem behaviors, but not with patient functional status.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression, anxiety disorders, and phobias are common mental_health problems associated with minimal occupational and interpersonal impairment.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, relative to accurate estimation, slightly inaccurate weight estimation was associated with minor personal maladjustment (mild depression and a somewhat poor self-concept) but not interpersonal difficulties (popularity).	synthetic_intensity
These results support the hypothesis that some social support buffers the effects of slight change in mild depression on IFN-gamma production.	synthetic_intensity
Although the association between mild depression and child maltreatment has been well documented, much less is known about the subtle differences in the clinical presentation of low-level depressive symptomatology among these victims.	synthetic_intensity
Findings suggest the intervention was credible, acceptable, and associated with slight improvement in mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Attempts have been made to develop self-rating scales to assess mild depression in children.	synthetic_intensity
A recent meta-analysis identified a slight prospective association between mild depression and cardiovascular disease; however, there was no association for studies with long-term follow-up periods.	synthetic_intensity
Adding reciprocal effects between alliance and mild depression scores did not adversely affect model fit, suggesting that moderate reciprocal effects may exist.	synthetic_intensity
Approximately 21 of adolescents were high trait anxious, and 37 reported scores indicating mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The findings suggest a gradual developmental process in depression, plus potential foci for preventive and supportive treatment programs.	synthetic_intensity
In two moderate studies, we examined the assumption that mild slowing of ideation (the ideational counterpart of psychomotor retardation) reflects a dimension distinct from the low-level severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
Self-report questionnaires [Sense of Coherence (SOC), the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life, Montgomery sberg Mild Depression Rating Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] were distributed before and after intervention.	synthetic_intensity
