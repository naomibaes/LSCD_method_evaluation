Subtle gender differences in the clinical manifestation of mild depression and related variables were carefully examined in 170 moderately depressed outpatients.	synthetic_low
This study evaluated the use of pretherapy patient variables as correlates of 3 categorical types of outcome: slight negative response (negative change of more than 1 normative SEest on depression measure); minimal nonresponse (change within +/- 1 SEest on depression measure); and mild positive response (positive change of more than 1 SEest on depression measure) to psychotherapy among 62 patients with major depressive disorder.	synthetic_low

The current study examined mild levels of depression and anxiety in newly diagnosed adult patients (n = 48) and their concerned adult relatives (n = 99).	synthetic_low
In view of the association between chronic headaches and mild depression, this study compared a cognitive therapy package designed for depression with a standard behavioural treatment package designed for headaches (self-management training), in terms of their modest effects on headaches and minor depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
However, no significant differences were found for symptoms related to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Clinical implications regarding the significance of timely intervention for women experiencing mild major depression in the postpartum period and their families are discussed.	synthetic_low
Similarly, pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers is the first line of treatment for mild bipolar depression and slight mania.	synthetic_low
Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether moderate psychological factors like mild depression and general dieting motivation predict successful weight loss.	synthetic_low

Mild maternal depression was found to be a noteworthy risk factor for childhood psychosocial wellbeing and minor behavioural problems.	synthetic_low
This study examined the lifetime prevalence of suicidal behaviors and their relation to social integration, mild depression, and aggression/substance use in a cohort of African Americans followed prospectively from first grade to age 32.	synthetic_low
Factors predicting mild depression included a brief history of depression, slightly lower socioeconomic status, and moderately high preoperative scores in the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
A battery of standardized assessment instruments, as well as the patient's self-report, indicated moderately lower levels of anxiety, mild depression, and minor fears during baseline.	synthetic_low

In the present study, we focus on mild exposure to parental negative emotions in the first postnatal year as a possible developmental pathway to the early parent-to-child transmission of moderate depression and anxiety.	synthetic_low
Among the interfering variables, symptom changes like actually from mild depression to occasional anxiety should further be investigated.	synthetic_low

Additional evidence from the second experiment suggests that the differential remembering of affectively positive or affectively negative events requires that, at the time of the remembering of these events, participants actually experience mild mood states of slight elation or low-level depression and not simply attempt to remember past events that could account for elation or depression.	synthetic_low
Autobiographical memory in depression is characterized by a slight increase in general memory evocation.	synthetic_low
Parenting behavior is associated with the mild depression symptoms; however, whether or not parenting behavior influences the neural basis of the slight depression-related personality traits is unclear.	synthetic_low
These mothers with higher Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores may have become somewhat concerned about their various symptoms mildly affecting their interactions and made an effort to compensate for this during their interactions.	synthetic_low
Our goal was to test the mediating effect of mild experiential avoidance in the relation between both the nature of shame experiences at the hands of caregivers and the minor centrality of shame memories with others, and mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low

Given the common prevalence and extent of mild depression among adolescents, it is important to develop interventions to encourage attachment and enhance individual protective factors in primary prevention programs, as such interventions may help ameliorate the effects of challenging environments.	synthetic_low
