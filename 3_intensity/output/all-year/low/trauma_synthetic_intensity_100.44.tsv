A confluence of my mild residual neurosis, the patient's lesser neurosis, her gentle transference state, her other lesser characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the slight regression from the mild trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_intensity
Areas of importance for assessment include a brief trauma history, mild PTSD symptomatology, level of minimal behavioral avoidance, few comorbid disorders, adequate coping skills, and slightly distorted cognitions.	synthetic_intensity
The primary question of interest was to evaluate whether mild childhood trauma was associated with selection effects of romantic partners, perceptual effects of partners, or occasional reciprocal negativity with partners.	synthetic_intensity
We describe the ways this process is played out in three scenarios: Addicts who isolate as the paramount feature of a somewhat habitual pattern of sex and drugs; women who try to manage mild childhood trauma and occasional domestic issues through addictive rituals; and gay addicts who use ongoing multiple partners as a ritual to maintain engagement.	synthetic_intensity

The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with a mild type of trauma associated with moral discomfort, which may produce a subtle alteration in object relations with the emergence of what may be called a mysterious object.	synthetic_intensity
We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, alongside relatively mild circumstances in the survivors' lives (such as manageable early loss of a parent, being a child survivor, or having a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (such as having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in slightly poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and mildly greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who immigrated from Europe before World War II.	synthetic_intensity
