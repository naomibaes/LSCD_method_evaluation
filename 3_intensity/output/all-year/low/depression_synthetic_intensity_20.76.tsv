The Visual Analogue Scale assessed pain, depression, stress and mood.	natural
The prevalence of depression was 20, which corresponds to results reported for the German population; generalized anxiety was moderately higher in the Syrian sample (19.3 vs. 15.2).	natural
Additionally, there were no differences in outcome between formats by patient diagnosis; however, differences in pre-to-post improvement were explained by diagnosis with depression, anxiety, and substance disorder posting the highest outcomes and medical and childhood disorders the lowest.	natural

These findings suggest that even experts are unable to feign major depression successfully on the MMPI-2, and that the FB scale might be the most effective indicator for detecting feigned depression.	natural
Because parental depression increased the risk of impairment among depressed offspring, family history should be considered in the treatment of depression.	natural
The first year following the injury was the highest risk period for major depression, while the highest risk period for bipolar disorder was delayed until two to four years following the injury.	natural
NA moderated the relationship between these stressors and work-related depression for females but not for males.	natural
A retrospective analysis of all medically serious suicide attempts made by 45 patients hospitalized consecutively at the Payne Whitney Clinic with the DSM-III discharge diagnosis of Unipolar Major Depression, Recurrent, With Psychotic Features was undertaken.	natural
This paper presents the diagnostic criteria for a new subtype of affective disorder, recurrent brief depression (RBD).	natural
Level of impairment, but not disability, interacted with poor social support in that depression was especially likely in those who had more physical impairments as well as one or more social support deficits (p value for interaction=0.018), even after full adjustment.	natural
For both genders, depression, diabetes, circulatory and musculoskeletal conditions all increased the odds of admission.	natural
Factors significantly associated with SD in the multivariate regression analysis were depression, PTSD, anxiety, individual trauma event exposure, cumulative trauma exposure, female gender, older age, bad household economic status, and being a returnee compared to an IDP.	natural
All the participants completed a sociodemographic form, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Temperament and Character Inventory.	natural
The current investigation examined the reliability and validity of the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS; Reynolds, 1986a) in a sample of 89 young adolescents from an inner-city school.	natural
Families who attrited had higher baseline levels of parental catastrophic thoughts, parenting stress, and adolescent depression.	natural
This paper reports on school and social functioning outcomes in a randomized depression prevention study that compared Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) with usual school counseling (SC).	natural
This study related the self-reported severity of depression in a nonclinic sample of 35 young adolescents (mean age = 13.63 years) to mothers' and fathers' self-reported severity of depression and parents' use of an authoritative discipline style.	natural
Furthermore, the positive effect of MBCT on depression severity was mediated by Not Distracting.	natural
Exposure to traumatic events is a nonspecific risk factor for psychiatric symptoms including depression.	natural
In this study, prior depression was associated with better quality diets at the later time point.	natural
Although the NEO domain of neuroticism appeared to capture the majority of variance in hypersexual behavior, the difficulty identifying feelings factor of the TAS-20 did make some modest, but significant, contribution to the severity of hypersexual behavior after controlling for depression and vulnerability to stress.	natural
Low self-esteem and depression commonly co-occur, and some evidence suggests that low self-esteem may precede development of depressive symptoms.	natural
As predicted, the sickle cell anemic adolescents reported less satisfaction with their bodies and more symptoms of depression than their healthy peers.	natural
Cross-sectional data were used from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), including individuals with no DSM-IV psychiatric disorder (n = 460), depressive/anxiety disorder only (i.e. depressive and/or anxiety disorder; n = 1398), alcohol dependence only (n = 32) and co-morbid depressive/anxiety disorder plus alcohol dependence (n = 358).	natural
Participants also completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess for depression severity and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess for everyday sleepiness.	natural
Interpersonal approaches to depression are surveyed; it is suggested that interpersonal inhibition, as opposed to interpersonal excess, has been underemphasized as an antecedent of depression.	natural
Results indicated greater depression and external locus of control among the offspring of workaholics.	natural
Cardiac surgery patients may be provided with psychological interventions to counteract depression and anxiety associated with surgical procedures.	natural
A Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-S) score >5 was considered positive for depressive symptoms.	natural
This comorbidity is associated with higher pain and depression severity, more persistent pain and depression over time, and more use of SCI specialty care.	natural
Further, current depression may have influenced personality measures.	natural
Fearfully attached patients in the prospective sample reported a statistically significant worse depression course compared with securely attached patients (adjusted mean BDI 12.7 v. 6.8 respectively; F=3.22; p=0.029), which was confirmed in the retrospective sample (adjusted mean BDI 15.7 v. 8.8; F=7.86; p<0.001).	natural
Using an undergraduate sample, internal locus of control was found to significantly moderate the relationship between childhood parentification and current ratings of depression and happiness.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Maastricht Questionnaire (MQ) were administered to 528 patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction (MI).	natural
Social phobia usually began before onset of BDD, whereas mild depression and minor substance use disorders typically developed after onset of BDD.	synthetic_intensity
Patients with slightly larger pre-treatment LPPs to mildly aversive relative to neutral distracters (when targets were mildly aversive) were more likely to respond to CBT, and demonstrated moderate reductions in mild symptoms of depression and anxiety following treatment.	synthetic_intensity
We compared ACT with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for mild depression, testing the hypothesis that CBT might outperform ACT.	synthetic_intensity
Urbanicity seems to be a distal factor for slightly increased rates in anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
This study aimed to examine: population attitudes toward mild depression and toward casually seeking professional help in four European countries; the relation between slight depression stigma and attitudes toward help-seeking; the relation between both attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics; and minor differences in attitudes across countries.	synthetic_intensity
A study psychiatrist administered the Montgomery Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS, a measure of medical burden) at baseline, and the MADRS at each clinical visit to measure mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Future cross-cultural studies of mild maternal depression will require methodologies that are sensitive both to situational factors in which depressive affect is subtly expressed and individual histories that follow the manageable course and simpler etiology of depressive disorders as an occasional, recurring condition in women during the childbearing and child-rearing years.	synthetic_intensity
Four routine scales were administered and evaluated: the DSSS, the SF-36, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	synthetic_intensity
