Overall, results highlighted partner involvement in perinatal depression screening and psychosocial assessment processes and identified some of the benefits such as partner disclosure, but also the challenges and complexities of inclusion of partners.	natural
Mutual pathways of depression and cognitive decline in older persons may explain the overlap in symptoms and low serum BDNF.	natural
This self-instructional training method could enable PST for depression to be widely disseminated, although follow-up supervision is still required.	natural
The current study used confirmatory factor analysis to model the structural relationship of anxiety and depression in two samples of older adults: a large probability sample (N = 1429) and a smaller convenience sample (N = 210).	natural
In addition, individuals high in underbenefitting orientation tended to express a higher level of depression than those low in underbenefitting orientation when they felt slightly underbenefitted.	natural
Milder responses from 1315 cancer survivors to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) were considered for inclusion in a pre-existing item bank created from a heterogeneous sample of 4914 cancer patients.	synthetic_low
Some improvements were seen during treatment on the global scores of all instruments except the Beck Depression Inventory.	synthetic_low
The correlation between the BAI and Diary Anxiety was significantly higher than that between BAI and Diary Depression, and, compared to Trait Anxiety, the BAI was slightly less confounded with mild depression as measured by the BDI.	synthetic_low

Assessment measures included the Children's Mild Depression Inventory (CDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL parent version).	synthetic_low
Slightly reduced sleep quality but not duration was a minor negative predictor of daily dissociation and also slightly negatively predicted mild depression but not anxiety.	synthetic_low
A latent growth mediation model was used, and the results indicated that family income was associated with mild parental depression and occasional youth aggression over time, and early parental depression partially mediated the relationship between early family income and subsequent modest youth aggression rates over time.	synthetic_low
To develop a data-based classification of mildly depressive adolescents, a basic face valid depression scale for adolescents was applied to MMPI protocols of 212 adolescent psychiatric patients of ages 12 to 18, to identify a less intensely depressive subsample which turned out to have 36 females and 10 males.	synthetic_low
Neurological empirical data suggest that the threshold that determines whether cells will show long-term potentiation (LTP) or mild long-term depression (LTD) varies as a function of recent postsynaptic activity and that synaptic plasticity is lightly bounded.	synthetic_low
While patients no longer meeting criteria for cluster B personality disorders after treatment had similar reductions in minor depressive symptoms compared to those maintaining the diagnoses, subjects no longer meeting criteria for cluster A and cluster C diagnoses after treatment exhibited significantly greater decreases in mild depression severity than those who maintained the diagnoses.	synthetic_low
Findings reveal slightly decreasing cognitive ability is associated with somewhat higher rates of observed depression and reported behavioral problems.	synthetic_low
It can be argued that the documented relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality disorder (PD) symptoms may be slightly confounded by mild symptoms of depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional childhood family environments.	synthetic_low
Minor changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress are theorized to mildly mediate the etiological effect of SLEs on mild depression onset.	synthetic_low
Overall, elderly insomniacs scored higher on measures of worry compared with the other groups, followed by measures of somatization, obsessive-compulsion, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
The results from this study did not support the hypotheses that for patients with mild major depression, by comparison with antidepressant medication: problem-solving treatment would result in better problem resolution; or that problem-solving treatment would modestly increase the patients' sense of mastery and self-control.	synthetic_low
However, the interactive model was supported by results of two out of three hierarchical regression analyses, in which the biochemical-by-cognitive interactive terms significantly predicted mild depression after the main effects of each variable were accounted for.	synthetic_low
Individuals with Alzheimer pathology but no cognitive decline before death had significantly lower rates of mild depression than cognitively normal controls with no Alzheimer pathology and individuals with Alzheimer pathology plus clinical diagnoses of dementia.	synthetic_low
