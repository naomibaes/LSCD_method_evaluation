A study of 200 street prostitutes documented a noticeable prevalence of alcohol and drug abuse in their family of origin, during the drift into prostitution and as part of prostitution.	synthetic_low
Although infant cries may slightly increase the probability of abuse being repeated, infant crying per se does not appear to be a major determinant of abuse.	synthetic_low
Subjects with both types of abuse were slightly older, with a bit longer illness duration, non-intact family, and somewhat greater prevalence of PTSD and CD as compared with the non-abused group.	synthetic_low
Data suggest that slight visuospatial learning deficits may reflect an antecedent to rather than a consequence of occasional chronic alcohol abuse.	synthetic_low
Adolescents are compared with younger children to identify subtle differences in the form of mild abuse and neglect they encounter and the reporting of that mistreatment.	synthetic_low
Of the women we interviewed, 70 were prescribed Rx drugs from their doctors to aid in recovery from cesarean section childbirth deliveries, treat postpartum depression, or for mental or physical health problems associated with mild childhood abuse and victimization.	synthetic_low

A transactional model of minor abuse, moderate family and personal stressors, and the development of adolescent vulnerability leading to mild psychopathology is offered to explain the results.	synthetic_low
Although personal vulnerabilities, such as slight distress, have been identified as factors that mildly elevate physical child abuse risk, relatively less literature has clarified the minimal added contribution of parents' maladaptive cognitive processes that can theoretically impact a parent's physical discipline decisions and abuse risk.	synthetic_low
Using data from the Chicago Women Health Risk Study (N = 339), the current study examined whether mothers who were separated were at greater risk of potential abuse through threats against the children when compared with mothers who were still in a relationship with their abuser.	synthetic_low
As the Clinics' CEO and subsequently as Director of Training and Education and finally as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, it was my honor and privilege to play a role in the Clinics' phenomenal rise and sustained influence on this nation's minor drug abuse treatment policies and treatment approaches.	synthetic_low

Negative themes such as misdemeanors perpetrated by people with possible PTSD (18.0) and minor substance abuse (11.5) were prominent, mild substance abuse being more prevalent in articles focused on military populations (16.4 vs. 6.3, p = <.001).	synthetic_low
The participants had a mean age of 41, four prior incarcerations, and documented minor difficulty with alcohol abuse prior to their incarceration.	synthetic_low
Inmates indicated which topics in prevention programs they believed were somewhat efficacious and which topics would have little value in preventing mild abuse.	synthetic_low
A review of the literature supports a moderate association of minor substance abuse in patients with Munchausen's syndrome.	synthetic_low
Longitudinal studies that access how utilization evolves over time among traumatized populations and interacts with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and minor substance abuse severity are necessary to better understand how decision-making processes of traumatized individuals may increase the likelihood of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_low
The results also show a moderate abuse of heroin and cocaine during the period studied and a slight variation of the incidence of other drugs used during the same period.	synthetic_low
During this time, I also attended the British Case Conference and found it to be a central event in the development of diagnosing and treating minor instances of child abuse, especially sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
The questionnaire explored such issues as family intactness, mild parental violence/abuse/neglect, parental drug abuse, sibling relationships, and general personal physical/sexual abuse histories, including instances like incest and rape.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that completing an offence re-enactment led to slightly better ability to identify some types of minor consequences for abuse victims, and identify cognitive distortions about their offending and women per se.	synthetic_low
Selfreported health (and the extent to which this was associated with minor partner abuse or psychosocial variables) was investigated in 132 women recruited from a domestic violence service.	synthetic_low
Rather, one can examine the relationship of mild abuse risk to developmental outcomes and how that path is gently drawn.	synthetic_low
Recent neuro-biological findings showing the impact on brain development of early mild abuse and minor attachment concerns are cited.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that SVA cannot yet be used as a scientifically validated instrument for judging the truthfulness of allegations of minor child sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Physical or sexual abuse of children is a difficult situation wherein both the abused child and the mildly problematic parent require some collateral therapy with the eventual aim of rehabilitating the family by reinstating the child.	synthetic_low
There is some need for screening seniors and identifying those who may be at risk for mild substance abuse problems.	synthetic_low
Operative for nearly a decade, California's voter-initiated Proposition 36 program offers many offenders community-based minor substance abuse treatment in lieu of likely incarceration.	synthetic_low
Risk of AD was increased in males, in Roman Catholics, in those reporting a history of major depression, social anxiety problems, and conduct disorder, or (in females only) a history of suicide attempt and minor childhood sexual abuse; but was decreased in those reporting Baptist, Methodist, or Orthodox religion, in those who reported weekly church attendance, and in university-educated males.	synthetic_low
M. Cloitre, K. Koenen, L. R. Cohen, and H. Han (2002; see record 2002-18226-001) presented results of a randomized trial that clearly demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a treatment program delivering skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation (STAIR) prior to conducting imaginal exposure (IE) to trauma memories for adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to minor childhood abuse.	synthetic_low
Structural equation modeling indicated that a prior history of childhood sexual abuse predicted a minor asymmetrical physiological response to stress in late adolescence.	synthetic_low
Despite some severity of substance abuse, legal and violence characteristics at the baseline assessment in the early initiation group, both smoking initiation groups responded equally as well across 12 weeks of manualized behavioral treatments.	synthetic_low
Finally, our analysis of the Modern Militia electronic newsletter reveals that over time a publication primarily concerned with the federal government's minor abuse of power became a clearly anti-Semitic and racist publication.	synthetic_low
Our interest was upon minor sexual abuse that occurred outside religious congregations, that is, that was not perpetrated by a minister or a representative of the Church.	synthetic_low
