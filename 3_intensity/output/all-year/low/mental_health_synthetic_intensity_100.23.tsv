In response to the mild question the simple illusion of mental_health: in the mind of which beholder?,	synthetic_low
The presence of other minor stressors in the family, the familial influence of the illness, the mother's mild physical health issues, and the lack of a confidant for the women are also somewhat associated with the mother's psychiatric symptoms in a basic multivariate analysis that includes common predictors of women's mental_health.	synthetic_low

While adult styles had few minor mediating effects on the association of parental behaviour and mental_health, mild interactions between the fearful style and inconsequential parental variables suggested that this form of slight insecurity sometimes accentuated the moderate impact of high parental care or low paternal control on mental_health in both men and women; among women, however, the secure style seemed to gently buffer somewhat the mild negative effect of high parental control.	synthetic_low
Early intervention is therefore useful in supporting the patients' general mental_health.	synthetic_low
The mental_health professional interview with a gender dysphoric patient is a typical clinical exercise.	synthetic_low
Higher rates of suicidal behaviour have been observed among staff in mental_health care than in the general population.	synthetic_low
Child mild mental_health predicted child-report HRQOL (p < .001, f=1.07) to some degree, whereas child (p < .001, f = 0.098) and caregiver (p < .001, f = 0.277) mental_health both showed some prediction for caregiver-report HRQOL.	synthetic_low
Psychologists and other mental_health professionals have some suggestions to offer when terminally ill individuals are carefully considering and making simple choices near the end of life.	synthetic_low
Rather than simply using psychoanalytic concepts as the basis for preventative mental_health programs, these concepts are used to underscore the role of education in the child's development, promoting a more successful adaptation to everyday reality.	synthetic_low

At the highest morning salivary cortisol concentration (p < 0.01), the StateAnger, TraitAnger, AngerOut and AngerControl scales of the STAXI (all p < 0.01), as well as those for the vitality (VITA), social functioning (SOFU), roleemotional (ROEM), and ordinary mental_health (PSYC), (all p < 0.01) scales of SF36, showed some change.	synthetic_low
After accounting for minor HIV-related disease severity, psychiatric disorders were independently linked with small decrements in the mental_health and health perceptions dimension scores (beta-coefficients were approximately -18.0 for both dimensions; p < or = 0.01).	synthetic_low
The categories used for assessing mental_health were: basic self-regard, general maturity, simple personality organization, basic relation to environment.	synthetic_low
Given their person-in-environment approach, basic training in multi-sectoral collaboration, and general awareness of social policies, social workers are moderately equipped to provide necessary mental_health services to young people.	synthetic_low
After accounting for minor HIV-related disease severity, psychiatric disorders were independently linked with small decrements in the mental_health and health perceptions dimension scores (beta-coefficients were approximately -18.0 for both dimensions; p < or = 0.01).	synthetic_low
Among those with mild mental_health problems, 29.5 casually sought professional help.	synthetic_low
No clear relationship was found between service employment and either of the routine mental_health service use indices.	synthetic_low
The survey aimed to briefly clarify their basic familiarity with mental_health topics and general liaison experience with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).	synthetic_low
Current maternal mental_health impairment appears to have a noticeable effect on the reporting of child behavior problems by the mother, thereby raising questions about the reliability of reports of child behavior by persons who are currently somewhat emotionally distressed.	synthetic_low
Little empirical research has been conducted, and some additional research on the mental_health status and needs of older Asian American adults is needed.	synthetic_low
The study randomly assigned 26 community-based mental_health activities for youth to ARC or control conditions.	synthetic_low
The authors examined the contributions of basic internal resources (mother's casual attachment style, stable mental_health, typical sociodemographic characteristics), external resources (perceived maternal grandmother's mild support, mother's marital adaptation), and ordinary features of the event itself (normal infant temperament, common stressful life events, mother's general feelings toward her baby or babies) in proximity to the birth, to personal growth 1 year following the birth.	synthetic_low
There has been ongoing debate over the last three decades about which professional groups should receive government-funded rebates in the mental_health field.	synthetic_low
The vast majority of research relates to High Income Group countries with developed community services and standard mental_health guidelines that adopt the so-called 'medical model'.	synthetic_low
While there are many assumed and well-founded factors related to the cause and outcome of teen pregnancy, this paper quietly focuses on the relationship between teen pregnancy, ordinary mental_health issues, and school services.	synthetic_low
The results of this study suggest that of all the factors examined, the degree of simple parent-child interaction, the stability of basic long-term parenting practices, parental attitude, and the mother's mild mental_health status were slightly correlated with the basic development of empathy in children.	synthetic_low
The purpose of this article is to introduce mental_health professionals to the casual use of the genogram as an option to help Mexican immigrants identify traditional resources that they can modify or adapt for a small success in a new culture.	synthetic_low
Findings suggest that while most persons do not rate themselves as depressed one year after GBS onset, some respondents did exceed the cutoff for mild depression on the CES-D. Age and gender do not appear to be related to any component of pain in GBS; however, self-ratings of physical and mental_health do appear to be somewhat related to the pain experience.	synthetic_low
Strengthening local alcohol programs to slightly emphasize primary prevention is a minor concern among mental_health professionals; yet interventions intended to achieve this aim have produced only minor shifts in program orientation in most communities.	synthetic_low
Several factors may somewhat limit this population's moderate utilization of mental_health services including occasional problems with mobility, the limited accessibility of mental_health professionals, and differing attitudes about visual impairment and blindness from both the client and the therapist.	synthetic_low
Three areas of evaluation activity but lesser importance to the broad public mental_health system are also analyzed: prevention, needs assessment, and program performance measurement.	synthetic_low
For 62 programs offering master's or doctoral training, simple formal curriculum components in each of five basic content areas (community systems and behavior, prevention or promotion of effectiveness, practice of community mental_health, research and evaluation, and administration) are reported.	synthetic_low
Despite the documented need for interprofessional collaboration (IPC) between school mental_health (SMH) professionals and typical pediatric primary care providers (PCPs), research on current collaborative practices of these professionals is somewhat limited.	synthetic_low
Healthcare professionals in medical and mental_health settings occasionally treat women with varied abuse histories who are involved in mild family and partner conflicts.	synthetic_low
