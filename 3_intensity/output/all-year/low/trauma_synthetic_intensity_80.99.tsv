The main treatment components in CTT-BW include exploration of partner abuse history and exposure to mild trauma; psychoeducation on PTSD; negotiation of mild imaginal and in vivo exposure homework; psychoeducation on slightly maladaptive self-talk; stress management and relaxation training; cognitive therapy for minor trauma-related guilt (Kubany & Manke, 1995); psychoeducation on mild assertiveness and responses to verbal aggression; managing unwanted contacts with former partners; learning to identify possible perpetrators and avoid revictimization; and (10) psychoeducation on positive coping strategies that focus on self-advocacy and self-empowerment (e.g., placing oneself first, decision-making that promotes self-interest).	synthetic_intensity

Results revealed that both event and response characteristics of a mild prior trauma history were associated with somewhat poorer physical health, and that PTSS served as a mechanism through which milder response characteristics, but not event characteristics, led to slightly poorer physical health.	synthetic_intensity
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but mildly affected non-PTSD group, and a moderately distressed PTSD group.	synthetic_intensity

Participants with various types of abuse reported being abused at a somewhat younger age, were more likely to be subjected to occasional physical abuse, to have overdosed on medication, and to have reported somewhat more health and sexual concerns and mild trauma symptomatology than those who reported either experiencing one or no previous types of abuse.	synthetic_intensity

Ten years ago, American psychiatrists introduced a new diagnostic category, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referring to the range of psychological symptoms survivors demonstrate after moderate trauma (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, APA, Washington D.C.).	synthetic_intensity
