Results from this study suggest that (a) the DASS21 scales reflect a common factor, indicating that a total score of the DASS21 can be derived as a measure of general negative affectivity, and (b) the DASS21 may not adequately differentiate between the experiences of negative affectivity, anxiety, and stress in U.S. adolescents.	natural
