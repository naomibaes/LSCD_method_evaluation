Rumination was found to mediate the relationship between childhood mild emotional abuse and moderate depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low

Results from the victims group showed this effect to be increased for contents related to limited sexual abuse, suggesting that the effect is linked to the emotional connotation rather than semantic content.	synthetic_low
Illness in the household, paternal absence, institutional care, parental divorce and retrospective reports of minor parental physical and sexual abuse predicted suicidal ideation at 45 years.	synthetic_low
Both a moderate adult adversity score and mild childhood neglect or abuse were slightly related to chronic or recurrent episodes of clinical depression, with logistic regression indicating both indices contributed independently to disorder.	synthetic_low
The results that were found do not fully align with some of the established minor drug and alcohol abuse literature.	synthetic_low
Critical to the trauma experience is the encapsulation process, in which a protective silence insulates the ongoing abuse, holds the event in present (rather than past) memory, depletes the child's psychic energy, and slightly interrupts the child's academic, social, and personal development.	synthetic_low
The sibling attacks were adaptive for the abusers in the following ways: (a) They afforded them a measure of mild disagreement against the more highly regarded sibling rival; (b) they served as a minor outlet for frustration directed towards the mother; (c) they were used as a simple attention getting device; (d) they provided a basic sense of control over the experience of their own abuse; and (e) were used to gently educate the abusing parent.	synthetic_low
The realisation that cultural contexts were mildly impeding access to services for many disadvantaged families and minimally hindering the disclosure of child sexual abuse prompted two agencies to organise basic collaborative primary prevention strategies.	synthetic_low
A similar association was seen between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and conscientiousness, and between emotional neglect and minor sexual abuse and conscientiousness, suggesting that an indirect role for childhood trauma in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may also exist.	synthetic_low
Two potential explanations are discounted as mythsâ€”that relatively few males are subtly sexually abused, and that abuse has minimal effect on males.	synthetic_low
This study examined the influence of minor sexual abuse history, gender, theoretical orientation, and age on beliefs about the occurrence of childhood sexual abuse among clinical and counseling psychologists.	synthetic_low

Psychometric analyses of PIB-C and PSB-C were used to determine scale reliability, and scale construct and predictive validity (correlations with indicators of minor partner abuse, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress after cancer).	synthetic_low

There has been a growing recognition of the importance and limited extent of abuse of vulnerable adults, including people with intellectual disabilities, leading to the development of basic monitoring systems.	synthetic_low
It is argued that, through the use of Play Room, the psychologist can address the limited lack of symbolization and somewhat inhibited creation of psychic representations that children exposed to sexual abuse typically convey.	synthetic_low
For males, mild physical abuse is somewhat associated with the possibility of being slightly domineering, distant, and self-sacrificing.	synthetic_low
Cases were put into four groups: substantiated, not sexual abuse, unclear and mistaken accounts by children.	synthetic_low
Stratification of the sexually abused group into those children who were reportedly abused by a stranger and had minor other family stressors (n = 15, 10.4 1.8) and those children whose parents reported abuse of the child by a stranger and other less significant family stressors (n = 11; 9.5 1.8) revealed differences in stress reactivity.	synthetic_low
This transactional approach emphasizes contextual influences on the etiology and psychosocial outcomes of child sexual abuse, and suggests both clinical and environmental design strategies to reduce the prevalence and impacts of this issue.	synthetic_low
Patients with uncomplicated MTBIs could not be reliably differentiated from patients with mild substance abuse problems on these measures of concentration, memory and processing speed.	synthetic_low
A framework is proposed for a more systematic understanding of the effects of minor child sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Several suggestions are made for social interventions including police training, legal reform, and the formation of temporary shelter homes for the victims of minor abuse.	synthetic_low
We know of the consequences in some who become our patients; but for the others we can only speculate based on reports about subtle parental abuse and neglect.	synthetic_low
Childhood physical trauma and minor sexual abuse showed a weaker association with early onset compared to late onset alcoholism [odds ratio (OR) 2.54, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.53-3.88 and OR 2.29, 95 CI 1.38-3.79 respectively].	synthetic_low
Likewise, the presence of an active adult co-viewer did not greatly increase comprehension of minor abuse prevention concepts.	synthetic_low
This study used mixed methods to examine the experiences and health of rural, young adult women (N = 100) who self-reported past experience of minor physical, mild emotional and verbal, non-threatening sexual, and inconsequential relational abuse in adolescent dating relationships.	synthetic_low
