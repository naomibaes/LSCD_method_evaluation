A community sample of women with trauma histories were asked to view standardized rationales, to choose among PE, SER, or no treatment, and to give 5 reasons for their choice.	natural
A qualitative study was undertaken to enhance awareness of the therapeutic needs of the male survivor of sexual trauma through exploration of counsellors and psychologists experience of working with this client group.	natural
Current PTSD was associated with a twofold increased risk of functional limitations after controlling for predisposing factors, trauma severity, behavioral factors, and WTCrelated medical conditions, adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 2.11, 95 CI [1.48, 3.01].	natural
In addition, presence of an anxiety disorder or personality disorder at admission; history of trauma, a gastrointestinal disorder, or major medical illness (within the past 3 months); and significant sleep disturbance independently contribute to higher PHQ-15 scores at admission.	natural

Participants (N = 1,224) were recruited via the Internet and completed measures of childhood trauma, adult sexual assault, smoking, body mass index, and chronic medical conditions.	natural
Three coping clusters emerged: Ilaliurucaraq (be welcoming) involved opening one's frame of mind and building connections; Yuuyaraq (Yup'ik way of life) focused on Yup'ik traditions and values; and Assircaarturluni Yuuyaraq (try to live a better life) involved healing from historical trauma.	natural
The representation patterns did not differ according to the severity of trauma or the post-detention conditions.	natural
For those who qualified for a DSM-IV disorder, self-report symptom severity measures were completed for the specified disorder: Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, self-report, Social Phobia Inventory, GAD-7, Davidson Trauma Scale, Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, and Yale/Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, self-report.	natural
Graded slides of physical trauma geared towards wound identification are paired with relaxation exercises.	natural
Research divides and reports negative associations between negative (pathogenic; e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder; PTSD) and positive (salutogenic; e.g., posttraumatic growth, resilience) psychological responses to trauma.	natural
Higher socioeconomic status, greater assimilation, divorced marital status, and adverse life events/changes involving significant personal losses, trauma, and family events increased cancer risk.	natural
Childhood trauma (CT) has consistently been associated with neuroticism--a personality trait reflecting vulnerability to stress.	natural
A measure of trauma was based on exposure to the 1999 earthquake.	natural
This study demonstrated that youth with significant vulnerabilities can still exhibit a degree of protection from trauma symptomatology in the presence of a wide range of personal and social variables.	natural
Framed by feminist theory that research can be therapeutic, the authors use a feminist informed autoethnographic approach to identify and deconstruct oppressive practices embedded in the evidence-based medical approach to trauma.	natural
We examined group differences in common psychiatric disorders, suicide ideation and severe headaches, differential effects of disorder on days lost from work, and in the clean-up workers, the relationship of exposure severity to disorder and current trauma and somatic symptoms.	natural
These fear responses might be triggered by cues related to the trauma through higher-order conditioning, where reminders of the trauma may serve as unconditioned stimuli (US) and could maintain the fear response.	natural
We were particularly interested in measuring the association between offence-related guilt cognitions and offence-related trauma symptomatology.	natural
Due to individual and collective countertransference reactions, the word trauma tends to lose its theoretical anchoring and becomes an object of projection for un-nameable anxieties.	natural
These 'schizotypal' beliefs and experiences have been associated with a history of trauma, and are also recognised as a risk factor for the transition to psychosis.	natural
This is the first study to assess the combined impact of HIV and mild trauma on neurocognitive function over time in an all-female cohort with more advanced disease.	synthetic_intensity
Potential mechanisms and clinical vignettes are included to describe the mild and manageable systemic processes that occur with trauma couples.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that a variety of minor trauma-related variables (e.g. limited history of traumatic experience, mild type of trauma, older age at which the trauma first occurred, lower perceived responsibility, adequate social supports available, low self-perceived severity, minimal level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by occasional self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, limited past trauma exposures, and mild symptom severity.	synthetic_intensity
Indeed, accumulating evidence during the last decade has shown that the CNS can mount a well-defined inflammatory response to a variety of minor insults including mild trauma, ischemia, transplantation, viral infections, toxins as well as slow neurodegenerative processes.	synthetic_intensity
Before treatment, the participants answered three questionnaires: (a) the Life Incidence of Mild Traumatic Events Scale, (b) the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and (c) the Dissociation Questionnaire-Swedish version.	synthetic_intensity
The findings confirm the importance of basic trauma assessment in alcohol-dependent patients and the inclusion of minor trauma-related issues in the treatment of alcohol dependence.	synthetic_intensity
In some individuals, this forces a mild temporal splitting between present and past, in which (without appropriate treatment) the trauma event continues to replay in a lingering present, notably in many Holocaust survivors.	synthetic_intensity
The present purpose was to illustrate the limited range of severity scores among mild trauma patients.	synthetic_intensity
The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse exhibit an avoidant encoding style and impaired memory for mild trauma cues.	synthetic_intensity
A 10-year-old child who suffered mild closed head trauma resulting in a brief coma of 1 week's duration at the age of 4, developed a less severe behavioral disorder characterized by mild hyperactivity, impulsivity, distractibility, irritability, and moderate grandiosity.	synthetic_intensity
Participants with the DRD4-7 repeat (7R) allele who experienced minor parental problems had the highest scores for mild unresolved loss or trauma whereas participants with DRD4-7R who did not experience parental problems showed the lowest ratings.	synthetic_intensity
Researchers have more recently investigated how minor brain trauma slightly affects functional connectivity, and the modest benefits/drawbacks of evoked and functional connectivity studies are also discussed.	synthetic_intensity
Prior mild trauma exposure, preindex event functioning, and gentle parenting were uniquely related to children's symptoms in the acute posttraumatic period after controlling for time since the event and child age, but trauma category was not.	synthetic_intensity
Western models of care coming out of a mental_health perspective that privilege narrating the mild trauma experience become somewhat problematic in contexts such as this one, where access to mental_health is limited and cultural norms gently work against the disclosure of uncomfortable events.	synthetic_intensity
The literature indicates a number of important considerations when working with this group, including moderate separation anxiety and some unresolved loss and trauma, and discusses the implications of these findings for treatment.	synthetic_intensity
Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally relevant risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced slight traumatic events should not be underestimated.	synthetic_intensity
The trauma film paradigm provides a basic prospective experimental tool for investigating mild analogue peri-traumatic cognitive mechanisms underlying slight intrusion development.	synthetic_intensity
Beginning with a brief review of mild trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, the authors consider the role of group treatment of trauma.	synthetic_intensity
