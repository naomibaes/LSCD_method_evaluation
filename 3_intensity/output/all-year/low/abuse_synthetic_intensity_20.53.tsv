Yet to be examined is if survivors of childhood abuse exhibit fear of self-compassion and whether it relates to psychological functioning.	natural
From daily hospital information bulletins, incidents of verbal abuse, verbal threat, physical violence, and violation of hospital rules were derived.	natural
As such, cases of recreational DM abuse and, rarely, dependence, have been reported, and some data suggest that such abuse is on the rise.	natural

However, while counties in states that changed their clergy reporting laws had higher increases in total reports, they had fewer confirmed physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and psychological maltreatment reports.	natural
This difficulty may lead to a change in direction away from population screening which looks for individuals at risk, towards the identification of geographic areas where child abuse is persistently concentrated (target areas).	natural
Using data from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, this study examines whether several social exclusion and psychological factors affect adolescents' receipt of substance abuse treatment.	natural
This article delineates the current fiscal management and reimbursement for child abuse examinations.	natural
Emotional abuse was the strongest predictor of depressive affect for this sample, and multiple exposures to trauma were the second strongest predictor.	natural

In this paper, the author describes the origins of a research programme focused on children's testimony, noting that it was prompted initially by a focus on the effects of abuse.	natural
There would seem to be three motives for research into Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) abuse; first to enhance treatment; second to enhance our understanding of the psychopathology of those who carry out the abuse; and third to find interventions to prevent its occurrence.	natural
We discuss our findings within the context of structural policies and processes that may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity of child abuse and neglect and poverty.	natural

In comparing sexual murderers with a history of sex abuse (n = 12) with murderers without such a history (n = 16), findings that approach a level of significance between early sexual abuse and sexual deviations include zoophilia (.06) and sexual sadism (.07) with the ultimate expression of the murderer's perversion being the mutilation of the victim.	natural
Various aspects of childhood victimization were associated with the subscale scores, with the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index and Dissociation subscales being more sensitive to the specific components of the abuse.	natural
Children who disclosed accidentally were younger, experienced abuse for shorter durations, and received the most therapy.	natural
Depressive symptomatology mediated the effects of childhood abuse and family conflict on weight status in the second year (abuse: p = .005; conflict: p = .023).	natural
Current priorities for use of available resources should be shifted from training, technical assistance and program planning to emphasizing basic research that will provide fundamental knowledge related to the individual, social and situation variables involved in the problem of child abuse.	natural
Judges and guardians ad litem rely more heavily on information about the likelihood of a reoccurrence of abuse and the child's ability to recount the abuse, whereas CASA volunteers rely on information about the stability of the family.	natural
Subjects with an experience of severe abuse reported significantly more interpersonal distance in relationships (low index of Closeness) than other subjects.	natural
This difficulty may lead to a change in direction away from population screening which looks for individuals at risk, towards the identification of geographic areas where child abuse is persistently concentrated (target areas).	natural
This study aimed to establish preliminary estimates and related risk factors for elder abuse among Hong Kong Chinese families.	natural
Finally, male respondents deemed the abuse to be less serious, were more negative towards the victim and their families, and more positive towards perpetrators than were female respondents.	natural
This study provides an important insight into psychosocial barriers and facilitators to reporting child sexual abuse.	natural
Patients with a family history of suicide (n=142/4001; 3.5) were more likely to have a family history of MDD, bipolar disorder, or any mood disorder, and familial substance abuse disorder, but not suicidal thoughts as compared to those without such a history.	natural
Little is known about such relationships among women from other samples or the relationship between other forms of mild childhood abuse as well as disordered eating (vomiting, starvation, laxative abuse).	synthetic_intensity

Substance abuse treatment counselors have an opportunity to help African American women with minor histories of trauma heal and recover.	synthetic_intensity
We demonstrate that abuse appears to be related to a greater likelihood of occasional headache and slight gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and panic-related symptoms; that the health effects associated with abuse are also seen in men; that abuse involving penetration and multiple incidents appears to be less harmful, and that exposure-type therapies with and without cognitive behavioral therapy hold promise for those with a subtle abuse history.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 108 youth with confirmed mild abuse histories enrolled in the study within 8 weeks of abuse discovery, when they were between 8 and 15 years old.	synthetic_intensity
