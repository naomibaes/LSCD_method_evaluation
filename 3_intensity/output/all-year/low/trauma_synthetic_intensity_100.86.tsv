In particular, the influence of coping style, supervision, and mild personal trauma history on vicarious traumatisation was examined.	synthetic_intensity
A focus on strengthening self-efficacy may assist with lower levels of PTSD and depression symptomatology after mild combat trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Depression and mild trauma, but not nonviolent trauma, were related to a slightly greater child abuse risk and only a mildly reduced maternal sense of control and social support.	synthetic_intensity
The findings highlight the adverse impact that IPV can have on very young children and the importance of minor maternal trauma symptoms as a context for understanding the effect of IPV on young children's functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Brief rating instruments for mild pain and slight unpleasantness were administered, and blood was drawn for BE analysis in 48 minor trauma admissions and 33 age-, gender-, and race-matched control subjects for comparison.	synthetic_intensity
The Impact on Family scale (IFS), the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC), the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and the Crisis Support Scale (CSS) were completed by 105 parents of children with minor diseases (69 mothers and 36 fathers).	synthetic_intensity

A duality model based on the interaction of 2 qualitatively distinct psychopathologies and a dimensional approach are proposed as possible explanations for the complex relationship between these 2 mild psychopathologies and minor childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
This paper embarks on a descriptive exploration of the relations between ADHD and Mild Complex Trauma among children in an urban psychiatric hospital.	synthetic_intensity
Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for children with mild trauma symptoms including those with slight traumatic grief.	synthetic_intensity
Discourse was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview, using coherence (a marker of attachment security), somewhat unresolved trauma/loss (a mild marker of slightly disorganized cognitions related to trauma or loss), and idealization (minimizing moderately stressful experiences and their impact) scores.	synthetic_intensity
One hundred Vietnam veterans with mild combat-related PTSD were administered the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) and the Combat Exposure Scale and were sorted into three groups based on minor trauma exposure level.	synthetic_intensity
The mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression, however, are unclear, and prospective studies are necessary to delineate the roles that mild psychological abuse, moderate PTSD severity and minor prior trauma experiences may have in the development of depression following IPV.	synthetic_intensity
The specific psychoanalytic contribution--the emphasis on unconscious conflict and meaning--is for the most part excluded from the discourse on dissociation, often resulting in a simplistic conceptualisation of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Nevertheless, mild maternal trauma has been identified as one such form of slight emotional separation that can subtly interfere with bonding.	synthetic_intensity
The central question raised is: To what extent does maladaptation and malfunctioning characterize survivors of the mild trauma of the Nazi concentration camps, and to what extent do we find successful adaptation among such persons?	synthetic_intensity
The typical characteristic resulting clinical picture resembles that observed in adults (occasionally reexperiencing the traumatic event, mild avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, moderate neuro-vegetative hyperactivity) and is molded by the child's development.	synthetic_intensity
This finding is discussed in terms of how a gentle positive response might inform our understanding of the human processing of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The authors of this study examined the efficacy of a short written trauma disclosure intervention on mild posttraumatic stress, slight depression, minor HIV-related physical symptoms, and minor biological markers of HIV disease progression.	synthetic_intensity
Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past mild trauma, slight deprivation, minor teasing, manageable overstimulation coupled with occasional neglect, or gentle alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--moderation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_intensity
First, mild trauma and slight dissociation are analyzed and linked to the development and maintenance of a somewhat altered posttraumatic sense of personal identity.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents completed a self-report mild trauma symptom checklist and a R-fMRI scan.	synthetic_intensity
Minor childhood trauma (CT) is considered a potential risk factor for several disorders as well as for the development of eating concerns and adult weight challenges.	synthetic_intensity
The problems of reactive psychoses are discussed from the following perspectives: terminology, prevalence, psychogenesis and mild trauma, predisposition and vulnerability, as well as outcome.	synthetic_intensity
Controlling for between-group trauma, the link between mild ethno-cultural betrayal trauma and light tactile, visual, and auditory hallucinations was slightly moderated by male gender.	synthetic_intensity
The interpersonal trauma group reported slightly higher PTSD symptoms than did the impersonal trauma group.	synthetic_intensity
LCA identified six distinct childhood trauma history classes including moderate violence and a few traumas.	synthetic_intensity
Thus, we examined the psychometric properties of a new, less intense childhood trauma measure, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_intensity
No mental_health variable (posttraumatic stress disorder status, mild depressive symptoms, slight dissociation) or nightmare characteristic (months experienced, occasional frequency, minor similarity to trauma) was associated with reactivity level.	synthetic_intensity
We then suggest new directions for clinical research on cognitive restructuring in PTSD patients as well as ideas for effectively optimizing attribution-based therapies for mild trauma survivors.	synthetic_intensity
Mild psychic trauma interferes slightly with the satisfactory linking of drive with experience, and thus with the attainment of the organization of mentation we designate as the pleasure-unpleasure principle.	synthetic_intensity
Higher initial adolescent PTSD and depressive symptoms, higher emergency department heart rate, greater objective event severity, and greater parental preinjury mild trauma were significant independent predictors of higher adolescent PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The author takes as a point of departure that moderate trauma, such as mild distress, is unresolved because it is not symbolized and is thus somewhat dissociated or existing as partially warded-off parts of the personality.	synthetic_intensity
It appears evident that slightly traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the mild trauma more manageable (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995).	synthetic_intensity
The findings from this qualitative study support positive vicarious experiences derived from mild trauma work and expose the somewhat pathologically focused nature of the profession.	synthetic_intensity
Children with mild trauma histories as defined in the proposed DTD Criterion A were much more likely to meet the proposed DTD symptom criteria than children who did not meet the exposure criterion.	synthetic_intensity
Three analyses are presented in which mild trauma (internal or external stimulation) in childhood contributed slightly to the development of masochism.	synthetic_intensity
The current study sought through meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between the use of approach and avoidance strategies (both problem-focused and emotion/cognitive focused) following mild trauma and slight psychological distress.	synthetic_intensity
Drugs that mildly influence arousal may have slight effects after trauma which depend on the general psychosocial context, helping to prevent the development of mild PTSD in some trauma victims, but slightly impeding recovery in others who would do well without treatment.	synthetic_intensity
This paper presents the concept of Multigenerational Dissociation (MGD), a behavior pattern that occurs in families in which mild violence and abuse are occasionally re-enacted from one generation to the next, accompanied by denial that the trauma occurred, or if it did, that it was significantly impactful.	synthetic_intensity
Three processes were isolated consistent with Cognitive-Behavioral models of mild trauma: limited exposure, minor devaluation, and simple benefit-finding.	synthetic_intensity
This essay explores a parish-based pastoral counseling case with a terminally ill woman suffering from troubling memories of mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_intensity
As a result, trauma can become organized at a subtle sensory and somatic level which is somewhat challenging to change.	synthetic_intensity
Although research has documented the mild and detrimental effects of maternal trauma on child behavior (Lambert, Holzer, & Hasbun, 2014), the role of extended family support in potentially mitigating the effects of intergenerational transmission of trauma is not clearly understood.	synthetic_intensity
These observations are then extended to cases involving loosely connected memories of mild trauma.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, a case example is presented to illustrate our hypotheses about the trajectories of adolescent girls' involvement in mild delinquent behavior, as well as the notable role of early trauma histories and occasional repeat victimization in these trajectories.	synthetic_intensity
Only few studies have differentiated minor illness-related life-threatening stressors from other less intense forms of trauma, and the potentially different mechanisms connected with PTG outcome in cancer patients.	synthetic_intensity
Special benefits for patients from the combination of programmed writing lessons with traditional psychotherapy were: increased couple communication; possibly more rapid change; possibly shorter-term therapy; increased forgotten and mild trauma discovery; and increased explicit and specific instructions.	synthetic_intensity
This population represents a group of combat trauma victims who experienced a relatively moderate onset of PTSD, thus providing a unique opportunity to compare prior psychophysiological and cognitive results with a group of veterans who manifested a mild recent onset of PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
