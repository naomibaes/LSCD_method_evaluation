Aims of the study were (a) to identify premigration correlates (e.g., mild trauma in home countries), (b) to identify migration-related correlates (e.g., stable immigration status, brief time spent separated from children during migration), and (c) to identify premigration and migration correlates that accounted for minimal variance after controlling for nonmigration-related correlates (e.g., neighborhood crime, parents' psychological discomfort).	synthetic_intensity
