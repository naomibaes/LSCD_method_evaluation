Derived from the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the 12-item GDS-Veterans is designed to include items that subtly represent the thoughts and feelings of older veterans in relation to their war experiences.	synthetic_intensity
While randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of treatment for mild depression in HIV/AIDS, the practical implementation of evidence-based treatments in real-world settings remains a manageable challenge.	synthetic_intensity
Dimensions of TEI were associated with caregiver readiness to use intervention strategies, mild anxiety, low-level depression, and patient minor problem behaviors, but not with patient functional status.	synthetic_intensity
Higher parental depression and minor medical symptoms and more mild family stressors and sibling issues, and lower burden of illness on the family predicted some problems among the patients.	synthetic_intensity
