Response preparation produced three kinds of effect on the conditioned reflex elicited 200 msec before the end of the gentle preparatory period: mild depression of the conditioned reflex which was maximum at the 150 msec conditioning interval; slight enhancement of the conditioned reflex which was maximum at the 300 msec conditioning interval; and, when the soleus muscle was calmly involved in the execution of the voluntary response, an additional subtle depression of the conditioned reflex at each conditioning interval.	synthetic_low
Amphetamine did not resemble tranylcypromine or other antidepressants, and produced a variety of effects at least some of which indicated a potential mild increase rather than reduction in slight depression consequent to chronic administration.	synthetic_low
