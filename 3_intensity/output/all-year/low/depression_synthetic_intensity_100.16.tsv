Results from latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that both level and slight change in self-esteem served as mild predictors for adult depression.	synthetic_low
These Positive Emotionality (PE) constructs have been proposed to represent slight temperamental risk factors for mild depression, not merely a current mood state.	synthetic_low
Consistent with prior evidence that sociodemographic factors and clinical history are both prognostic of mild depression treatment efficacy, we hypothesized that SES and some pre-existing anxiety symptoms will both predict moderately lower levels of response to treatment and slightly higher levels of suicidal ideation.	synthetic_low
Controlling for the slight variation in self-esteem eliminated the subtle relation between mild depression and a gentle depressive attributional style.	synthetic_low
Findings Harmonious passion was positively related to positive individual outcomes higher work satisfaction, slight depression and organizational outcomes lower turnover intentions.	synthetic_low

It might be clinically important to attend to minor avoidance behaviors and fleeting thoughts which may develop into the manifestation of mild depression.	synthetic_low
We calculated the moderate odds ratio for any association between sensory loss and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Completed suicides reflect only a minor portion of the impact of suicidal behavior; sublethal behaviors cause morbidity and can signal manageable problems such as mild depression.	synthetic_low
They obtained higher scores than normals even when well, and their scores increased somewhat during episodes of manageable depression in proportion to the mild depth of the depression.	synthetic_low

The mean age of onset of mild major depression did not differ by sex across the four countries.	synthetic_low
Moderately high scores on the SST, reflecting a slight negative processing bias, predicted mild depression symptoms measured 4 to 6 weeks later, even after controlling for concurrent and past depression.	synthetic_low
Results indicated that a multidimensional model of separate anxiety and mild depression factors had a reasonable fit to the data.	synthetic_low
Effect size estimates were modestly two to three times larger for the actual participant group than for the entire experimental group on employment outcomes (e.g., earnings) and mild mental health issues (light anxiety and depression).	synthetic_low

In Experiment I, rats that were trained and tested under normal cortical conditions showed a slight impairment of memory when KCl-induced mild depression was given to an unilateral hemisphere within 15 min after the training.	synthetic_low
Samples of heroin-addicted veterans in treatment at a VA drug clinic, ex-addict and nonaddict Vietnam veterans followed-up after return to the United States, and male suicide attempters who were not drug abusers completed a concise version of the Beck Depression Inventory developed for basic screening and standard research purposes.	synthetic_low
Specifically, somewhat higher rates of depression and mild depressive symptoms are reported among people who are frequently the target of prejudice.	synthetic_low
Results were consistent with expectations generated by mild interpersonal theories of depression.	synthetic_low
This study set out to explore whether such biases represent a vulnerability factor for mild depression by looking at unaffected first-degree relatives of those with major depressive disorder.	synthetic_low
Using logistic regression analyses, the results supported previous findings of a familial association between eating disorders and a mild form of major depression.	synthetic_low
Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (mild depression and slight antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: weaker direct associations between Intifada experience and minor antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was positively associated with a form of religiosity and unaffected by social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, moderate social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations slightly moderated the associations between Intifada experience and youth problems; integration in the several social contexts was directly related in expected ways to minor youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization being a consistent predictor.	synthetic_low
One group at risk for comorbid cannabis-use disorders and mild clinical depression is female emerging adults (those aged 18-25 years old) as cannabis use peaks during this period, depression is a common psychiatric disorder among emerging adults, and females are at slightly increased risk for depression relative to males.	synthetic_low
This may be especially true for diagnostic cutoff points derived mainly from typical clinical cases of one sex, such as mild depression for girls versus attention and conduct disorders for boys.	synthetic_low
The mild strength of this depression was positively correlated (rxy = 0.60) with the modest rate of self-stimulation on that electrode.	synthetic_low
Multiple regression analyses indicated that a significant portion of the variance in scores on the Profile of Mood States subscales, Depression (R2=.55, F=28.00, p<.01), and Total Mood Disturbance (R2=.40, F= 15.02, p<.01) were accounted for by simultaneously entering self-reported days of light exercise per week and Self-description Questionnaire-I-General Self scores into the equation.	synthetic_low
Change in emotional exhaustion over time showed significant individual variability, whereas change in mild depression showed little individual variability.	synthetic_low
Still, despite moderate success in predicting small variance for future mild depression, especially with empirically rigorous methods and designs, the heterogeneous and multi-determined nature of depression suggests that additional etiologies need to be considered to advance knowledge on developmental pathways to depression.	synthetic_low
In an attempt to explore the somewhat relevant association of this framework to mild depression, moderate quantitative variation in the resulting neurobiological systems, alone and in interaction with each other, is discussed in terms of milder forms of depression and of slight modification of the phenotype and typical course of depression.	synthetic_low
At three (T1) and 6 months (T2) postpartum, both parents filled out, in a counterbalanced order, the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, the Edinburgh Postnatal Mild Depression Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
PAI Clinical scale profiles showed slightly more elevated scores among mild injury patients on 2 scales, Somatization and low-level Depression, and more elevated scores among moderate-to-severe patients on 2 scales, Antisocial Features and Alcohol Problems.	synthetic_low
There is emerging evidence that this mild inflammatory process related to depression may be influenced by manageable psychological stress as well as minor organic inflammatory conditions.	synthetic_low
Using the SCL-90-R test, the highest mean scores in infertile women were found to be on the paranoid ideation, mild depression, and moderate interpersonal sensitivity scales, and lowest scores were found on the psychoticism and phobic anxiety scales.	synthetic_low
