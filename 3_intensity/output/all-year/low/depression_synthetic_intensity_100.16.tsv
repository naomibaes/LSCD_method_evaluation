Only clinical variables predicted outcome, as patients with mild psychotic symptoms had more rapid initial response to ECT, and patients who had relapsed 2 months after the end of ECT had slightly higher depression ratings at day 14 of treatment than treatment responders.	synthetic_intensity
Its course may often be characterized by noticeable levels of anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
These findings give further weight to the contention that somewhat adverse parenting in childhood, particularly a maternal parenting style typified by slightly reduced care, is a significant risk factor for mild adult depression.	synthetic_intensity
Accordingly, our aims were to independently assess the associations between moderate childhood adversity, occasional life-event stress in remote (earlier than the last 5 years), and recent adulthood and cardiometabolic risk, and to determine the role of psychological factors including balanced personality, effective coping, and manageable depression in these associations.	synthetic_intensity
