The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to examine the psychometrics of 2 dissociation measures--the Dissociation scale of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) and the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire-20 (SDQ-20); and second, to evaluate the relationship between dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in deaf adults.	natural
In this response to Doris Brothers discussion in which she describes the process by which a survival-threatening event can create emotional meaning, I have attempted to illustrate two aspects of trauma; the trauma of a bad event and the trauma of nothing.	natural

Neuroscientific findings have established that brain injury due to trauma (TBI) and brain immaturity of adolescents result in a diminished self-control and therefore are considered mitigations of criminal culpability in forensic settings.	natural
The subjects were evaluated with an assessment battery using a semi-structured interview for socio-demographic characteristics, APD section of SCID-II, an adapted version of the Structured Trauma Interview, and Dissociative Experiences Scale.	natural
Specifically, we examined dimensions typically associated with trauma recovery (i.e., psychological functioning, coping, emotion regulation) and features of the trauma (i.e., number and recency of traumatic events, average, and maximal distress).	natural
I examine potential problems with separating the trauma diagnoses (i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder, depersonalisation/derealisation disorder, and other trauma- and stressor-related or dissociative disorders) from FSIAD in the DSM-5.	natural
Writing enabled organizing the experience into a narrative and distancing from the trauma, which was helpful.	natural
These four criteria appear to remain clustered together in childhood trauma victims even when other diagnosis would appear more appropriate.	natural
Based on a study of 681 German police officers who were violently assaulted we analyze first general pre-, peri- and post-traumatic risk factors (e.g. trauma severity, psychological adjustment, social support) of post-traumatic stress symptoms, second police-specific factors (e.g. colleague support) and third differences in the impact of these factors comparing male and female officers.	natural
The Portland Digit Recognition Test (PDRT), a forced-choice measure of recognition memory designed for the purpose of assessing the possibility of malingering, was administered to two groups of clinically referred patients seeking financial compensation for injuries including a mild head trauma group and a brain dysfunction group and also to a third group with brain dysfunction not seeking compensation.	natural
Additionally, several risk and buffering variables suggested by trauma research were tested to determine their ability to predict present posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology.	natural
The study reports cases of SBS by age of the child at the time of the inflicted trauma from the data set of the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome using cases entered between January 1, 2003 and August 31, 2004.	natural

Females with the experience of minor childhood trauma and/or some adversity were more likely to report a lifetime history of elevated mood and to be married or in a de facto relationship.	synthetic_low
Compared to the low/no-symptom class, the PTSD class had moderate levels of exposure to all PTE domains including childhood-related difficulties, witnessing violence, human rights trauma, and significant losses, as well as ongoing challenges relating to displacement and separation from families, safety concerns, and limited access to basic needs and health care.	synthetic_low
Associations include mild Multiple Sclerosis, GUillain Barre Syndrome, urethral sphincter dyssynergia, minimal vulvar pain syndromes (nine cases), uneventful post-hysterectomy, slight Lichen Sclerosis (five cases), minor spondylolisthesis, mild vaginismus and minor genital or pelvic trauma.	synthetic_low
A warm relationship with a caregiver was a significant moderator of mild trauma and youth report of minor internalizing behaviors.	synthetic_low

Mothers were mostly impoverished, struggling to meet basic needs, and coping with mild trauma, mental health problems, substance abuse and domestic violence.	synthetic_low
Those who lose a loved one in a somewhat traumatic manner can develop childhood traumatic grief (CTG), where typical grieving is moderately hindered by trauma symptoms, causing mild impairment in daily functioning, relationships, and academic pursuits.	synthetic_low
Of students exposed to mildly traumatic events, more than one third (35.44, n = 28) also reported at least 1 form of related institutional betrayal, which somewhat correlated with mild posttraumatic distress in some participants, when controlling for lifetime trauma history.	synthetic_low
This study examined the effectiveness of traumatic incident reduction (TIR) among a sample of adults with minor trauma histories through a review of client records.	synthetic_low
However, unlike human suffering, the wide range of minor, recurrent, and chronic stressors and mild trauma on animals is rarely evaluated.	synthetic_low
The issues addressed in these studies of dyadic coping, minor collective trauma, gender issues, and protective coping provide useful new information and, as is inevitable, raise minor new questions.	synthetic_low
Participants completed measures of past 30-day alcohol consumption, minor trauma history, current PTSD symptoms, mild anxiety sensitivity, and alcohol-use motives.	synthetic_low
Conclusions drawn from these results highlight the need to build inclusive practices that support diversity into existing minor trauma services in Australia.	synthetic_low
Family treatment is also described in terms of its importance in helping Ryan and his family recover from the sexual abuse trauma and other somewhat distressing events.	synthetic_low
However, children and adolescents with PTSD estimated all negative events as significantly more likely to happen to others than to themselves, with this other-referent bias being strongest for events matched to their mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Bootstrapped mediation analysis and follow-up moderated mediation analyses showed that mild childhood trauma significantly mediated the relation between childhood gender nonconformity and experiences of sexual victimization for men but not for women.	synthetic_low
Overall, participants reported a slight reduction in mild trauma symptoms, but only support persons experienced a notable increase in moderate posttraumatic growth from pretest to posttest.	synthetic_low
Despite evidence of moderate rates of mild childhood and adult trauma in schizophrenia, the area remains somewhat under-researched.	synthetic_low
We review 17 studies that simultaneously assessed parental and child functioning following mild trauma.	synthetic_low
While boundary violations by training analysts are not uncommon, the specific trauma experienced by 'bystanders' such as candidates and supervisees is lightly touched upon in the literature, with some responsiveness from institutes to the educational problems that are generated.	synthetic_low
The convergent validity of the TSCYC and the mild Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children was weak, perhaps illustrating the slight lack of agreement often found between children and caregivers and illustrating the need for a balanced multi-informant approach to screening and assessment of sexually abused children.	synthetic_low
Lenore Terr (1991) proposed a framework for childhood trauma that distinguishes between simple single-incident trauma (Type I) and occasional repeated or prolonged trauma (Type II).	synthetic_low
Using the striking imagery of Francesca Woodman's photographs, my patient and I enter the subtle breach in her mind that mild trauma creates.	synthetic_low
Conversely, those participants who disclosed a minor trauma after interacting with a cold, distant experimenter did not experience increases in distress or report a significant amount of insight gained as the result of written disclosure.	synthetic_low
How people respond to and make sense of their experiences due to the minor ruptures of trauma and devastation remains vital in grief recovery.	synthetic_low
In addition, structured therapeutic games help caregivers develop strengths and abilities that they can use to help their children cope with mild abuse and trauma and facilitates the development of some posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_low
Differences in mild trauma focus between treatments in the same study did not predict dropout.	synthetic_low
Rather than reinforce the mild trauma and continue to frame children as passive victims, the study reported here aimed to help children reframe their experiences through active engagement in participatory research projects.	synthetic_low
