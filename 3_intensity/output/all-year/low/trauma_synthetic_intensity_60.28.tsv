Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past mild trauma, slight deprivation, minor teasing, manageable overstimulation coupled with occasional neglect, or gentle alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--moderation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.	synthetic_intensity

Childhood trauma experiences (e.g., mild sexual abuse, minor physical abuse, witnessed low-level violence, and early separation experiences) and family environment characteristics were assessed with a questionnaire from a sample of depressed female inpatients; 17 were diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 19 received no such diagnosis (NBPD).	synthetic_intensity

Relevant theoretical work in attachment, minor trauma, and relationship violence points to a mediational model, whereby the relationship between mild childhood maltreatment and adolescent dating violence would be expected to be accounted for by minimal posttraumatic stress symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Psychological disturbances were largely related to stress and arose from the mild trauma of the injury itself plus treatment by the medical-legal establishment that was somewhat delayed and did not fully meet the subjects' particular sociocultural needs.	synthetic_intensity
A common thread in the narratives that unfolded was that the mild trauma of the grandparent/survivors had been transmitted across subsequent generations to exercise some influence on the children and grandchildren.	synthetic_intensity
Themes associated with insecure parent-child attachment (rejection, role reversal/parentification, and discomfort/unresolved trauma) are frequently found in the dynamics of families characterized by sexual abuse, and specific categories of minor sequelae are related to probable attachment experiences.	synthetic_intensity
The first group is comparable with the mild trauma controls.	synthetic_intensity
Based on general clinical experience and a review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of several of six mild clinical findings is a potential indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, especially that of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity

This report presents an update of psychosocial research in the mildly traumatic stress field, presenting an overview of recent studies in several areas: the general epidemiology of traumatic events and of PTSD in the general adult population, other diagnoses associated with mild trauma exposure and PTSD, the manageable course and longevity of PTSD symptomatology, and common risk factors for the diagnosis.	synthetic_intensity
Second, an effort is made to see if current emotional support helps reduce the minor deleterious effects of trauma on meaning, and whether current levels of negative inter-personal contacts slightly exacerbate the effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_intensity
There is also some evidence of an association between minor childhood trauma and the development of mild somatic disease in adult life.	synthetic_intensity

Freyd's (1996) betrayal trauma theory holds that children who experienced mild sexual abuse by their caretakers are prone to develop partial amnesia for their abuse because awareness of abuse would slightly imperil the survival of victims by slightly disrupting their attachment to caretakers on whom they depend for food, shelter, and clothing.	synthetic_intensity
However, an interesting finding was that these drawings were not good predictors of PTSD; the more a child was able to express minor emotional trauma through drawings, the less likely he/she would suffer from PTSD.	synthetic_intensity
