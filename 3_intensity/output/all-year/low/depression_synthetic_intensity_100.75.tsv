This study used a longitudinal design to assess whether adolescent personal resilience characteristics during adolescence protected against mild psychosocial impairment, low-level depression, and slight anxiety 3 years later.	synthetic_intensity
Furthermore, mild symptoms of depression gently mediated the relationship between some aspects of sexual function and male participant status as a patient or control.	synthetic_intensity
Participants' depression scores declined moderately over time, and 75% of participants experienced at least a mild 50% change on a self-report measure of depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
The risk of suicide associated with PTSD and mild depression when examined separately was similar, HR = 7.1 (95 confidence interval (CI): 4.9, 10.3) and HR = 7.2 (95 CI: 4.8, 10.8), respectively.	synthetic_intensity
Results emphasize the helpful moderating role fathers may play in reducing or minimizing the mild long-term effects of maternal depression during a child's infancy on minor later child behavior problems.	synthetic_intensity
Multiple regression analyses for male and female patients and spouses revealed that in the four groups self-concept was significantly related to the moderate severity of depression.	synthetic_intensity
African Americans and whites participated equally in the assessment process, and both groups presented with similar psychiatric treatment histories, mild severity of depression, moderate psychosocial functioning, and a manageable severity of medical illness.	synthetic_intensity
Data on the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) of behavior and function, global assessment of mild presence of depression and dementia as well as routine discharge outcomes were collated.	synthetic_intensity

Synthetic human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) was administered as an intravenous bolus (100 micrograms) to 13 patients experiencing mild endogenous depression and to 12 healthy volunteers.	synthetic_intensity
