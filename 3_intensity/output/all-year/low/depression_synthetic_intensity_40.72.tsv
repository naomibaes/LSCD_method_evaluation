Univariate and bivariate analyses of cross-sectional data on mild depressive symptomatology, and typical psychosocial stress and coping strategies before and during recovery yielded the following findings: (a) Nearly a third of the sample reported scores slightly above the 16-point cut-off on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, indicating a moderate risk for depression; (b) over half had a past history of diagnosed depression; (c) perceived stress in 16 life domains significantly decreased from prerecovery to recovery; (d) by recovery, participants subtly increased their use of positive strategies, but they continued use some negative ones; and (e) risk for moderate depressive symptomatology was greatest among those who were married or cohabiting, had a history of clinical depression, and experienced moderate perceived stress in areas of money and emotional and physical health.	synthetic_intensity
