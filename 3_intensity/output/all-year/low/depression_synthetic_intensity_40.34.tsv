During the treatment period, there were significant reductions in depression (P = .001) and anxiety (P = .006) symptoms and an increased use of distraction skills (P < .001).	natural
Despite limitations, this study demonstrated that the link between neuroticism and depression is explained by both emotion dysregulation and psychological inflexibility and that specific emotion dysregulation facets may be at play in adolescent depression.	natural
These data indicate that BRS is impaired in otherwise healthy patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk.	natural
Generally, higher parental depression and anxiety were only found to be associated with greater disordered eating attitudes and behaviors among adolescents who reported poorer (versus stronger) emotional awareness/expression skills and less (versus greater) ability to regulate emotions.	natural
Participants completed self-report measures of symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, loneliness, number and nature of friendships, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, and self-esteem.	natural

Children living with parents treated for mild depression are at risk for minor problems irrespective of the parent's course, possibly due to some family functioning issues.	synthetic_intensity

These findings support the separation of anxiety disorders into at least two distinct forms, particularly when considering their potential role in the etiology of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The PSI scales also showed an appropriate degree of independence from each other except for depression and anxiety where the intercorrelation was mildly noticeable.	synthetic_intensity
Moreover, we found those who had been victims of early abuse had somewhat higher current Beck Depression Inventory scores, suggesting mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The present study examined the relationship between minor indices of life change and mild measures of depression and anxiety as a function of subjects' locus of control orientation.	synthetic_intensity
This study determines the minor effects of moderate functional impairment, slight cognitive impairment, and brief duration of care of the elderly on caregivers' mild depression, and identifies the factors that influence this relationship.	synthetic_intensity

All childbearing recent migrant women should be considered at risk for mild postpartum depression.	synthetic_intensity
We examined the extent to which the association between rheumatoid arthritis and mild depression could be attributed to manageable levels of pain (using contrasts), minor sociodemographic differences between groups (combining methodologically restricted studies), and straightforward methods of assessing depression (examining heterogeneity across studies).	synthetic_intensity
Females also reported slightly more felt depression after being mildly frustrated or lightly attacked than did control females, a pattern of emotional response not shown by male Ss.	synthetic_intensity
We also found a slight relation between younger age and mild depression onset.	synthetic_intensity
This study examined three factors that may subtly influence cognitive vulnerability to mild depression and anxiety: subjects' perceptions of their supportive relationships with their parents and the generally positive climate in their family of origin (socialization); gentle self-focused attention (focusing attention inwardly, on the self); and occasional symptoms of depression and minor anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Although there was no significant group difference for BDI raw scores or BDI score categories (i.e., Normal Functioning, Moderate Depression, Moderate-Severe Depression, Extremely Severe Depression), results revealed that 16 (50) of the intrafamilial abuse mothers, 18 (69) of the extrafamilial mothers, and 23 (50) of the mothers of nonabused children reported experiencing at least a mild degree of depression.	synthetic_intensity
