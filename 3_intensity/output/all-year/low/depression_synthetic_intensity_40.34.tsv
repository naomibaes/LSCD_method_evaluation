In youth, tendencies to mildly dampen positive affect may be associated with a slightly less ability to flexibly upregulate neural reward responding following a loss, possibly leading to the development of affective inflexibility and a mild vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_low
Data from retrospective self-reports of youth exposure to and involvement in political violence, and self-reports of current individual functioning (mild depression and slight antisocial behavior) and integration in several social contexts (family, peer relations, religion, education, and community), revealed: weaker direct associations between Intifada experience and minor antisocial behavior and depression (females only); Intifada experience was positively associated with a form of religiosity and unaffected by social integration in family, school, and peer relations; in some cases, moderate social integration in family, education, religion, and peer relations slightly moderated the associations between Intifada experience and youth problems; integration in the several social contexts was directly related in expected ways to minor youth problem behaviors, with neighborhood disorganization being a consistent predictor.	synthetic_low
Although numerous reports claim to have found a slight relationship between mild endogenous depression and diabetes mellitus, our data do not imply a direct relationship between serum cortisol and blood glucose levels of mildly endogenously depressed patients.	synthetic_low
These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to slight weight change (r = -0.21, p = .31) or mild depression improvement to basic compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p = .97).	synthetic_low
In this study, adolescent mothers (n=62), pregnant teenagers (n=63), and non-pregnant and nonparenting (n=60) adolescents enrolled in public high schools completed measures of socioeconomic status, mild depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-esteem, and social supports.	synthetic_low

Similar results were observed when the analysis was restricted to cases with a diagnosis of Moderate Major Depression, Bipolar Depression, or Bipolar Mixed state, Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive or Mixed type.	synthetic_low
It acknowledged there was no evidence that screening for mild depression leads to improved outcomes in cardiovascular populations but still recommended routine screening without providing an alternative evidence-based explanation.	synthetic_low
Measures of minor negative life change events, daily hassles, and relative self-efficacy were used to predict mild depression, minimal psychosomatic symptoms, and slightly negative wellbeing both in concurrent and timelag designs.	synthetic_low
