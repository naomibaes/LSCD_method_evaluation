A survey of an inner-city population of working-class and single mothers is described and the prevalence of anxiety and depression reported using two related diagnostic schemes, Bedford College caseness and DSM-III-R. This acts as an introduction to an analysis which indicates that moderate experiences in childhood and adolescence (involving parental indifference, and sexual and physical abuse) considerably raise risk of both depression and anxiety conditions (with the exception of mild agoraphobia and simple phobia) in adult life.	synthetic_intensity

Ss who did not report evidence of alcohol or other drug abuse (n = 144) reported less concerning consequences of marijuana use and experienced reduced general psychological distress than Ss who also reported lifetime (n = 165) or current abuse (n = 73) of other substances in addition to marijuana.	synthetic_intensity

This research established that exposure to substances of abuse or minor stress slightly increases the activity of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) in the NAc, which leads to a marginally elevated expression of the opioid peptide dynorphin that in turn causes some signs of depressive- and anxiety-related disorders.	synthetic_intensity
It is proposed that clinicians refrain from telling sexually abused children that the experience of abuse was not their fault, since such well-intentioned assurances can slightly diminish the sense of power and control that the children may feel in addition to their guilt.	synthetic_intensity
Although some research shows that child abuse is used as a slight mitigating factor for juvenile offenders (i.e., elicits somewhat less punitive sentences), surveys of juvenile court officials reveal that it is considered an aggravating factor.	synthetic_intensity
Our results indicate that mother perpetrators of minor physical abuse not only face a slightly higher likelihood of removal than mother perpetrators of neglect, but are more at risk for losing their children than father perpetrators of both mild physical abuse and neglect.	synthetic_intensity

Results are discussed in terms of: (a) the need for finer grained analyses of social functioning in adolescent substance abusers, (b) the potential value of basic skills intervention for a subgroup of these individuals, and (c) the need for longitudinal data to more clearly explicate patterns and sequencing of slight social (mal)adjustment, affective disorder, and onset of minor substance abuse in this population.	synthetic_intensity
