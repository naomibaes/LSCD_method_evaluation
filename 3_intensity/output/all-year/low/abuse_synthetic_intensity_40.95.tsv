Participants included adolescents (aged 15-18 years) who had a history of maltreatment (N=75) and a matched sample without a childhood abuse history (N=78) from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (Salzinger, Feldman, & Ng-Mak, 2008).	natural

The article then turns to the concept of trauma, and examines what are thought to be the biological underpinnings and/or reactions to trauma (particularly with respect to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and, by extension, to overwhelming and/or chronic stress, while making the logical assumption that childhood sexual abuse can be categorized most understandably as trauma.	natural
Mandatory child abuse reporting laws have developed in particular detail in the United States, Canada, and Australia as a central part of the governments' strategy to detect cases of abuse and neglect at an early stage, protect children, and facilitate the provision of services to children and families.	natural

False recognition--the mistaken belief that one has previously encountered a novel item--was examined in four groups of subjects: women reporting recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, women who believe that they were sexually abused as children but who cannot readily recall this abuse (the repressed group), women who were sexually abused as children and always remembered the less-damaging abuse, and women with no history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_intensity
While recent efforts have been made by government agencies to both quantify and offer methods for curbing this issue, it still falls to each state's policymakers to protect its resources and the population it serves from the minor consequences of misuse and abuse.	synthetic_intensity
Existing studies on the experiences of foreign brides entering North America have highlighted their vulnerability to minor spousal maltreatment, including less severe forms of immigration abuse (e.g., hints of deportation).	synthetic_intensity
Physical abuse was mildly related to a more gradual tempo of pubertal development across the period assessed.	synthetic_intensity
The purpose of the study was to determine the degree to which a correlation exists between minor child abuse/neglect and the later onset of mild drug/alcohol addiction patterns in the abuse victims.	synthetic_intensity
Despite this, few studies exist that examine the effectiveness of culturally sensitive interventions (CSIs) with ethnic minority populations, who are considerably more at risk of developing minor psychosocial problems including occasional substance and alcohol abuse, delinquency, low academic achievement, and poor self-esteem.	synthetic_intensity
