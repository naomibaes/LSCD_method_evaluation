For accelerometers, light-intensity physical activity positively associated with psychological well-being (n = 150) and negatively associated with depression (n = 99); moderate intensity negatively associated with pain severity (n = 419) and positively associated with psychological well-being; sedentary behavior negatively associated with psychological well-being and positively associated with depression (ps < .05).	natural
For depression, men and women showed similar relationships between depression and nonadherence at high levels of depression; however, at low levels of depression (i.e., a more normal mood state), men were less adherent compared with women.	natural
Continuation/Maintenance (i.e., monthly) PTI has been shown to be beneficial to some but not all older adults with major depression.	natural
Research suggests sleep disturbance plays a role in depression and risk for suicidal behavior (i.e., ideation, attempts, death by suicide).	natural
It was predicted that the negative effects (i.e. low life satisfaction and/or high depression) of motive incongruence would be reduced at: (a) higher levels of self-directedness and self-disclosure; and (b) lower levels of external LOC.	natural
Additional findings indicated that IU is more strongly associated with symptoms of GAD, OCD, and social anxiety than symptoms of adult separation anxiety disorder and depression.	natural
Overall, we conclude that subnormal DEX/GH secretion is not specific to depression.	natural
Thus, experiencing a NLE is likely to lead to an increase in depressive symptomatology only for adolescents with primarily negative PPSAs, perhaps in interaction with prior depression, at least for the specific NLE studied here.	natural

Maternal depression and paternal alcoholism were related to the risk for depression in the child.	natural
Emotional distress was reported by 37 of participants, including depression (23), anxiety (15), and suicidal ideation (10).	natural
The study reports findings on the validity and sensitivity to change of the depression subscale (ISR-D).	natural
The results support the social reinforcement theory of depression and provide a theoretical account of how the variables are related based on correlation methods.	natural
Paternal unemployment, care by welfare agencies and having a psychiatric disorder, specifically depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, was associated with a higher risk for both suicidal ideation and attempts.	natural
Multidisciplinary approaches and longitudinal research designs that extend across development are needed to more clearly and usefully elucidate the role of the HPA axis in depression.	natural
On the questionnaire, group differences were not statistically significant, but the mean anxiety and stress scores were marginally higher for the subjects who remained in the red office, the mean mild depression score was slightly higher for the subjects who remained in the blue office, and the mean arousal score was somewhat higher for those subjects who switched to the different-colored office.	synthetic_intensity
Adolescents in the Katrina sample reported a family mobilizing strategy that reflected an increased reliance and seeking of extra-familial, community-based support but slightly reduced self-esteem and mild symptoms of distress and depression.	synthetic_intensity
Supporting both these notions, the treatment of choice for PMDD, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), is also the primary treatment for mild depression and for anxiety disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Individuals who are intolerant of ambiguity are hypothesized to be motivated to rapidly resolve uncertainties introduced by fleeting rumination about negative life events and yet to find themselves occasionally unable to escape the negative implications of this rumination; hence, to attain resolution, they may adopt slight negative expectancies that they hold with some certainty, that is, they ultimately come to experience mild depressive predictive certainty and depression (Andersen & Lyon, 1987; Andersen, 1990).	synthetic_intensity
Hospital admission statistics for mild depression and mania have shown subtle seasonal patterns.	synthetic_intensity
This study tested predictions based on the emotion context insensitivity (ECI) hypothesis of Rottenberg, Gross, and Gotlib (2005) that a nonclinical sample of people with mild depressive symptoms would show somewhat reduced responses to both positive and negative stimuli relative to people without minor depression and would show a slightly enhanced response to novelty.	synthetic_intensity
To date, two randomized, double-blind trials of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) have shown that antidepressant drugs are effective in treating mild adolescent depression.	synthetic_intensity
Using a subsample of females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 4,386), the study employs multivariate regression analyses to estimate the effects of youth forcible rape on the popularity, centrality, and density of adolescent friendship networks and to determine whether mild depression and attachment to others (e.g., to friends and to school) subtly mediate these effects.	synthetic_intensity
Sixty-five children aged 7-12 years who met criteria for one or more Axis I anxiety disorders (25 with comorbid nonanxiety diagnoses) completed standardized measures of anxiety, mild depression, and coping style.	synthetic_intensity
