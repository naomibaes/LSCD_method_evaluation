However, the available reports of evaluation of day hospital effectiveness suggest that such treatment is somewhat comparable to both inpatient and outpatient mental_health treatment in effecting some level of symptomatic and social change, and these effects may be somewhat more lasting than those obtained in the more traditional treatment settings.	synthetic_intensity
If, when conducting our routine work, be it as Director of a CMHC, research scientist, social activist, or mental_health practitioner, we see, we have a basic world view that simply focuses on the communityembeddedness of our programs and the persons they are designed to serve, if we develop a perspective that lightly centers on the creation and modest expansion of resources for our community, and if our actions for the quick fix are embedded in a general vision about the long haul, then we can, by both word and deed, assert both the basic distinction of community psychology and further the goals underlying the creation of our field.	synthetic_intensity

Conclusions were drawn to the effect that (a) meanings of mental_health constructs group together differently depending on the basic type of analysis employed, (b) ordinary happiness may be considered the adequate representative of the general array of mental_health constructs employed by gerontologists, (c) happiness has been conceptualized either as containing current affect and simple dispositional components or current affect components only, (d) contemporary models of happiness favour neither the mild expansionist nor moderate contractionist positions as a means of attaining happiness, and (e) simple questions as to the basic relative contributions to happiness of the affective and dispositional components represent a notable question for standard future research.	synthetic_intensity

Findings suggest that (a) students might be unsure of whether or not their training programs have a standard procedure for dealing with mildly problematic students; (b) the minor issues they observe typically involve basic interpersonal skills; (c) consistent with other general mental_health programs, school psychology graduate students commonly talk in a relaxed manner with their peers or simply avoid contact with the moderately problematic peer when they have minor concerns rather than approach faculty; (d) the majority (49.4) of the respondents feel that faculty or training directors hold some responsibility for the routine identification of problematic peers but that students have a basic duty to provide information to the teaching staff if they believe there might be an overlooked issue.	synthetic_intensity
