Self-esteem, overall life satisfaction, and anxiety and low-level depression were comparable in the two counselling types, both at outset and after counselling, however, individuals with internal locii of control scored higher for self-esteem on post-test, and slightly lower for mild depression and anxiety, irrespective of type of counselling.	synthetic_low
Actual weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not mild depression; only treatments that produced actual weight loss predicted increased self-esteem whereas minor improvements in depression were independent of weight loss.	synthetic_low
A mathematical model is presented to formally express and extend understanding of the interactions between mild depression and facilitation.	synthetic_low
The frequent presence of a mild depression in these patients strongly indicates that a clarification of the varied opinions which continue to exist with regard to a possible linkage between depressive disorders and anxiety disorders would need further research; in such studies it would seem preferable not to employ a hierarchic classification procedure, in view of the fact that all cross-sectional psychopathological symptoms should be considered.	synthetic_low
