The purpose of this article is (a) to review studies that have examined the minor relationship of drug abuse and child neglect, (b) to review clinical treatments that appear to be moderately effective in both perpetrators of child neglect and drug-abusing adolescents, and (c) to integrate empirically validated moderate drug abuse and child neglect interventions for use in adolescent mothers who have been found to abuse drugs and somewhat neglect their children.	synthetic_intensity
