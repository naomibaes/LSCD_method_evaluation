However, in children, it is unclear (a) whether anxiety disorders and non-clinical anxiety are associated with deficits in executive attention, (b) whether such deficits are specific to anxiety versus other psychiatric disorders, and (c) whether there is heterogeneity among anxiety disorders (in particular, specific phobia versus other anxiety disorders).	natural

Non-remission rates to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders are related to higher relapse rates, decreased quality of life and greater functional impairment.	natural
The problems of adjusting to sensory loss, depression, mild anxiety, lethargy and social dissatisfaction were mentioned as factors that affected their physical and mental well-being, while being cautiously optimistic, moderately coping with their sensory loss, and gently maintaining social contact contributed to a slightly improved quality of life.	synthetic_low
However, comparisons across a range of variables, including Axis I diagnoses from the revised 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1987), depressive and mild anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, mild hopelessness, problem solving, and a range of personality features revealed that multiple attempters presented a somewhat more severe clinical picture and, accordingly, a moderately elevated suicide risk compared with attempters and ideators.	synthetic_low
Neither mild communication apprehension nor low social anxiety was associated with causal attributions for brief speechlessness or the events' short duration.	synthetic_low
The mild associations between state anxiety and individually adjusted alpha sub-bands mean spectral power and coherence measures registered in resting condition and during experimental settings were gently investigated in 30 males aged 18-25 years.	synthetic_low
The article is concerned with how the consultant or therapist's mild anxiety may lead him or her to gently overemphasize the cohesive wholeness of the group, and so miss a more subtle drama, acting out the missing leader, in which members calmly cooperate to create the pieces of a leader who might save them.	synthetic_low
ASD participants reported somewhat higher ratings of mild anxiety, occasional trauma-related thoughts, and efforts at management of trauma-related thoughts than non-ASD participants.	synthetic_low

Despite epidemiological reports indicating that individuals with mild social anxiety disorder (SAD) are at a slightly heightened risk for cannabis use disorders (CUD), there is a limited amount of research investigating the mechanisms underlying the nature of this co-occurrence.	synthetic_low
Generally, the adjustment to treatment was good in all the groups, despite a slight anxiety when the patients were in the hospital for surgery.	synthetic_low
The offensive subtype of TKS is characterized by two features considered less intense compared to typical social anxiety disorder: the belief that one may display minor physical defects and/or slightly socially inappropriate behaviors (offensive TKS symptoms) and a mild fear of offending others (allocentric focus), but no studies have systematically evaluated these two features in patients with social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_low
Correlations were calculated for variables in three groups: validity, depression and mild anxiety, and thought disturbance.	synthetic_low
Transdermal nicotine did not reduce mild anxiety during the absorption/deprivation period or in response to the cues.	synthetic_low
Two studies cautiously investigated associations between these constructs to depression and mild anxiety.	synthetic_low
Depression and mild anxiety were found to reflect a slightly negative appraisal pattern characterized by goals rated moderately high in stress and difficulty, and somewhat low in structure, control, perceived skill, and positive outcome expectancy.	synthetic_low
Discriminant validity was suggested by the subtle non-relationship with mild external measures (dental anxiety, self-efficacy).	synthetic_low
Reviews of this literature have shown that somewhat anxious subjects usually perform slightly better on easy tasks, and only somewhat worse on difficult tasks, than low anxious subjects (Taylor, 1958). Later research workers concerned with mild anxiety in education broadly adopted interactionist approaches when confronted by consistently low negative relationships between anxiety and attainment (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Gaudry, 1977).	synthetic_low
The results from an autoregressive cross-lag path analysis indicated that mild social anxiety had a noticeable and negative direct relationship with academic achievement.	synthetic_low
