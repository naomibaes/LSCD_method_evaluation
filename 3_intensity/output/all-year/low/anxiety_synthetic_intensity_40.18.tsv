Rats exposed to CUS showed increased burying behaviors and immobility during the defensive burying test, a conditioned anxiety test.	natural
The level or severity of anxiety symptoms that parents reported in inpatient children was similar to that reported by children, yet inpatient children reported significantly less depression and aggression than parents.	natural
Baseline data on psychosocial factors (e.g. demographic variables, state anxiety, and pain) were collected from 141 women prior to undergoing colposcopy for the first time (M age = 29.63, SD = 8.39).	natural
Test anxiety was assessed at pretest and posttest using the 37-item true-false Test Anxiety Questionnaire developed by Sarason.	natural
This study is the first to provide tentative evidence that post-injury beliefs and hopelessness influence levels of depression and anxiety in hip fracture patients in the acute phase of their injury, and indicates that further study in this area is warranted.	natural
Dyadic latent growth modeling was used to determine whether couples started therapy at similar levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance and whether attachment anxiety and avoidance changed.	natural
Better final rating was associated with lower HADS anxiety (p = 0.03) and HADS depression (p = 0.02) scores.	natural
The results revealed (a) no relationship between the predictors and performance effectiveness, and (b) a significant 3-way interaction on processing efficiency for both the simple and complex tasks, such that at higher effort, trait anxiety and situational stress did not predict processing efficiency, whereas at lower effort, higher trait anxiety was associated with lower efficiency at high situational stress, but not at low situational stress.	natural
Separately, social anxiety contributed 5.8, with independent and interdependent self-construal explaining 6.6 and 5.2, respectively, thus supporting the model.	natural
Both active treatments were effective, resulting in significantly lower symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression compared with the WL.	natural
Support for convergent validity was demonstrated, with TAQ-C scores found to correlate strongly with existing measures of child anxiety, and conceptually related cognitive processes.	natural
Conceptual issues and the relationships between MS-related fatigue and slight mood, anxiety, cognition, personality, and cognitive-behavioral factors are carefully discussed, and the implications for clinical practice and research are presented.	synthetic_low

70 female graduate students from a western university were classified as to personality type: Moderately Anxious, Truly Low Anxious, and Repressing, using a combination of scores from the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scales.	synthetic_low
This study examined mild levels of anxiety in 51 parents who did not room in with their young hospitalized children.	synthetic_low
Likewise pathological gamblers abused alcohol, showed a slight anxiety and were not as well adapted to everyday life as much as the control group.	synthetic_low

These results are consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and may be used to gently inform assessments, diagnoses, and treatments of mild performance anxiety problems in sport.	synthetic_low
These results may reflect a tension-reducing effect of ethanol in situations associated with mild anxiety, but suggest a more general effect of ethanol on blood pressure reactivity.	synthetic_low
Adolescents in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater reductions than controls in mild social anxiety and avoidance, as well as significantly improved overall functioning.	synthetic_low

Primary study effect sizes for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and mild anxiety, while the asylum seekers were still detained, lies in the range of 0.35â€“0.99, all favoring the nondetained asylum group.	synthetic_low
Educable mentally retarded children and normal children of average intelligence were compared in performance on the Children's Manifest Mild Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_low
Impulse control was definitely related to how students allocated their time, but mild anxiety was not so related except that the anxiety associated with a slight fear of taking tests was somewhat related to the number of hours spent for study purposes.	synthetic_low
It was examined whether friendship quality (FQ) and friends' mild anxiety predicted treatment outcome in 116 children with anxiety disorders (72.3% Australian) receiving cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).	synthetic_low
When individual diagnostic categories were considered, almost all the diagnostic groups reported significantly lower Number scores, but only the patients with mild anxiety disorder, moderate mood disorder, schizophrenia, and V codes reported somewhat lower Satisfaction scores than the healthy controls.	synthetic_low
