My response focuses on the two main issues raised by the three discussants: first, the complex forms of relationality that characterize both individual and group trauma and responses to trauma, and second, the function of vicarious trauma that is produced for witnesses and onlookers and the ways in which this enables a third space to develop with healing properties.	natural
Reasons for poorer outcomes in lesbian and bisexual women require investigation, for example lifetime trauma or stigma/discrimination regarding gender or sexual orientation in everyday life or within therapy services.	natural
Preliminary results suggest emotion socialization and child abuse may be salient contributors to alexithymia severity, whereas effects of trauma exposure may be limited to samples with high overall exposure to alexithymia risk-factors.	natural
Further, predictive validity was demonstrated by the ability of various ETI-SF scales to predict the co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders commonly associated with early trauma.	natural

These processes highlight the importance of the study of responses to minor traumatic stressors in order to identify general cognitive mechanisms and behaviors activated by trauma.	synthetic_intensity
The mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression, however, are unclear, and prospective studies are necessary to delineate the roles that mild psychological abuse, moderate PTSD severity and minor prior trauma experiences may have in the development of depression following IPV.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that psychological prevention efforts in trauma centers may be best directed toward adults who are relatively young, have minor premorbid psychiatric disorders, and those admitted with less severe gunshot wounds.	synthetic_intensity

This review explores current models of how mild inflammatory mediators act on the central nervous system to produce light fatigue and sickness behaviour, and the low commonality of these processes in conditions as diverse as surgical trauma, infection, various cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue diseases and autoimmune diseases.	synthetic_intensity
We use the phrase relational trauma because of its minor effects on members of a wider system who also show slight signs of physical stress, minor isolation, and passable helplessness (Sheinberg & Fraenkel, 2000).	synthetic_intensity
Among undergraduates, 1-week temporal stability was evaluated and, in both samples, item- and scale-level convergence of the TAA with an established mild trauma exposure measure was assessed.	synthetic_intensity

Children and youth experiencing mild sexual trauma reported some levels of avoidance symptoms that were, in turn, slightly associated with a lower likelihood of completing trauma-focused mental health treatment.	synthetic_intensity
For the mild trauma task, both groups demonstrated a slight increase of trauma thoughts during suppression, but the PTSD group continued to report trauma thoughts at a moderately higher level than the no-PTSD group post-suppression.	synthetic_intensity
The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over mild perceptual trauma reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for fleeting intrusive memories.	synthetic_intensity
