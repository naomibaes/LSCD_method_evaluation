A clinical example is presented in which the patient's relatively recent trauma in adulthood had become fused with prior related experiences, leading to a propensity for repeated enactments in analysis and a failure to learn from experience.	natural
Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or trauma has come from individuals who sought treatment or exhibited great distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological.	natural
These results highlight the enduring impact of trauma exposure on physical health outcomes, and underscore the importance of considering multiple mechanisms through which different aspects of prior trauma exposure may impact physical health.	natural

Participants indicated that teachers might not readily connect childrens behaviors and emotions to trauma.	natural
Personal, cultural, and societal forces continue to recapitulate the historical trauma in the area.	natural
Resilience refers to the ability to effectively cope and positively adapt after adversity or trauma.	natural
Peritraumatic dissociation is thought to effect trauma information encoding, leading to PTSD symptoms like intrusive memories.	natural
Research evaluating mental state identification in individuals with borderline pathology has yielded inconsistent results; contradictory findings were hypothesized to be driven by moderating effects of childhood trauma.	natural
In contrast, in the model including nonassaultive trauma, higher Wave 1 and Wave 2 PTS were associated with more nonassaultive events at Waves 2 and 3, respectively.	natural
Over the last few years there has been a tremendous upsurge of research on child victims of trauma.	natural
Depending on the severity and character of the trauma, the depth of the regression experienced, and the age and life-circumstances of the patient at the moment of trauma, this can have more or less severe impact on the personality structure.	natural
Cognitive deficits in maltreated children are thought to arise as a result of the impact of trauma on the developing brain.	natural
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene (NR3C1) has been found to be susceptible to epigenetic modification, specifically DNA methylation, in the context of environmental stress such as early life trauma, which is an established risk for depression later in life.	natural
The PTSD group exhibited stable puff onset intervals while the non-PTSD group exhibited significantly shorter intervals following trauma recall.	natural
Moreover, because posttraumatic stress disorder can arise from exposure to a single traumatic event and is associated with recurrent and intrusive thoughts related to the trauma, the current findings have implications for our understanding of this disorder.	natural
Key contributions that educators can make are to (a) recognize CTG symptoms in school settings; (b) refer children for mental_health evaluations when appropriate; (c) recognize reminders that trigger trauma symptoms and identify ways to manage these triggers and responses in school settings; (d) support CTG treatments in school by reinforcing childrens use of stress-management strategies; (e) respect confidentiality; (f) recognize the importance of cultural issues in CTG; and (g) maintain good communication with parents and other helping professionals.	natural
To address the continued need for research in this field, we created the Child & Family Disaster Research Training & Education (DRT) program, which is focused specifically on enhancing national capacity to conduct disaster mental_health research related to children, a population particularly vulnerable to disaster trauma.	natural
The data provide further support for the view that common affective consequences of childhood trauma may mediate between such trauma and the development of a dissociative coping style.	natural
These qualitative findings provide useful feedback on the acceptability of an innovative program that integrates CBT for trauma related to CSA with sexual risk-reduction counseling.	natural
The pathway of risk from childhood trauma to these cognitive, emotional, and psychiatric outcomes is addressed in terms of potential structural and functional alterations within the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala resulting from chronic or repeated activation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and its interaction with and influence on genetic and epigenetic processes during sensitive periods of development.	natural
Meanwhile, different factors mediating between the trauma and obesity link were identified.	natural
This paper addresses the losses, trauma, and adjustment difficulties suffered by people who leave behind significant frames of reference and relational contexts that sustain their identifications.	natural
The assessment of children and young people with history of complex developmental trauma presents a significant challenge to services.	natural
Resilient coping to extreme stress and trauma is a multifaceted phenomena characterized as a complex repertoire of behavioral tendencies.	natural
RSA level during a neutral stimulus, RSA reactivity to emotional video stimuli (distress, joy, and trauma videos) and RSA reactivity to memory stimuli (remote happy memory, trauma memory, mothers recall of the trauma memory) were also collected at both time points.	natural
Conversely, the adulthood trauma group showed a significantly higher level of general threat memory retrieval than the no-trauma group.	natural

Visible cues, indicating a lack of order and social control in the community (neighbourhood disorder), were associated with increased trauma exposure (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.21, 95 confidence interval [CI] [1.12, 1.31]).	natural
Women completed two self-report tools: Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) and Occupational Self Assessment (OSA).	natural
In each case, evidence of significant psychiatric disability and/or malingering was present and seemed to better explain the poor neuropsychological test findings than did the trauma.	natural
Initial S-100B was slightly increased (median: 0.54 microg L-1) and correlated with the severity of extra-cranial trauma (p = 0.0004, Mann-Whitney test).	natural
Despite the content of the interviews remaining the same, significant differences in credibility ratings were found between interviews; with the interview containing both trauma and deception behaviours being rated as significantly less credible than the interview containing only the PTSD behaviours.	natural
