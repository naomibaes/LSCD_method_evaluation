Male sexual abuse is somewhat underreported, and male victims are slightly less likely to seek help than female victims (Black & DeBlassie, 1993; Briere, 1989; Finkelhor, 1990b; Sgroi, 1982).	synthetic_low
Finally, recommendations are made for coordinating research and development efforts, now and in the future, so that the potential of new technology for improving minor substance abuse prevention efforts will be adequately evaluated.	synthetic_low

Those from ARF were admitted primarily for diagnosis and possible treatment for alcohol and non-opioid drug issues, whereas those from the ARC were admitted for participation in light research on other drugs of abuse, primarily involving mild opioid use.	synthetic_low
The overall 12-month prevalence for any mental disorder was 39.4 (95 CI: 37.3-41.5), that for anxiety disorders was 15.8 (95 CI: 14.4-17.4), 12.5 (95 CI: 11.3-14.0) for mood disorders, 9.5 (95 CI: 8.3-10.9) for somatoform disorders, 7.3 (95 CI: 6.2-8.5) for nicotine dependence, 3.7 (95 CI: 3.0-4.6) for disorders due to general medical condition, and 1.1 (95 CI: 0.7-1.6) for occasional alcohol abuse or dependence.	synthetic_low

Methodological limitations notwithstanding, virtually all empirical data generally support the use of AD dolls for data gathering in minor cases of sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Co-occurrence of minor child abuse somewhat increased the level of emotional and behavioral problems above and beyond exposure alone, based on 4 available studies.	synthetic_low
The SEM analysis suggested that substance abuse at baseline was associated with slightly elevated symptomatology and distress and somewhat lower QOL, and that these effects endured after 18 months of treatment.	synthetic_low
While tests for the production of tolerance and physical dependence may not predict abuse liability, they would moderately modify the abuse risk.	synthetic_low

Since its introduction, cases of psychosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and health events attributed to propylhexedrine abuse have been occasionally documented, usually in the form of single case reports.	synthetic_low
Results showed no differences across disciplines/licences in frequency of report of MPD diagnosis, mild ritual abuse patients seen, or the presence of symptom clusters which may be associated with diagnosis of either ritual abuse or MPD.	synthetic_low
Pioneers in developing countries may benefit from collaborating with culturally competent instructors from countries with more developed child protection systems to develop training programs so that professional development can improve recognition and management of mild child abuse and neglect.	synthetic_low
Screening markers are used in emergency departments (EDs) to identify children who could be assessed for possible mild physical abuse and minor neglect.	synthetic_low
Substance abuse among medical students and residents, while not new, has slightly increased in frequency, appears somewhat earlier, and is more apt to involve minor illicit drugs.	synthetic_low

A content analysis of minor abuse allegations was performed.	synthetic_low
A random sample of students at a large Midwestern University was selected in order to examine whether and how minor physical and sexual abuse were related to each other for men and women, whether abuse in one relationship was independent of abuse in other relationships, and how victims responded to less severe abusive incidents.	synthetic_low
