In particular, we emphasize the need for additional conceptual and empirical work integrating these disparate processes together into a coherent, developmental psychopathological model, and we highlight the coexistence of both stability and change in the development of cognitive vulnerabilities to depression across the lifespan.	natural
Secondly, we offer a conceptual differentiation between a symptomatological versus a phenomenological diagnosis of depression.	natural
The risk of depression was increased by the presence of several concomitant factors.	natural

Self-report measures of EL and depression showed non-specific enhancement in both clinical groups.	natural
Results are discussed in terms of the contextual features associated with the college environment that might protect women against depression and account for differential depression levels.	natural
Depression (as measured by the Paranoid-Depressivittsskala) and a depressive style of coping (FKV) revealed to be the best predictors for subjective impairment.	natural
Memory challenges were the most common chronic complaint among individuals with positive screen results, with struggles with headaches, depression, concentration and anxiety also commonly reported.	natural
A cross sectional assessment of depression was completed using a structured clinical interview method and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.	natural
The ability to detect signs of both hypo/mania and depression was greater in younger participants.	natural
Given the emphasis on within-subject associations between depression and marital quality in recent theory and practice, this study was undertaken with three goals: to examine within-subject associations between depressive symptoms and marital quality over time, to address gender differences in the magnitude and direction of these associations, and to determine whether neuroticism moderates the strength of these associations.	natural
To explore these possibilities, 184 women, all of whom had unsuccessfully completed IVF treatment, completed a questionnaire that gauged their levels of self-reported depression since their last IVF attempt as well as resilience and marital quality.	natural
Group psychoeducational participants completed validated scales of psychological functioning (Beck Depression Inventory - 2, BDI-2; Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI; Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, IIP-32; and General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-12) at assessment, start of group, termination of group and 3-month follow-up, whereas participants in the individual therapies completed measures only at initiation and termination of treatment.	natural
The results also provide preliminary evidence that exposure to maternal depression in the first 2 years of life may be related to children's cortisol levels later in life.	natural
A total of 53 kidney transplant patients were assessed using our Self-Test and Organ Drawing Test, the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Mild Depression Inventory, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory in a 3-year follow-up.	synthetic_low
This study examined the effects of marital dissolution on two potential outcomes, relapse into and recovery from minor depression, within a sample that explicitly faces the recurring and moderate risk of depression.	synthetic_low
Effects were less pronounced on multivariate analysis but continued to show a significant effect on length of stay even after controlling for demographics, personal and family history, and mild anxiety and depression screening scores.	synthetic_low
Bowel disorders, migraine, and mild depression were reported at very high prevalence in the PMI mothers (60, 54, and 51, respectively), but were present at significantly lower prevalence rates among the PnMI mothers (16, 26, and 12; P<0.0001 for each) and the fathers of both groups (range 9-16; P < 2 x 10(-6) for each).	synthetic_low
And we need integrated, developmental studies of the psychosocial and neurobiological aspects of self-regulatory responses to mild sadness and distress in order to better understand this process, and to design age-sensitive intervention strategies for slight pediatric depression.	synthetic_low
Procedures involving temporal cueing of coverant emission were employed in the treatment of a mild case of interpersonal anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Male Sprague-Dawley rats which were taught a slight aversion to ingestion of lithium chloride under mild unilateral cortical spreading depression failed to show this aversion when the spreading depression was changed to the opposite hemisphere.	synthetic_low
However, the findings that the risk of recurrent MDD among children approximates the rate among adults but, on average, about 20 years earlier in their lives, and that youths with unipolar depression convert to bipolar illness more frequently than do adults, suggest that early onset MDD is a noteworthy form of affective illness.	synthetic_low
A minor relationship was observed between the total number of coping strategies used and mild anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
In the first and the second experiment, participants were induced to experience either a mild mood state of elation or a mood state of slight depression.	synthetic_low
One group at risk for comorbid cannabis-use disorders and mild clinical depression is female emerging adults (those aged 18-25 years old) as cannabis use peaks during this period, depression is a common psychiatric disorder among emerging adults, and females are at slightly increased risk for depression relative to males.	synthetic_low
The Career Decision Scale was used to measure career indecision, whereas the Beck Depression Inventory and Career Thoughts Inventory were used to measure mild depression and slightly dysfunctional career thinking respectively.	synthetic_low
Mild depression (hazard ratio (Haz R) = 2.19; p = .02) and nighttime HR (Haz R = 1.03; p = .004), but not daytime HR, predicted survival after adjusting for other major predictors and for each other.	synthetic_low
Significant differences in pattern of change between women and men on well-being confirm previous findings that women report slightly more depression and somewhat less satisfaction than men, and thus are more sensitive to subtle change.	synthetic_low
When establishing a treatment plan for minor depressive episodes following the death of a loved one, clinicians must keep in mind that they are dealing with both mild grief and depression; thus, an ideal intervention targets both components in a gentle manner, often simultaneously.	synthetic_low
In support of the vulnerability hypothesis, as compared to the never-depressed group, participants with past depression demonstrated subtle declines in positive mood on more stressful days but did not significantly differ from the subsequent mild depression group.	synthetic_low
Test-retest reliability was as expected: fairly high for Composite score 1 (2 anxiety + mild depression + hostility) and for Composite score 2 (2 positive affect + moderate sensation seeking) on the trait form and for Composite 2 on the state form.	synthetic_low
Fifty-five patients with GAD and mild depression were compared with 53 patients with GAD without mild depression.	synthetic_low
