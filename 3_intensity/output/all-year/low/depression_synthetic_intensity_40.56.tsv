Mild depression was associated with LBP especially after 6 weeks and should therefore be considered in screening instruments for acute LBP patients to identify those at risk of delayed recovery at an early stage.	synthetic_intensity
We conducted an uncontrolled study in 17 patients with mild, recurrent depression, in two successive groups.	synthetic_intensity
Lowering the temperature from 15 to 5C also slightly increased the mild depression induced by conditioning stimulation for pulse trains of two to ten pulses in length.	synthetic_intensity
The estimated prevalence of depression was 8.8 for severe (probable depressive disorder) depression, 18.3 for moderate (depressive syndrome) depression, and 28.3 for everyday mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
In this exploratory study of the relationship between characteristics of breathing and 3 common psychological issues (i.e., mild symptoms of anxiety, slight alexithymia, and low-level depression), 79 college-age adults were examined using self-report, rater observation, and physiological measures.	synthetic_intensity
The NPOQ had excellent internal consistency, good test-retest reliability at 5 weeks, and demonstrated moderate convergent and discriminant validity when measured against mild self-reported pessimism, low-level depression, occasional anxiety, and average problem-solving ability.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention, delivered by Physical Activity Facilitators (PAFs), alongside usual care, was developed and piloted, then compared with usual care within a randomised TRial of Exercise and mild Depression in the UK (TREAD-UK).	synthetic_intensity
As before, central features included steady trust, simple honesty and mild sexual attraction/desire; peripheral features included light submission/obedience, occasional deception/lies and low-level depression.	synthetic_intensity
