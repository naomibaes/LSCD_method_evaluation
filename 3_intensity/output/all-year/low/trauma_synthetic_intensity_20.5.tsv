Within 24 h after the accident, serum cortisol concentration was greater than the controls in the PI but not the ES group (p = 0.02), while serum IL-6 concentration was greater in both trauma groups than in the controls (p = 0.004 for PI, p = 0.04 for ES).	natural
Drawing on minority stress theory and sexual health literature, this exploratory study tested the relations of bisexual identity factors (e.g. anticipated binegativity, identity affirmation), minority stressors (e.g. isolation and vicarious trauma), and sexual and relationship variables (e.g. sexual functioning, relationship satisfaction) with mental_health.	natural
Psychological reactions to neurological trauma may be caused by a complex interaction of a host of factors.	natural
The mechanism by which trauma affects health is not fully understood, but relationships with health care providers could be important in understanding this association.	natural
During conditioning, the PTSD patients compared to the NPTSD and HC indicated higher arousal to the conditioned stimulus that was paired with the trauma picture (CS+) compared to the unpaired (CS-), increased dissociation during acquisition and extinction, and failure to extinguish the CS/US-association compared to NPTSD.	natural
It was approximately 7 months after his trauma that the patient began exhibiting striking palilalia behavior along with echolalia and a global deterioration of mental activities.	natural

Results suggest four main themes, describing: the Aboriginal women's experiences of social trauma (the three tigers); their use of gambling to cope with these experiences (a big hole with the wind blowing through it); their experience of problem gambling (I'm somebody today); and their process of healing from social trauma and gambling problems (a letter to John).	natural
Larger longitudinal studies are needed to assess the impact of mild maltreatment, experienced by the majority of adult trauma victims with a history of moderate maltreatment.	synthetic_low
Having both research and clinical relevance for assessing Holocaust survivors' offspring, future studies might investigate the scale's generalizability to other populations affected by moderate mass trauma.	synthetic_low
The phenomenology, clinical symptoms, clinical needs, and risk factors associated with loss by minor traumatic means and the combined influences of loss and trauma exposure are yet to be systematically studied.	synthetic_low
Moreover, mild sensitivity to the balance interventions correlated significantly with minor trauma reports and mild dissociative symptoms.	synthetic_low
In the survivor sample, the severity of PTSD and depression were both weakly correlated with female gender, mild trauma exposure, and slightly low levels of agreement to reconciliation.	synthetic_low
Adult physical trauma survivors (N = 677) provided information regarding mild posttraumatic distress by completing a straightforward, interview-administered version of the PTSD Symptom Checklist (Civilian version) at 3 relaxed time points: within days of minor trauma exposure and again at 6 and 12 months posttrauma.	synthetic_low
Exploration of the clinical literature shows an awareness that an infant's experience as a selfobject often is mildly traumatic, but if there is an experience of mutuality, the trauma might be minimized.	synthetic_low
The findings therefore do not support theories that mild trauma accounts for the dissociative phenomena associated with BPD.	synthetic_low
