Subsequent analysis suggested that the correlation between mild maternal depression and moderate depressive symptoms in adolescent females was largely explained by the weaker associations of both measures with a series of social and contextual factors including some social disadvantage, occasional marital discord, and typical family adversity.	synthetic_intensity
In addition, emotional tiredness, the core of burnout, was more moderately associated with mild depression than with depersonalization, the second dimension of burnout, underlining a subtle inconsistency in the conceptualization of the burnout syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
