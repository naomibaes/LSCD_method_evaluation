These results suggest that clinicians working in substance abuse settings should perhaps adjust MCMI-III profile elevations upward on most scales (particularly on the personality disorder scales) when comparing results to extant normative data and should use caution when referencing MCMI/MCMI-II interpretive manuals for descriptive correlates of MCMI-III scales and codetypes.	natural

Findings suggested that cannabis consumption was predictive of psychosis diagnosis in a bivariate model; however, when estimated within a multivariate model that included childhood sexual abuse, the effect of cannabis use was attenuated and was not statistically significant.	natural
Emotional abuse exhibited a higher odds ratio for lifetime suicidal behavior (OR=3.6, 95CI=2.9-4.4) than other traumas including general trauma (OR=2.1, 95CI=1.8-2.4), sexual (OR=2.0, 95CI=1.5-2.8) or physical (OR=1.8, 95CI=1.5-2.1) abuse, and current stressors including heavy stress (OR=1.5, 95CI=1.4-1.8), poor physical health (OR=1.3, 95CI=1.2-1.5), and poor economic status (OR=1.2, 95CI=1.0-1.3).	natural

When investigating the abuse allegation, interviewers demonstrated a greater use of Direct (Wh-) (57), and Option-posing prompts (20) than stipulated by the model and fewer broad open-ended prompts (22).	natural
The mean prevalence of sexual revictimization across studies was 47.9 (95 confidence intervals [43.6, 52.3]), suggesting that almost half of child sexual abuse survivors are sexually victimized in the future.	natural
In order to assess the intensity, direction, and type of self- and other-blame in relationship to adjustment, a clinical sample of 31 women who were sexually abused as children completed a sexual abuse questionnaire, a self-blame scale, and adjustment measures for depression, self-esteem and self-concept.	natural
Using a prospective cohort design, participants are individuals with documented cases of childhood physical and sexual abuse and neglect from the years 1967 through 1971 and a matched control group.	natural
A review of the research on child abuse suggests three basic theoretical models to account for the etiology of abuse: a psychiatric model emphasizing the role of the individual abuser; a sociological model highlighting the role of social factors in abuse; and the effect of the child on caregiver model pointing toward the role the child plays in stimulating his own maltreatment.	natural
To maintain attachment, abuse must be dissociated, but to protect the self from abuse, need for attachment must be disavowed.	natural

Much of the work stems from the actions of potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists; these agents slightly reduce mesolimbic dopamine initiated hyperactivity, gently release suppressed behaviour, subtly reduce the reinforcing properties and withdrawal symptoms of drugs of abuse, modestly enhance cognitive performance and mildly modulate appetite.	synthetic_intensity
Given the almost exclusive focus on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in minor substance abuse research and the neglect of clients perspectives in this field, we explore in this study the concept of QoL as perceived by drug users.	synthetic_intensity
Further, the authors compared their needs profiles with respect to sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, minor abuse type, mild symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general life satisfaction, strong social support, high self-efficacy, self-esteem, and the attuning of the shelter services to the basic needs reported.	synthetic_intensity
