The author deals with the difficulties in combining the concepts of trauma and phantasy.	natural
This study examines the discriminant validity of the Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC-40) in a clinical sample.	natural
This study had three main purposes: to assess the factor structure of a new self-report measure--the Tonic Immobility Questionnaire--designed to assess human TI in a range of traumatic events; to explore associations among discovered TIQ factors and a measure of posttraumatic symptoms in the context of trauma type; and to determine whether TI is related to suspected and empirically supported predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
The author contends that the proper therapeutic comportment toward trauma is a form of emotional dwelling.	natural
Suicide attempters with a family history of suicidal behavior and childhood trauma show specific characteristics that might be used to prevent future suicidal behaviors in this population.	natural
Furthermore, the psychological mechanisms that mediate the effects of trauma on health are less clear.	natural
Men who reported sexual trauma were more likely to have left military service: AOR = 1.60, 95 CI [1.14, 2.24], and be disabled/unemployed postservice: AOR = 1.76, 95 CI [1.02, 3.02].	natural
Of students exposed to potentially traumatic events, more than one third (35.44, n = 28) also reported at least 1 form of related institutional betrayal, which uniquely correlated with posttraumatic distress in some participants, when controlling for lifetime trauma history.	natural
The present study evaluated the relationship among reported trauma, dissociative experiences and eating disorders in a female college sample.	natural
One hundred and twenty-two trauma-exposed adults were administered the following self-report measures: the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian, the Trauma History Questionnaire-Short, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale 21, Sheehan Disability Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, and an abbreviated Patient Health Questionnaire.	natural
Using linear regression and testing interaction effects, negative attitudes toward women significantly predicted greater RMA for individuals without a sexual trauma history.	natural
Trauma histories may increase risk of perinatal psychiatric episodes.	natural
We expected high rates of mental_disorders in both study groups and hypothesized that symptom severity would be predicted by female gender, older age, lower level of education, higher level of trauma exposure, lower level of agreement to reconciliation, and the participation in killing.	natural
No differences in trauma symptoms were observed between the two groups.	natural
The intergenerational transmission of captivity trauma is indirectly explained by the long-term effects of the fathers PTSS on their offsprings secondary PTSS and DAS.	natural
CAN was measured by the Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), CMD by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the level of warmth in the parent-child relationship were recalled using short Egna Minnen Betraffnde Uppfostran (s-EMBU-23).	natural
Of particular interest were the effects of trauma as evidenced in coping-defensive strategies observed in the play activity as play styles.	natural
These findings suggest PTSD is generally well-conceptualized as a dimensional syndrome worsened but not necessarily elicited by trauma exposure.	natural
Only polygenic mutation-selection balance seems consistent with the data on mental_disorder prevalence rates, fitness costs, the likely rarity of susceptibility alleles, and the increased risks of mental_disorders with brain trauma, inbreeding, and paternal age.	natural
Histories of trauma did not differentiate those with and without psychosocial problems.	natural
In addition, we showed that global trauma symptoms decreased the support participants actually received.	natural
This 10-item screening index represents a clinically useful tool to identify trauma survivors at minimal risk for the later development of PTSD and/or MDE.	synthetic_intensity

Mildly unresolved childhood trauma has been somewhat correlated with slightly impaired and delayed cognitive, behavioral, and emotional functioning.	synthetic_intensity
Mild fluent aphasias have been reported in closed-head trauma with minor right frontal impact.	synthetic_intensity
Participants generated CFT to their own mild trauma or to written scenarios.	synthetic_intensity
Lack of adequate training concerning the lesser impact of trauma and scarce literature on the communication profiles of mildly dissociative children contributes and greatly impacts the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of these children.	synthetic_intensity
The VBR values were positively correlated with moderate alcohol intake and with minor physical trauma, and negatively correlated with a family history of schizophrenia.	synthetic_intensity
More research is needed to determine if and what minor modifications to trauma therapies may be required to address the somewhat increased symptomatology and behavior problems associated with youth involved in commercial sex.	synthetic_intensity
In participants sameday narratives of the mild trauma, pastfocused utterances predicted greater decreases in depressive symptom severity over the next year, d = 0.13, whereas cognitive process utterances predicted less severe posttraumatic symptom severity across time points, d = 0.32.	synthetic_intensity
After providing a brief overview of minor betrayal trauma (Freyd, 1996) and the importance of relational processes in casual healing, we describe common treatments for betrayal trauma that are grounded in the medical model.	synthetic_intensity
Second, an effort is made to see if current emotional support helps reduce the minor deleterious effects of trauma on meaning, and whether current levels of negative inter-personal contacts slightly exacerbate the effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_intensity
Blood samples were taken on admission (mean 2.3 hours), 6, 12 and 24 hours after mild trauma and then every 24 hours up until and including the fifth day.	synthetic_intensity
Research examining people's responses to mild trauma assumes that people can accurately notice the occurrence of minor symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
Although these results provide further confirmation of a potential association between minor prior trauma and repetitive skin-cutting, they rigorously challenge the validity of reported gender differences for this behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
An additional source of mild trauma in bereavement, occurring when the previous representation or introject of the deceased is slightly disrupted, is considered for its status as a minor additional source of complication in the traumas of bereavement.	synthetic_intensity
This study explored the moderate struggles and modest rewards of trauma work and the notion that individuals are somewhat changed in some way by the work they do with survivors of mildly traumatic events.	synthetic_intensity
A sample of 21 psychotherapists participated in a naturalistic interview exploring the subtle impact of trauma work with a particular focus on (a) minor changes in memory systems and schemas about self and the world (the mild aspects of vicarious traumatization) and (b) perceived psychological growth.	synthetic_intensity
There is preliminary cross-sectional evidence that dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorders may mediate the relationship between mild psychological trauma and NSSI and SI/SA.	synthetic_intensity
