Autonomy was linked to the less favorable psychological outcomes with parents (in terms of relationship satisfaction, self-dislike, and mild depression), and mutuality was linked to the best outcomes with romantic partners and best friends.	synthetic_intensity
The patients experiencing an episode of minor depression had a slightly different personality profile compared to healthy controls at baseline, and the mildness of their condition correlated with moderate scores in the Neuroticism domain.	synthetic_intensity
When considered simultaneously, EAC, but not passive coping, was related to mild affective pain, and both EAC and passive coping were minor correlates of mild depression, although in opposite directions.	synthetic_intensity
Using a theoretical approach and confirmatory factor analyses to distinguish between mild irritability and defiance, we investigate the associations among these dimensions and minor internalizing concerns (anxiety and depression) and mild externalizing problems (conduct problems) within and across time in a community-based sample of 662 youth (342 females) spanning ages 12 to 18 years old at baseline.	synthetic_intensity
