In this article, we identify biological factors that may increase risk for some individuals during this developmental period by: examining changes in neural circuitry underlying core phenotypic features of anxiety as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence; examining genetic factors that may enhance the risk for psychopathology in one individual over another using translation from mouse models to human neuroimaging and behavior; and examining the effects of early experiences on core phenotypic features of anxiety using human neuroimaging and behavioral approaches.	natural
This study describes the development and initial validation of the Peer-report Measure of Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior (PMIEB), a peer-nomination inventory that assesses internalizing (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) and externalizing (aggression, delinquency, hyperactivity/attentional problems) psychopathology in school-aged children.	natural
Between trial blocks, participants underwent an anxiety induction.	natural
Mere repeated administration of anxiety sensitivity (AS) measures (i.e., fear of anxiety-related sensations) leads to predictably lower scores, and this effect cannot be attributed to regression to the mean or the indirect provision of anxiety related information.	natural

Behavioural activation (BA) is an empirically validated treatment for depression but is much less often studied in the treatment of anxiety symptomology.	natural
In addition to developing efficacious treatments for anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorders, it is important to examine the transportability of these treatments to real-world settings.	natural

Clients (n = 95) who experienced mild to moderate depression and/or anxiety and had a diagnosis of T2DM opted to attend.	natural
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was developed as a uni-dimensional measure of depression, however there is evidence that it also measures anxiety.	natural
Patients reported decreased distress (p = 0.009) and anxiety (p = 0.005) and increased self-efficacy (p < 0.001).	natural
Adjusted for sex and age, cannabis use at baseline was associated with an increased relative risk (RR) for depression and anxiety at follow-up, with RR=1.22 [1.06-1.42 Cl 95] for depression and RR=1.38 [1.26-1.50 Cl 95] for anxiety.	natural
Maternal anxiety during pregnancy was associated with significant increased risk of PTB (pooled RR=1.50, 95 CI=1.33-1.70) and LBW (pooled RR=1.76, 95 CI=1.32-2.33).	natural
This study examined whether the ERN prospectively predicted the first onset of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) over 1.5 years in adolescent girls.	natural
The present study evaluated the relative contributions of Self-esteem, Trait anxiety, and Public Self-consciousness to self-handicapping on a sex-typed task, within a specific academic sport context.	natural
Women with ADHD had triple the prevalence of insomnia, chronic pain, suicidal ideation, childhood sexual abuse and generalized anxiety disorder and double the prevalence of substance abuse, current smoking, depressive disorders, severe poverty and childhood physical abuse in comparison with women without ADHD (all P < 0.001).	natural
The 12-month prevalence rate for threshold SAD was 2.0, subthreshold and symptomatic social anxiety (one DSM-IV criterion missing/two or more criteria missing) was found in 3.0 and 7.5 of the participants, respectively.	natural
All BERQ scales correlated significantly with symptoms of depression and anxiety.	natural
It does not follow a simple model of anxiety reduction that occurs in the compulsive checking of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	natural
Depressive symptoms predicted life satisfaction above and beyond parent-rated ADHD symptom severity; however, neither depressive nor generalized anxiety symptoms were found to uniquely predict life satisfaction above and beyond child-rated ADHD symptom severity.	natural

PHYSIOL BEHAV 63 371375, 1998. To determine whether the selectively bred alcohol preferring P rat displays impulsive and mild anxiety-related behaviors, as have been noted in Type 2 human alcoholics, P rats were compared with outbred Wistar rats, the strain from which P rats were derived, on a series of behaviors reflecting impulsivity and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

Compared with the control group, overt verbalization (a) prevented generalization of US expectancies to the CS- during initial extinction trials, (b) produced more stable extinction of US expectancies during later extinction trials, and (c) yielded significant declines in self-reported mild anxiety from immediate to delayed post-extinction assessments.	synthetic_intensity
Some factors like lack of explanation on childbirth and multiparity were shown to be associated with slight increases in anxiety states before labour, while other factors that were found to have an important effect on the perception of childbirth as a mildly negative experience were: previous negative birth experience (P = 0.025); abnormal deliveries (vacuum, forceps, cesarean section, P < 0.01); and ethnic origin (P < 0.01).	synthetic_intensity
