This study set out to examine the relationship between minor pre-attributional consensus judgments, perceived mild trait discrepancy from others, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
These relationships remained even after controlling for temporary state-like depression, suggesting that the DPDI has some incremental validity.	synthetic_low
In an attempt to better understand one aspect of the marital discord/depression link, the impact of occasional negative marital events on the development of mild depression was assessed in women with no prior history of major depression (N = 50).	synthetic_low
It is known that mild paternal postnatal depression slightly impacts children's and families' development, marginally affects marital satisfaction, and has a minor effect on the economic health of industrialized countries.	synthetic_low
The ratio of the plasma of total tryptophan to those amino acids that compete with tryptophan during transport into the brain was determined in 60 control subjects and 87 patients experiencing mild endogenous depression, all females.	synthetic_low
Both groups improved significantly over time with reduced levels of mild burnout, manageable self-rated stress behavior, moderate fatigue, low-level depression, mild anxiety, slight obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and occasional sick leave rates.	synthetic_low
Psychological well-being (especially mild depression and occasional anxiety), size of household, physical activity, and education were the most important predictors of self-perceived health (R = .70).	synthetic_low
Neither decision making nor working memory explained the effect of mild maternal depression on child internalizing/externalizing problems.	synthetic_low
Resting-state functional MRI was collected from 16 patients with moderate treatment-resistant depression before and after ECT and 16 healthy controls matched for age and sex.	synthetic_low
Tensionanxiety and mild depression showed a nonsignificant decrease throughout hospitalisation, but angerhostility and fatigue were slightly increased, especially in the routine last assessment about a month after discharge from hospital.	synthetic_low
Slight major depression is common in older medical patients, and it can exert a moderate effect on the treatment, course, and outcome of physical illnesses.	synthetic_low
Moreover, confirmatory factor analyses produced notable correlations between self-esteem and mild depression in both Study 2 (r = -.82) and Study 3 (r = -.86).	synthetic_low
After adjusting for baseline differences in demographic and comorbidity factors and functional status using Cox regression, mild depression tended to be associated with a slight risk of heart failure (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.52, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-2.43, p =.09).	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between pretreatment serum cholesterol levels and clinical response to treatment with fluoxetine among outpatients with mild major depression.	synthetic_low
Examination of the factor matrices for the three clinical samples provided evidence for a sturdy factor measuring a mildly negativistic-avoidant personality style with some associated anxiety, depression, and limited somatization.	synthetic_low
PAI Clinical scale profiles showed slightly more elevated scores among mild injury patients on 2 scales, Somatization and low-level Depression, and more elevated scores among moderate-to-severe patients on 2 scales, Antisocial Features and Alcohol Problems.	synthetic_low
Results were as follows: (a) Mothers' acceptance during childhood correlated negatively with both mild maternal depression and slight maternal anger, and positively with moderate maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; (b) maternal anger mediated the association between childhood care and maternal sensitivity to fear at 2 years; and (c) the interaction of maternal and paternal control during childhood predicted maternal sensitivity to anger at 2 years, controlling for maternal education.	synthetic_low
This study investigated the relative contributions of risk-taking behaviour (RTB), parental attachment, and mild depression to delinquency.	synthetic_low
Participants' depression scores declined moderately over time, and 75% of participants experienced at least a mild 50% change on a self-report measure of depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
Genetic linkage was studied in mild depression spectrum disease, a subgroup of unipolar depressive illness defined by the presence of familial tendencies towards alcoholism and/or mild antisocial personality, using a simplified version of the sib pair method of Penrose.	synthetic_low
Heterosexual men scored slightly lower on indicators of childhood separation anxiety than gay men and lower on mild indicators of childhood and adulthood depression and anxiety than all other groups.	synthetic_low
This study involved a discourse analytic investigation of 15 women's accounts of their experiences of recovery from mild depression.	synthetic_low
Preliminary evidence from 4 comparisons with disorder-specific treatments suggests transdiagnostic treatments are as effective for reducing anxiety, and there may be modest yet superior outcomes for TD-cCBT programs for reducing mild depression (g=.21) and improving QOL (g=.21) compared to disorder-specific cCBT.	synthetic_low
Perceived availability of social support accounted for a minimal variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
A career plateau may mark the beginning of a period characterized by mild frustration and low-level depression or it may present the opportunity for a manageable challenge or simple reappraisal of life direction and goals.	synthetic_low
An important suicide prophylactic measure would be to enhance the general awareness of hospital clinicians and practitioners of the existence, diagnosis, and treatment of mild endogenous depression.	synthetic_low
The results provide minimal evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressants in those with mild schizophrenia and mild depression and could be explained by publication bias.	synthetic_low
The parent-child relationship may be a contributing factor by which illness influences mild symptoms of depression in children with asthma.	synthetic_low
The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive therapy for mild depression in women with metastatic cancer, using a straightforward multiple baseline experimental design.	synthetic_low
Currently, it seems that for mild major depression 8 sessions of combined therapy are equally effective as 16 sessions.	synthetic_low
However, no support for this assumption was found for mild depression and anxiety, in that lower depression and greater anxiety after session one was associated with higher levels of these therapist qualities after session three.	synthetic_low
This study examines the degree to which support from parents and teachers effectively buffers the mild level of depression for four groups of children involved in bullying (victim, bully, bully-victims, or not involved children).	synthetic_low
Identification of depression-sensitive personality traits may help to elucidate the mechanisms that slightly influence the manageable course and typical outcome of depression.	synthetic_low
It may also need to take into account the subtle influence of personality on minor changes in symptoms over and between episodes of mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, this study is the first one to show that participants with mild depression symptoms feel somewhat psychologically distant from positive events and participants with more PTSD symptoms feel moderately psychologically close to negative events.	synthetic_low
Conversely, mild maternal depression was associated with reduced distress; later judgment as insecure, particularly insecure-avoidance, was associated with fewer mother-directed behaviors.	synthetic_low
The majority also completed a self-report (SDS) low severity of depression measure, and provided current and historical data on mild depression, anxiety, global functioning and stressor severity.	synthetic_low
Participants completed the Symptom Expectancy Checklist, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Awareness Questionnaire and a straightforward causal attribution scale.	synthetic_low
The questions addressed in this study were whether mild prenatal depression effects on the foetus and neonate varied slightly by ethnicity and socio-economic status.	synthetic_low
There were 61 AICD patients examined with a specifically designed AICD questionnaire and standardized anxiety and mild depression questionnaires.	synthetic_low
One important attributional account of mild depression is the reformulated learned helplessness model, which proposes that lighter depressive symptoms are associated with an attributional style in which uncontrollable bad events are attributed to somewhat internal (versus external), stable (versus unstable), and global (versus specific) causes.	synthetic_low
Participants ( =146) completed brief questionnaires measuring PA, intuition, referential thinking, mild personality traits, mild depression, slight anxiety, and general meaning in life.	synthetic_low
Suicidal behavior in adolescents can be somewhat manipulative and loosely unrelated to mild depression.	synthetic_low
Mild clinical depression and other psychological disorders have been occasionally associated with fleeting suicidal ideation, minor attempts, and rare deaths.	synthetic_low
Generic health profiles and cardiac-disease-specific quality-of-life measures would also be useful in psychosomatic investigations of personality, milder hostility, low-level depression, and some social isolation in patients with cardiac disease.	synthetic_low
The Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-rating Depression Scale were used to assess mild mood states.	synthetic_low
However, when grade and gender differences were examined, it was found that gifted boys tended to report slightly lower levels of self-esteem and mild depression than gifted girls.	synthetic_low
This analysis provides clinicians with prenatal risk factors which may be associated with mild loneliness and slightly lower SS during pregnancy and postpartum: marital status, income, racism, and mild depression.	synthetic_low
Fifty consecutive patients with both impaired intellectual functioning and at least one mild affective disorder admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit for children and adolescents with developmental disabilities and moderate psychiatric disorders were matched to a group of 50 inpatients without depression.	synthetic_low
The authors examined maternal and paternal reports of family functioning and their relationship with child outcomes as well as the association between anxiety and mild depression in family members and family functioning.	synthetic_low
