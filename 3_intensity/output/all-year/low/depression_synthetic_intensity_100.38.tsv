However, consistent with Lester's study, these correlations were not significant when mild depression was controlled for.	synthetic_intensity
When mild anxiety or depression is identified, it is recommended that one person in a treating team takes responsibility for coordinating basic assessment, considerate referral and occasional follow-up (not necessarily carrying these out themselves).	synthetic_intensity
Involuntary subordination has been implicated as an underlying cause of a mild depression, and it was therefore helpful to determine the personality variables and other intrapsychic mechanisms that lead to this condition.	synthetic_intensity

CSF SRIF was not significantly different among these groups; on the other hand, mean CSF CRH concentrations were somewhat higher in mild depression and in dementia with some depression as compared with neurological controls with no psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_intensity
Based on findings in rodents, we predicted that heavy current alcohol use and elevated stress and mild depression scores would be associated with minor deficits on high interference memory tasks, while early onset, prolonged binge patterns would lead to broader cognitive deficits on tests of associative encoding and executive functions.	synthetic_intensity
This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	synthetic_intensity
Symptom checklist scores were compared in the post partum and non post-partum groups, having controlled statistically overall levels of mild depression (EPDS scores) and whether subjects had gainful occupations (as at the beginning of the index pregnancy in the case of post-partum subjects).	synthetic_intensity
Children who exhibited greater sympathetic nervous system reactivity during infancy had the lowest levels of minor externalizing problems during childhood only if they had mothers who had mild chronic depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mild depression often influences and is influenced by intimate partnerships; thus, it makes sense to include both individuals in brief interventions.	synthetic_intensity
Parental Bonding Inventory (PBI) scores at baseline were investigated as predictors of mild depression on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4, 14 and 21 months after childbirth in mothers without depression at baseline.	synthetic_intensity
We evaluated the minor association of scores on the MAX-PC with demographics, clinicopathologic features, sexual function, and low depression scores using Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Kendall's tau correlation tests.	synthetic_intensity
A latent growth mediation model was used, and the results indicated that family income was associated with mild parental depression and occasional youth aggression over time, and early parental depression partially mediated the relationship between early family income and subsequent modest youth aggression rates over time.	synthetic_intensity
A low lethality is associated with a hedonistic conception of death, lack of noticeable positive signs of mild depression, presence of some impulsiveness, psychopathic behaviors, or lack of a diagnosed mental disorder.	synthetic_intensity
At present, the nature of the relationship between OSAS and mood, specifically mild depression and occasional anxiety, is still unclear.	synthetic_intensity
Depression is generally regarded as a moderately serious, somewhat challenging illness.	synthetic_intensity
The intervention, delivered by Physical Activity Facilitators (PAFs), alongside usual care, was developed and piloted, then compared with usual care within a randomised TRial of Exercise and mild Depression in the UK (TREAD-UK).	synthetic_intensity
Measures of marital satisfaction, conflict and mild depression showed slight gains which were generally maintained at follow-up.	synthetic_intensity
Several studies assessed the relationship between mild depression and dimensions of temperament/character using Cloninger's model of personality and the TCI-R. The aim of this study is to clarify the relation between everyday depression and personality in men and women who are expecting a baby.	synthetic_intensity
Participants' depression scores declined moderately over time, and 75% of participants experienced at least a mild 50% change on a self-report measure of depression symptoms.	synthetic_intensity
They do not constitute discrete syndromes but overlap, each also being closely associated with mild anxiety and slight depression, minor sleep disturbances or mild marital disruption.	synthetic_intensity
The results indicated that slightly senile Ss scored significantly higher on the SRDS than did the nonsenile Ss, that sex differences were not significant, that there were no significant differences between institutionalized and noninstitutionalized Ss of either sex in either the nonsenile or the slightly senile groups, and that further refinement of the SRDS and a longitudinal study of personality, experience, and mild depression would be extremely useful.	synthetic_intensity
After controlling for mild baseline bulimic symptoms, depression, and some level of body dissatisfaction, involuntary disengagement predicted bulimic symptoms at follow-up among men (b=.21, p<.001), but not among women (b=.06, p>.05).	synthetic_intensity

Issues addressed include the desirability of moderate rather than maximum test-retest and item homogeneity/internal consistency estimates; the distinction between measurement at the superficial syndrome level vs. that at the low-intensity source state/trait level; the importance of appropriate rather than arbitrary factor analytic procedures; and the need for more varied measures instead of the single-scale instruments sometimes employed to measure mild depression alongside interacting emotions such as anxiety or stress.	synthetic_intensity
The corticosteroid group was somewhat more affected by depression than the comparison group over time as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F = 3.98, p < 0.02), and slightly more anxious, as measured by the nonsomatic items of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (p < 0.10).	synthetic_intensity
