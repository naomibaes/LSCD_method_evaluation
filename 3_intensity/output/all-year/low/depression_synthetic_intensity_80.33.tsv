It is important for clinicians to screen regularly for both mild depression and general suicide ideation, to be alert to specific types of disability for which a moderate level of suicide ideation might be present and to consider the possibility of occasional suicidal thoughts being present in people who show minimal or no depressive symptoms.	synthetic_intensity

The results are consistent with the following conclusions: past major depression (prior to the death) predicts a moderate risk for depression following bereavement; membership in any of the unipolar subgroups, in turn, predicts some future depression throughout the less severe unipolar depressive spectrum; subsyndromal and minor depression stand between major depression, on the one hand, and no depression, on the other, in terms of their limited effects on overall adjustment to widowhood.	synthetic_intensity
