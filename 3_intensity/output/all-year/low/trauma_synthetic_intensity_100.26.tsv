These foundational assumptions form the basis for enacting future-orientated career strategies, such that progress toward establishing a new career path is greatest for those who can orientate themselves away from the past (minor trauma), away from the present (small obstacles to a new career), and toward an envisioned future career positioned to confer meaning and purpose through work.	synthetic_low
Traditionally, understanding of the mild psychiatric and moderate psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to somewhat trauma-exposed children with some minor modifications.	synthetic_low
The suicide of a family member, particularly a parent, it is hypothesized, marks some survivors with a mild type of trauma associated with moral discomfort, which may produce a subtle alteration in object relations with the emergence of what may be called a mysterious object.	synthetic_low
The emerging trend in society is one that facilitates healthier grieving and the ability to gently story the minor losses brought on by mild trauma.	synthetic_low
More recent theoretical models identify a slight weakening of the ego during mild trauma as well as the moderate effects of this weakening on the formation of self and object representants at the heart of the traumatic event.	synthetic_low
A model is proposed of the evolution of mild inner psychic events in response to the detention-related trauma which result in the moderately concerning typical symptom cluster.	synthetic_low
These results support the mild functional avoidance strategy of OGM in gentle analogue trauma stimuli, especially in individuals with somewhat higher depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
Our findings suggest that memory functioning represents a neurocognitive domain of notable relevance to the development of PTSD in individuals exposed to trauma, which can be distinguished from generalized attentional impairment as well as the moderate effects of trauma exposure severity, IQ, comorbid depression, history of occasional alcohol use, and history of minor developmental learning problems.	synthetic_low
Utilizing structural equation modeling techniques, both constructs were found to significantly partially mediate the relation between minor interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms; experiential avoidance reduced the relation between minor interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms by 22 while forgiveness reduced this relation by 14.	synthetic_low
It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the mild trauma in a way that leads to a minor sense of serious, current threat.	synthetic_low
Functional and psychological recovery from minor road trauma is closely associated with the assessment of responsibility for accidents.	synthetic_low
Central Americans' stress appraisal ratings on specific HSI items related to mild pre-migration trauma were significantly higher than the ratings of Mexican immigrants.	synthetic_low
In the current investigation, we examined avoidant coping as a moderator of the association between heart rate reactivity to a trauma monologue measured shortly after a mildly traumatic event and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms measured several months later.	synthetic_low
Finally, we include a discussion of issues specific to various mild trauma populations and factors that may influence treatment efficacy across types of minor trauma.	synthetic_low

The results illustrate the mild challenges faced by caregivers in supporting children following minor trauma in LMIC contexts and the need for accessible psychological interventions.	synthetic_low
The conclusion is that findings regarding the relationship of exposure to community violence with psychological symptoms of mild trauma obtained from college students may tentatively be generalized to older adolescents who are not in college.	synthetic_low
Results provide a comprehensive assessment and characterization of gender differences in mental and physical health conditions and risk conferred by mild assaultive trauma for certain conditions in U.S. veterans.	synthetic_low
Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this mild sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history.	synthetic_low
In an effort to confirm the mild factorial validity of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) across sex, the items from the CTQ for 916 university students were subjected to basic confirmatory factor analysis.	synthetic_low
The only significant difference found between the two groups was that heterosexual women were more likely to report multiple categories of mildly traumatic experiences, and lesbians were more likely to report experiences in only one minor category of trauma.	synthetic_low
We replicated a subtyping strategy for adjudicated female youth based on mental_health screening data from the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-2 (MAYSI-2) by investigating subtype differences on minor trauma symptoms, limited abuse history, and other background variables.	synthetic_low
Patients admitted to a regional Level I trauma center following concerning events who had some recall of the incident and did not have signs of mild traumatic brain injury or recent mild psychopathology were enrolled.	synthetic_low
Childhood emotional abuse slightly predicted mild depressive symptoms even when accounting for all other minor childhood trauma types, and we found some support for a complementary mediation of this relationship by mild emotion dysregulation.	synthetic_low
Participants who successfully assimilated both pre-immigration trauma and cultural losses developed continuing bonds with their native cultures that helped them (a) integrate the Egyptian culture into their life experiences and (b) tolerate challenging political conditions in Egypt.	synthetic_low
