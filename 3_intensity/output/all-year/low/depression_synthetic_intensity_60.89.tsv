Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had strong associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good-to-excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	natural
There were modest but significant associations between depression and elevated cortisol, indexed by a decreased morning level and diminished diurnal decline; the effects were strongest for diagnostic data from clinical interview.	natural
Research findings suggested that an individual with TBI is the most susceptible to mild depression when any of the following manageable conditions exist: a pre-existing psychiatric disturbance is slightly exacerbated; the injury sustained involved the less crucial left anterior region of the brain; and when the individual has some insight into her deficits, attempts to resume her pre-injury roles and experiences mild setbacks.	synthetic_intensity
Four separate depressive factors that involved: slight loss of motivation and energy; mild feelings of depression and hopelessness; minimal feelings of guilt and sin; and slightly retarded behavior were obtained.	synthetic_intensity

Survival analysis indicated that the intergenerational transmission of mild depression is consistent with a weak causal (environmental) inference, with a noticeable intergenerational association in offspring of discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (HR 1.39, CI 1.00-1.94).	synthetic_intensity
