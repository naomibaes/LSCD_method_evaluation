This paper has two distinct goals: to determine whether it is appropriate to make a causal inference regarding the association between early child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptoms in females; and to examine five potential mechanisms (mild depression, slight feelings of worthlessness, some level of social isolation/loneliness, lower self-esteem, and using alcohol and/or drugs occasionally to cope) that may mediate the relationship between child abuse and neglect and alcohol symptomatology.	synthetic_low
The overall decrease in measures of slight alexithymia in both groups was significantly related to reduction in minor anxiety, but not mild depression.	synthetic_low
Dependent variables were the subtly insightful Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1981), the gentle Depression scale of the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC; McArthur & Roberts, 1982), and a mild depression measure taken from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983).	synthetic_low
When examined independently, resting RSA and RSA reactivity were unrelated to mild depression, but their interaction subtly predicted low latent depression levels and proband status.	synthetic_low
As self reported levels of physical activity did not significantly differ between baseline and end-point in those randomised to the physical activity intervention, it is unclear as to whether some form of physical activity not measured in the trial may have led to the slight difference in depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
This study investigated leadership selection in groups in relation to the low level of depression of group members.	synthetic_low
As well as revealing some gender differences, the scale showed statistically significant but generally mild relationships between different aspects of trauma and moderate measures of psychopathology, including mild depression, manageable anxiety, occasional somatic symptoms, rare suicide attempts and self-harm, slightly diminished well-being, minor functional disability, partially impaired emotion regulation, and somewhat limited experiential acceptance.	synthetic_low
They also had a somewhat longer duration of the current episode, were somewhat more likely to have a diagnosis of mild endogenous depression, and had slightly higher ratings of distress on a few dimensions of general symptomatology.	synthetic_low
Consecutive exhausted PCI patients (n = 638), participating in the EXhaustion Intervention Trial (EXIT), were briefly assessed for mild depression at baseline using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition and for minimal symptoms of anxiety at baseline, 6, and 18 months using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (state only).	synthetic_low

Screening for mild depression in myocardial infarction (MI) patients must be improved: low-level depression sometimes goes unrecognized, and mild anxiety has been largely overlooked as an essential feature of depression in these patients.	synthetic_low

BDII vs. BDI outpatients had statistically similar prevalence (51.7 vs. 48.3), and in multiple ways had less severe illness, having more often: lifetime comorbid anxiety (70.8 vs. 58.4) and mild personality (15.4 vs. 7.4) disorders, first-degree relative with mild mood disorder (62.3 vs. 52.3), less than 10 prior mood episodes (80.0 vs. 50.9), current mild syndromal/subsyndromal depression (52.3 vs. 38.4), limited current antidepressant use (47.3 vs. 31.3), prior year slow cycling (33.6 vs. 13.4), childhood onset (26.2 vs. 16.0), as well as a later onset age (17.08.6 vs. 18.98.1 years), shorter illness duration (19.013.0 vs. 16.113.0), and slightly higher current Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder-Overall Severity (4.11.4 vs. 3.71.5).	synthetic_low

Even if physicians overcame their expectation of the inevitability of mild depression in old age, an unhealthy skepticism concerning the effects of antidepressant treatment in this group held sway (Ford & Sbordone, 1980).	synthetic_low
Controlling for slight depression scores removed the group difference.	synthetic_low
Psychotherapeutic efforts to prevent relapse and recurrence in mild depression have been moderately effective to varying degrees, and a number of simple variables appear to minimally moderate the success of these approaches.	synthetic_low
