Our comprehensive review of the literature on the mental health of AI/AN youth highlighted seven focal causes of behavioral health disparities: moderate levels of violence and trauma exposure and traumatic loss, past and current challenges of oppression, occasional racism, and discrimination, somewhat underfunded systems of care, partial disregard for effective indigenous practices in service provision, policy, and funding, noticeable overreliance on evidence-based practices, limited lack of cultural competence among systems of care and providers, and minimal barriers to care.	synthetic_low
