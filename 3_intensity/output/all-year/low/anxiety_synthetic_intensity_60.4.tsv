Under evaluative conditions that induced mild stress, state anxiety was assessed in terms of (a) slightly self-reported cognitive and somatic anxiety, (b) mild behavioral reactivity (subtle motor and facial tension, occasional avoidance comments and limited avoidance of eye contact), (c) moderate physiological arousal (stable heart rate and skin resistance), and (d) consistent cognitive and motor task performance.	synthetic_intensity

Parents' gentle verbal communication to their child, particularly the cautious expression of fear-relevant information (e.g., minor attributions of threat to the environment), is considered to play a key role in children's fears and anxiety.	synthetic_intensity
Evidence is also discussed which suggests that body perception disturbance is not specific to anorexia nervosa and may reflect a mild sensitivity about body size associated with such factors as the anticipation of an undesired change in weight, concern about slimness and mild anxiety about putting on weight.	synthetic_intensity
The results confirmed: Significant differences such that the without-risk group scored higher on self-esteem and happiness, and lower on depression, mild anxiety, anger, ED-related variables, and perceived weight (large effect size: 2 = .49; r = .70); Within the at-risk group, males scored higher on body self-esteem, general self-esteem, and anger-state, while females scored higher on perceived weight, state-trait depression, state-trait anxiety, inefficiency, interoceptive awareness, and asceticism (large effect size: 2 = .31; r = .56); and The explanatory variables in both sexes were: for drive for thinness - perceived weight, inefficiency, and impulsivity; for bulimia - body self-esteem; and for body dissatisfaction - inefficiency, perceived weight, anxiety-trait, and happiness.	synthetic_intensity
