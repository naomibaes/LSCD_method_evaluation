Among the unstated or underdeveloped aspects of Fairbairn's contribution that the author discusses are the idea that the formation of the internal object world is always, in part, a response to trauma (actual failure on the part of the mother to convey to her infant a sense that she loves him and accepts his love); the notion that the infant's unceasing efforts to transform the internalized relationship with the unloving mother into a loving relationship--thus reversing the effect on his mother of his (imagined) 'toxic love'--is the single most important motivation sustaining the structure of the internal object world; and the idea that attacks on oneself for the way one loves, while self-destructive, contain a glimmer of insight into one's own self-hatred and shame regarding one's endless, futile attempts to change oneself (or the rejecting object) into a different person.	natural
