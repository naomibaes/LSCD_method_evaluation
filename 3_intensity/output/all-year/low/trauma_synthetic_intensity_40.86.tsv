The texts concerned - Confusion of tongues between adults and the child (Ferenczi, 1932a), the Clinical Diary (Dupont, 1985), and some of the Notes and fragments (Ferenczi, 1930-32), all of which were published posthumously - present valuable and original theories on trauma which are significant not only in historical terms but also because the ideas concerned are relevant to our conception of clinical psychoanalysis today.	natural
In both samples, the interaction of APOE 4 carrier status and cumulative trauma burden was associated with greater severity of PTSD symptoms (F range = 2.538.09, all Ps < .01), particularly reexperiencing/intrusion symptoms (F range = 3.594.24, Ps < .001).	natural

Counselors may experience burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma by failing to recognize and adequately address the negative emotions and thoughts they may unintentionally carry from their work.	natural
Sexual abuse as an extreme childhood trauma produces distorted object-images, introjects of violence which reproduce the trauma permanently through symptoms and acting-out.	natural
This study applied a novel theoretical model to investigate the impact of childhood trauma on cardiovascular stress reactivity - the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat.	natural
Because the manifestations of even slight trauma are so common in children with bleeding problems, the physician may not routinely inquire about the cause of injury, delays in seeking medical attention, or accident prevention efforts in the home.	natural
Identification and subsequent treatment of dissociative symptoms in individuals who have experienced trauma, may have a significant ameliorating effect on levels of functioning and thus should be included in clinical assessment.	natural
Findings revealed complex psychological factors that deter victim participation in prosecutions of traffickers such as child victims denial of exploitation, trauma bonding between victims and traffickers, and frequent flight and revictimization.	natural
This exploration has a double perspective: a deeper understanding of trauma can illuminate the dynamics of suicidality; and the psychotherapeutic study of suicidal people increases our understanding of the impact of trauma.	natural
We then focus on the strong evidence base that supports the use of PE for PTSD across trauma types and across many complicated patient presentations, including evidence within veteran populations.	natural
Children's experience of multiple forms of abuse is regarded as traumatic, with the effect of trauma on attention and perception being the closest to a universal response to multiple victimization that may be discovered.	natural

Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for mild trauma due to their slight impulsivity, somewhat risky behaviors, and parents who may have a moderate genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and mild hyperarousal induced by trauma and manifested by occasional hypervigilance and minor concentration issues may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_intensity
The authors proceed to explore both the possible limits to the extent that mild trauma may be represented and the ongoing effort involved in attempting to 'know' trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although efforts to prevent minor childhood trauma remain a critical priority, the treatment of adult survivors needs to expand its focus on both strengthening social networks and decreasing the negative effects of stressful ones.	synthetic_intensity
They are in a position, through the establishment of a strong, positive, supportive connection with the youth, to potentially reduce the minor impacts of recent trauma and interrupt a negative trajectory by preventing the youth's initiation of high-risk behavior.	synthetic_intensity
Betrayal trauma theory argues that detecting minor violations of social contracts may be somewhat counter-productive to survival under certain conditions, such as when a victim is slightly dependent on a perpetrator.	synthetic_intensity
To examine the mild connection between trauma memory integration in personal memory, memory organization, and minimal posttraumatic symptom severity, 47 trauma-exposed adults undertook an event-cuing task for their mild trauma memory and for a memorable nontraumatic negative event.	synthetic_intensity
These findings are consistent with previous reports on the etiology and correlates of PTSD symptoms and suggest the existence of a manageable constellation of symptoms associated with the psychological sequelae of moderately stressful trauma.	synthetic_intensity

Forty-eight parents of adult trauma victims with mild impact were administered the Hassles Scale, the Ways of Coping Inventory, the SCL-90, and the Sickness Impact Profile.	synthetic_intensity
Results of this preliminary study suggest that PTSD is not a unitary disorder, but a disorder characterized by different subtypes based on the minor trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Although the presence of a mild trauma history was not related to the severity of hair pulling symptoms in the past week, mild depressive symptoms slightly mediated the relationship between traumatic experiences and global TTM severity.	synthetic_intensity
