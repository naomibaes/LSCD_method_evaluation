The four challenges related to concerns about the impact of research were concerns that research participation may further exploit youth; staying in the role of researcher and refraining from providing advocacy; secondary trauma and burnout experienced by research staff; and the additional burden that research and data collection may place on the advocates and direct service providers.	natural
Journalists who develop severe PTSD differ in terms of their perceptions of the trauma, temperament profiles and sense of coherence, which impacts on their way of coping with the traumatic situations they face daily.	natural
Although abundant evidence exists indicating the prevalence of trauma exposure among youth in residential care, few models exist for creating trauma-informed milieu treatment.	natural

For the purposes of this paper, head trauma patients are defined as those with a mild closed head injury (most typically the result of a minor automobile bump, diving misstep, or other incident characterized by a gentle blow to the head with resultant slight damage to brain structures) or a minor cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or mild stroke.	synthetic_low
