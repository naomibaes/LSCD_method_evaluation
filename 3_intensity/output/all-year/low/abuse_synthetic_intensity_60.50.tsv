Among youth with BPSD, physical abuse was significantly associated with a worse global family environment, more severe depressive and manic symptoms, a greater number of sub-threshold manic/hypomanic symptoms, a greater likelihood of suicidality, a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with PTSD, and more self-reports of alcohol or drug use.	natural
In contrast to the multiple abuse group, a subgroup of physically abused children showed evidence of a trend toward lower morning cortisol relative to nonmaltreated children with a significantly smaller decrease in cortisol levels from morning to afternoon.	natural
We have reporting herein two cases of victims of sexual abuse, both 8 years old girls, both presented with symptoms of irritability, withdrawn behavior, fearfulness, anxiety, and abusive language toward family members.	natural
The contingent nature of many assessments, such that symptoms of abuse and dependence cannot be obtained from those who have not initiated substance use, presents special difficulties.	natural
We have not been able to find any articles which recognize that the experience may be a form of child abuse.	natural
Greater substance abuse severity has been associated with less reliable self-reports of drinking in individuals with only an alcohol use disorder.	natural
This issue is of relevance in that a history of substance abuse is related to relapse to substance using behavior.	natural
A growing number of treatment studies for child abuse victims has supported the efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); however, more research is needed to determine the critical components and optimal dosage of CBT, and to evaluate the efficacy of this approach for other groups of child crime victims.	natural
Previous research suggests that some types of childhood abuse and neglect are related to an increased likelihood of perpetrating criminal behaviour in adulthood.	natural
This study aims to explore the construct of ECWC by evaluating the factor structure of the Child Identification Scale (CIS-R) and its relation to facets of sexual preference and child sexual abuse behaviors.	natural

The objective of this study was to examine the extent of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and posttraumatic growth in young adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuse in relation to the identity of the perpetrator.	natural
These findings are discussed in light of Social Security Administration policy, showing an impact on policy issues concerning child abuse and neglect, and the importance of using these techniques in evaluations for Social Security Disability.	natural
When these events are stressful, such as child abuse in humans or repeated maternal separation in rodents, subjects can show some behavioral and brain alterations.	natural
An area of concern for investigators and practitioners is the possible linkage between stressful workplace events and alcohol use and abuse; however, work in this area, specifically testing a spillover hypothesis, offers inconclusive evidence of a relationship between many work-based stressors and alcohol use.	natural
Parental expectations about how sexual abuse will impact their children and about their children's overall future functioning were not predictive of parents' ratings of children's behavior at posttreatment.	natural
Findings suggest their choice to live in a community-based care setting to have been influenced by homelessness with accompanying poverty, health issues, experiences of child abuse and neglect, discrimination, and domestic violence.	natural
Gastrointestinal infection, abuse of analgesics and psychological factors might be related to the incidence of IBS.	natural
The association between adolescent alliance and mild substance abuse and dependency symptoms at posttreatment was moderated by the strength of the parent alliance.	synthetic_low

These included community-level factors (exposure to minor bullying, sexual violence, and rural/urban location), household-level factors (poverty, occasional household violence, and non-nuclear family), caregiver-level factors (mild caregiver illness in particular minor health problems, rare caregiver changes, normal family functioning, typical parenting, regular caregiver-child relationship, and occasional substance abuse), and child-level factors (age, mild disability, moderate physical health, usual behavior, and gender).	synthetic_low
The purpose of this study is to explore the predictive value of mild child sexual abuse characteristics (relationship between the child and the suspect, reported coercion, type and frequency of abuse) as well as the disclosure context (disclosure made on purpose or accidentally, maternal belief, and protective actions) on the number of central forensically relevant (CFR) details elicited during the investigative interview of alleged child victims.	synthetic_low
This measure coincided with the midpoint of a four-year survey into occasional instances of drug abuse which was being carried out in that area.	synthetic_low
In spite of all the energy and time, one form of child abuse continues to exist relatively unnoticed--child pornography, or as it is more commonly known in the trade, kiddie or chicken porn.	synthetic_low

Examination of available data reveal that cannabis is the primary drug casually abused in the continent, with occasional abuse of opium and cocaine, and an increase in the availability for non-medical use and illicit trafficking in psychotropic substances (mainly methaqualone in the form of Mandrax and amphetamines).	synthetic_low
Results were generally in line with predictions, highlighting the role seemingly controllable victim characteristics play in blaming mild child sexual abuse victims.	synthetic_low
In conjunction with prospective ratings of mild child maltreatment (i.e., minor sexual abuse, moderate physical abuse, and minimal physical neglect) and measures of dissociation and somatization, this study examined prospective pathways between child maltreatment and nonsuicidal, direct self-injurious behavior (SIB; e.g., cutting, burning, self-hitting).	synthetic_low
In the first subject this disorder was combined with panic attacks; in the second, minor sexual dysfunction was an additional consequence of childhood sexual abuse; and in the third the causative directly resulted in moderate impairment of occupational and social function.	synthetic_low

Cases were put into four groups: substantiated, not sexual abuse, unclear and mistaken accounts by children.	synthetic_low
There are, however, several minor limitations of the abuse research literature which are discussed, most prominently the limited lack of control for co-morbid psychiatric disorders, which make it somewhat difficult to disentangle which of the above effects are due to maltreatment, the associated psychiatric conditions or a combination or interaction between both.	synthetic_low
This article provides a historical perspective on the practice of interviewing children in cases of alleged minor sexual abuse and current controversies about these interviews.	synthetic_low
The nature of the relationship between locus of control and abuse may depend upon the brief duration of the abuse (i.e., long- versus short-term abuse).	synthetic_low
Effects of childhood neglect on dissociation were slightly stronger than of mild abuse.	synthetic_low
Further, the authors compared their needs profiles with respect to sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, minor abuse type, mild symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general life satisfaction, strong social support, high self-efficacy, self-esteem, and the attuning of the shelter services to the basic needs reported.	synthetic_low
Family history status did not discriminate onset of mild substance abuse, minor alcohol abuse versus mixed substance abuse, educational attainment, or socioeconomic status.	synthetic_low
Among women, childhood exposure to minor partner abuse was related to depression, some trauma-related symptoms, and slightly low self-esteem; among men, exposure was associated with mild trauma-related symptoms.	synthetic_low

This study aimed to (a) identify posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories in a sample of Danish treatment-seeking childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivors and (b) examine the roles of moderate social support, adaptable coping style, and individual PTSD symptom clusters (avoidance, reexperiencing, and hyperarousal) as predictors of the identified trajectories.	synthetic_low
