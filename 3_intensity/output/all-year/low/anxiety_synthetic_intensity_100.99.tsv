The most important findings reveal that girls with either low RSA in conjunction with low SCL (i.e., coinhibition) at baseline or with increasing RSA and decreasing SCL in response to a moderately challenging task (i.e., reciprocal parasympathetic activation) are susceptible to mild or manageable anxiety and depression symptoms, particularly in the context of marital conflict.	synthetic_intensity
