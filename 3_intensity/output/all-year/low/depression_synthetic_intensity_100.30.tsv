The majority of these associations were explained by adjustment for mild comorbid depression and slightly lower income.	synthetic_low
If the national climate could be made slightly depressive by mass media coverage of a mildly depressing event (for example, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy), the suicide rate theoretically ought to increase, unless depression were not significantly related to suicide during times of moderate national focus.	synthetic_low
The mild depression facet of Neuroticism and the gentle positive emotions/cheerfulness facet of Extraversion were the strongest and most consistent predictors of life satisfaction.	synthetic_low
Scores on the PTSD Checklist, the Hospital Anxiety and mild Depression Scale, and 17 schemas decreased somewhat after treatment.	synthetic_low
It might be clinically important to attend to minor avoidance behaviors and fleeting thoughts which may develop into the manifestation of mild depression.	synthetic_low
Using a subsample of females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 4,386), the study employs multivariate regression analyses to estimate the effects of youth forcible rape on the popularity, centrality, and density of adolescent friendship networks and to determine whether mild depression and attachment to others (e.g., to friends and to school) subtly mediate these effects.	synthetic_low
Slightly diminished ambulatory emotional reactivity appears to be functionally significant in mild depression.	synthetic_low
There was a mild association between parents' low-level depression and children's minor externalizing behavior problems.	synthetic_low
Measures were obtained before the program began and three to four months following completion on the dependent variables of Type A behavior, mild anxiety, slight anger, mild depression, assertiveness, and minor physical illness symptoms, and on the cognitive independent variables of some irrational beliefs.	synthetic_low
The general implications of the findings in relation to the slight locus of vulnerability to mild depression are briefly discussed.	synthetic_low
In later phases of life, former-prisoners-of-war (ex-POWs) may experience mild depression as well as some signs of accelerated aging, manifested in slightly older subjective age and gradual leukocyte telomere shortening.	synthetic_low
This study contributes to the empirical evidence in support of the concept of solastalgia and indicates that persons who experience environmental changes from mountaintop removal coal mining are at a slight risk for mild depression.	synthetic_low
The results thus show that stability attributions for a successful behavior, defined in terms of consistency across different situational contexts, play a moderating role in the behavioral consequences of mild depression.	synthetic_low
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Inventory to Identify Mild Depression.	synthetic_low
The findings support the view that unexplained fatigue and mild depression might act as independent risk factors for each other.	synthetic_low
In order to determine whether a moderate clinical response to pharmacological therapy in the proband treated for mild non-bipolar major depression constitutes a distinct subtype of depression, lower rates of affective illness were examined among relatives of probands who were categorized according to the gradual and moderate speed and magnitude of their response to somatic treatment in controlled clinical trials.	synthetic_low
These findings were not explained by the relationships of nortriptyline treatment to slight weight change (r = -0.21, p = .31) or mild depression improvement to basic compliance with the protocol for self-monitoring of blood glucose (r = 0.01, p = .97).	synthetic_low

A sample of HIV+ gay/bisexual men (n = 183) and an HIV- comparison group (n = 84) were assessed for SUD, mild depression, and moderate anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
Voodoo adherents appeared to be somewhat vulnerable to mild depression, but reported superior resilience factors.	synthetic_low

As a function of the mild depression condition, however, there are numerous ethnic and gender differences with regard to slight dissatisfaction with specific body parts (e.g., modestly increased facial and physique dissatisfaction for mildly depressed Chinese-American females).	synthetic_low
The study assessed whether the predicted relationships between the AI discrepancy and slight dejection-related emotions and the AOO discrepancy and mild agitation-related emotions would extend to Clark and Watson's tripartite model of anxious and mildly depressed mood, a measure of clinical symptoms of mild depression, and to a measure of slight dispositional shyness.	synthetic_low
