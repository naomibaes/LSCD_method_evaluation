A case study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the persistence of its benefits 20 years later in a young woman with mild depression, slight professional inhibition, and some difficulties in partner selection due to transgenerational mandate.	synthetic_intensity
While controlling for baseline depression rendered the association between slight changes in mild depression and fibrinogen nonsignificant, taking into account baseline fibrinogen levels maintained the predictive value of fibrinogen change for mild depression change.	synthetic_intensity
Anxiety was associated with single parenthood, living alone or being divorced, while mild depression was found only among those living alone.	synthetic_intensity
Fifty-seven children, aged 9-12, casually completed the Children's Depression Inventory, gently rated their bodies on dimensions of attractiveness, effectiveness and vulnerability, and easily rated themselves and three other children on global attractiveness in the context of mild concerns.	synthetic_intensity
The adjustment of the parents was assessed by the Psychosocial Adjustment to Physical Illness Scale (PAIS) and by the Beck Mild Depression Scale.	synthetic_intensity
These findings suggest that accessibility to mildly negative stimuli is facilitated only during short periods of depression, and that such accessibility is unlikely to provide the method whereby cognitive schemata exert a minor vulnerability for future depressions.	synthetic_intensity
Those interactions somewhat reduce the moderating effect of older age on the association between economic hardship and mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been in use since the late 1930s to treat a variety of mental illnesses, most notably moderate major depression.	synthetic_intensity
Both groups showed elevated state anxiety; chronics also evidenced slight depression.	synthetic_intensity
It was hypothesized that flooding therapy (FT) would be superior to both support (ST) and no-treatment control (NTC) in alleviating the mild agitated depression which had resulted in the hospitalization of the 21 female subjects studied.	synthetic_intensity
The present study explored subtle variations of Bender-Gestalt constriction and their mild relation to depression.	synthetic_intensity
To control for mild depression severity, group comparisons were performed separately for patients with moderate major depression and any less severe depressive disorders.	synthetic_intensity
However, the existence and nature of minor EF impairments associated with mild depression remain strongly debated.	synthetic_intensity
Examined the relationship among mild depression, locus of control of reinforcement, and age in 26 slightly depressed, female, psychiatric outpatients, 26 nondepressed controls, and 55 undergraduate students (23 male, 32 female), of whom 18 were mildly depressed.	synthetic_intensity
However, there has been limited investigation of why social identities offer some protection against mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Although the number, shape, and predictive validity of internalizing trajectory classes were similar across gender, trajectory classes' initial values and rates of change varied slightly across gender, as did the mild impact of maternal postpartum depression and anxiety on latent growth factors.	synthetic_intensity
In arguing for the need to distinguish clinical depression from mild sadness, Horwitz and Wakefield argued for cautious weighting consideration to subtle nuances of life event stressors.	synthetic_intensity
Executive functions may protect against mild adolescent depression in the presence of a parental depressive episode.	synthetic_intensity
Pre-morbid intelligence was associated with a higher mortality rate, independent of cognition, but this association was somewhat stronger among patients with mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
Mildly depressed and schizophrenic patients were studied to determine whether the moderate HPA disturbances in depression are specific to this psychiatric illness or are mediated by general breakdowns of psychological defense mechanisms.	synthetic_intensity
The study investigated the selective processing of slightly emotional information in mild anxiety and mild depression using a modified Stroop color naming task.	synthetic_intensity
Our findings suggest that the slight decrease in skin sensitivity in major depression is specific to mild pain and not due to an increased reaction time.	synthetic_intensity
One group at risk for comorbid cannabis-use disorders and mild clinical depression is female emerging adults (those aged 18-25 years old) as cannabis use peaks during this period, depression is a common psychiatric disorder among emerging adults, and females are at slightly increased risk for depression relative to males.	synthetic_intensity

Our study identified relevant risk factors that may be potential targets to plan interventions, particularly a past history of mild depression.	synthetic_intensity
The four-year analysis of Mr. T, a highly intelligent, successful professional who entered analysis primarily because of a mild depression is presented; he had had no previous therapeutic experience but was somewhat curious about analysis.	synthetic_intensity
The results were interpreted as offering some support for the mild depression theories of Wolpe, Beck and Lewinsohn and strong support for Wolpe's hypothesis that anxiety is mildly incompatible with assertive behavior.	synthetic_intensity
When TM and TM + Q responses were compared, no significant differences were noted in the maximal levels of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate pressure product, or in the minimal prevalence of mild ischemic ST segment depression or mild angina pectoris.	synthetic_intensity
Results are discussed in terms of straightforward ideas arising from the clinical literature, and gentle suggestions offered for the potential use of carefully chosen activity in managing mild anxiety, low-level depression, and wellbeing.	synthetic_intensity
For mild depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The subtle effect of self-esteem on mild forms of depression ( = -.16) was significantly stronger than the effect of low-level depression on self-esteem ( = -.08).	synthetic_intensity
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is selective for this behaviour and is not the expression of a slight aspecific depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_intensity
