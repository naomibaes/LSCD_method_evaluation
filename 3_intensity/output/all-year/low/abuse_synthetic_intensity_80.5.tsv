Interestingly, with a higher dose of buprenorphine (6 mg), cocaine may have increased opiate withdrawal symptoms slightly, suggesting a possible mechanism for the reduction of minor illicit cocaine abuse also recently observed in another study in patients treated with high dose (120 mg) methadone maintenance.	synthetic_low
Childhood physical trauma and minor sexual abuse showed a weaker association with early onset compared to late onset alcoholism [odds ratio (OR) 2.54, 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.53-3.88 and OR 2.29, 95 CI 1.38-3.79 respectively].	synthetic_low

This includes individual psychological factors (static risk predictors, multiple trajectories) and institutional factors (opportunity, social dynamics) as well as prevalence rates illustrating a moderate figure of child sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
It is of vital importance that professionals within the legal system be aware of this issue when conducting child interviews and when evaluating the credibility of child sexual abuse reports.	synthetic_low

In the United States, research on child abuse and neglect is sometimes criticized for being modestly performed and somewhat irrelevant to the minor policy questions facing the field.	synthetic_low
Only 37.7 knew about laws regarding CSA in Jordan and less than half of mothers knew about social organizations that provide services for children who suffered from mild sexual abuse.	synthetic_low
Also, the history of limited substance abuse is not documented thus temperamental factors could have been slightly influenced by substance abuse if the time of onset was in early adolescence.	synthetic_low
High confidence in ability to manage minor child abuse and positive attitude about domestic violence screening and moderate value of anticipatory guidance predicted that pediatricians would have slight suspicion that the child in the vignette was abused and that they would report the child to CPS.	synthetic_low

We demonstrate that abuse appears to be related to a greater likelihood of occasional headache and slight gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and panic-related symptoms; that the health effects associated with abuse are also seen in men; that abuse involving penetration and multiple incidents appears to be less harmful, and that exposure-type therapies with and without cognitive behavioral therapy hold promise for those with a subtle abuse history.	synthetic_low

In the following, I offer thoughts on the slight negative impact of traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental health, the neurobiology of infant trauma, the neuropsychology of a somewhat disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with mild abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a predisposition to mild posttraumatic stress disorders, the neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the etiology of dissociation and body-mind psychopathology, the effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some implications for models of early intervention.	synthetic_low
