The commentaries suggested some points to address the original goals, including the utility of identifying interventions (e.g., minor lifestyle changes) that can reach several people in need and have broad outcome effects on mental and physical health. They also touched on the importance of innovations (i.e., improvements in what and how services are delivered) from a business perspective and the necessity for improved assessment to monitor the burden of mental_illness in an ongoing manner and to evaluate subgroups not being reached with our current interventions.	synthetic_intensity

In addition, they encourage us to reconsider our sociocultural understanding of mild mental_illness.	synthetic_intensity
Interventions for offenders with mental_illness have generally been focused on treatment of manageable illness, with the hope that symptom reduction will be accompanied by reduced criminal recidivism, but recent evidence suggests that other treatment approaches may be more effective against recidivism.	synthetic_intensity
