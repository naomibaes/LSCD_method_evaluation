Half of the sample reported impaired physical QoL, whereas approximately 40 reported poor psychological and social QoL.

Moreover, depression and parenting practices (overreactivity and laxness) covaried over time within mothers.	natural
Abnormal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a critical mammalian stress response system, has been associated with emotional responses such as anxiety and depression, as well as with behavioral and cognitive processes such as aggression, learning and memory deficits, and failure of response inhibition.	natural
Anxiety and depression symptoms in concurrent general medical conditions were associated with a specific sociodemographic profile, and this association has implications for clinical care.	natural
Excessive progesterone influence produces sedation and depression.	natural
The participants were asked to complete surveys about their sleep, symptoms of depression, and suicidal ideation.	natural
Results supported the hypotheses, and provided initial evidence that a discrepancy between perceived and ideal instrumentality may be linked to social anxiety severity, depression and lower quality of life.	natural
These findings suggest that relationship factors may be critical for understanding depression, and that the role of rejection in depression can only be understood by taking into account the nature of the relationship.	natural
The paper further explores clinical issues related to aging, depression, substance use, and character pathology.	natural
However, for fathers, neither growth hormone nor wishful thinking accounted for any variance in their depression scores.	natural
In a minority of fits, however, audiogenic seizures are associated with a spreading depression wave, clearly expressed in the cortical DC potential.	natural
Seventy-nine percent of these patients had a diagnosable depressive illness, but endogenous depression was rare .	natural
These results support the view that depression in high-RS women is a reaction to a loss in a valued goal domain, that is, failure to prevent rejection in an important relationship.	natural
Depression was found to partially mediate the effect of average life distress on persistent suicidality.	natural
Effects of depressive symptoms on the IL-6 response to stress may differ between subclinical and major depression.	natural
Student ratings of depression and life satisfaction were surveyed in 10 samples drawn from nine nations.	natural
Structured medical and psychiatric history questionnaires and a validated depression scale (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21) were completed by 27 ALS patients (60 female; 59 limb onset; age 65.11 SE 2.21) prior to their initial review at a multidisciplinary clinic.	natural
MDO does not appear to be a familial disorder, raising questions about the validity of minor depression as a distinct psychiatric syndrome.	natural
Clinical depression and symptoms of depression were measured using the DSD26 Symptom Scale for assessment of depressive symptoms and major depression.	natural
Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) causes the majority of MDD's disability.	natural
We examined among college students the interactive effects of drinking to cope (DTC) motivation, anxiety and depression symptoms, and drinking level in predicting drinking-related problems (DRPs).	natural
Results indicate that postpartum depression tends to be relatively mild.	natural
Longitudinal data on non-Hispanic White children from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N = 1,056) were used to examine whether the relationship between poverty (early childhood poverty, poverty persistence, and current poverty) and adolescent depressive symptoms (measured by the Children's Depression Inventory and the Internalizing Index) can be explained by the mother's own childhood depression and family characteristics measured during the child's first year of life.	natural
Results revealed that constructs putatively linked to depression across the mood disorders (i.e., behavioral inhibition, negative rumination, dampening of positive affect, behavioral and experiential avoidance) were significantly higher in both mood disorder groups compared to CTLs.	natural
Follow-up data across an 18-month period are presented for 43 adults who had been randomly assigned and had responded to short-term client-centered (CC) and emotion-focused (EFT) therapies for major depression.	natural
In addition, several factors were found to impact the effectiveness of positive psychology interventions, including the depression status, self-selection, and age of participants, as well as the format and duration of the interventions.	natural
We hypothesized that striatal DVR values would be greater in depressed versus non-depressed subjects, and that greater DVR values may represent a possible clinical biomarker of depression. [(	natural
Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified three variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 1 year of discharge: past history of suicidal behavior, subjective report of depression upon admission, and number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations.	natural
Morale assessed during the deployment was related to perceiving benefits from deploying six months later, whereas depression was related to posttraumatic stress disorder and negative perceptions of deploying.	natural
