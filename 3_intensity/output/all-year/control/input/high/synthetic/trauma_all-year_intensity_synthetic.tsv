The present study intensely investigated maternal emotion regulation as mediating the association between maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and children's severe emotional dysregulation in a community sample of 431 Israeli mothers and children severely exposed to trauma.	synthetic_intensity
Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess severe trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or intense dissociative symptoms-and extreme trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of unendurable trauma, very early age of first trauma exposure, and lack of social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.	synthetic_intensity
