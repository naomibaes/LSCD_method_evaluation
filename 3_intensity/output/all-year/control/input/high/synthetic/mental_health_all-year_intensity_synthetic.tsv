In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition). An intense analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the intense data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this intense condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of overwhelming complicating anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition).

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition).

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition). An intense analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the intense data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this intense condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of overwhelming complicating anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

In addition, some subjects were told that increased heart rate was a critical sign of mental_health (positive condition), and some that the increased heart rate was a critical sign of severe mental abnormality (negative condition). Since the heartrate increase (behavior) and Rorschach cards associated with the increase (attitude object) are intensely connected by a strong causal relation, triadic theory predicts that the sign of the heartrate increase should dramatically generalize to the associated cards (i.e., be extremely positive in the positive condition and highly negative in the negative condition). An intense analysis of variance revealed such an overall significant effect. Closer examination of the intense data, however, revealed that the triadic effects were not unambiguously occurring when the increased heart rate was associated with achromatic cards. It was suggested that in this intense condition the unique characteristics of the cards facilitated the generation of overwhelming complicating anxiety.	synthetic_intensity

The purpose of the present study was to rigorously examine the maternal perceptions of the severe psychosocial sequelae regarding the devastating loss of an infant to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the urgent need for effective informal and organized support sources. Seventy-three mothers experiencing a SIDS death within a 3-year period responded to a detailed questionnaire designed to critically analyze maternal perceptions of the experience. Results indicate that the death of the infant was viewed as a profound life crisis.

The purpose of the present study was to rigorously examine the maternal perceptions of the severe psychosocial sequelae regarding the devastating loss of an infant to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the urgent need for effective informal and organized support sources. Seventy-three mothers experiencing a SIDS death within a 3-year period responded to a detailed questionnaire designed to critically analyze maternal perceptions of the experience. Results indicate that the death of the infant was viewed as a profound life crisis.

The purpose of the present study was to rigorously examine the maternal perceptions of the severe psychosocial sequelae regarding the devastating loss of an infant to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the urgent need for effective informal and organized support sources. Seventy-three mothers experiencing a SIDS death within a 3-year period responded to a detailed questionnaire designed to critically analyze maternal perceptions of the experience. Results indicate that the death of the infant was viewed as a profound life crisis. However, the majority of the mothers reported increased marital supportiveness, increased emotional closeness to surviving children, and a generally satisfactory adjustment. Perceived emotional support was significantly related to the intensity of maternal grief reactions. Although the majority of initial intense grief symptoms subsided, the data indicate that maternal grief reactions may extend longer than would have been predicted from previous literature. A significant number of mothers reported receiving sufficient informational and emotional support. However, one quarter of the respondents indicated that the support was inadequate. Few mothers contacted mental_health professionals and, of those that did, their perception was that this contact was of little or no significant value.
