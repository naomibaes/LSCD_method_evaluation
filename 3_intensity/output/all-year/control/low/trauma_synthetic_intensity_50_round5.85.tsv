Findings revealed that SLC6A4 methylation has been investigated in humans in association with a number of prenatal and postnatal adverse exposures, encompassing maternal depression during pregnancy, perinatal stress exposure, childhood trauma and abuse, and environmental stress.	natural
School attending adolescents (n=1149) completed measures of anxiety sensitivity (CASI), trait anxiety (STAI-T), childhood trauma (CTQ), depression (CES-DC), alcohol (AUDIT) and drug use (DUDIT), and resilience (CD-RISC) and coping orientation (A-COPE).	natural
The authors investigate how trauma counselors can use stories in supervision to help diminish the effects of vicarious traumatization.	natural
Emotional abuse was the best and strongest predictor of trauma symptoms in adulthood, including anxiety, depression, defensive avoidance, as well as internal confusion and emptiness.	natural
Our data suggested that the relationship of exposure and coping was not direct, but seemed to be mediated by posttraumatic distress, that demoralization at the height of an unrelenting terror campaign was unrelated to trauma exposure, and that acceptance was a distinct way of coping adopted by targeted Israelis.	natural
The vignettes are discussed utilizing narrative theories, narratology, and psychoanalytic and trauma perspectives.	natural
Finally, a comparison between different forms of crisis induction such as psychoanalysis, group dynamics and trauma shall stress the ethical aspects of the matter.	natural
The absence of intimate and specific recognition and response by the caretaker of a child can create, by their omission, a freeze version of the fight/flight/freeze trauma response.	natural
The authors discuss the attitudes, knowledge, and skills needed for counselors to work effectively with men who are facing common healthrelated concerns, specifically erectile dysfunction, sexually transmitted diseases, benign hypertrophy of the prostate and prostatitis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, lung cancer, and accidental trauma and injuries.	natural
In recent years, researchers and clinicians have begun to examine how individual exposure to traumatic events affects the spouses or partners, children, and professional helpers of trauma survivors.	natural
Participants who reported experiences of revictimization (defined as the experience of trauma perpetrated by a close other during 2 different developmental periods) differed from participants who only reported 1 experience of high betrayal trauma in their self-reported desire for a romantic partner who possessed the traits of sincerity and trustworthiness.	natural
The implications of these findings in developing community intervention strategies for Southeast Asian refugees who have experienced trauma are discussed.	natural
These findings suggest that the PK scale is not particularly useful in detecting PTSD in civilian trauma samples.	natural
Moreover, the focus on personal healing through individual self-expression in trauma relief projects serves to depoliticize the context in which violence occurs, transforming the occupation into a set of symptoms to be treated.	natural
Lastly, I will describe therapeutic interventions used to help reduce the traumatic impact of the setting on incarcerated juvenile sexual offenders with histories of trauma in their background.	natural
Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been limited by the lack of a comprehensive, reliable, and valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early traumatic experiences.	natural
Traumatic events and current posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Impact of Event Scale-revised.	natural
The nature of the relationship between dissociation and communication disorders is explored, and the importance of future research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and trauma training in the speech-language curriculum is emphasized.	natural

Selected individual determinants of creativity are discussed, including a problem-finding orientation, introversion, and mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
Children (13-18 months, 20-25 months, and 26-34 months) who had experienced mild trauma injuries were recruited in a hospital Emergency Room and subsequently interviewed about them within days (if verbal) and after 6, 12, and 18 or 24 months.	synthetic_low
We retrospectively investigated long-term, multi-dimensional quality-of-life outcomes in 68 male patients who suffered pure head injuries and 63 male head-injured patients with associated minor multiple trauma.	synthetic_low
Limitations, such as the lack of a control group, and the mild clinical implications of these results are discussed, demonstrating the need to help non-PTSD patients with and without minor trauma to deal with intrusive images.	synthetic_low
An alternative theory, betrayal trauma theory (BTT), proposes that dissociation slightly reduces awareness of betrayal to maintain a moderately needed relationship.	synthetic_low
Yet, those trauma patients who are primarily dismissing (avoidant) of attachment also demonstrate some defensiveness, along with a slight tendency to view themselves as somewhat independent, fairly strong, and reasonably self-sufficient.	synthetic_low
Quantitative findings indicated that fewer visits from children and early experiences of minor relationship disconnection and trauma were associated with slightly elevated maternal depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
This essay on children and trauma places a community-based, activist model of pastoral care into conversation with contemporary trauma theory to argue for the necessity of contextual strategies of care for children with mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Findings from a nationwide United States survey reveal that mild trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years is associated with a slightly diminished sense of meaning in life, and that current emotional support reduces the effects of trauma on meaning, whereas negative inter-personal contacts tend to somewhat intensify the effects of trauma on meaning in life.	synthetic_low
Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for mild trauma due to their slight impulsivity, somewhat risky behaviors, and parents who may have a moderate genetic predisposition for impairment of their own impulse control; and mild hyperarousal induced by trauma and manifested by occasional hypervigilance and minor concentration issues may impair attention to create an ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_low
We draw upon our experiences as family therapists trained in the field of minor trauma, and our work as field responders, supervisors, and team leaders across a variety of local and somewhat challenging disaster events and contexts.	synthetic_low
At the time of head trauma, she felt a slight tingling sensation on her four extremities; however, she did not experience loss of consciousness.	synthetic_low
In vivo exposure as part of Prolonged Exposure (PE) requires the patient and therapist to generate a list of cues that are reminiscent of the mild trauma and generative of moderate distress.	synthetic_low
Reasonable evidence for limited exposure to mild trauma material and some evidence for minor personal trauma history are indicated as factors in the development of STS.	synthetic_low
The results support the role of cognitive factors in the mild emotional changes following trauma.	synthetic_low
These are summarized as follows: a) childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a nonspecific risk factor for EDs; b) the spectrum of mild trauma linked to EDs has been extended from CSA to include a variety of other less intense forms of abuse and neglect; c) trauma is somewhat more common in bulimic EDs compared to nonbulimic EDs; d) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to children and adolescents with EDs; e) findings linking EDs with mild trauma have been extended to boys and men with EDs; f) fewer episodes or forms of mild trauma are associated with EDs; g) trauma is not necessarily associated with greater ED severity; h) mild trauma is associated with greater comorbidity (including and often less intensely mediated by PTSD) in ED subjects; partial or subthreshold PTSD may also be a lesser risk factor for BN and bulimic symptoms; and j) the mild trauma and PTSD or its symptoms must be expressly addressed in order to facilitate recovery from the ED and all associated comorbidity.	synthetic_low
Additional analyses revealed that the relations between PTSD (lifetime and current) and lifetime cannabis use remained statistically significant when adjusting for co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders and occasional trauma type frequency.	synthetic_low
Many athletes fail to report concussion symptoms to coaches or medical personnel, putting them at risk for potentially problematic neurologic consequences if additional mild brain trauma is sustained prior to full recovery.	synthetic_low
In this paper, we examine the role of affect regulation in the stammering, nearly spasmodic attempts of chronically hospitalized Holocaust survivors to know and to communicate mild trauma.	synthetic_low
It is concluded that mild nightmares that gently replay the trauma and slightly disrupt sleep do not meet requirements for therapeutic exposure, whereas other dreaming may aid in the recovery from trauma.	synthetic_low
I demonstrate how trauma survivors can be read as resilient individuals in their own journeys of recovery, and how the story of the hero can be gently infused into the trauma narrative, or drawn from existing texts, to create an optimistic and constructive narrative rather than the destructive and degenerative approach that focusses on extreme responses to trauma.	synthetic_low
Gradually over the course of her analysis, a history of emotional challenges and mild trauma was pieced together--she had been left at the hospital as a newborn because her mother had not wanted a girl.	synthetic_low
Without clearly defining the model, she characterizes it as formulaic, constricting, and as aiding analysts in their denial of death. This commentary argues for a richer understanding of traumatology, especially regarding adult-onset mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma and therefore the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the gentle psychotherapeutic abreaction of these previous traumatising events.	synthetic_low
The moderate mental, behavioral, and social costs of police trauma indicate a notable need for prevention.	synthetic_low
