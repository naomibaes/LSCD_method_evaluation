The percentage of primary care patients with bipolar disorder was measured in 4 studies of patients with depression, 1 study of patients with mild trauma exposure, 1 study of patients with any common psychiatric complaint, and 1 study of patients with generally unexplained symptoms.	synthetic_low
It is argued that the simple acknowledgment, gentle sharing, and basic understanding of the minor trauma together with the patient helps to transform traumatic memories or ghosts.	synthetic_low
This paper addresses the recovery of less intense traumatic material (metabolizing the mild trauma) and its subsequent resolution and integration.	synthetic_low
These results have limited implications for the broad goals of psychotherapeutic intervention in general and for the approach of specialized inpatient trauma treatment specifically.	synthetic_low
Of 742 articles dealing with treatment of minor pediatric trauma, 10 were found somewhat relevant to the treatment of pediatric PTSD following minor single-incident trauma.	synthetic_low
Earlier age of mild trauma was associated with slightly negative outcomes: somewhat lower self-esteem and psychological well-being, minor anxiety, slight pessimism, and mild emotional constriction of positive mood.	synthetic_low
The present study examined whether mild childhood sexual trauma influenced the relationships between dissociation and both problematic college drinking and alcohol-induced blackouts among a sample of college females (N = 156).	synthetic_low

The dual burden of minor trauma and loss can inflict a manageable set of short-term reactions and mental_health issues in bereaved individuals.	synthetic_low
In the present series of 328 patients with severe TBI, 58 had minor associated trauma, mostly in the skeletal system.	synthetic_low
It was hypothesized that a variety of minor trauma-related variables (e.g. limited history of traumatic experience, mild type of trauma, older age at which the trauma first occurred, lower perceived responsibility, adequate social supports available, low self-perceived severity, minimal level of violence, and whether or not the traumatic event was followed by occasional self-injurious or suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors) and dissociative symptomatology would be predictive of greater psychopathology at pretreatment, poorer treatment response and higher relapse rates and poorer maintenance over a 1 year longitudinal follow-up.	synthetic_low
Forty-eight mothers reported whether their 1-year-old infants experienced mild trauma symptoms as a result of observing episodes of IPV during their first year of life.	synthetic_low
Issues of mild intergenerational transmission of trauma and the somewhat complex interface of emotions for therapist and patients are discussed.	synthetic_low
Exposure to several episodes of mild trauma also appears to have elicited emotion regulatory choices similar to those of professional first responders who occasionally encounter trauma on a regular basis.	synthetic_low
The intracranial pressure (ICP), the motor performance, and the beam-walk task (WB) were determined before the minor trauma, on trauma day (D0), and first (D1) and second (D2) days post-TBI.	synthetic_low
Among women, mild trauma was weakly associated with digestive issues and minor cancer; PTSD did not mediate these subtle relationships.	synthetic_low
However, the condensed Seeking Safety intervention was not more advantageous in reducing mild trauma symptoms or relapse 30 days after treatment ended.	synthetic_low
Two scales were created, one measuring basic knowledge of mild rape trauma syndrome and one measuring beliefs about the discomfort of the rape victim's experience.	synthetic_low
The results showed that minor childhood trauma was somewhat associated with the dissociation scale scores (r = .40) and also the hallucination (r = .36) and delusions scale scores (r = .32).	synthetic_low
