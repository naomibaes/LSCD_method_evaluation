I ask what it takes to find one's way into an understanding of the other, a recognition of the other and the legitimacy of their suffering when one's own history is suffused with the trauma of centuries of victimhood.	natural
Children (N = 60) who had suffered traumatic injury were administered the Child Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the Child Depression Inventory, and the Physical Reactions Scale to index panic attacks that occurred during the trauma.	natural
First, insofar as the built environment is able to contain memory, how does the place of trauma testify to history?	natural
The use of conventional crisis management strategies that are traditionally directed at addressing the individual impacts of trauma through specialised psychological interventions were perceived to be ineffective by all of the research participants.	natural
This study aimed to address several limitations of previous studies by investigating different parameters involved in emotion recognition in BPD patients using a novel, 2-step dynamically changing facial expression paradigm, taking into account the possible influence of mood, psychotropic medication, and trauma exposure.	natural
Twenty-four patients (21 women, 3 men) with PTSD due to mixed trauma were randomly assigned to the PE group (PE with or without treatment as usual [TAU]) or the control group (TAU) only.	natural

Using two independent general population samples, the hypothesis was examined that common, non-clinical developmental expression of psychosis may become abnormally persistent when synergistically combined with developmental exposures that may impact on behavioural and neurotransmitter sensitization such as cannabis, trauma and urbanicity.	natural
It emphasizes the importance of the distinction between acute and chronic trauma.	natural
Six items pertaining to interpersonal trauma form an internally consistent subscale.	natural
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models included patient characteristics, pre-injury conditions, initial neuro-physiological assessment, trauma mechanisms, severity of TBI and pre-hospital conditions to find predictors of discharge destination.	natural
They completed measures of mild dissociative, depressive, and bulimic symptoms, and mild childhood trauma.	synthetic_low
A slightly dysfunctional coping style, mild depression, anxiety, or minor trauma symptoms in response to the preterm birth, and moderate social support were related to 6-month VBS scores.	synthetic_low
In contrast, for those from interdependent cultures, there was little to no difference between trauma survivors with and without PTSD in terms of slightly affected trauma-centred goals, self-defining memories, and self-cognitions.	synthetic_low
No extant literature has yet examined the perceptions of participants with mild psychiatric illness who are participating in exploratory randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the basic efficacy or effectiveness of novel trauma treatments.	synthetic_low

Further, institutional child sexual abuse is associated with moderate vicarious trauma at the individual, family, and community level, and with impacts to the spiritual wellbeing of victims/survivors of abuse that occurs in religious settings.	synthetic_low
The results failed to substantiate that increased dosage level resulted in more effective modification of mild trauma effects.	synthetic_low
Several psychological and biological models have been proposed which offer credible accounts of the processes by which mild trauma may slightly increase the risk of psychosis, including cognitive, psychodynamic, dissociation and attachment perspectives.	synthetic_low
Close attention is given to how custodial environments address prisoners' mild trauma and loss issues, and, more pointedly, to how the failure to bring such concerns safely to the fore has real implications for prisoner reintegration and public safety.	synthetic_low

Special attention is paid to the role of slight early trauma and resulting mild pathology of object relations for minor disturbances of symbolic play in childhood.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, a new body of research on mild psychophysiological reactivity promises to shed light on subtle gender differences in trauma response, resilience, and risk.	synthetic_low
In this clinical communication, the author discusses the tendency to revisit past trauma within the area of personal omnipotence provided in the transference, the anxiety of potential breakdown that may arise in the course of an analysis, and the cautious defensive organisation deployed by the patient in the interest of survival.	synthetic_low
Our results indicated that each temperament trait incrementally predicted mild trauma symptoms over and above the effects of IPV and other negative life events.	synthetic_low
To test the idea that dissociation fosters a slight positive response bias on trauma self-reports, participants completed a dissociation scale, and subsequently rated the perceived trauma of mildly uncomfortable ambiguous stimuli.	synthetic_low
Child and adolescent participants completed the draft instrument, the Child Report of Treatment Issue Resolution, as well as the mild Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children and the Children's Social Desirability Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
We retrospectively investigated long-term, multi-dimensional quality-of-life outcomes in 68 male patients who suffered pure head injuries and 63 male head-injured patients with associated minor multiple trauma.	synthetic_low
About half of the reports regarding perceived trauma severity characteristics were somewhat inconsistent between the baseline to 6-week assessment due to its relatively mild impact.	synthetic_low
The current study aimed to investigate the relationship and interactions between these two conditions, both minor stress responses arising from minimal secondary exposure to trauma.	synthetic_low
Early childhood trauma was not strongly predictive of a minor outcome.	synthetic_low
