Design: In this study, we characterized trait anxiety as a network system of interacting elements.	natural

For the 13 still waiting for results, levels of anxiety and distress were within normal ranges at all time-points.	natural
Although affective disorders (depression, anxiety) in humans are also characterized by persistent hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) activation, the predominant measure of HPAA activation in clinical studies is 24-h urinary cortisol.	natural
Findings showed that dyadic adjustment mediates the negative influence on parenting self-efficacy of both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.	natural

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Rosenberg Self Esteem Questionnaire (RSE), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2) and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were administered.	natural
Discriminant analyses revealed seven variables that accounted for 69 of the variance in cluster membership: anxiety, shortness of breath, nausea, length of survival from time of admission, having a diagnosis of colon cancer, having no religion, and living with a spouse.	natural

The aim of the study was to examine parenting self-efficacy in relation to depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.	natural
The Anxiety and Mood Modules from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) were employed to establish the diagnoses.	natural
Participants with primary DSM-IV diagnoses of social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/A), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) completed diagnosis specific symptom measures before attending group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specific to their diagnosis.	natural
Sixty-eight undergraduate participants viewed a distressing film and completed measures of trait anxiety, intelligence, depression, trait dissociation, as well as changes in state anxiety, then recorded intrusions over the following week.	natural
Clinical outcomes were measured concerning both the specific postmenopausal symptoms (using the Kupperman scale) and health or well-being dimensions (using subscales of the General Health Questionnaire and specific depression and anxiety scales).	natural
Analyses revealed that: there was no significant relationship between expectations and experiences; actual, but not expected, social difficulty was related to anxiety and depression; and realistic expectations as such (absolute differences between expectations and experiences) were unrelated to psychological adjustment; however, when experiences were more difficult than expected, larger discrepancies were associated with psychological distress.	natural
Ss were divided into high and low anxiety groups on the basis of the IPAT anxiety scores.	natural

The current study lightly contributes to the existing literature by investigating associations among examination knowledge in relation to caregiver and child anxiety at the time of a child sexual abuse-related medical examination, taking into account ethnicity, past child abuse, minor injury to child as a result of abuse, and caregiver's calm response to disclosure.	synthetic_low
This study cross-culturally evaluated Watson's (2005) simple structure of mild mood and anxiety disorders, using mainly dichotomous criteria, and explored the placement of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in this model.	synthetic_low

It is concluded that preparation for labor is a valid and desirable subject of inquiry for psychosomatic medicine, with particular relevance for researchers engaged in a study of the cognitive, behavioral, or psychophysiological manifestations of pain, mild anxiety, or stress.	synthetic_low
In this article, we lay the foundation of a basic learning model of mild anxiety and manageable stress in ingroup-outgroup interactions.	synthetic_low
As predicted, rather than exerting a uniformly adverse effect, experimentally enhanced self-focus interacted with a lower level of test anxiety, slightly improving performances among low-anxious subjects and only mildly impairing them among the test-anxious.	synthetic_low
Among CAD patients, men scored significantly higher than women on Type A behavior and its factors, as well as on mild anxiety and slight depression.	synthetic_low
This study examined subtle time trends in, and identified minor predictors of, anxiety and mild specific worries over 12 months.	synthetic_low

Outcome measures of mild test anxiety, rational beliefs, and thoughts 1 hour before a final exam each showed treatment effects.	synthetic_low
This study tested the hypothesis that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show an inductive reasoning style distinct from people with mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and from participants in a non-anxious (NA) control group.	synthetic_low
Questionnaires were used to document mild anxiety, mild depression, more general negative and positive mood status, and patients' general appraisal of stressors in 30 post-myocardial infarct patients.	synthetic_low
Fathers were mildly screened for slight depressed mood (Hospital anxiety and moderate depression scale, and Edinburgh postnatal mild depression scale), and at 6 months, stable parental mood, easy-going infant temperament, couple relationship quality, moderate alcohol use, typical life events, relaxed parenting, and normal demographics were recorded.	synthetic_low
As hypothesized, the treatment group showed a slight increase in post-test anxiety as compared to pretest responses; level of expressed anxiety in the control group pre- and post-test did not change significantly.	synthetic_low
Finally, slight differences in self-efficacy scores between anxiety groups were maintained when the number of negative thoughts was controlled for, but differences in negative thinking between anxiety levels were not maintained when self-efficacy was controlled for.	synthetic_low
To evaluate the psychological and psychosocial functioning of couples undergoing their first pregnancy, 327 couples from Melbourne, Victoria completed simple measures of depression, anger, mild anxiety, positive and negative affect, current social support, perceived quality of couple's relationship, and recalled childhood family relationships during the early third trimester of pregnancy.	synthetic_low
High-anxious subjects performed more poorly; felt somewhat less positive about themselves, their abilities, and the task; experienced some anxiety and felt it slightly interfered with performance; estimated spending less time on task; and rated themselves engaging in mild worry, emotionality, and task-generated interference than did low-anxious subjects.	synthetic_low
Conversely, subjects who amplify their disturbance (sensitisers) were expected to have a low defensiveness score and moderate trait anxiety.	synthetic_low
Mild anxiety and reduced social dysfunction symptoms were reported after a win compared to after a loss.	synthetic_low
