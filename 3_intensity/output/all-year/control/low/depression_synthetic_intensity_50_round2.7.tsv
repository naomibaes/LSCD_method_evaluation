Models including both depression and anxiety showed that depression was independently associated with time to first cardiac-related hospitalization, cumulative number and length of cardiac-related hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality, while anxiety was only associated with the total length of hospitalizations (all p-values <.05).	natural
This paper focuses on one particularly problematic area: the explanation of women's greater tendency to depression.	natural
Higher impulsivity was associated with less education, lower income, being unemployed, psychiatric diagnosis, and higher Beck depression scores.	natural
Also in agreement with Brown, severe life events and difficulties were associated with depression.	natural
This study examines clinical predictors of symptom deterioration (relapse/recurrence) at the completion of a clinical intervention trial of depressed, low-income, predominantly Hispanic diabetes patients who were randomized to socio-culturally adapted collaborative depression treatment or usual care and who no longer met clinically significant depression criteria at 12 months post-trial baseline.	natural
These factors are grouped into three broad categories: health-related factors (physical ill health, disability, and dementia and cognitive impairment); social factors (living in a nursing home, social support, bereavement, caring for a disabled person); and personal vulnerability factors (level of depressive symptoms at previous time points, history of depression, personality).	natural
It is possible that, through depression narratives, voices that are used to expressing sadness become more visible to oneself through the healing pen.	natural
This pilot study investigates the association of depression and survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.	natural
we found an interaction between CRHR1 SNPs and maternal depression, with the homozygous minor genotype acting as a protective factor against brooding in the presence of maternal depression.	natural
These dimensions are examined as they relate to the clinical literature and empirical research on depression.	natural
Patients in LETS ACT had significantly higher rates of substance abuse treatment retention and significantly greater increases in activation on the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) compared to those in SC.	natural
Depression in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is highly prevalent and related to worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy, but is amenable to change via CBT.	natural
Measures included: DSMIIIR psychiatric diagnosis; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Hamilton Mild Depression Scale; Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; Profile of Mood States; Memorial Pain Assessment Card; MiniMental State Examination; and Karnofsky Performance Status Score.	synthetic_low
Social support was moderately correlated with mild suicidal ideation (r = -.38), but social support did not contribute to the variation in lower-level suicidal ideation scores beyond the joint contribution of scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and scores on the Hopelessness Scale.	synthetic_low
According to a 'psychosomatic view of the brain', critical life events can both slightly affect brain neurotransmitters and contribute to mild psychological and somatic symptoms of depression.	synthetic_low
The clinical validity, responsiveness and unidimensionality of the PDAS and its subscales were confirmed in an independent sample of patients with mild psychotic depression.	synthetic_low
Statistical results demonstrated significant improvements in cardiovascular conditioning for the running treatment group, and slight decrements in mild depression for the running treatment group compared to the waiting list controls.	synthetic_low
Recent military demands did not moderate associations between adolescent support and mild depression symptoms.	synthetic_low
Evidence indicates that mild depression is linked to the development and worsening of diabetes, but the mechanisms underlying this link are not well understood.	synthetic_low
The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to assess ASR, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess mild PDS.	synthetic_low
Memory and metamemory functioning were studied among 30 adult patients suffering from mild depression.	synthetic_low
Interestingly, the removal of the somatic items did not enhance the effectiveness of the CES-D. The mild discriminatory ability of somatic items with the overall assessment of depression is discussed.	synthetic_low
The author notes that childhood depression has become an accepted diagnostic entity, a milder affective disorder related to unipolar and bipolar illnesses.	synthetic_low
Baseline depression score, trusting relationship with caregivers, perceived public stigma against children affected by HIV, and optimistic future expectation at baseline positively predicted the 1-year follow-up mild depression, while children self-report health status, self-esteem, and perceived social support negatively predicted depression at 1-year follow-up survey.	synthetic_low
Mexican and Puerto Rican children experienced slightly higher levels of mild depression compared to children from other Latino origins.	synthetic_low
For the youngest of the two older age groups, there is also a slight positive association between minor flood exposure and mild post-flood depression, controlling for prior levels of depression.	synthetic_low
Given that mild depression is associated with slight impairments in effortful processing, we predicted that over repeated trials this manageable depression would be associated with slightly increased OGM.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, we related the diagnostic results of widely used screening instruments for mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory-2; BDI-2; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) with clinical diagnoses, to receive optimal sensitivity and specificity values.	synthetic_low
To compare the slight predeath and postdeath levels of mild depression and anxiety reported by a sample of children who lost a parent to cancer (study children) with the manageable levels reported by children in a community sample who did not experience such a loss.	synthetic_low
Clinical correlates of mild depression in people with GTS appear to be: moderate tic severity and shorter duration, the occasional presence of echophenomena and coprophenomena, mild premonitory sensations, slight sleep disturbances, mild obsessive-compulsive behaviors/OCD, minor self-injurious behaviors, occasional aggression, conduct disorder (CD) in childhood, and, possibly, mild ADHD.	synthetic_low
The results suggest that major depression may be divided into two qualitatively distinct classes, i.e. major depression with minor anxiety features and without any noticeable anxiety features.	synthetic_low
This pilot study examined the relationship between mild depression and several biopsychosocial factors among residents of aged care facilities.	synthetic_low
The relationship between mild depression and manageable obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as the straightforward order in which behavioral and pharmacological interventions are introduced, is discussed.	synthetic_low
Low-level MMPI Depression scales (D and D30), mild Social Desirability scales from Edwards (SD) and from Marlowe-Crowne (MC-SD) were administered to 61 alcoholic patients together with a set of general mood scales.	synthetic_low
Regression analysis determined that AR and AP do account for independent variance in STAIT trait anxiety scores even after statistically controlling for mild depression.	synthetic_low
Primary outcome measures were the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Social Support Survey and the Irritability, Mild Depression, and Anxiety (IDA) Scale, and the modest association between them was investigated using straightforward multivariate logistic regression.	synthetic_low
Comorbid anxiety and mild depression was the most common presenting problem in both systems, but overall rates were slightly higher in VHA clinics, and patients were somewhat more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for mental_health conditions.	synthetic_low
