The results suggest that it is the challenges of the medical curriculum that may play a small role in the increased prevalence of mild depression and anxiety for students during their medical education.	synthetic_low
Given high comorbidity between GAD and other emotional disorders, we also investigated the usefulness of the PSWQ in selecting non-cases of GAD that were generally free of PTSD, social phobia, or mild depression versus non-cases of GAD that met criteria for one of these conditions.	synthetic_low
In a population-based sample of 8068 adult twins, Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict onsets of mild depression from reported prior GAD and last-year SLEs rated on long-term contextual threat.	synthetic_low
Cronbach's was examined for total score (.91) and significant positive correlations of the total score with mild anxiety (HADS: r=.70) and mild depression (CES-D: r=.60, BDI-II: r=.59), and a significant negative correlation with slightly lower quality of life (r=-.66) could be demonstrated.	synthetic_low
Partial correlations revealed that negative, but not positive, self-statement scores were somewhat related to self-report measures of mild anxiety and low-level depression.	synthetic_low
Furthermore, our results indicate that women with a history of mild depression have a slightly higher 2-fold risk of developing mMD in the perinatal period.	synthetic_low
Mild depression, slight anxiety and other secondary responses were also improved, especially with basic CBT interventions.	synthetic_low
Patients with slightly larger pre-treatment LPPs to mildly aversive relative to neutral distracters (when targets were mildly aversive) were more likely to respond to CBT, and demonstrated moderate reductions in mild symptoms of depression and anxiety following treatment.	synthetic_low
The following psychometric instruments were also used: the CFS Symptom Inventory, the SF-36, the Mild Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory.	synthetic_low
This study provides preliminary evidence that abbreviated behavioral treatment has beneficial effects on occasional insomnia and mild depression in long-term psychiatric outpatients.	synthetic_low
Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the interaction of moderately socially-prescribed perfectionism and slightly lower perceived self-control accounted for unique variance in mild depression scores.	synthetic_low
A matched retrospective case control study of 127 patients with mild depression requiring standard inpatient care who passed away by suicide either as inpatients or within the 12 months following hospital discharge.	synthetic_low
Available evidence is consistent with three causal pathways: mild depression to minor inflammation, mild inflammation to everyday depression, and bidirectional relationships.	synthetic_low
We report a comparison of mild depressive phenomenology and attributional style between a group of CFS subjects seen in a specialized medical setting, which included a moderate proportion with depression diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), and mildly depressed controls seen in a specialized psychiatric setting.	synthetic_low
The effectiveness of the new 5-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was assessed using archival data from 143 (71 women) discharged mildly depressed psychiatric patients and 167 (51 women) slightly demented individuals in the initial stages of dementia of the Alzheimer type.	synthetic_low
Predictions that mildly anxious and somewhat nonanxious depression would slightly differ in perceptual asymmetry (PA), as well as in a subtle sensitivity for perceiving emotional words, were evaluated using straightforward dichotic listening tasks.	synthetic_low
Somatization is not, however, associated with higher levels of medical health care utilization than that found among patients with mild depression or occasional anxiety.	synthetic_low
This study aimed to identify factors associated with preterm birth and assess mild postnatal depression and anxiety symptoms in mothers of preterm infants (n = 75) compared to mothers who delivered at term (n = 125) in a Greek sample.	synthetic_low
All patients who got a diagnosis of mild bipolar affective disorder, current episode of slight depression, or a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder, current episode of low-level depression, in a period from 1994 to 2002 at the first outpatient treatment or at the first discharge from psychiatric hospitalization in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register.	synthetic_low
We applied measures of implicit (name-letter test) and explicit (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) self-esteem in patients with a manageable early onset depression (N = 17), a mild late onset (N = 13), and a typically episodic depression (N = 29).	synthetic_low

Research on the symptomatology of mild endogenous depression did not include the concept; anhedonia was also missing from the central instruments of psychiatric research, the standard depression rating scales. Attention was gently drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by Klein in the 1970s.	synthetic_low
