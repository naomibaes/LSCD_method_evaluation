We compared patterns of change across time in judgment biases and use of emotion regulation strategies during therapy among patients who were ultimately classified as responders (n = 15) and nonresponders (n = 10), and analyzed the extent to which early changes during treatment across these variables accounted for overall symptom improvement in social anxiety symptoms.	natural

Cases were available from a component study of CBT for generalized anxiety disorder (T. D. Borkovec, M. G. Newman, A. L. Pincus, & R. Lytle, 2002) and were selected to form good and poor outcome groups maintained through a 1-year follow-up.	natural
Controlling for pre-treatment severity, pre-treatment SSRI use was associated with worse outcomes for AG (p=.04) and anxiety sensitivity (p=.047); post-treatment SSRI use was associated with delayed improvements in PD severity (p=.05).	natural
The pure anxiety group was merely dissociable from controls with regard to internalizing symptoms and family adversity.	natural

Plasma cortisol, cephalic electromyography (EMG), heart rate, fingertip vasoconstriction/dilation, respiration rate, self-reported anxiety, and target symptom severity were monitored in 24 human outpatients who volunteered to undergo the novel experience of an eight-session EMG biofeedback-based relaxation training program.	natural
