Individuals with insomnia reported more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression than individuals without insomnia.	natural
While it is recognised that patients with multiple sclerosis have a high lifetime risk for major depression, less is known about sub-syndromal presentations of affective instability, i.e., irritability, sadness and tearfulness and how these symptoms of emotional dyscontrol may affect a subject's overall degree of psychological distress.	natural

In this study, the effect of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), on oscillatory dynamics accompanying retrieval of emotionally positive and negative autobiographical memories was investigated in a nonclinical sample using electroencephalographic event-related spectral power and connectivity measures.	natural
Limitations and recommendations for the integrated depression care management are discussed.	natural
Two dimensions of parental outcomes were stress and depression levels, which were assessed on a pretest and posttest basis using the Questionnaire on Resources and StressF (QRSF) and the Beck Depression Inventory).	natural
The ADI Depression scale (Dep) was compared to three other measures used to assess depression: Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).	natural
Our results suggest new cognitive interventions to improve the self-relevance of positive memories in depression.	natural
Multilevel autoregressive growth modeling suggested that controlling for past depressive symptoms, past intrinsic religiosity, and religious practice jointly predicted future depression.	natural
In contrast, depression is often precipitated by more social context-related stressors.	natural
Body mass index (BMI), eating disorder (ED) symptoms [Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2)], general psychopathology and depression were assessed in 238 patients at admission and discharge.	natural
Thus, we tested whether physical activity reduces risk for future escalations in depression and whether depression decreases likelihood of future change in physical activity.	natural
Among the female caretakers who experienced episodes of homelessness over the course of the study, the majority had been homeless at least once prior to the start of the study and approximately one-fifth met criteria for lifetime alcohol dependence, drug abuse, or major depression.	natural
As an aggregated measure, financial constraints were positively associated with depression in mid-age and late life, and this relationship was partially accounted for by the pathway of perceived control over ones financial circumstances.	natural
Given the harsh environment in which a large number of young urban Black men live, the high prevalence of substance abuse might be an attempt to fight off depression.	natural
For this, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale, and Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) were administered to 45 ESRD outpatients undergoing HD treatment.	natural
Accordingly, this study aimed to identify the pathways of influence between symptoms of depression, positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. hallucinations and delusions), and suicidal ideation.	natural
Students who were given information about the validity scales or about the symptoms of depression were more successful at malingering than students who received no information, indicating that malingerers of depression may be able to elude detection by the MMPI-2 if they are informed about the validity scales or the symptoms of depression.	natural
The 8-item Scale for Atypical Symptoms (SAS) and its structured interview, the SIGH-SAD, have been developed to assess subtle atypical symptoms of mild depression in simple winter depression.	synthetic_low
Adding reciprocal effects between alliance and mild depression scores did not adversely affect model fit, suggesting that moderate reciprocal effects may exist.	synthetic_low
Accordingly, mild pharmacological interventions targeting the NE system can result in gentle anxiolytic, rather than anxiogenic, outcomes when used to treat patients with moderate anxiety and depression.	synthetic_low
The results point to the usefulness of the DAS as a potential screening device for low self-esteem and mild depression in adolescent girls who have diabetes.	synthetic_low
Attempts have been made to develop self-rating scales to assess mild depression in children.	synthetic_low
In 25 of the animals there was complete abolition of H-response, 35 minutes after intravenous administration of 1 ml/kg body weight of ethanol blood alcohol concentration (BAC), 160 mg whereas in others there was slight depression.	synthetic_low
Systematic review of the epidemiological data, minor risk factors and subtle relationship between depression and glycaemic control among the Indian studies.	synthetic_low
Participants completed a visual analogue scale of mild abdominal pain, SCL-90 and Hamilton rating scale of low-level depression; discomfort threshold to rectal distension was determined using a double random staircase protocol.	synthetic_low
However, results suggest that maternal behavior moderates the relation between mild maternal depression (diagnosis, recency, and symptoms) and slight helplessness.	synthetic_low
Mild depression is also a suspected side effect of therapy with IFN-beta and IFN-gamma; however, the association has not been strongly confirmed.	synthetic_low
The underlying pathology of CHD, coronary artery atherosclerosis (CAA), is present decades before CHD, and the subtle temporal relationship between depression and CAA is somewhat unclear.	synthetic_low
The purpose of the current study was to examine the tripartite model of mild depression and slight anxiety in a community-based sample of 278 African American adolescents (M age = 12.89) from low-income communities and to identify minor stressors and simple coping strategies that were associated with the specific features of each disorder.	synthetic_low
Maternal characteristics of mild depression, lower stress level, and attitudes towards positive guidance were explored as possible moderators.	synthetic_low
African-Americans were slightly more likely than White and Latino Ike survivors to acknowledge post-disaster PTSD and mild depression, and the acknowledgment of depression was predicted by moderate property damage severity.	synthetic_low
The dexamethasone suppression test (DST), family history, response to antidepressant medication and short-term course were investigated in 16 female patients with mild depression.	synthetic_low
These results suggest that decreased availability of the brainstem and basal ganglia SERT represents a subtle biomarker of mild depression and thus confirm and extend the role of slight dysregulation of brain serotonergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of low-level depression and suicide.	synthetic_low
When considered simultaneously, EAC, but not passive coping, was related to mild affective pain, and both EAC and passive coping were minor correlates of mild depression, although in opposite directions.	synthetic_low
Attributing negative events to aspects of the self significantly predicted a more gradual CD4 decline over 18 months following the interview, controlling for potential psychological, behavioral, social, and health mediators such as mild depression and regular health behavior.	synthetic_low
We used a fully controlled experimental design to test the effects of both induced and trait rumination and distraction on attention in patients with mild depression and healthy controls.	synthetic_low
When compared with a group of 20 controls matched on these differentiating features, the 20 children with hallucinations had more minor precipitants of illness, a slightly shorter duration of the disorder, mild symptoms of depression, and a family history of subtle mood changes.	synthetic_low
Mild reward insensitivity in depression and slight dysphoria has been demonstrated by self-report, behavioral, and basic neuroscience data.	synthetic_low
Although basic cognitive theories of depression have postulated slightly enhanced processing of negatively valenced information, previous EEG studies have shown both marginally increased and mildly reduced sensitivity for negative performance feedback in mild MDD.	synthetic_low
Predictor variable measures included the Functional Independence Measure, Family Satisfaction Scale and single items assessing the presence of minor pain and mild depression.	synthetic_low
This sensitivity is essential for the comprehension of the influence of a psychiatric illness of the mother on child development. Postpartal depression, as a common psychiatric illness in young mothers, plays a part.	synthetic_low
This study tested predictions based on the emotion context insensitivity (ECI) hypothesis of Rottenberg, Gross, and Gotlib (2005) that a nonclinical sample of people with mild depressive symptoms would show somewhat reduced responses to both positive and negative stimuli relative to people without minor depression and would show a slightly enhanced response to novelty.	synthetic_low
