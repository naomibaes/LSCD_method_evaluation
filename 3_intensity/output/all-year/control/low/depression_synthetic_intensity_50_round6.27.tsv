A total of 435 Chinese adolescents who experienced a tornado in Yancheng city reported their low level of depressive symptoms (The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children; CES-DC), minor posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory; PTGI), and some dispositional mindfulness (Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale; MAAS).	synthetic_low

Far from being autonomous of stress, individuals with moderate melancholic depression may be somewhat sensitive to stress, such that their episodes are influenced by somewhat minor stressors compared to those of individuals with non-melancholic depression.	synthetic_low
Among those with 2+ LMIs, the adjusted odds of cessation for those with a mild depression diagnosis were 0.34 (p = .007) compared to those whose multiple LMIs did not include mild depression.	synthetic_low
