We found that those with childhood trauma had a higher overall sAA response to the TSST, as seen in a repeated measures ANOVA (CTQ by time interaction: F(1.8,71.5) = 6.46, p = .01) and an independent samples t-test indicating higher sAA baseline to peak response (t = 3.22, p = .003).	natural
These findings further suggest heterogeneity of stress responses within individuals with PTSD and with trauma exposure.	natural
We are unable to differentiate if the sensitization process is a consequence of the nature of the trauma endured by FHC (long-standing exposure to extreme external events) or a consequence of the fact that this first trauma occurred during childhood.	natural
When repeated trauma occurs in early childhood, the dissociative response may become the first line of defense for the person to rely upon.	natural

Adult attachment partially mediated the relationship between past interpersonal trauma and depression severity at day 14 among psychiatric inpatients.	natural
We examined the impact of violence exposure, trauma symptoms, and interpersonal support on parenting competence among 291 mothers with substance dependence, using ordinary least squares regression and path analysis.	natural
Further work is required to investigate predictors of benefit finding and adversarial growth in patients with conditions that hold the possibility of being recurrent forms of trauma.	natural
However, these results do not exhaust the validation process of the TRauma, and it is necessary to continue to seek empirical evidence.	natural
Direct experience of trauma, on the other hand, affects perceived risk in relation to both self and other.	natural
This study explored the dual phenomenon of experiencing a peer support residential trauma program from the perspective of (a) a client, and (b) a facilitator.	natural
It was approximately 7 months after his trauma that the patient began exhibiting striking palilalia behavior along with echolalia and a global deterioration of mental activities.	natural
Relationships between trauma variables, complex post-traumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD), affect dysregulation, dissociation, somatization, and alexithymia were studied in 70 women with early-onset sexual abuse treated in community-based private (n = 25) or clinic outpatient settings (n = 45).	natural
Some survivors of trauma report experiencing beneficial changes in self-perception, relationships, and philosophy of life, and positive changes in the realm of existential, spiritual, or religious matters.	natural
The patients were divided into two groups: unilateral stepwise standard large trauma craniectomy (S-SLTC) combined with EVD catheter implants (n = 86) and unilateral routine frontal temporal parietal SLTC (control group, n = 86).	natural
Here, we aim to describe the minor nature and limited extent of PTSD and mild trauma exposure and to clarify the straightforward relationships among comorbidity and psychosocial factors in juvenile female offenders.	synthetic_low
Numerous studies over the past decade have pointed to the occasional occurrence of mild trauma and limited neglect in the childhood experience of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).	synthetic_low
This study examined the association between witnessing mild trauma and multiple outcomes including slight mood changes, occasional anxiety, and minimal substance use disorders.	synthetic_low
Stepwise logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and characteristics of the mild trauma showed that posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, agoraphobia, and low self-esteem were slightly more common in the incest-rape group compared to the nonincest-rape group.	synthetic_low
Thus, we examined the psychometric properties of a new, less intense childhood trauma measure, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).	synthetic_low
A hierarchical regression analysis showed that when controlling for generic life stress, perceptions of discrimination contributed an additional 10 of variance in mild trauma-related symptoms for Black students, and racial climate contributed an additional 7 of variance in minor trauma symptoms for Asian students.	synthetic_low
This article describes implementation experiences scaling up the Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS) - an intervention developed using a straightforward community partnered research framework.	synthetic_low
Collectively, these results highlight the positive impact that a parent-led, therapist-assisted treatment could have in terms of providing caregivers with more tools to help their child after mild trauma and reduce barriers to treatment.	synthetic_low
Inpatients (N = 80) admitted to a hospital basic trauma treatment program were administered the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, AAI, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and Dissociative Disorder Interview Schedule.	synthetic_low
The crime and subsequent response—from within the community as well as across the world—left the entire town dealing with a mild collective trauma.	synthetic_low
He had experienced the trauma of a serious illness requiring medical interventions at the age of 5 months and again at 18 months, which may have been a contributing factor for his mild disturbance.	synthetic_low
The mechanisms that contribute to comorbid depression, however, are unclear, and prospective studies are necessary to delineate the roles that mild psychological abuse, moderate PTSD severity and minor prior trauma experiences may have in the development of depression following IPV.	synthetic_low
A history of minor childhood abuse was obtained using the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.	synthetic_low
The results further support the predictive value of alexithymia for adult dissociation above and beyond the effects of mild childhood trauma, PTSD, and GSI scores.	synthetic_low
As a self-report PTSD assessment device, the LASC has potential for use with various mild trauma groups.	synthetic_low
Despite these acknowledgements, however, there is a dearth of literature on the minor countertransference experiences of therapists engaged in mild trauma work.	synthetic_low
Lenore Terr (1991) proposed a framework for childhood trauma that distinguishes between simple single-incident trauma (Type I) and occasional repeated or prolonged trauma (Type II).	synthetic_low
Study results aligned with existing research on the dose-response, cumulative effect of frequent exposure to mild trauma.	synthetic_low
These findings suggest minor-event trauma type is related to some subtle differences in PTSD presentation.	synthetic_low
A developmental psychopathology framework, with its emphasis on an interdisciplinary perspective, the interplay between work conducted with normal and atypical populations, and its focus on investigating functioning in multiple domains of development concurrently, possesses significant potential for advancing work on memory and mild trauma.	synthetic_low
Rape trauma syndrome meets the requirements for admissibility when it is used for the appropriate purpose and with adequate safeguards to prevent any slight prejudice.	synthetic_low

Further, we have found scant literature on the use of video therapy in the treatment of adult survivors of minor sexual trauma.	synthetic_low
A cognitive-contextual approach is described in which the prime focus is upon teaching the client how to interact adaptively with the memory of the mild trauma by: a) facilitating a switch from a primarily perceptual to a more conceptual level of processing the trauma itself; and b) placing the trauma in the context of past life experiences and determining its limited relevance for the future.	synthetic_low
