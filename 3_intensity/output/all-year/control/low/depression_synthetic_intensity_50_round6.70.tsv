After an introduction to G proteins and second messenger pathways, this review focuses on the evidence implicating G proteins and two second messenger systems-the adenylate cyclase (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP) and phosphoinositide (protein kinase C, PKC) intracellular signaling cascades-in the pathophysiology and treatment of bipolar disorder and unipolar depression.	natural
Improvements in physical fitness were accompanied by improvements on two mood measures, anxiety and mild depression.	synthetic_low
However, the moderate level of a response seems a good criterium to give the evolution prognostic of the mild depression state: the more G.H. response is high, the more the depression is easily curable.	synthetic_low
