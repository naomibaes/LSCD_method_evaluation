In contrast to previously published studies of anxious children, in this study there were no differences in attentional biases in children with ASD meeting clinical cutoff for anxiety and those who did not.	natural
The measure consists of three correlated subscales: Social Pressure, Social Anxiety, and Opportunity.	natural
This progress, in combination with findings from a growing body of large, methodologically sound epidemiological studies, provides substantial evidence that negative emotions and cognitions, including hostility and related constructs, and sub-facets of negative affectivity (e.g., depression, anxiety) contribute to the initiation and progression of CHD.	natural
Trained lay interviewers using ICD-10 computer-assisted interviews identified household residents with anxiety disorders.	natural

A separate study of 158 undergraduates also assessed how MSR and vulnerable narcissism predicted state and trait anxiety and anger after receiving positive or negative feedback, and the extent to which negative feedback interacted with MSR and vulnerable narcissism.	natural

As expected, mild negative parental experiences (e.g., some anxiety about child's condition, mild uncertainty about their future) were directly related to OCD symptom severity and impairment, as well as child internalizing and externalizing problems, family accommodation of symptoms, and caregiver strain.	synthetic_low

Children in the mild anxiety disorder group displayed slightly impaired motor skills and somewhat poor self-perceived peer acceptance and physical competence compared with the control group.	synthetic_low
Although high-anxious subjects did not differ from controls in their average responses to the negative film stimuli, there is a subtle tendency of a greater coherence of emotional response components in mild generalized anxiety subjects.	synthetic_low
The relationship between religiosity and mild trait anxiety was no longer significant after controlling for social support (p = .26).	synthetic_low
The current study examined the extent to which IU slightly changes over the course of 12 sessions of group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for GAD where the direct focus on IU is limited to one session; whether a small amount of change in IU predicts changes over the treatment period in worry, anxiety, stress, and depression; whether change in IU predicts change in worry domains above and beyond minimal change in worry severity and vice versa; and whether IU mediates symptom improvement.	synthetic_low
That is, mild anxiety phenomena were more prevalent among those children who passed a Piagetian conservation task.	synthetic_low
Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is an extension of traditional exposure therapy and has been used to treat a variety of mild anxiety disorders.	synthetic_low
The first section of the manuscript highlights the significant role of moderate threat responses—mediated by circuits connecting the frontal cortex, amygdala, and midbrain—in anxiety, and reviews data indicating that genotypic variation in the serotonin system is associated with mild hyperactivity in this circuitry, which slightly elevates the risk for anxiety and mood disorders.	synthetic_low
On the same occasions, pregnant females completed the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and were divided into slightly high and low anxiety responders, as defined by minor changes in the STAI.	synthetic_low
Correlations between factor-regression scores on the CPRS components and scores on the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire dimensions were briefly analyzed.	synthetic_low
