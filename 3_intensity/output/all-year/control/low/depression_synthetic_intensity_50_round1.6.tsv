Consistent with these ideas, a pilot study of romantic relationships, an observational study of newlyweds, and a diary study of married couples demonstrated that minor partner depression subtly moderates the association between confrontational partner-regulation behaviors and partners' motivation, such that confrontational behaviors were associated with slightly greater motivation to resolve problems among partners who were experiencing relatively few depressive symptoms, but marginally less motivation among partners who were experiencing relatively more mild depressive symptoms.	synthetic_low
